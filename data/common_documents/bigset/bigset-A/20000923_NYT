`EDWARD II': A GRAPHIC PRODUCTION FROM BIRMINGHAM ROYAL BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not often that publicity announcements warn that
a ballet is not family entertainment. Yet some of those heralding
David Bintley's ``Edward II'' did note that this production
``presents graphic sexual images and is not appropriate for
children.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Birmingham Royal Ballet made its New York debut with
the two-act work at the City Center on Thursday night, one learned
the reason for such a warning. ``Edward II'' is filled with sex and
violence. Yet to anyone who might accuse the British company of
mere sensationalism, Bintley, its director, might point out that
his sources are medieval history and classic drama. And although
his choreography is sometimes disconcertingly uneven, ``Edward II''
is a serious effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bintley has been inspired by historical accounts of the reign of
this monarch, who died in 1327, and by ``Edward II,'' Christopher
Marlowe's still-enthralling play of 1592. Both in real life and in
Marlowe's tragedy, Edward, though married and a father, displayed
an inordinate passion for his friend Piers Gaveston. Isabella,
Edward's queen, and the English barons grew dismayed by Edward's
behavior. A civil war erupted. Gaveston was executed. So,
eventually, was Edward, after suffering gruesome sodomistic
tortures.
</P>
<P>
   Bintley does not underplay the unsavory incidents. Yet he
provides them with dramatic point. ``Edward II'' never resembles a
kinky porn show.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a sign of how venturesome the Birmingham Royal Ballet
can be. Since the '40s, the Royal Ballet in London has often had a
second company of some kind. Often it served as a training ground
for young dancers. At other times it was a touring group. Earlier
incarnations of the organization occasionally visited America.
</P>
<P>
   When it moved to the British city of Birmingham in 1990, the
second company became totally independent of London's Royal Ballet.
It has developed its own repertory, featuring provocative new works
like ``Edward II'' as well as revivals of such major 20th-century
ballets as Leonide Massine's ``Choreartium'' and Ninette de Valois'
``Job,'' which thrilled me when I saw them in England a few years
ago and which would surely thrill New York audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham dancers made an impressive debut, for all are
blessed with a strong sense of conviction. Bintley set ``Edward
II'' to a commissioned score by John McCabe, which, as played by
the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Paul Murphy, helped
emphasize the story's dramatic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Bintley was most inventive in scenes for the leading characters.
Robert Parker's Gaveston was a bounding scamp. The obviously
infatuated Edward of Wolfgang Stollwitzer could not keep his eyes
or hands off him. No wonder Monica Zamora, as an innocent-seeming
Queen Isabella, was so bewildered by these men.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first act came a potentially overwrought yet
mesmerizing incident when, after Gaveston's execution, Stollwitzer
clutched a bag supposedly containing Gaveston's severed head while
a distraught Zamora tried to cling to him. Here was a truly macabre
romantic triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, throughout the ballet, group sequences were weak.
Although Joseph Cipolla, a former member of Dance Theater of
Harlem, was a believably surly Mortimer, most of the other barons
were spoilsports who just kept marching monotonously. And, to make
``Edward II'' last an entire evening, Bintley has padded his
two-and-a-half-hour production with extraneous choreography,
including appearances by fairground entertainers presenting a show
that serves as a heavy-handedly allegorical counterpart to what is
basically a realistic plot.
</P>
<P>
   The second act has several dull stretches, especially an
interminable court ball. And some of the battle scenes involve
little more than running around on a smoky stage. The designs for
the second act are also odd. Peter J. Davison's sets for both acts
make ingenious use of shifting walls and curtains. But whereas
Jasper Conran's costumes for the first act are essentially
medieval, some of those for the second inexplicably suggest the
early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weak ensemble sequences, Bintley again
choreographically enlivens his leading characters in the second
act. Jonathan Payn was charming as Hugh Despenser, Edward's new
male favorite. As hostile forces trap Edward, Stollwitzer's monarch
grew horrifyingly demented, and when he bent to ask for mercy his
cringing was pitiable.
</P>
<P>
   With his studded wristband and codpiece, Toby Norman-Wright, as
Lightborn, the executioner, appeared to be en route to a leather
club. But this fellow was genuinely sinister. The torture scene was
horrifying without being unduly protracted. Even more effective was
the moment when Norman-Wright cradled the king in his arms like an
ominously gentle angel of death.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting character development was that of Zamora.
Her frail and naive Isabella of the first act submitted to
Mortimer's wiles. But, gradually, as the ballet proceeded, she
found strength to stand proudly as a stern warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughtful interpretations made one curious to see these
dancers in a variety of roles. And, later in the engagement, which
runs through Oct. 1, there will be a program called ``Jazz
Triple,'' featuring three one-act jazz ballets.

SHARING THE WEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The first thing Mike Bottom noticed about
Anthony Ervin's swimming when he started coaching him at California
was not how much water he displaced with every armstroke, it was
not his whippet kick. It was his start.
</P>
<P>
   It was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the worst start of anybody I had ever coached,'' Bottom
said, laughing at the memory. ``He worked so hard on getting that
start down.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show there was nothing wrong with Ervin's start
in the 50-meter freestyle Friday at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, a Hart High graduate, had the fastest reaction time in a
field that included history's greatest sprinter (Alex Popov), the
breakout star of these Games (Pieter van den Hoogenband) and
America's reigning sprint champion (Gary Hall Jr.).
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic annals will show Ervin's finish also was fabulous:
He ended up in a dead heat with Hall, his training partner this
summer in Phoenix, for the gold medal. It was the first time two
swimmers have stood shoulder to shoulder atop the victory podium at
the Olympics since Americans Carrie Steinseifer and Nancy Hogshead
tied for first in the 100 freestyle in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, whose father is three-quarters African-American, became
the first U.S. swimmer of African-American descent to win a gold
medal. He and Hall, whose career (and life) was derailed briefly by
diabetes, were timed in 21.98. Van den Hoogenband was third.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 25, doesn't mind if people peg him ``the diabetes dude.''
He is comfortable using his athletic forum to educate people about
the disease. Ervin, the more introverted of the two, would prefer
not to be pigeonholed.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about the historical and sociological
significance of his swim, Ervin said, ``I've always been proud of
my heritage. It's kind of cool. But I don't really think about it
in respect to being the first of this, the first of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to pin me down (on his ancestry) when it's
never been an issue for me. In America today I would think having
diverse blood would be no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Popov, who faded to sixth, was a major accomplishment.
The 28-year-old Russian was bidding to become the first male
swimmer to win back-to-back-to-back Olympic titles. His time of
22.24 was .60 seconds slower than the world record he set in June.
That's a veritable eternity in the sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Popov is old enough to be married and awaiting the
birth any day of his and wife Darya's second child. Ervin is young
enough to have a nickname (Tone Loc) that reflects his love of rap.
</P>
<P>
   It was another mesmerizing night of finals at the International
Aquatic Centre as Brooke Bennett of the U.S. swam the third-fastest
time in history in the 800 freestyle (8:19.67) to set an Olympic
record and successfully defend her Olympic title. And Sweden's Lars
Froelander touched out Australians Michael Klim and Geoff Huegill
in the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   But the 50 freestyle was the race that had the crowd of 17,500
abuzz. Suffice it to say Ervin and Hall, who won a bronze medal in
the 100 freestyle earlier in the week, rebounded nicely from last
Saturday's disappointment at being part of the first U.S. 400-meter
freestyle relay team to lose an Olympic final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' Ervin said. ``The 50 was my place to shine and
thankfully I did.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning breakthrough for someone who wasn't a familiar
racer on the national scene, much less internationally, a year ago.
Throughout high school, Ervin maintained a low national profile.
</P>
<P>
   He competed in only a handful of United States Swimming-
sanctioned meets, preferring instead to carve out a distinguished
high school career that culminated with two CIF titles in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Ervin traded in his swimsuit last summer for a suit
and worked the register in the clothing section of a department
store near his family's Valencia home. He resumed swimming when he
enrolled at Cal in the fall. He thrived in the competitive
environment and responded immediately to Bottom's cross-training
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Ervin won NCAA titles in the 50 and 100 freestyles and
was amazed.
</P>
<P>
   Then he finished fifth in the 100 freestyle and second in the 50
freestyle at the U.S. Olympic Trials in August and was astonished.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming an Olympic champion in swimming's glamour event at the
tender age of 19 _ the average age of the other seven finalists was
25.4 years _ left Ervin grasping for adjectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say when I started out this year I wasn't
expecting anything remotely close to what I've accomplished,''
Ervin said. ``I don't even know what to think. I don't think there
have been many people who have done so much in so little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall has been a fixture on the international scene since 1994.
But this Olympics has been as fresh for Hall as for Ervin. The
reason? It is the first Games in which Hall has competed as a
diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Olympian was diagnosed with the disease in March of
1999 and fell into such despair he contemplated suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He has struggled at times to maintain proper insulin levels. So
to get the individual gold medal here that eluded him in Atlanta
when he was perfectly healthy was especially gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   While Ervin and Hall were in the water celebrating, Ervin told
him, ``It couldn't have worked out any better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall replied, ``You're right about that.''

BELIEFS: UNDERLINING WHAT CHRISTIANITY AND JUDAISM SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there were a religious equivalent to low-level environmental
pollution, a major offender might be the well-meaning but
platitudinous statements by religious leaders about interfaith
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement ``Dabru Emet,'' published in The New York
Times on Sept. 10 as an advertisement, is not one of them. Its
Hebrew title comes from the biblical phrase ``Speak the truth to
one another.'' It is only 10 paragraphs, and every paragraph has
been carefully forged.
</P>
<P>
   The opening sentence speaks of ``a dramatic and unprecedented
shift in Jewish and Christian relations.'' In the decades since the
Holocaust, after nearly two millenniums of dismissing or
denigrating Judaism, church after church has publicly expressed
remorse and pledged to acknowledge in its preaching and teaching
``God's enduring covenant with the Jewish people'' and ``the
contribution of Judaism to world civilization and to Christian
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes merit a thoughtful Jewish response,'' the second
paragraph said. ``It is time for Jews to learn about the efforts of
Christians to honor Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed were eight brief statements about how Jews might
now view the relationship of Judaism and Christianity. The first
said that both faiths worship the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
and that ``through Christianity, hundreds of millions of people
have entered into relationship with the God of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Other paragraphs addressed Jewish and Christian concerns about
the authority of the Bible, the land of Israel, the moral
principles of Torah, and justice and peace.
</P>
<P>
   One paragraph advised that ``the humanly irreconcilable
difference between Jews and Christians will not be settled until
God redeems the entire world as promised in Scripture''; meanwhile,
Scripture-based polemics, political pressures or proselytizing will
be destructive and futile.
</P>
<P>
   The next paragraph claimed that an improved relationship between
Jews and Christians will not weaken Jewish practice, accelerate the
``religious assimilation that Jews rightly fear'' or encourage
intermarriage, conversion to Christianity or a false blending of
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial paragraph dealt with the Holocaust. ``Nazism was not a
Christian phenomenon,'' it stated, but it added that ``without the
long history of Christian anti-Judaism and Christian violence
against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have taken hold nor could it
have been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to,
Nazi atrocities against Jews,'' the paragraph continued. ``Other
Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities.
But Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   The paragraph also expressed gratitude for Christians who had
risked themselves to save Jews and for those who have struggled for
an unequivocal repudiation of any contempt for Jews and Judaism in
Christian teaching or practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dabru Emet'' was signed by more than 150 rabbis and Jewish
scholars. They came from all branches of Judaism _ Reform,
Conservative, Orthodox and Reconstructionist _ although they did
not claim to speak for anyone but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Four Jewish scholars of different viewpoints _ Dr. Tikva
Frymer-Kensky of the University of Chicago Divinity School, Dr.
David Novak of the University of Toronto, Dr. Peter W. Ochs of the
University of Virginia and Dr. Michael A. Signer of the University
of Notre Dame _ met for over a year (indeed, some conversations
went back five years) to hammer out the wording.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As evidence that the drafters were tangling with substantial
matters, one observer recalled ``hot and heavy arguments,'' and
people ``storming out of the room'' and then cheerfully getting
back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this Presbyterian, the crafting of this document was
nothing short of miraculous'' said the observer, the Rev.
Christopher Leighton, executive director of the Institute for
Christian and Jewish Studies in Baltimore, where the drafters met.
</P>
<P>
   As Novak recalled, ``It was a question not only of getting four
Jews to agree but four theologians as well.'' Many of the stumbling
points, of course, had less to do with differences between Jews and
Christians than differences among different strands of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence that the statement is substantial has also been
supplied by the criticism it has garnered. Rabbi A. James Rudin,
senior interreligious adviser of the American Jewish Committee,
complained that the paragraph on the Holocaust fell short in
emphasizing Christian responsibility and the need for churches to
continue re-examining their histories.
</P>
<P>
   The drafters surely knew that no single paragraph on the
Holocaust would be beyond criticism. (One Jewish historian who
signed the statement reportedly hesitated because he found the
language about the Holocaust and Nazism overstated in the other
direction.)
</P>
<P>
   The essential point, Novak said in a telephone conversation
Friday, was that Nazism was not an inevitable product of
Christianity. ``If you look upon Christians as potential Nazis by
the very fact of their Christianity, you cannot really have a
relationship,'' he said, unless you ask them to renounce their
faith.
</P>
<P>
   That this paragraph should be the focus of criticism was
inevitable and understandable.
</P>
<P>
   But that could obscure some other very substantial aspects of
the statement. For one thing, it implicitly criticized the Jewish
community for being uninformed about or indifferent to major
developments in Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   By underlining points of intersection between Judaism and
Christianity while affirming an ``irreconcilable difference,'' the
statement suggested that Jews would understand that difference only
as they plumbed their own tradition and not simply because they
rejected the other tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dabru Emet'' implicitly challenged Jews who, as Novak had
written, ``seem to think not being a Christian is all they need to
do to retain a Jewish identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement is one of several efforts to widen the
Jewish-Christian encounter from a focus on community protection to
one on theology. Its drafters were convinced that understanding
what the two faiths have in common and what differentiates them
would lead Jews to a renewed commitment to be fully Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have assumed that ``Dabru Emet'' was written in
response to Pope John Paul II's trip to Israel. A few have
suspected it of being released to ride on the coattails of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate. Not
so, in either case. The statement has been years in germination,
and it was released two weeks ago because of the approaching Jewish
holy days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're insisting that Jews speak theologically in public,''
Novak said. ``And if theology can't be discussed from pulpits,
where can it be?''

U.S. SWIM COACH QUICK TO APOLOGIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Richard Quick's drug rant didn't irritate
the Netherlands' Inge de Bruijn as much as his timing. The head
U.S. women's Olympic coach didn't bring up the issue of ``dirty''
swimmers until after de Bruijn had beaten Quick's club swimmers
Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres in the 100 freestyle and 100
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   So while Quick insisted he was pointing to no particular
swimmer, the insinuation seemed clear to de Bruijn. She called
Quick out Friday after leading all semifinalists (including Torres)
in the 50-meter freestyle with an astonishing world-record swim of
24.13 seconds. Her previous best was 24.48.
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn and Quick stood on the deck of the warmdown pool and
cleared the air for five minutes. DeBruijn said Quick apologized to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for him as a great coach to apologize like that,''
said de Bruijn, who broke eight world records in the five months
leading up to these Games. ``After I set all those world records,
(people) accused me of things. I didn't think that's fair. I think
I handled it well. It was not easy at all. I don't think (the
doping) question is fair to be asked of anyone.''

BRINGING PEOPLE DOWN TO EARTH WITH JUST A LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winning a Nobel Prize in Literature can be an albatross, making
it more difficult for a writer to create work after he has been
anointed by the Swedish Academy. Not so with Dario Fo, whose Nobel
in 1997 _ the first, as the playwright and comic actor says, for a
buffoon _ has increased his productivity and improved his standing
as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Since the award, he said, he has written five plays and staged
them all and has been encouraged to speak out on public as well as
theatrical issues. He has been deluged by requests to lecture at
universities.
</P>
<P>
   With a smile as jaunty as his straw hat, Fo arrived in New York
this week for the Woman of the World Festival of Performance at
Barnard College. Or rather, his wife and collaborator, Franca Rame,
was invited to the festival. He had planned to stay home in Milan,
Italy, writing, but at the last minute decided to join her. This is
quite a change from the period when, for political reasons, he was
denied a visa to come to United States. On Thursday the two
performed extracts from their work at the Minor Latham Playhouse at
Barnard, and on Friday they led a master class.
</P>
<P>
   This was his first trip to New York since 1986, when he
performed his signature play ``Mistero Buffo'' (``Comic Mystery''),
and it was his first visit to the United States since winning the
Nobel. In an interview at Barnard (with Ron Jenkins as
interpreter), he seemed sanguine about his expanding role. Now 74,
he has fully recovered from a stroke in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spoke with gravity about issues that concern him, he
retained his sense of equilibrium and his sense of fun.
Occasionally his wife clarified an answer. As he spoke he sipped an
espresso and frequently jabbed his finger into the air to punctuate
a point.
</P>
<P>
   As he learned several years ago, he is ``the most translated
living writer in the world.'' He was always famous. Now, he said,
he is more famous, and more people are paying attention to him. But
he made it clear that he had not altered his work; it remains
political, populist and, of course, comic. As he said, ``I have
just had the courage to go back to themes I left unfinished.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of Fo, everything is subject to ridicule wherever
he finds greed or hypocrisy: the larger the target the more
malicious the satire. With ``Accidental Death of an Anarchist,'' he
attacked police corruption; in ``We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!,'' he
staunchly defended beleaguered consumers, and in ``About Face,'' he
crosscut the effects of terrorism and capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Mistero Buffo,'' which he performs partly in double talk,
he mocks doublespeak in religion and politics. That show constantly
changes. Years ago the Vatican said that one version was the ``most
blasphemous show in the history of television.'' In these and
scores of other comedies he has been a perpetual gadfly and
renegade, fearless about assailing all those who he believes limit
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   For years he was persona non grata in the United States, and he
was twice denied visas. When he was finally allowed to visit in
1984, he saluted President Ronald Reagan as a fellow actor. This
was, he said, ``a gesture of a colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently he and his wife have been particularly outspoken
against genetic engineering and capital punishment, and he is
writing a play about noise and air pollution. He said, ``In Italy,
we've discovered that at least 10 people a day die of ailments
related to pollution.'' With the Nobel Prize money, the Fos have
also created a foundation to help the handicapped in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Because Fo is so distant in style and form from other Nobel
laureates _ as a clown and playwright who performs his own plays _
the award provoked shock waves. He greeted the outrage with his
customary nonchalance as if to say: ``Fo? Why not.'' He made it
clear, however, that he was honored to be in the company of Nobel
playwrights like Pirandello and Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never thought about rejecting the prize, as Jean-Paul
Sartre did. The adverse reaction to his elevation, what he called
``the scandal that erupted in Italy,'' bolstered his feeling that
the award was deserved. Some of the resentment, he said, could be
categorized as envy: ``There were many writers who had been waiting
in line for years to get the prize, and they were in crisis. Some
scholars even insulted the King of Sweden. But the open-minded,
progressive, liberal people were very happy.'' His candidate for a
future Nobel is Stefano Benni, ``who is well known for his comic,
satiric writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the winner delivers a formal lecture. In that
sense, Fo was the anti-Faulkner. Ever the clown, he gave a
performance, a kind of variation of ``Mistero Buffo.'' He charged
the august members of the academy with being reckless in their
choice. An artist as well as a playwright, he distributed copies of
a comic book he designed as a guide for those at the ceremony. In
it he told the story of the travail and harassment he and his wife
have endured over their years in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ironic, comic and grotesque speech,'' he said. ``It
was not a triumphant speech.'' And, he said, the audience laughed,
another first.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has continued to improvise, traveling through
Europe performing his work. Among his many projects was a public
celebration, ``a theatrical illustration'' that he staged for the
unveiling of the restored ``Last Supper'' in Milan. That event was
televised throughout Italy.
</P>
<P>
   His first stop on this visit to the United States was to receive
a humanitarian award at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.
Then it was off to Barnard. About his master class, he said that he
and Rame would do what they always do. He explained, ``We're going
to talk more or less about improvisation, about the techniques you
can use to destroy the fourth wall, to create false accidents,''
things that happen ``outside the text, that force the public to
enter into the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his legacy, he gave the question careful thought and
said: ``I am speaking not only as a writer. I have tried to make it
clear to young people that a writer should be linked to his times
and that the writer who is linked to his times should put his hands
into the awful things of life. You have to plunge into the muck.''
Evoking the names of fellow playwrights, Aristophanes, Shakespeare
and Moliere, he added, ``There is no such thing as living comedy
unless it has its roots in things that are tragic.''

TALKS TO BAN SOFT MONEY IN NEW YORK SENATE RACE COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Negotiations over an agreement to ban soft money in
the New York Senate race collapsed on Friday after Hillary Rodham
Clinton offered a plan that was initially embraced by Rep. Rick
Lazio _ until he learned that it contained more restrictions on him
than on her.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Lazio denounced Clinton as the ``queen of dirty
money'' and said she was clinging to legalistic excuses to avoid a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that Lazio's aides had engaged in some sleight
of hand in the bargaining over an agreement. She based this
assertion on what appeared to be her interpretation of an 18-word
clause in a letter that her campaign received from the Lazio
campaign on Thursday. Lazio's aides said they were baffled and
infuriated by her reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable shift during the day from apparent good will
to vitriol between candidates who have argued for weeks over soft
money, the largely unregulated contributions that have eroded a
system of limits on federal elections imposed after Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Lazio has sought to put Clinton on the
defensive over soft money because she has benefited from at least
$5 million in commercials financed by soft money she collected in
conjunction with Democratic allies.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who has not raised soft money, asserts that he has
championed a ban because it will restore the public's faith in
elections. A campaign committee can accept donations of up to
$1,000 per person for the general election. On Friday morning,
Clinton took the stage at a breakfast meeting in Rye, N.Y., and
announced that even though her candidacy might suffer financially
if she renounced soft money, she would immediately do so as long as
Lazio followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make it simple, effective, enforceable and fair,'' she
said. ``Today I will urge the political parties supporting me not
to buy any more soft-money issue ads on TV or radio as long as the
parties and other groups helping my opponent don't buy any more of
those ads either. All it will take to do this is one word from Mr.
Lazio: OK So how about it, Mr. Lazio? OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had wanted a written agreement drafted by lawyers, and
monitored by two leading proponents of campaign finance reform,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio immediately agreed to this more informal one, and his
aides sent a letter to the Clinton campaign, outlining what they
understood to be the agreement: no soft-money spending by political
parties on behalf of either candidate and no spending by outside
political groups, either.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning upstate, Lazio declared victory, announcing what he
said was an historic change in campaign finance practices. Around
the same time, though, Clinton's aides issued a statement saying
there was no deal, accusing the Lazio campaign of ``double talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block was spending by outside political groups,
which is technically not soft money because it is not collected by
political parties. It turns out that Clinton wanted to ban
soft-money spending for both candidates; however, outside political
groups could help her but not him. Her aides pointed to her
statement at the breakfast, noting that a close parsing of the
language revealed the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lazio campaign responded that such a rule was unfair,
the Clinton campaign said that the Lazio campaign had actually
agreed on Thursday to the same thing. The Clinton campaign pointed
to the 18-word clause in the letter that it had received from the
Lazio campaign during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides had been discussing how each candidate would be
required to obtain signatures from outside groups pledging to not
spend money in the race. In the letter, the Lazio campaign said
that to speed up putting an agreement in place, ``we have dropped
our precondition that you attain the signatures of the outside
interest groups supporting your campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the clause demonstrated that the Lazio campaign no
longer would require the groups supporting her to stay out of the
race. By saying on Friday that such groups would have to refrain,
the Lazio campaign had ``reimposed a condition they had taken off
the table,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign called her interpretation nonsense,
maintaining that it was merely letting the Clinton campaign know
that if necessary, it could obtain some of the formal pledges after
the agreement was in force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and her aides have long expressed concern that
conservative political groups would spend heavily to defeat her,
though until now, they have mostly used her as a fund-raising
vehicle while spending relatively little.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that these groups were closely tied to the Lazio
campaign and as a result should be barred from spending in the
race. The groups supporting her, such as the National Abortion
Rights and Action League and various unions, were more independent,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference having an organization that is a
longstanding institution that makes independent decisions, and an
organization with your supporters on the board that calls the shots
where the money goes, which is what he has,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Elmira Friday night, Lazio ridiculed
Clinton. ``I twice voted for campaign finance reform in the House,
and we issued the pledge,'' he said, referring to his call for an
agreement. ``Now today, we see more evasion, more ducking, more
distortion of the truth. Let me tell you, there is not going be any
coronation this November of the queen of dirty money.''

GRAHAM STEPS DOWN AS WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER
</HEADLINE>
 By FELICITY BARRINGER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  Donald E. Graham announced on Friday that he was stepping down
after 21 years as publisher of The Washington Post to concentrate
on steering its parent company, of which he is chairman and chief
executive, as it continues to expand its new-media ventures.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publisher's job will be taken by his longtime associate,
Boisfeuillet Jones Jr., the first publisher from outside the
Meyer-Graham family in 30 years. Jones had been associate publisher
and president of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Alan G. Spoon resigned as president and chief
operating officer of the Washington Post Co. to join a venture
capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   The latest changing of the guard, while not expected to bring
any change in direction for the newspaper, was still a symbolic
moment: for 61 of the last 67 years, the publisher's job has been
held by a member of Graham's family.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Meyer, his grandfather, bought it in 1933. Since then,
the only nonfamily publisher was James Sweeterman, who ran the
newspaper for six years after Graham's father died in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's mother, Katharine Graham, one of a tiny group of major
newspaper publishers who have won Pulitzer Prizes in their own
right, took over in 1969 and presided over the newspaper's greatest
modern triumph, the coverage of the Watergate scandal, which ended
with the resignation of President Richard Nixon. After 10 years,
she turned the job over to her son in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In his tenure as publisher, during which The Post's major
competitor, The Washington Star, closed, Graham focused on
broadening the newspaper's coverage and circulation in the
ever-expanding suburbs, as well as building on The Post's
reputation for enterprising national and international reporting.
</P>
<P>
   When Ben Bradlee, the flamboyant and hard-driving editor who
oversaw the Watergate coverage, resigned, Graham replaced him with
Leonard Downie Jr., who was equally hard-driving but less
flamboyant _ a journalist who grew up at The Post, and was best
known for his local investigative coverage and his stint as
metropolitan editor.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's strategy of making the most of the newspaper's
near-monopoly position in its region paid off for years; until
three years ago, when it was supplanted by Newsday. The Post had
the greatest household penetration of any large newspaper in the
country. But like most other newspapers, it has suffered an erosion
of daily circulation _ which was stemmed in the last year or so _
and a sharper drop in Sunday circulation.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Jones _ who was two years behind Graham at
school in Washington and worked with him on The Harvard Crimson _
served as the newspaper's lawyer and later as its president.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, in an interview, said: ``The point is to have a good
publisher. Everyone here knows that Bo's basically running the
paper the last few years. He's doing the job; he ought to have the
title.''

U.S. BREEZES AS FRANCE EDGES BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Katie Smith scored 14 points and was one of
six Team USA players in double figures as the United States rolled
past New Zealand, 93-42, Friday at the Dome in Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   In what became the most exciting day of the women's tournament,
the Americans reasserted their dominance while upstart France
continued its surprising bid for a medal. The Frenchwomen knocked
off Brazil in overtime, 73-70, to move to 4-0 in their Olympic
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Fijalkowski scored 18 points on 6-of-7 shooting and
Yannick Souvre also had 18 points, dropping in six 3-pointers. The
French players gathered in a circle near midcourt after the game,
held hands and jumped up and down while singing.
</P>
<P>
   France's final preliminary round game is against Australia,
which is also 4-0 and along with Russia is considered the one of
the few teams to have a shot at upsetting the United States. Even
if France loses that game, it will finish second in the six-team
pool and head to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   With one game remaining before the medal round begins, the
United States women moved to 4-0 in Group B and are a virtual
certainty to be seeded first among the final eight qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Leading, 47-17, at halftime and turning 22 turnovers into 26
points, the Americans solidified their dominance after a grueling
victory Wednesday over Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, used primarily as a defensive specialist, made 6 of 11
shots and led the Americans in scoring for the second time in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In the other game, South Korea knocked off Russia, 75-73, in
another overtime thriller. Lee Jong Ae's 12-foot jumper with 2.8
seconds left in overtime _ just her second field goal of the game _
gave South Korea the victory and kept alive its hopes for a
quarterfinal berth.

WANTED: NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add 465 words at end, bgng `Lynch, who is...')  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a striking illustration of the eroding interest in
police careers, New York City has fallen far short of finding
enough recruits to fill its next Police Academy class, which is
scheduled to begin training in just a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters will continue to try to find candidates right up to
Sept. 29, when the new class is scheduled to be hired. But as of
Friday, the city expected to enlist only about 1,300 new officers,
not the 1,589 it had planned on adding to the force, according to
police officials who have been told of the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said it was the first time in memory that the
Police Department had been unable to fill openings for what has
long been considered a secure, respected job, with decent pay and
good benefits. In recent years, however, the luster of the job has
dulled as public criticism of officers has risen and the pay scale
has stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has flagged despite unprecedented spending on
advertising _ $20 million in the last two years _ to attract new
candidates. Police union officials predict that if current
conditions persist, the force will inevitably shrink. Indeed,
police managers are concerned enough to be reviewing a host of
measures to lure applicants, like allowing rookies more time to
earn the 60 college credits required for the job, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a police spokesman said it was premature to discuss the size
of the incoming class or any steps that might be taken to address
the recruiting issue. ``While the process is going on, the
department does not comment on personnel decisions,'' said Thomas
Antenen, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   New York is far from alone in its difficulty in finding new
officers. Los Angeles, Chicago and Phoenix are among the dozens of
American cities where police agencies have struggled in recent
years to compete for candidates with a booming private economy that
often offers safer, better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem in New York has grown particularly acute. The
city is already facing a possible wave of retirements in the next
five years when 10,000 veteran officers will become eligible to
leave with full pensions. If a majority of those officers retire,
as many expect, it will be essential to fill recruiting classes
just to keep pace with attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't make this class,'' said John Driscoll, president
of the Captain's Endowment Association, the union representing many
supervisory officers, ``and we have no one signing up to take the
tests, we will eventually reach a point where we will have no one
to make up the shortages and the department will have to shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, there is little danger New York will find
itself with too few police officers. The 40,000-member force is
already the largest in city history, with roughly 8,000 more
officers than a decade ago. On a per capita basis, the department
has 54 officers for every 10,000 residents, more than any other
large American municipality, according to the city's Independent
Budget Office. In fact, when the new class of rookies hits the
streets after seven months of academy training, the force will grow
to 41,000 officers at a time when the city is enjoying the lowest
crime levels in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the long-term prospects for police recruiters do appear
daunting. For five years, the number of people signing up to take
the police exam has been dropping. While 31,986 applicants signed
up for the test in 1996, only 8,381 applied for the test last May.
The next test, to be given in November, has drawn a meager 1,896
candidates, with only two weeks left in the application period. If
history holds, as many as one-third of those who sign up for the
test will not show up when it is given.
</P>
<P>
   Given their predicament, police officials have not been pleased
with an $800,000 ad campaign sponsored by the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association that has juxtaposed a graphic picture of a
fallen officer with the message that officers are paid far too
little. Currently, police officers in the city with five years on
the job earn $54,000, a salary that lags behind that paid by Nassau
and Suffolk Counties, where officers with equivalent experience
earn $76,000 and $78,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not create this problem,'' said the union's president,
Patrick J. Lynch. ``But we are giving them a solution and the
solution is to pay police officers a livable wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who is in the midst of contract negotiations, expressed
concern that the city will lower standards for recruits as hiring
becomes more difficult. Police officials countered that the current
shortfall in recruits was evidence that the department was willing
to forsake its hiring goals rather than settle for less-qualified
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, if the city had been willing to cut corners, there
were opportunities to make up the shortfall. Even today, there are
tens of thousands of names on active Civil Service hiring lists for
the position of police officer. All of the candidates have passed
the police test in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said they found that thousands of the candidates
did not meet the educational or physical requirements. Others had
not reached the minimum age of 22. Many had dropped out of an
earlier application process because they could not pass the medical
or psychological tests. Still others had a past drug problem or
criminal record that surfaced during their background screening.
And thousands more had lost interest in the job or had found
another position.
</P>
<P>
   Even after police recruiters contacted 28,000 of these
candidates by letter and telephone, the department fell nearly 300
short of its goal of 1,589 new hires, officials said. In March, the
city had been able to completely fill the last academy class, which
had 1,500 openings.
</P>
<P>
   The new class of 1,300 could be winnowed further once the
recruits get a taste of academy life. Typically, the department
loses 5 percent to 8 percent of a recruit class because of
resignations and terminations.
</P>
<P>
   Other police departments that are experiencing recruiting
problems of this magnitude have taken to searching across the
country, to solicit interest from the broadest possible pool of
applicants. New York has avoided such an effort, in large part
because it is trying to attract more city residents, especially
blacks and Hispanics, to take the test, with some success.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, New York officials have played down any talk of
eliminating the entrance requirement of two years of college that
was introduced by the department in 1996. Many police officials
across the country believe that stricter entry qualifications have
made it tougher to recruit at a time when accomplished people have
such a variety of options in a sizzling private-sector economy.
Several studies, however, have shown that college-educated officers
receive fewer brutality complaints and take fewer sick days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years of college is not a panacea,'' said Jerome H.
Skolnick, a professor at the New York University School of Law who
teaches a seminar in police practices. ``It is a minimal
requirement. Once you drop it, any concept of professionalism in
policing is going to be discarded.''

YEHUDA AMICHAI, POET WHO TURNED ISRAEL'S EXPERIENCE INTO VERSE,
DIES AT 76 
</HEADLINE>

italics.) 
 By MEL GUSSOW  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yehuda Amichai, the Israeli poet who distilled his experience _
and his nation's _ into highly metaphorical verse written in Hebrew
and translated into more than 25 languages, died Friday in
Jerusalem. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   He died of a rare form of lymphoma, said Stanley Moss, a poet
and close friend.
</P>
<P>
   In his poetry Amichai often wrote about love and loss and, in
recent years, about aging and mortality, all of it linked by his
gift for poeticizing the particular: the localized object or image
in everyday life. From his point of view, the role of a poet was
``to name each thing, each feeling, each experience, plainly and
accurately, without pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amichai's verse, said the critic Robert Alter, ``There is a
tension between personal experience and the violent pressures of
history.'' Alter continued. ``Writing about himself, he is also
writing about Everyman.''
</P>
<P>
   Amichai's work derived from his own background as a young man
fleeing from Nazi Germany to Palestine in the 1930s, as a soldier
who fought in the British Army in 1948 and in the Israeli armed
forces, and as a husband and father and lover articulating his
feelings and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He was firmly rooted in contemporary Israel and aware of the
politics that surrounded him, but he often treated it by
indirection and had been known to write love poetry in time of war.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai'' in The New
York Times Book Review in 1986, Edward Hirsch said, ``Amichai is an
essentially autobiographical poet with the rare ability to
characterize the complex fate of the modern Israeli, the private
individual inevitably affected by the public realm of war, politics
and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Amichai was like one of Emerson's ``representative
men,'' updated and living in Jerusalem, a prophet who ``speaks in
the guise of an ordinary Jewish citizen concerned with his people
and his place.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hebrew and in translation, Amichai's work is remarkably
accessible, imaginative, unburdened by artificiality and often
almost conversational. As a result, he was that exception: a poet
who is read by a wide public and not just by academics and other
poets. His books sold about 15,000 copies on average in Israel,
comparable to best-seller status in larger countries. Still, in the
manner of a poet, for many years he had to support himself by
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai's celebrity in Israel followed him down the street.
Walking in Jerusalem, his home for many years, he would be
recognized and accorded the attention that in the United States
might be reserved for a movie star or athlete.
</P>
<P>
   In a profile of Amichai in The New York Times Magazine in 1986,
Alter said about the poet's work, ``His Hebrew is often rich in
soundplay, wordplay, allusion and other traits of virtuosity that
are not readily evident in translation, and his language is a
shifting mixture of colloquial and literary.''
</P>
<P>
   Alter said that Amichai saw no contradiction in a poet's also
being a man of action. and that a symbolic tie between the two can
be discovered in his use of poetic metaphor as a ``weapon in the
hand-to-hand struggle with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Amichai said he believed that metaphor ``is the great human
revolution, at least on a par with the invention of the wheel.''
Words were his arsenal, as in his ``Poem of My Time'':
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Is there in this land a stone that was never thrown
</P>
<P>
   And never built and never overturned
</P>
<P>
   And never uncovered and never discovered
</P>
<P>
   And never screamed from a wall and never discarded by the
builders
</P>
<P>
   And never closed on top of a grave and never lay under lovers
</P>
<P>
   And never turned into a cornerstone?  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Lawrence Joseph &UR; , &LR;  published in The Paris
Review, Amichai said, ``A poet's state of mind is seeing the world
with a kind of double exposure, seeing undertones and overtones,
seeing the world as it is.'' Irony was an essential element in his
poetry, a way, he said, of ``always trying to see another side.'''
That was how he lived, he said, ``focusing, refocusing and
juxtaposing different shifting and changing perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing his process, he said he combined ``different,
sometimes competing, language and forms.'' Before he began writing,
he said he thought about the shape the poem would take ``almost
visually, like a piece of sculpture _ I can touch it.'' Then he
would fill it in ``with my subjects, from the entire world of my
subjects.'' Freely mixing techniques and forms, he wrote poetry
that ranged from terse four-line images to sonnets to the epic
``Travels of a Latter Day Benjamin of Tudela.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, time was the most important dimension in his writing:
``Time is entirely relative, relational. The phrase I like to use
to describe my sense of time _ a play on  &UR; comparative literature  &LR; _
is &UR; comparative time &LR; . Time, for me, is imaginatively comparative
and continuous; I have an almost physical sense of memory recall. .
. . It's easy for me to shortcut back to my childhood, my
adolescence, my wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Yehuda Amichai was born in Wurzburg, Germany, on May 3, 1924.
The Amichais were an Orthodox Jewish family living in a mostly
Catholic environment. After immigrating with his parents to
Palestine in 1936, he lived in Jerusalem. After his high school
graduation, he was drafted into the British army and served four
years with the Palestinian brigade during World War II. Stationed
in Egypt, he accidentally came across an anthology of modern
British poetry that included poems by Dylan Thomas, T.S. Eliot and
W.H. Auden. Their work had a great impact on him. As he said, ``I
think that was when I began to think seriously about writing
poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war &UR; , &LR;  Amichai taught school in Israel and, in 1948,
joined the Haganah underground. He fought in the Israeli-Arab wars
of 1948, 1956 and 1973. His adult life was caught up in Israel's
struggle to survive and endure and the images of war appear
frequently in his work. In his poem ``Seven Laments for the War
Dead'' he wrote that everything is written in three languages:
``Hebrew, Arabic and Death.''
</P>
<P>
   While teaching, he also studied the Bible and literature at
Hebrew University and wrote poetry. In 1951 he showed some of his
poems to a professor who submitted one to a magazine. It was
accepted. Then he won first prize in a poetry competition. His
first book of poetry, ``Now and in Other Days'' was published in
1955. The book was attacked by some Israeli critics, partly because
of his use of colloquial language, but gradually it became a
success, and soon his career as a poet had begun.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s after a trip to the United States, Amichai
wrote two essays, one about hearing Auden read his poetry at the
92nd Street Y in New York. Later, he and Auden became friends.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Amichai began writing short stories, publishing a volume in
1959. Other books followed in Hebrew, but it was not until 1968
that his work was published in English, beginning with his first
novel ``Not of This Time, Not of This Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Amichai's breakthrough with English readers came in the late
1970s with two volumes translated by the author and Ted Hughes. It
was Hughes, he said, ``who put me into orbit.'' With Hughes'
encouragement, Amichai was invited to read his poetry at the
Spoleto arts festival, and soon found himself in the company of
Auden, Pound and others, ``reading with poets whom I had admired
for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the admiration was mutual, as Amichai's work became
recognized throughout the world. Although he often taught and gave
poetry readings in the United States, he remained an active Israeli
citizen who never ignored the politics of his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to acknowledge political realities,'' he said in the
interview in The Paris Review. ``There's an old Jewish saying, `If
you meet the devil, take him with you into the synagogue.' Try to
take the evil of politics into yourself, to influence it
imaginatively, to give it human shape. This is my attitude toward
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   For Amichai, all poetry was political: ``This is because real
poems deal with a human response to reality, and politics is part
of reality, history in the making. Even if a poet writes about
sitting in a glass house drinking tea, it reflects politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his many books of poetry and his short stories,
Amichai published a volume of plays, two novels and three books for
children. A new book of verse, ``Opened Closed Opened,'' was
recently published by Harcourt Brace. In it, he said, ``God is
change and Death is his prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife Chana, two sons, Roni and David, and
a daughter Emanuela, all of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s Amichai lived in the Yemin Moshe district of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gods Come and Go, Prayers Remain Forever,'' a poem written
in 1994, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tombstones crumble, words come and go, words are forgotten,
</P>
<P>
   The lips that uttered them turned to dust,
</P>
<P>
   Tongues die like people, other tongues come to life,
</P>
<P>
   Gods in the sky change, gods come and go,
</P>
<P>
   Prayers remain forever.  &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Metaphor as a Weapon in `a Struggle With Reality' &QC;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; God takes pity on kindergarten children,
</P>
<P>
   Less on schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On grown-ups, He won't take pity anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves them alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime they have to crawl on all fours
</P>
<P>
   In the blazing sand,
</P>
<P>
   To get to the first aid station
</P>
<P>
   Dripping blood.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe He will take pity and cast His shadow
</P>
<P>
   On those who truly love
</P>
<P>
   As a tree on someone sleeping on the bench
</P>
<P>
   On a boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we too will spend on them
</P>
<P>
   The last coins of favor

PREP THROWS FOR 724 YARDS

 (NOTE TO EDITORS: Van Nuys and Pacific Palisades are both
neighborhoods of the city of Los Angeles)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Koral of Pacific Palisades passed for 724
yards against Grant of Van Nuys Friday afternoon, shattering the
state single-game high school record by 160 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Koral, a senior, also threw seven touchdown passes. He completed
34 of 53 attempts _ averaging 21.3 yards a completion in slippery
and sometimes rainy conditions as Palisades (2-1) defeated host
Grant 48-30.
</P>
<P>
   The previous state record was set in 1996 by Doug Baughman of
Bolsa Grande High of Garden Grove in a 53-23 victory over La Quinta
High of Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   His first-half touchdowns went to Charles Ealy (80 and 15 yards)
and Greig Carlson (42 and 52 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, who caught nine passes for 249 yards, added his third
touchdown on a third-down, 94-yard strike from Koral.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Beegun finished with five catches for 133 yards, including
touchdowns of 90 and 36 yards. Ealy caught 13 balls for 226 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Clayton, who intercepted Koral in the first quarter, led
Grant (1-2) with 276 rushing yards and three touchdowns _ all in
the third quarter _ on runs of 40 and 46 yards.

AN INDESCRIBABLE MOMENT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The horn blared and the coach of the United
States women's water polo team, Guy Baker, Friday night almost
leaped into the pool in his frenzied exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's indescribable how I feel,'' he said. ``No matter what
happens, we're going to win a medal now. It's just unbelievable how
far we've come.''
</P>
<P>
   His gals, showing once again their toughness, their resolve,
their durability and, most of all, their courage, had defied all
pre- Olympic expectations and earned themselves an opportunity to
win a gold medal by beating the Netherlands 6-5 in what was an
aquatic version of one of those fierce NBA playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The teams competed furiously the entire 28 minutes, holding,
grabbing, bumping, mauling, jostling and even elbowing in a game
that wasn't decided until the final seconds when team captain Julie
Swail and Maureen O'Toole teamed up to smother a Netherlands shot
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will face Australia, which beat them earlier in
the week 7-6, tonight for the championship. If this one is as
intense and entertaining as Friday night's drama, then the 17,000
people expected to show up at Sydney International Aquatic Centre
will be in for a riveting evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia obviously will be the favorite, but I promise we'll
show up,'' said a smiling Baker after his team's latest heroics.
``We're a team that never quits, and gets stronger as the game goes
on. I think you saw that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   What the intimate gathering at the Ryke Aquatic Centre saw was
the Americans bolt to a 2-0 edge on two early O'Toole goals and
then fall behind 5-3 at one point in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   What the intimate gathering saw was Coralie Simmons and Robin
Beauregard, both former UCLA All-Americans, score goals to tie up
matters at 5-5 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   What the intimate gathering saw was Heather Moody score what
turned out to be the game-winner at the 6:09 mark of the fourth
period and then have to retire to the sidelines after getting
elbowed in the nose by a Dutch player.
</P>
<P>
   What the intimate gathering saw was the American goalkeeper,
Bernice Orwig, make an incredible stop on a point-blank shot by the
Netherlands' Carla Quint in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just focused on the ball and I had to stop it because of
what happened to Heather,'' said Orwig, who played at USC. ``We had
to win this game for her after she got hurt. No way we were going
to let it slip through our grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody remained in the Americans' locker room afterward and was
unavailable to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Her status tonight is uncertain, although Guy Baker said, ``If
there is any way she can play, she will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans showed stellar resourcefulness in this one,
although it seemed they were in serious trouble when they fell
behind by those two goals.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Dutch have been the most dominant force in the
sport the past 12 years, winning eight world championships. Eight
of their players on the current team have performed in more than
100 international matches, compared to only three for their Yankee
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   No way they would squander such an advantage, especially when a
gold-medal match with Australia was a little more than 14 minutes
away.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker's women have extraordinary grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got down or got worried when we fell behind,'' said
Simmons, who wound up with two goals. ``We had made a few defensive
mistakes and we just tightened up. I don't think they scored on us
the last two quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just seemed to play better when we are in tough,'' said
O'Toole. ``We did the same against Hungary in Sicily when we
qualified for the Olympics. This team just never stops fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Netherlands for the second time in this
tournament, the U.S. team now has a 4-1-1 record that also includes
victories over Russia and Kazakhstan and a tie with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we and the Australians are two very evenly matched
teams,'' said Baker. ``They've got a lot of talented players and so
do we. It seems like every time we play them, it goes right down to
the final horn.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, Maureen O'Toole will hear the horn for the final
time tonight, culminating a 22-year career in storybook fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't ask for a better way to go out,'' said O'Toole,
whose team did its pre-Olympic training in Los Alamitos. ``My dream
was always to play in the Olympics and to win a gold medal. I'm
halfway there. Hopefully, I'll achieve both goals on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans figure to be underdogs. But they weren't exactly
the favorites against the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are starting to find out we have a pretty good
team,'' said Baker.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.

 GORE'S PERSONAL TOUCH DRAWS VOTERS IN  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actor Harry Hamlin, in jeans and a sport coat, was quietly
sitting in a Southern California health center this week, because
he wanted to hear Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Geoff Patnoe, 28, a former Republican strategist
who works in the technology industry, stood along a rope line in a
park in Sunnyvale, because he wanted to see Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was running across California this week, from
Hollywood to Silicon Valley, in search of dollars and votes. There
were two big, fancy fund-raisers, crowds of campaign workers, and
political reporters to record it.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the real people who showed that even in a state as
big as California _, &LR;  with more than a dozen media markets, where
everything seems to run on television, &LR;  _ sometimes the candidate
himself makes the sale.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case a stone's throw from Hollywood, where Hamlin
showed up quietly, to see Gore face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin isn't exactly a regular guy. He starred in ``L.A. Law,''
was once People Magazine's ``Sexiest Man Alive,'' and has taken
some challenging roles, like the gay lover in the controversial
``Making Love,'' a film about coming out. His wife, Lisa Rinna, who
was the husband-stealing vixen of ``Melrose Place,'' once posed for
a Playboy centerfold while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   So the couple have a stake in the fact that Gore and his running
mate, Joe Lieberman, have been recently charging that Hollywood has
been irresponsible in marketing adult products to kids recently _
even as the Democratic nominees were picking up money in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamlin, watching Gore talk to seniors and health care
professionals at a town hall meeting, seemed impressed. Instead of
chafing at Gore's Hollywood stance, he said he had to give him some
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain factions in Hollywood that have made profits
by selling the worst part of what we do to the wrong audience _ an
audience of children,'' Hamlin said. ``They see a way to make a big
buck there; they've exploited that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have small children, and it's very important to me that the
kind of programming, the kind of films marketed to them, is
appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, he said, ``my 21/2-year-old daughter is not even
allowed to see Disney movies. (They) have catastrophes in them, and
parents die, and there are witches and monsters, a lot of negative
stuff,'' he said. ``For a 21/2-year-old ... to be exposed to that
kind of trauma on the screen, I think, is inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin said he doesn't think Disney is inappropriately marketing
to kids; it ``really is a parental issue.'' But he gave Gore a
thumbs up for raising the issue, and said he hoped ``there could be
regulations put in place by marketers,'' to assist parents choosing
their kids' entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Half the state away, there was another unlikely supporter in
Gore's camp.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, that was Patnoe, a Republican, a tech
communications worker and former GOP strategist who has given money
to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Patnoe showed up at Lakewood Park in Sunnyvale to ``check out''
the vice president at this week's rally. He stood along the rope
line, next to a guy who held a newer version of a Palm Pilot-like
device.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president came up and grabbed it. ``Wow, is this the
new Handspring Visor?'' asked Gore excitedly, referring to another
version of the handheld gizmo that's become a tec &LR; chie must-have.
``Is it a Beta version? Has it shipped yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He commented how he had a Palm V, but he bought two
Handsprings for his daughters,'' Patnoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Patnoe, who once worked for Gov. Pete Wilson, said he was
taken aback. ``I'm a big fan of Bush Senior,'' he said. ``But I
thought, `There's no way that Bush Jr. could have a discussion like
that with someone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But for Patnoe, the clincher came a moment later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore looked me in the face and asked me for my vote,'' he
said. ``I have never been asked directly by a presidential
candidate like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will shock most of my friends, because I am going to vote
for Al Gore,'' he said. ``Retail politics does work.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's as simple as that: up close and personal still
works.

 CLINTON TO TAP U.S. OIL RESERVE  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     and MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day after Vice President Al Gore called for
tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reduce oil prices,
President Clinton moved to release 30 million barrels of crude oil
from the 570-million-barrel stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced the decision Friday,
marking the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991 that the
reserve is to be tapped _ and the first time ever for nonmilitary
purposes since the stockpile was created more than a
quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right time to do this,'' Richardson said at a news
conference, describing the move as an effort to ease supplies of
home heating oil, which the Energy Department estimates will cost
30 percent more this winter than last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that American families keep warm this
winter and get their heating oil,'' Richardson said. ``Portland,
Maine, will be in the 50s next week, so will Minneapolis, and it
snowed in the Rockies yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning hard in the battleground states of the
Midwest, urged Clinton Thursday to release 5 million barrels from
the reserve in six or seven installments.
</P>
<P>
   Gore reiterated his call Friday, saying releases from the
reserve would ``help the middle-class families of this country get
some lower gasoline prices and lower home-heating oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson quickly denied any political motivation. ``This is
not political,'' Richardson said. ``The president wants to help the
American people get heating oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve consists of crude oil stored in
salt domes in Louisiana. It was created as an emergency supply in
1973 after a series of oil shocks disrupted economies around the
world. It has been tapped only once before, by President George
Bush to maintain supplies during the Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, himself a former
Texas oil man, condemned the move, saying the reserve ``is meant
for a national emergency, a national war, a major disruption of
supply. The Strategic Petroleum should not be used as a short-term
political fix for somebody whose administration has been asleep at
the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, representing the U.S. oil
industry, refused to comment Friday, referring reporters to a
sharply critical statement issued Thursday after Gore's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country's current situation has been a long time coming,
and it cannot be remedied overnight,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices, which reached nearly $38 a barrel in recent days,
fell $1.38 Friday to $32.68. But most economists believe the
political impact of the oil release will be far greater than its
economic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore called for several releases of 5 million barrels
each, Clinton, in effect, authorized six releases. It would take
114 such installments to deplete the nation's reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, economists believe the additional 30
million barrels will probably translate into just paltry savings,
if any, for the average consumer. Drivers will probably notice no
difference at the pump, while users of home heating oil might see a
short-term drop in price, according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh  &LR; Refinery Capacity an Issue
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the new oil could reach homes in 40 to 50 days, just
in time to bring prices down for winter _ and election day. But
first the crude oil must be refined, and most of the nation's
refineries, particularly those on the Gulf Coast, are running close
to 100 percent capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having more crude isn't going to help me make more (heating
oil) right now,'' Bill Greehey, chairman and chief executive of
Valero Energy Corp., a refining company based in San Antonio, told
the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the mere threat of using the nation's reserve to
influence the market could lead to lower energy bills as sellers
try to unload their inventory before an anticipated price drop. By
the time markets closed Thursday, the day Gore announced his
support for the plan, the price of oil dropped 3 percent to $34.20
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe Clinton's decision to tap the oil reserve
could prompt OPEC ministers, who will meet next week in Venezuela,
to place more oil on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But an OPEC backlash is also possible. A tiny cut in supply from
the oil-producing nations would more than eliminate any benefit
from using the domestic reserves, something Gore himself recognized
when he spoke against such a policy in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they (OPEC) would have to do is cut back a little bit on
supply, and they'd wipe out any impact from releasing oil from that
reserve,'' Gore said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices began moving sharply up last spring after remaining
in the low $20 range for the previous two years _ a level
economists say was depressed by the Asian financial crisis, when
world demand fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have been rising as a result of many factors, including
the long economic expansion in the United States that has boosted
demand, now combined with higher economic growth overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The long period of depressed oil prices also induced higher
consumption, reflected in such things as the popularity of larger
vehicles. Half of all vehicles now sold in the United States are
sport utility vehicles, light trucks and vans, which consume more
gas than the average car.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the policy's actual effect on oil prices, its
political ramifications could be significant in a presidential race
where the outcome of a few swing states could determine the victor.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, with 21 electoral votes and a 40-year record of voting
for the winning presidential candidate, the price of heating oil is
big news. For example, a front-page headline in Thursday's
Cleveland Plain Dealer warned of a proposed utility rate hike that
would cost the average consumer $70 more per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it a crisis today, but it is critical in the
short term,'' Ohio Gov. Bob Taft said of the high cost of natural
gas. Still, Taft, a Republican, stood at Bush's side this week in
Cleveland when he attacked Gore's proposal as politically motivated
and ``bad public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil is most widely used in the Northeast, including New
York, where Hillary Clinton is battling for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have consistently given Bush an edge over Gore when voters
are asked which candidate is better able to address the high cost
of gasoline. Gore's new line of attack allows him to polish his
image as a populist crusader standing up for the little guy, while
reminding voters that both Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney,
have worked for big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am president,'' Gore said this week, ``I am going to
stand up to big oil and demand fairer gasoline prices for families
and an end to unfair profiteering.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponents call his plan politically motivated and
economically undisciplined.
</P>
<P>
   They point to an internal memo written by Secretary of Treasury
Lawrence Summers, reported in the Wall Street Journal this week,
that argued it would be ``a major and substantial policy mistake''
to use the reserve beyond a limited test. Summers pointed out that
his view is shared by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the plan note that only once, during the Persian
Gulf War in 1990-91, has the nation found it necessary to use the
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established by Congress to
address supply disruptions. It was not intended, and should never
be used, to manipulate prices,'' the American Petroleum Institute
said in a statement.

SOARING OIL PRICES HURTING AMERICANS, GORE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With GORE) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday, Vice President Al Gore addressed members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Valport, Pa.:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to stand up to the apologists for big oil. I
reject an agenda that is of big oil, by big oil and for big oil. I
reject the agenda of those who say, `Don't even offer a plan, do
nothing about it.' These prices are skyrocketing. It's hurting
small businesses, it's hurting those on fixed income, it's hurting
young families, and the prospect for even higher prices ahead is
going to cause even more trouble unless we act now. We are not
helpless. We can act. We have tools at our disposal. And I'm
calling for them to be used ....
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to develop our own domestic resources. We need to
develop new technologies so that we can burn all of our fuels more
efficiently and more cleanly. We need to create millions of good
new jobs in states like Pennsylvania with workers like those here
at the IBEW by getting out in front of the market for these new
boilers and new furnaces and new cars and trucks and buses and
revamped power plants and new technologies that help us to conserve
more energy. ''

GRUDZIELANEK STILL THINKS ABOUT SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ His glove is at second, but Mark Grudzielanek's
heart belongs at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek said he understood why the Dodgers moved him from
shortstop this year and is all right with it, but as his first full
season at second winds to a close, he hasn't given up on the
possibility of returning to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm at second,'' Grudzielanek said. ``Next year,
you never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm done with shortstop for the rest of my
career. I love that position. You play it as long as I did, that's
going to feel like home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But A.C. is doing a good job and I see him being here for a
while. He's very solid and one of the better defensive shortstops
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A.C.'' is Alex Cora, the 24-year-old shortstop the Dodgers
were so high on in the offseason, they asked Grudzielanek to switch
from short _ where he had always started during his five-year
career _ to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accepted it,'' Grudzielanek said. ``I understood it and
tried to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cora failed to win the job out of spring training, the
Dodgers left Grudzielanek at second and opened the season with
veteran Kevin Elster at short.
</P>
<P>
   Cora has been the Dodgers primary starting shortstop since being
recalled a second time this season on May 31. He's batting .244,
with only 12 errors in 101 games.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek said he has slowly become comfortable at second,
but the move has also coincided with an offensive drop.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Grudzielanek hit .326 _ the highest average ever for
a Dodgers shortstop and the highest in the NL in 63 years. This
season he is batting .281, although his seven home runs and 48 RBI
are almost identical to last year's totals (seven, 46).
</P>
<P>
   ``The move was definitely on my mind, but I don't want to make
excuses for my poor offensive output this year,'' he said. ``I
never really put a good streak together.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sheffield out for year? Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said it
was possible Gary Sheffield's bad back could force him to miss the
last eight games, but the outfielder said he expects to return.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield did not play again Friday and has played only one of
the last six games while battling a lumbar sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back out there,'' Sheffield said. ``I've been doing
some strengthening exercises, but every time I get ready to swing a
bat, I feel that sharp pain again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's not to a point where I can't swing a bat and go
out there and play. But I don't want to risk further injury. That's
the only thing I'm really concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Outfielder F.P. Santangelo, out since Aug. 23
with a torn ulnar ligament in his left thumb, was activated.
Johnson said he could be used as a pinch-runner. . . . Believe it
or not: Padres first baseman Ryan Klesko stole his 23rd base of the
season. He'd stolen a total of 26 bases in his six-plus previous
seasons.

ERVINS MUST PAY TO SHARE GOLD JOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Sherry Ervin traveled halfway around the
globe so she could watch her son compete in the Olympics on a
giant-screen television in a place packed with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand: Ervin made it inside the Sydney
International Aquatic Centre Friday when her 19-year-old son
Anthony tied for the gold medal with U.S. teammate Gary Hall Jr. in
the 50-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin was one of the lucky ones, as it were. She corralled one
of the 17,500 tickets to the penultimate finals session of the
eight- day competition.
</P>
<P>
   Trust her, procuring an NBA Finals Game 6 seat on the floor
couldn't have been any harder. The Valencia mom was so grateful for
the seat, she didn't blink at the price _ $275 Australian (about
$173 in U.S. currency).
</P>
<P>
   To sire an Olympian, you see, is to realize quickly that
parental pride is its own reward. Everything else _ airfare,
lodging, food, tickets to your child's events, hugs for your child
after his race _ will cost you extra.
</P>
<P>
   Extra money. Extra time. Extra tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin was one of the lucky ones, as it were. Her airfare and
lodging were picked up by Budweiser, a branch of Anheuser-Busch.
Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to afford to join her
husband Jack and the couple's eldest son Jackie at the Games
(youngest son Derrick stayed home).
</P>
<P>
   What parents of Olympic hopefuls don't know can hurt their
pocketbooks. It's sort of shabby but true:
</P>
<P>
   You can drive your kid to practice twice a day, six days a week,
for 11 months a year for eight to 10 years; you can stop at every
Motel 6 from Apple Valley to Yuba on the age-group swimming
express; you can dress up ground beef in a hundred ways to keep
your kid in swimsuits and caps; you can be there to wipe away
rivers of tears and shoo away fears. And if Junior grows up to
become one of the fortunate few to compete in the Olympics, you'll
be in the same boat as Maude and Ed from Milwaukee when it comes to
securing a decent vantage point.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin is pretty sure she would have seen more of the 50 final
had she stayed home and planted herself in a booth at a San
Fernando Valley sports bar. For starters, she was as far away from
the blocks as you could be and still go deaf from the chants of
``Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ervin stands 6-foot-2, but from where Sherry and Jack
sat, he looked ethereal, like a finger of steam rising from the
deck. And they were so high, she almost could use the flags hanging
from the rafters to wipe the sweat off her brow.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry and Jack Ervin were among the lucky ones, as it were.
Their son was the first one off the blocks and Sherry flew to her
feet, her reaction time just slightly slower than Anthony's.
</P>
<P>
   The race lasted under 22 seconds but long enough for her to yell
herself hoarse cheering. Even though the field was swimming toward
the Ervins, they were too far away to make out many details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to look at the replays to see the race,'' Sherry Ervin
would later say, or rather, croak.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, watching the race unfold over and over and
over, from all different angles, would be a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Ervin, 19, touched the wall, Sherry stared at the
giant scoreboards on either side of her to see his reaction. When
she saw the image of Ervin hug the image of Hall, with whom he had
trained this summer in Phoenix, the tears started to queue in the
corners of her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was picture perfect,'' Ervin said throatily.
</P>
<P>
   A German gentleman was seated behind her and at some point he
grabbed Sherry Ervin's shoulder and shouted above the din, ``It was
worth the price of the ticket just to see your reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Ervin couldn't see her son's face during the awards
ceremony to gauge what he was feeling, though she could guess.
``All we could see was the top of his head,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The co-gold medalists were shepherded to a group interview
session after the awards ceremony and then to drug testing. More
interviews ensued, then a long overdue warmdown, more interviews, a
deep-tissue massage and a live network TV appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly three hours after his race before the Ervins
finally got to give their son a congratulatory hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I loved him,'' Sherry Ervin said, ``and then I
started crying.''

STATE DEPARTMENT BUILDING DEDICATED TO HARRY S. TRUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Kevin Murphy  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ President Harry S. Truman's
contribution to world peace and diplomacy fills American history
books. On Friday, it was set in stone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under a bright afternoon sun, President Clinton unveiled a
17-foot-long granite marker that names the headquarters of the
State Department as the Harry S. Truman Building.
</P>
<P>
   The honor, to recognize the foreign policies of Missouri's most
famous son, was long overdue, said U.S. Rep. Ike Skelton of
Lexington, Mo., who spoke at the ceremony Friday. He called Truman
``undoubtedly one of the most illustrious occupants of the Oval
Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman brought an end to World War II by dropping the atomic
bomb, led America during the Korean War, created the Marshall Plan
and NATO to rebuild and protect Europe, and saw the start of the
Cold War with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a doer, whose plain words and bold actions mended a
broken world, saved freedom, and embodied the principles of our
nation at its best,'' Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said
at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But Truman, the 33rd president, was also one of the more
unassuming chief executives. So what would he think of having his
name emblazoned across the State Department headquarters?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would be honored,'' said John Truman, a grandnephew
of Truman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have been very proud and humbled by the step you are
taking today to memorialize his good name,'' Truman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-foot-high black granite marker was stationed in a bed of
pale yellow chrysanthemums in front of the eight-story State
Department complex, where about 8,000 people work. Part of the
building was finished in 1939 and the other section in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the State Department and a great day
for Missouri,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright tried to re-create the Truman era during two days of
events honoring him. At a State Department dinner Thursday night,
the menu was identical to one at a state dinner at the White House
in October 1949. On Friday, the Navy Commodores orchestra played
big band music of the 1940s era.
</P>
<P>
   Among guests at the dinner was Larry Hackman, director of the
Truman Library and Museum in Independence. The library lent a bust
of Truman that was displayed in the headquarter's lobby Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not someone who was enamored with having things named
after him, but if there was one he would have (agreed to), it would
have been the State Department building,'' Hackman said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other federal buildings in Washington are named after
presidents. The Commerce Department bears the name of Herbert
Hoover, former Commerce secretary, and a new world trade center is
named after Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The Executive Office Building next to the White House is going
to be named after Dwight Eisenhower of Kansas. The dedication date
is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton said he was asked earlier this year by two former aides
of Truman to name the State Department headquarters after him.
Albright readily agreed and the legislation sailed through the
House and Senate with bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership and character, especially in the area of
foreign policy, have earned him well-deserved praise and respect
throughout the world,'' Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican,
said in a statement to the Senate on Thursday. Ashcroft and Sen.
Kit Bond were invited to attend the ceremony Friday but said they
had other commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Truman is rated in numerous polls of historians as one of the
country's best presidents, but his foreign policies are not without
detractors, especially regarding the Cold War that lasted until 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vietnam intruded and we saw the consequences of the Cold
War, we began to argue that his truculence really provoked the
Russians when there was a possibility for cooperation,'' said Allan
Winkler, a Miami University history professor who specializes in
the last half of the 20th century. ``His reputation has gone up and
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and others said Truman took the long view in making
decisions, such as sending aid to Europe to stave off Soviet
influence, recognizing the state of Israel in 1948, and opening the
armed forces to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Truman is largely responsible for some of the
freedoms and opportunities Americans have today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing we say, `Thanks, Mr. President,' by naming
this building for him,'' Clinton said. ``It would be a far, far
better thing if we would follow his lead and give the same set of
opportunities to our grandchildren.''

EDITORIAL: SLEEPOVERS AND SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Just when Hillary Rodham Clinton has been making headway among
voters in New York, her campaign for Senate has hit a familiar
political problem. On Friday the White House released a list of
more guests who have stayed overnight there or at Camp David since
July. About a quarter of them have contributed to Hillary Clinton's
campaign for Senate in New York. At the same time, the first lady's
proposal to Rep. Rick Lazio, her Republican opponent, that both
candidates forgo all broadcast advertisements paid for with
unregulated soft money was rejected by Lazio on the grounds that it
was one-sided. The collection of soft money, of course, is at the
center of the reckless fund-raising system that has led to excesses
like the White House sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' use of the White House to reward contributors was
a national embarrassment, but the sleepovers themselves were never
proved to be illegal. That probably continues to be the case, but
the use of invitations to the Lincoln Bedroom as fund-raising bait
is just the kind of outdated practice that Hillary Clinton needs to
shed as she grows to political independence. Lazio is justified in
making this distasteful practice an issue in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A possible mutual agreement to ban soft money unraveled Friday
when it turned out that Hillary Clinton's proposal would have
called on Lazio to bar advertisements sponsored by groups outside
his campaign but allow supporters of Clinton's candidacy _
particularly the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club and the National Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League _ to run advertisements paid
for by unrestricted donations. The first lady argued that her
proposal was more of a sacrifice for her campaign than it would be
for Lazio. Her aides also asserted that the outside groups paying
for advertisements for Lazio were sham organizations set up by the
Republican Party, whereas Clinton's groups were legitimate
organizations with large numbers of members.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's contention is not supportable. A soft-money ban
should apply equally to both campaigns. She could easily get these
well-known groups to forgo their televised ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Although discussions between Lazio and Clinton collapsed into
recriminations Friday night, there is still time for them to try to
work something out that would be of mutual benefit and would also
serve the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to ban soft money would also enhance Clinton's image. The
one thing that has marred her increasingly effective race is
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 President Clinton twisted the limits on the use of soft
money, which should never have been used for campaign
advertisements, in a way that has damaged and corrupted the
political system. Using the White House and Camp David for
sleepovers has tarred the presidency and cheapened institutions
that should be above political advantage. Mrs. Clinton can go far
to separate herself from these abuses if she can accept a fair deal
on soft money.

GORE GIVES WALL STREET THE JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Jerry Heaster  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   While the Stock Trader's Almanac reveals
September as the worst month of the year for investors over the
past half-century, there doesn't appear to be any common factor
involved in the month's historically bad showing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thus, in the 27 Septembers since 1950 during which the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index registered a loss, it must be assumed that
transient rather than cyclical factors were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts of the conservative persuasion think they've
already identified the cause of this September's stock market
swoon.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as they see it, is the increasing strength shown by
Al Gore in voter polls combined with the vice president's
relentless attacks on Big Business. Since the Labor Day weekend
kickoff of the presidential election campaign, September has become
a downer for all the major indices: Measured from their September
highs established early this month, the Dow Jones industrial
average is down 4 percent, the S&AMP;P 500 is off 4.7 percent and the
Nasdaq has plunged 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kudlow, a Wall Street economist and policy aide in the
Reagan administration, has accused Gore of liking jobs but not the
businesses that create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes prosperity,'' Kudlow said in a recent commentary.
``He just doesn't want anyone to get rich.'' The perceived
contradictions of Gore's message, he says, jeopardize the 18-year
bull market. Kudlow, who has taken to calling Gore the aspiring
``regulator in chief,'' says Gore's campaign theme of ``the people
against the powerful'' makes it clear a Gore presidency will be
characterized by a heavy hand on business activity.
</P>
<P>
   As polls show improving prospects not only for Gore but also for
Democrats attempting to regain a House majority, investor jitters
have intensified accordingly, says James K. Glassman, a resident
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman, who is co-author of Dow 36,000, differs somewhat from
Kudlow in that he thinks the market could live with a Gore
presidency if it occurred in the context of divided-government
gridlock. Glassman, writing in The Wall Street Journal this week,
said his research showed the market had performed best since the
mid-1970s when one party controlled the White House while the other
controlled Congress.

   During one-party control, he said, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose an average of only 2.3 percent annually. When
political power was divided between the White House and Congress,
however, the average yearly gain was nearly 24 percent.

   ``Gridlock is good,'' Glassman avers. ``It has blocked big new
federal programs, new taxes, and new agencies, departments and
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Although nobody believes what happens in Washington is the
be-all, end-all for stock prices, Glassman says his research proves
conclusively that what happens in Washington ``has a huge effect on
stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be, of course, that Wall Streeters are worried
needlessly. Perhaps the race is closer than recent polls indicate.
Even so, politics aside, here's something else to keep in mind: The
stock market is a leading economic indicator, and the bias has been
down for six months.

EDITORIAL: APPROVAL FOR RU-486  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce a
decision next week on the fate of RU-486, the abortion pill that
can offer women a safe, non-invasive alternative to surgical
abortion. The agency faces a Sept. 30 deadline on whether to give
final marketing approval for the drug, call for a delay of action
or deny approval.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 would be a crucial breakthrough in abortion access in
this country because it can be administered by primary care doctors
in communities where surgical abortion services are nonexistent.
Patients with RU-486 prescriptions would no longer need to travel
to clinics that are targets of abortion protests. Not surprisingly,
anti-abortion groups have vehemently opposed FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   There is overwhelming evidence of RU-486's safety and
effectiveness in a decade of use by more than 500,000 women in
Europe and in clinical trials in this country. It is time the FDA
allowed women access to this important medical option without
unnecessary restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486, also known as mifepristone, was determined by the FDA in
1996 to be safe and effective in terminating early pregnancies when
used with another already approved drug called misoprostol. But
RU-486 cannot be marketed until the FDA resolves some
manufacturing, labeling and distribution concerns. Those issues are
being negotiated between the agency and Danco Laboratories, the
group that seeks to market the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year there was considerable concern among
pro-choice groups that the FDA would impose strict distribution
limits on RU-486. The FDA was said to want only doctors who can
perform surgical abortions to prescribe RU-486. Another proposal
was to require prescribing doctors to have admitting privileges at
hospitals within an hour of their offices. Such restrictions would
greatly limit use of the drug, and do not seem medically necessary.
The FDA should approve RU-486 promptly without restrictions that
undermine broad access.

EDITORIAL: THE WOUNDED EURO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Friday's surprising decision by the United States to join with
Japan and Europe in propping up the euro will not heal the ailing
new currency, but it was a gesture worth making.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's slide poses no grave threat to the world economy.
Indeed, by cutting the cost of buying European goods, it helps
American consumers and travelers to Europe. A lower euro does make
American goods more expensive for Europeans to buy, hurting sales
of American exports. But the American economy, according to the
Federal Reserve, is in danger of overheating and needs no extra
assist from more exports.
</P>
<P>
   But the sagging euro has seriously hurt some American
industries. It also hurts European consumers by driving up the
price of imports and makes the European Central Bank's task of
keeping inflation low that much harder. If, as the finance
ministers believe, the slide of the euro is temporary, then there
is an argument for returning it to its long-term value as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind intervention is that the euro is falling
primarily because currency traders expect it to continue to fall.
Intervention, so the argument goes, can swing currency traders
around to the idea that the euro's slide is ending, inducing them
to buy the euro, thus driving up its price.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, interventions rarely work. The amount of money that
governments are prepared to spend buying euros is tiny compared
with the amounts that private currency traders are prepared to
sell. Interventions can change currency values, but only if they
are tied to changes in government policy. If, for example, the
Federal Reserve had intervened Friday as part of a decision to
drive interest rates lower, investors would start selling dollars
and buying euros. But that was not the Fed's intent in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The best case for intervention is that America's European allies
asked for help. Someday the United States might seek European
assistance to prop up a falling dollar or to rein in a soaring
dollar. If finance ministers feel compelled to help one another
out, there is little danger in trying.

EDITORIAL: GRIDLOCK AT LA GUARDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   New York City's airports are already strained beyond their
limits and crying out for more flights to enhance competition. That
is the conundrum now facing regional and federal transportation
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers complain that there are not enough conveniently
scheduled flights from New York City to places like Buffalo and
Norfolk. Congress passed a law earlier this year allowing airlines
to circumvent long-standing caps on the number of flights out of La
Guardia Airport to fly regional jets to such underserved, or new,
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   But travelers also point out that there are far too many
nightmarish delays at La Guardia. The city and the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey, La Guardia's operator, have moved to
prevent airlines from capitalizing on the legislation and adding as
many as 600 more takeoffs and landings a day at La Guardia.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority informed airlines on Thursday that they could
not add more flights during the airport's two busiest morning and
two busiest evening hours. The authority fears that the airlines
could add up to 50 percent more daily flights to an already
overburdened system, and would like new flights to be scheduled
during off-peak hours. The airlines concede that the airport is
already under tremendous strain, but feel compelled to add the new
flights at prime time to keep up with the competition. They also
claim that the Port Authority has no legal right to ban flights
approved by the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative reportedly being considered by the Port
Authority is a restructuring of fees paid by airlines to reflect
the higher value placed on rush-hour flights. Such a step is worthy
of further study, and could be a means of holding airlines to the
same pricing principles they impose on passengers _ you pay more
for the most convenient flights.
</P>
<P>
   At some airports around the nation, the airlines themselves are
reacting to passengers' ire at recent gridlock by reducing the
number of flights. That is more easily done at hubs already
controlled by one airline, where cutting back does not translate
into a meaningful drop in market share.
</P>
<P>
   At La Guardia, an airport not dominated by any one airline, it
will take the prodding of regulators to both rationalize the
scheduling of existing service and accommodate truly needed new
routes. Whether the Port Authority should be that regulator is not
clear, but it should be applauded for intervening to state the
obvious. Something has to give.

TEEN-AGERS' BRAINS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Mara Rose Williams  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   On the outside, teen-agers appear to be
nearly grown up. But inside the skull, a vital part of their brain
is closer to a child's than an adult's.
<TEXT>
<P>
   New findings in neuroscience and pediatric psychiatry link brain
immaturity to teens making foolish judgments and reckless
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Some teens have sex too soon. Some experiment with drugs and
alcohol. Some see how far their car will fly on a hilly road.
</P>
<P>
   Adults have long been puzzled about why otherwise ``good'' kids
_ smart kids _ take deadly chances. But now scientists have made a
connection. They've discovered that one of the last parts of the
brain to mature is the prefrontal cortex _ the very part
responsible for self-control, judgment, emotional regulation,
organization and planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teen-age brain is a work in progress,'' said Sandra
Witelson, a neuroscientist at McMaster University in Hamilton,
Ontario, who has done research on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The old belief was that by the time a child reached the age of
puberty and pimples, his brain's hardware was completely connected.
</P>
<P>
   But by using magnetic resonance imaging, researchers got
pictures that helped prove that the brain has a good deal of
developing to do well beyond the start of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   The brain does reach about 95 percent of its maturation by age
5. But the corpus callosum, a cable of nerves that connect the
right and left halves of the brain, continues growing beyond
20-something. The corpus callosum is linked to intelligence,
consciousness and self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The prefrontal cortex matures the most between the ages of 12
and 20.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this brew of disconnected neurons a healthy dose of
active hormones spiked with the power of peer pressure and a need
for autonomy. That's a recipe for teen-age behavior that at times
is risky at best.
</P>
<P>
   Leawood resident Barb Kane said she grew up in a small rural
town where there was little to do but test your limits
experimenting with drugs and driving cars too fast.
</P>
<P>
   She said she still thinks about some of the ``just plain stupid
things,'' even dangerous things, she did as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we were doing them, we didn't think about it being
dangerous. You just did it. But as parents now, we stay close to
our kids because we know it's tough being a teen-ager today.
There's a lot out there that's scary, even in the suburbs,'' said
Kane, whose 14-year-old daughter is a freshman at Shawnee Mission
East High School.
</P>
<P>
   The biological root of reckless behavior might provide an answer
for adults who can't understand why hill-hopping accidents have
taken at least 10 lives in the Kansas City area over the last 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent death was that of Mistyka Fiedler, a promising
15-year-old Truman High School student. She was thrown from a car
in which she was riding and run over by another in a Sept. 15
hill-jumping accident on Ringo Road in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 10 deaths occurred in eastern Jackson County.
Alcohol was not a factor in any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Principals at Truman and William Chrisman high schools in
Independence say that year after year, they drill students on the
dangers of hill jumping, drinking and driving, drug and alcohol use
and other risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freshmen take health, and our health classes deal with healthy
lifestyles and decision-making,'' said John Ruddy, principal at
William Chrisman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a teacher advisory program, which links students and
teachers in a non-academic setting so they can talk to kids about
these things. And we do programs like this every year, with each
new crop of students that comes in,'' Ruddy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see as much as anything is that kids have more freedom
than they have ever had before and they may not be ready for that
freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The brain research suggests that Ruddy is right, that teen-agers
must be trained to handle the freedoms they demand.
</P>
<P>
   The research says that after puberty, a pruning process takes
place in the prefrontal cortex. About the age of 10, the prefrontal
cortex goes through a growth spurt when neurons grow new
connections. But those connections die off if they are not used.
</P>
<P>
   The pruning process allows the brain to work more efficiently,
researchers say. But until that process is complete, most young
people don't have all the brain power needed for good judgment.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that many teens cannot walk away from risky
activities when they are being coaxed by their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rapoff, a professor of pediatric psychology at
University of Kansas Medical Center, said most teens lack the
skills to resist peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peer pressure is so powerful that it is difficult to override
it by any lecture from adults,'' Rapoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Into a teen-ager's explosive boil of unbridled emotion and
temptation, he said, must be added the adolescent feeling of
invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he said, ``teen-agers are correct in assuming that
this is not a very likely time for them to die. So they tend to
underestimate risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens, he said, must be trained to handle peer pressure and to
``think before they leap.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapoff advises parents to talk with their teen-agers without
lecturing them. Dialogue and negotiation, he said, makes the
teen-agers part of the learning process.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall 1998 issue of the Journal of American Psychology,
neuropsychologist Deborah Yurgelun-Todd said that good judgment is
learned once teens have the necessary hardware.
</P>
<P>
   With these latest discoveries about the brain, doctors and
educators may have the key to helping teen-agers listen to that
small voice within that repeats past warnings from parents,
teachers or counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prefrontal cortex is a source of knowledge about what is
most important in our lives,'' said Vermont psychiatrist Emma
Bragdon, who has written several papers on adolescent behavior.
``Without kids being able to be in touch with that, they feel life
has no meaning, they can be self destructive or violent toward
others.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of this type of behavior, psychiatrists cite such
extreme aberrant adolescent behavior as the massacre at Columbine
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Bragdon says most kids never come close to committing an act of
violence, but many are involved in risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we did educate to enhance emotion and spiritual
intelligence they would be getting the education they need to
really be in touch with their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragdon explains that emotional intelligence (EQ) and spiritual
intelligence (SQ) join IQ as new measures of intelligence. All
three, she said, are indicators of someone's level of success in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional intelligence is a person's ability to judge the
situation he is in and behave appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritual intelligence allows us to take a perspective beyond
the boundaries of situations: to envision unrealized potentials, to
perceive meaning and unity, to create and transform new
perspectives by integrating all the intelligence of the body, mind
and spirit,'' Bragdon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those skills are not exercised, then a big potential of
that part of the brain is left dormant.''
</P>
<P>
   When teens have spiritual and emotional intelligence, she said,
they make life-affirming decision for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many kids who have developed that part of the brain want to do
things in life that are of service to others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are already engaged in something that makes their life
meaningful, then they are not as apt to push themselves in to
self-destructive behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane, like a lot of other parents of teen-aged children, expect
a time may come when even her ``very level-headed'' teen does
something foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids will make mistakes and bad decisions,'' she said ``The
most we can really do is hope that the mistake they make won't cost
them their life.''

WHITE HOUSE E-MAILS CONFIRM GORE AIDES TREATED COFFEES AS
FUND-RAISERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Retrieved White House e-mail messages turned over
Friday to federal and congressional investigators show that Vice
President Al Gore's senior aides routinely characterized White
House coffee sessions as fund-raising events in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the e-mail messages indicate that the vice
president himself was involved in any of the electronic
conversations, the aides' descriptions of the coffees seem to be at
odds with Gore's comments in an April 18 interview this year with
federal investigators. The vice president said the 103 coffee
gatherings with campaign donors held at the White House before the
1996 election had not been ``fund-raising tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks in the four-hour interview had led a senior
Justice Department prosecutor, Robert Conrad Jr., to recommend that
Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to
investigate the truthfulness of Gore's remarks, but last month,
Reno declined to appoint a special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messages had been subpoenaed by a congressional
committee and the Justice Department investigating allegations of
campaign finance abuses and other matters in the Clinton
administration. Their release Friday came after months of
complaining by members of Congress that the White House was trying
to withhold them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly seized on the contents as evidence that the
vice president and the White House had not been truthful in earlier
explanations of the purpose of the coffees, and an event at a
Buddhist Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., before the 1996
election. And the committee chairman, Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana,
said he would made hold hearings on the newly released
correspondence next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign countered that the e-mail messages were
consistent with earlier explanations of the nature of the coffees
and contained nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Skelton, Gore's political director, asked an aide to the
vice president in an e-mail note dated April 23, 1996: ``These are
F.R. coffees, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday night whether the abbreviation stood for
fund-raising, a White House aide said it could also mean
``finance-related,'' a phrase the vice president himself once used
to describe his appearance at a luncheon at a Buddhist temple in
Los Angeles in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, 1996, Skelton described in an e-mail message the
expectations that the White House had for people invited to coffees
with President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Skelton wrote to an aide, ``but keep in mind that these
people must be justifiable on the basis of what they give us down
the line. What is the consequence of our meeting with one person
other than that person feeling good?''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messages released by the White House are among a
cache of nearly 150,000 messages that the White House failed to
properly archive from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have criticized White House officials
for failing to immediately inform them that they could not retrieve
the messages, a problem the White House attributed to a computer
error in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not revealed to congressional committees
investigating the issue until early this year. Since April,
technicians have methodically retrieved the lost e-mail
correspondence from a computer database.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for Gore, said Friday night that the
e-mail messages contain information that had already been provided
three years earlier to several congressional investigative
committees, including the House panel led by Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing significant here in response to Dan Burton's
25 subpoenas,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that in the April interview with federal
investigators, the vice president acknowledged that White House
coffee guests were often solicited to contribute to the Democratic
Party after attending one of the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president testified seven times in April that
attendees would likely be asked at a later date to financially
support the DNC, and that is completely consistent with these
e-mails,'' Kennedy said. ``There is nothing in any of this material
that sheds any new light on old arguments, all of which have been
fully investigated for years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the communications director for Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, said the e-mail notes are ``another piece of
evidence that calls into question the vice president's credibility
when he says he did not know that a fund-raising event was a
fund-raising event.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, on Friday Burton vowed to make the newly released
e-mail messages an issue at a hearing scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Reno decided not to seek the appointment of a special
counsel to investigate Gore, she said, ``I have concluded that
there is no reasonable possibility that further investigation could
develop evidence that would support the filing of charges for
making a willful false statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said: ``At the time the attorney general made this
statement, did she have these e-mails? Many of them come from the
vice president's office and deal directly with the White House
fund-raising coffees and the Hsi Lai Temple fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House first released the documents this afternoon to
The Associated Press, not long after White House aides released a
lengthy list of recent overnight guests at the White House and Camp
David. In 1997, the White House routinely released campaign
documents late on Friday afternoon so it would be published in
Saturday newspapers when readership is often thought to be
lightest. Aides refused to say whether the simultaneous release of
the material was intended to minimize its impact.
</P>
<P>
   Some messages deal with Gore's luncheon at the Hsi Lai Temple.
But many of those notes are excerpts of memorandums that had been
previously turned over to congressional investigators and made
public. Several e-mail messages again demonstrate that Gore aides
may have been confused about two fund-raisers that had been
originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, we are committed in San Jose and L.A. for
fund-raising events,'' one staff e-mail note said about the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the schedule for Gore prepared nearly three weeks before the
temple luncheon did not mention a fund-raising event at a Los
Angeles area restaurant. After arriving in Los Angeles at 11 a.m.,
Gore was scheduled to proceed to the Hsi Lai Temple event, which
was described at the time as a Democratic National Committee
``Asian Pacific American Leadership Council Luncheon.''
</P>
<P>
   Another e-mail note recommended that Gore bring $20 with him to
the temple so he could make a donation of his own. ``The VP will
need to have some cash on hand,'' a message said, ``to offer as an
offering at the Buddhist temple in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   James Wilson, the chief counsel of the House Committee on
Government Reform, said Friday night that he was ``particularly
frustrated'' by the cache of e-mail messages that the committee
received this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is new information and new leads that need to be
investigated,'' Wilson said. ``The White House covered this up for
over three years and that is simply not acceptable.''

Economics has something to do with their choices. None of them can

stalemate between BMW and Volkswagen AG, which both wanted to buy
Rolls-Royce two years ago, he has to wait until 2003, when
Volkswagen will relinquish control over the celebrated name. Until
BMW acquires the name, Kalbfell is not supposed to even pose in

AS INDEXES FALL, SOME MUSINGS ON THE DOWNSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By   JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the last week of the third quarter begins, the three major
stock indexes are down for the year. If they finish the quarter
this way, it will be the first time since 1990 that all three have
been down at this time of the year. So let's think some bearish
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the threats to the stock market is the retirement of the
baby boomers. As they leave the work force, will they also choose
less risk, moving money from stocks into bonds?
</P>
<P>
   Paddy Jilek, the director of U.S. economics at Credit Suisse
First Boston, thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that the life-expectancy data shows that people
who are retiring at 65 can now expect to live to 75 or 80. That
makes it difficult to say when retirees' investment horizons will
shorten enough to make them demand investments that are less risky
than stocks. Still, he said, ``eventually the baby boomers will
become risk averse like every retiree, and that means, ther things
being equal, the stock market could struggle over a 10-year
period.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first baby boomers, the age of 65 doesn't come for 10
years. So what's the worry?
</P>
<P>
   Jilek thinks that the previous generation, which is reaching 65
now, is ready to begin making the portfolio shift to less risky
assets like bonds. And he argues that this group, which dates from
1935 _ 10 years before the beginning of the baby boom generation _
was the pace setter at two other crucial points for markets.
</P>
<P>
   One was the surge in home buying that he believes reached its
inflection point around 1965, while many baby boomers were still in
grade school. Before then, housing prices had been falling,
relative to the Consumer Price Index. Afterward, housing prices
began to rise in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   The second key point was at the beginning of the 1980s. That,
Jilek argued, was when this older group began the accumulation of
financial assets to help pay for college educations for their
children and eventual retirement for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If this group is leading the way again, investors may have more
to worry about now than they are aware of. ``A sprinkle now, a
drizzle soon, and a torrent in 15 year's time,'' Jilek wrote in a
recent report on this issue. ``It's the sprinkle that marks the
inflection point relative to asset prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Jilek thinks that there is another threat to the stock market _
one that means it may not be able to match the wonderful returns of
the last half of the 1990s. If it coincides with the shift of risk
preference by those born in 1935 who are now retiring, it could
aggravate the portfolio shift away from equities, putting downward
pressure on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That threat, he says, is from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Jilek argued that foreign demand for U.S. stocks
played a crucial role in the second half of the 1990s _ and that a
switch in sentiment could hurt. In 1999, according to Federal
Reserve data, foreign investment funds bought a net $98.1 billion
of U.S. stocks. That number has taken off this year, despite the
poor performance of the major stock indexes. Net purchases surged
to $176.4 billion in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stock has also been gobbled up in the form of foreign
acquisitions of U.S. companies. There were about $153 billion in
cross-border deals in 1999, almost double the $78 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So with the stock market in a position it has not seen for a
decade, think of influences that go beyond corporate earnings,
whose growth appears to be slowing, and whether the Federal Reserve
is finished raising interest rates for this cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it is not a factor tomorrow, Jilek said, it would be
wise to be a little more cautious about the potential for stocks in
the years ahead. ``I think it is an issue you really need to keep
in mind,'' he added. ``It's there all the time and can be a pretty
powerful force.''  &QL;

THE CASE OF THE PHANTOM SALES LOGGED BY MITSUBISHI MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Ore., Fla., Ga., Japan)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By MARCIA RUFF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, it has sometimes seemed that if it wasn't for
bad news, there would be little news at all for Mitsubishi. For
several years, the company was dogged by complaints of sexual
harassment in its Normal, Ill., assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the president of the Japanese parent company resigned
over illegal payments to gangsters. His successor, Katsuhiko
Kawasoe, announced his resignation this month after the company was
embarrassed by reports that it had concealed customer complaints
for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Things were looking up, though, for the U.S. sales operation,
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, which broke even in 1998 for the
first time in a decade. Profits have risen since then, with sales
expected to reach 300,000 this year, up from 190,515 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But then last week, Automotive News, the industry's leading
trade publication, published an article that said the company had
falsified sales records and possibly jeopardized customer
warranties.
</P>
<P>
   The article portrayed deception unfolding like scenes from
``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' David Mamet's play about desperate, amoral
salesmen. In late-night sessions at regional headquarters in
Orlando, Fla., regional sales managers entered false sales data,
seeking to inflate their total to meet corporate objectives and
outsell other regions, the article said. The managers entered names
like Patty O. Furniture, Bud Weiser and Supa Mann as the buyers of
cars on dealers' lots. Automotive News quoted an unidentified
source as saying that thousands of cars had been ``sold'' this way.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers never knew about the fake sales until a legitimate buyer
wanted the car _ and the dealer would find it listed on the
computerized inventory as sold, Automotive News reported. The
region would then ``back out'' the false sale and enter information
about the real buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi concedes that false sales were entered, but said the
numbers were in the hundreds, not the thousands. The company said
it began an investigation after a sales manager in Atlanta reported
the falsifications in May. Memos went out condemning the practice,
and regional sales managers were barred from entering sales data.
</P>
<P>
   The article also raised the issue of whether the legitimate
buyers might lose warranty coverage if their cars had been reported
as sold at an earlier date. Automotive News reported that the
warranty clock started with the false sale, not the actual sale.
But a Mitsubishi spokesman, Kim Custer, said the warranties start
from the date of delivery to the customer. In the normal course of
business, information about an actual sale would overwrite any
false data.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the integrity of the company's sales totals, Custer
said any cars sold falsely ultimately went out the door as
legitimate sales. To maintain the accuracy of its database, the
company periodically asks auditors to compare its records with
title registrations, which represent actual ales. For 1999,
Mitsubishi said the auditor found a 5 percent discrepancy, which it
said was within the norm for its automotive clients.
</P>
<P>
   Overzealous sales reporting has a long history in the business.
Art Spinella of CNW Marketing/Research, in Bandon, Ore., said,
``Falsifying sales records has been going on for years and years
and years, and has been done in a whole raft of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is done for bragging rights. Cadillac lost face two
years ago when it claimed sales leadership for 1998 over its
archrival, Lincoln, only to back down a few weeks later when
independent figures showed that Cadillac had come up short.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the falsifications are done for money. If a dealership
or salesman is a few units short of reaching a target for a bonus,
the temptation is great to fudge the sale of a few cars, which
would then be sold for real the next month.
</P>
<P>
   From a customer's perspective, the risk of having a warranty
jeopardized this way is low. It is wise, however, to double-check
the date of delivery on your car's records when you buy it and when
you bring it in for the first service. &QL;

THE SMITH IN THE SHADOW AT GM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Mass., Calif., Spain)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is an early September morning at the Four Seasons
Hotel, and Manhattan's power brokers are back from their summer
vacations, posturing over caffe lattes and toast in the hotel
restaurant, bragging about their latest deals. Among them, in this
cavernous I.M. Pei room, Michael T. Smith sits quietly, picking at
an egg-white omelet.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the mild-mannered chairman and chief executive of Hughes
Electronics, hardly stands out among the Armani-clad bankers and
other Upper East Side prima donnas. But for 14 years, Smith, now
56, has had a substantial role in transforming Hughes, once an
anchor of Southern California's military industry, into a
technology powerhouse and the third-largest provider of pay
television in the United States, behind AT&AMP;T and Time Warner. Its
best-known venture, DirecTV, already has more than nine million
subscribers who receive programming in their homes using
pizza-sized satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   But the obscurity that he so enjoys, despite having held his
titles since 1997, is about to end. General Motors, which acquired
his company, the former Hughes Aircraft, in 1985 and still owns 100
percent of the company's assets (pay no attention to that tracking
stock), is now seeking a partner for it. Several possible suitors
have emerged, most notably Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Disney and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is well positioned to negotiate. He was part of the GM
team that brokered the Hughes acquisition 15 years ago. More
important, he has the ear of John F. Smith Jr., the GM chairman,
who is also his older brother. The two have never truly worked
together, Michael Smith said. They climbed the ranks independently,
he said, and when the board named him to lead Hughes, his brother
declined to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith appears happy to remain relatively unknown. ``I've
always distinguished between rainmakers and doers,'' he said, his
voice still thick with the accent he developed while growing up
near Boston. ``A lot of people make headlines, but they don't
really achieve anything.''
</P>
<P>
   His subdued demeanor is unusual in an era when chief executives,
especially of technology companies, are hailed as celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a charismatic leader,'' said Harry Pearce, the vice
chairman of GM, who has known him for 13 years. That sentiment is
echoed by Smith's wife, Jane. ``If he came into a room, he's not
the one who makes a big scene that he's there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just the personality needed to soothe Hughes
engineers who, when the company was owned by Howard Hughes, worked
for years on projects free from demanding managers. ``Because he
does things in a low-key way, they aren't intimidated,'' Pearce
said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened in 1990, when Smith brought in a
consultant to evaluate which of Hughes' technologies were worth
pursuing. ``He called them a bunch of underachievers and that set
off a rocket,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made his point in a quieter way. He called a meeting and
laid out several goals. If the engineers, virtually all of them
Hughes shareholders, met them, he explained, Hughes' stock price
would grow fourfold. ``That got them focused on what they needed to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1943, Smith was one of four children in an Irish family.
He spent afternoons at his family's ice cream shops, scooping
cones. Like most other young boys in the neighborhood, he played
ice hockey, paying $15 a day to practice at the local ice rink.
Summer weekends were spent at a rented New Hampshire cabin where
his aunts, uncles and cousins gathered. In 1965, he graduated from
Providence College with a degree in political science.
</P>
<P>
   Having belonged to the Reserve Officers Training Corps in
college, Smith joined the Army as an intelligence officer. In 1966,
during the Vietnam War, he spent his days roaming the South
Vietnamese countryside interviewing villagers and looking for enemy
camps. On Christmas Day in 1966, he recalled, a plane crashed in a
village not far from an airport near Danang. When Smith went with a
doctor and engineer to assess the damage, he saw that the crash had
exposed a chain of tunnels built by enemy sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the village were scared,'' he said. But not
because they were found out. ``They were homeless.'' As he learned,
``There was a human side to the war.'' Such experiences helped him
identify with other people's circumstances and their stakes in an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife first met him at a high school dance, she was not
struck by his presence. But she noticed his quiet distinctiveness.
``I loved his sweater, a cardigan,'' Smith said, noting that she
still has it. ``It had multicolors and was different. He's an
individualist.'' She laughed as she remembered the moment, adding,
``He's not motivated by what other people think.'' The two were
married in 1966. They have had three children; one of them died
recently in a hiking accident.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after two years in Vietnam, Smith joined GM, earning
$7,800 a year working at the same plant in Framingham, Mass., where
his brother had worked. His first job was in the accounting
department, collecting workers' punched time cards and calculating
their hours. Three years later, having earned an MBA from Babson
College at night, he moved to Detroit and joined the GM finance
team. Then came New York City and Spain, before his return to
Detroit in 1982 as assistant controller of the company. In 1986,
after GM acquired Hughes, he went to El Segundo, Calif., where the
company was based, to be its chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was quiet about the plans for Hughes, except to say, ``I'm
not ready to retire.'' But it is clear that he would like his own
future to include more time in the sun. ``When you leave a place
like Michigan'' for a place like Southern California, he said,
``you never think of snow again.'' &QL;

A CAMEL FOR WILDERNESS EXPLORATION,   TWO HUMPS INCLUDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Japan)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By LEONARD M. APCAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESTES PARK, Colo. _ I am at the wheel of the freshly redesigned
2001 Mitsubishi Montero, doing what most people never do in
off-road-capable sport utility vehicles: I am driving it off road.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, I am on Old Fall River Road in Rocky Mountain
National Park. The nine-mile gravel path zigzags up a narrow
mountain valley to a treeless tundra with heartstopping views.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guardrails, and the turns are so tight that
vehicles longer than 25 feet should stay back at camp. But the
Montero, at just under 16 feet, neuvers nicely, and its
rack-and-pinion steering _ rare for a mountain goat like this _ as
well as its unusual transmission are making pretty easy work of the
terrain even at power-sapping altitudes of 8,500 to nearly 12,000
feet. With the sunroof peeled back, the pines and aspens within
reach, this is truly a ride on the edge of the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Montero is not truly about off-road treks in the
highlands. While Mitsubishi likes to advertise its dirt-digging
prowess, the latest Montero, full of leather and luxury, has been
designed more for the Hamptons than for the Himalayas. Like just
about every vehicle in this $32,000-to-$36,000 segment, the ride
has been re-engineered to feel more like a car's than a camel's.
The appointments are more luxurious and the third row of seats,
which is standard, does a neat, four-step disappearing act into the
cargo floor.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Montero's famously boxy look has been given a
little flair. The front fenders have new humps, and the rear flanks
have been puffed out to form beefier haunches.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is not a handsome wrap. The large grille and
squared-off side windows don't mesh well with rounded fenders that
look like cartoonish afterthoughts. A young boy stepped forward
during my test drive and asked the name of the red truck.
``Montero?'' he said, mangling the pronunciation. ``Kind of ugly,
especially right here,'' he said, jabbing at one of the humps.
</P>
<P>
   Looks may not be the only aspect to give a buyer pause.
Mitsubishi confessed this summer to concealing complaints and
defects about its vehicles in Japan going back more than 20 years.
While I encountered no troubles with this test truck _ and none of
the defects in Japan are related to Monteros sold in this country _
Mitsubishi cars and trucks have received mixed reviews in
product-quality surveys. DaimlerChrysler has invested in the
company and installed its own operating chief to improve
Mitsubishi's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Humps aside, the Montero stands out in two other respects, which
partly explain its strong sales since it was introduced in March.
One is its disappearing third seat. The other is its new Sportronic
automatic, a transmission that allows drivers to shift manually,
but without a clutch, through five speeds in both rear-drive or
three distinct four-wheel-drive modes, including a full-time
all-wheel-drive setting. Up and especially down the mountain roads
of north central Colorado, this was a brake-saving delight. It also
provided much better coordination between the gearbox and the
engine because the transmission, on its own, shifted often as it
hunted for the appropriate gear in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Sportronic is standard on the Montero Limited, which starts at
$35,517. A less expensive XLS, without leather and the fancy
gearbox, starts at around $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   Third-row seats are a popular SUV feature, especially for
customers who want the room and flexibility of a minivan, but don't
want to be seen driving one. The Montero's extra seat is a big
improvement over the jump seats the truck used to have, which
folded to the side when you needed them out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big SUVs, the Dodge Durango has a nicely designed
third seat. G.M. put an even better one in its slightly larger
Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, and Ford plans one for its 2002
Explorer, due out next year. Even the next generation of the
smaller GMC Envoy and Chevy Blazer will come in stretched versions
with third seats. In mid-November, Toyota will begin selling its
Sequoia, which also has a third row.
</P>
<P>
   The standard Montero third-row seat is a narrow bench that
barely holds two children and has precious little legroom. There
are two shoulder straps with the seat belts, and the side windows
pop out for ventilation. With the seat up, I was able to stow a
backpack and a few carry-ons behind it. There was also extra space
below the floor. Best of all, there was room for each of my two
children to have a row of his or her own. In all, there was seating
for seven.
</P>
<P>
   When I needed to pack up for the ride home, it was easy to fold
the seat and flop it into a compartment below the floor. That
opened up plenty of room for about 10 bags, including two big
suitcases and a set of golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the tight space, the air-conditioning didn't quite reach
the far-back seat. Separate automatic climate control, rear air
controls and a second blower are a $900 option.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the Montero was pretty well behaved, and road and
wind noise were modest for a truck. It navigated hairpin turns at
40 mph with composure. The four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes were
sure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most trucks at this price have V-8 engines under the hood, and
while the Montero's 3.5-liter, 200-horsepower V-6 will not win any
prizes for brute force, it felt surprisingly strong on the highway
and on city streets. Although the engine has been improved to
provide better pickup at lower speeds _ peak torque is 235
foot-pounds at 3,000 rpm _ it was both puzzling and humiliating to
be overtaken by a Dodge minivan as we galloped up a mountain pass.
The Montero was cranking out 5,000 rpm, but the minivan beat us to
the top. The Montero's V-6 generally limits towing capability to
1,500 pounds, compared with around 6,000 pounds for a Ford Explorer
or Expedition.
</P>
<P>
   While the Montero had plenty of smart touches, it also had its
quirks. The side mirrors are rectangles mounted vertically instead
of horizontally, the more common practice. The idea is that it will
pass more easily through tight spaces, but it also narrows the view
to the rear and makes blind spots larger.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the rear tailgate opens wide like a refrigerator door, not
up like a liftgate. This is fine in the wide-open West and made
loading very easy. But imagine trying to open the back end in a
tight space in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there were some details that were strangely missing
from a vehicle that wanted to offer every luxury and up-to-date
touch. While there were dual air bags in the dash and side bags in
the front seats, there was no shoulder strap or headrest for the
center spot in the second row.
</P>
<P>
   The Montero Limited has mirrors in the sun visors, but they are
not lighted, despite the vehicle's luxury pretensions. The rear
side windows do not open fully and the front passenger seat is not
available with power adjustments. One other flaw: The only
indicator of whether the air-conditioning is cranking is an
impossibly tiny light on the blower knob that is difficult to see
on a bright day.
</P>
<P>
   Such details may not mean a lot to other drivers. But with the
most luxurious leather version topping $36,000, the Montero
shouldn't be missing much.
</P>

FISET HURTS KNEE IN CLOSE LOSS TO DUCKS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ As if things aren't bad enough for the Los
Angeles Kings. Goaltender Stephane Fiset suffered a sprained left
knee midway through the first period of the Kings' 3-2 exhibiton
loss to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks in front of 11,237 at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings already were playing without Jozef Stumpel, who has
missed training camp in a contract dispute. Then, their top player
Rob Blake resigned his captaincy, also over trying to reach a new
deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, who did not allow a goal in his first two games, left the
ice with nine minutes left after former King Dan Bylsma
inadvertenly ran into him during a scramble in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset got to his feet and began flexing his left leg.
Eventually, he eventually skated off under his own power.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset will be reevaluted today. The Kings play tonight in
Bakersfield against San Jose. Jamie Storr is expected to start in
goal with Steve Passmore and Travis Scott also available.
</P>
<P>
   While things were downright dark in Los Angeles, it appears the
power is back on in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks won their second consecutive exhibition game after
three straight losses. But more importantly, Anaheim finally found
a way to take advantage of the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim scored not once, but twice in an 85-second power-play
binge that turned a tie game into a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' Paul Kariya stuck in a rebound from a Steve Rucchin
shot to end the streak of power-play failures at 38 in a row.
Kariya's goal came with Anaheim holding a 4-on-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Murray's power-play goal midway through the second period
brought the Kings to within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks top goaltender Guy Hebert made his preseason debut Friday.
Hebert was slowed by a strained groin muscle.
</P>

DODGERS VS. PADRES: RAIN DELAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Friday will not go down as the smoothest of nights
for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   First they learned the Mets had already won to further reduce
their dwindling wild-card hopes. Then promising right-hander Eric
Gagne was forced to leave the game when a comebacker left him with
a bruised right wrist. And then an unexpected light rain fell,
causing two delays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Mabry's RBI double in the top of the seventh
gave the San Diego Padres a 3-2 lead before the game was stopped
for the second time in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered the game with a nifty little scoreless
streak going, having not allowed a run in their past 19 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres ended all that before Gagne could record an out.
Second baseman Damian Jackson opened with a walk before light-
hitting shortstop Desi Relaford jumped on Gagne's second offering,
driving it over the right-field fence for a quick 2-0 San Diego
lead. It was Relaford's fifth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers threatened in the bottom of the inning when Tom
Goodwin singled and Mark Grudzielanek was hit by a Jay Witasick
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Witasick, a former Kansas City Royal facing Los Angeles for
the first time, avoided trouble by striking out the heart of the
Dodgers' order _ Shawn Green, Eric Karros and Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got one back, however, in a hurry in the second.
Chris Donnels, again starting in left for Gary Sheffield (back
sprain), jumped on a Witasick offering, sending it out to
straight-away center.
</P>
<P>
   It was Donnels' fourth home run in 27 at-bats for the Dodgers,
which, it turns out, is a career high. Donnels spent small parts of
five seasons in the majors, before spending the last four playing
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a 2-1 game in the top of the fourth when Gagne was
hit on the wrist by the comebacker from little-used Padre
outfielder Kory DeHaan.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne snapped his hand in pain, picked up the ball and threw
late to first as he fell backwards. He was examined by trainer Stan
Johnston and, after a couple of throws to test the wrist, was
allowed to remain in the game to face Witasick.
</P>
<P>
   Homeplate umpire Randy Marsh lost track of the count to Witasick
and awarded him first on what was actually a 3-2 count. But the
Dodgers took that opportunity to lift Gagne and bring on rookie
Luke Prokopec.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne is scheduled to have precautionary X-rays this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Prokopec threw one pitch for a ball to complete the walk to
Witasick and got Jackson to fly to left for the second out, before
Marsh called the rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Three times the grounds crew started to take the tarp off,
before just enough more rain fell to send it back on the field.

   Somewhere, William Gaddis is smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis, who died in 1998, brought four acclaimed novels into the
world, including ``The Recognitions'' and ``A Frolic of His Own.''
But after last week, his monumental ``J.R.'' comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sprawling comic novel he published in 1975. The
book's eponymous anti-hero, a grubby 11-year-old boy, builds a
business empire by wheeling and dealing in penny stocks and bonds
from the pay phone at his middle school. Gaddis described the boy's
creed as ``get all you can.'' The novel won the first of the
author's two National Book Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the book's complexity _ and daunting 725-page length _
the message was simple: In an age when corporate executives act
like greedy children, greedy children can be corporate executives.
At the time, the picaresque J.R. seemed like the stuff of purest
fantasy: parable, not prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Jonathan G. Lebed, the 15-year-old from Cedar
Grove, N.J., who made the front pages last week after the
Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of an illegal stock
manipulation scheme that garnered $272,826. His system? Wheeling
and dealing in penny stocks on the Internet in a classic ``pump and
dump'' cycle, investigators said. Jonathan was accused of buying
thinly traded stocks on his father's brokerage account, touting the
shares in online chat rooms (``the most undervalued stock in
history'') and then selling them after his rumors nudged the
stocks' prices skyward. Jonathan settled with the SEC, neither
admitting nor denying the accusations. But he did agree to pay back
the money he made, with interest.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between J.R. and J.L. are compelling, but Jonathan
appears to have one-upped his fictional predecessor: where Gaddis'
pint-sized protagonist enlisted a hapless teacher to represent him
in his real-world transactions, thanks to the Internet Jonathan was
able to eliminate the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis knew he was a writer ahead of his time. But the courtly
author, who pecked out his works on a portable Olivetti, would have
been stunned by the power of the Internet to enable a teen-ager to
move markets.
</P>
<P>
   What's the point of writing fiction in a world like this? These
are the days of miracles and wonder, as Paul Simon wrote in 1986.
We are living closer than ever to the future, having already been
20,000 leagues under the sea and up to the moon. We own  &UR; personal
 &LR; computers. The Internet has made its way into more than half of
America's homes; the geeks did inherit the earth. Open any given
newspaper and the day's events outpace most fiction on the
weird-o-meter. Scientists at Brandeis University announced last
month that they had created robots that design and build other
robots. Last May, college-age hackers in Manila sent out a ``love
bug'' virus that clogged computer networks around the globe _ a
tale straight out of the gritty works of writers like William
Gibson, Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, science fiction writers may be feeling the greatest
heat. They create literature of escape, but are scrambling to
outrun the present. ``The Nasdaq has become America's most
important science fiction writer,'' said Sterling, a novelist who
lives in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is not impressed with the Lebed case. The part that's
new _ the online element _ is no longer truly new, and the part
that's old is ancient. ``A kid ripping people off over the Internet
isn't that different from the Artful Dodger ripping people off in
Victorian London,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing well about cyberspace is becoming more challenging, he
added, precisely because online technology has been so thoroughly
adopted by society: ``Cyber is your  &UR; uncle's &LR;  job now.''
</P>
<P>
   The future sure isn't what it used to be. In a recent TV
commercial, the actor Avery Brooks (the baritone-voiced captain
from the science fiction series ``Deep Space Nine'') says: ``It is
the year 2000 and I don't see any flying cars! I was promised
flying cars. I don't see any flying cars!  &UR; Why? Why? Why? &LR; '' The
answer, he explains, is that we don't need them, since we can get
such amazing software from, um, IBM. The underlying message: We
might be getting the future we need, even if it's not the one we
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that science fiction authors are looking in
new directions. Stephenson's influential 1999 novel
``Cryptonomicon'' takes place both in the present and in World War
II, where he found rich settings to explore his themes of
communication, code making and code breaking. In ``Distraction: a
Novel,'' Sterling's 1999 political satire, the genetically
engineered hero (associates refer to his lack of an actual mother
or father as his ``personal background problem'') tucks into a
Louisiana dinner that's truly nouvelle: a crawfish modified to grow
as big as a lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling says the coming biotech boom, and the attendant specter
of so-called ``Frankenfoods,'' gives him reason to believe there's
plenty left to write about. ``The bio thing looks a lot rockier
than the cyber thing,'' he says. The pleasure in his voice is
delicious.

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Hugo Chavez spent his first 18 months as
president of Venezuela consolidating his power on the domestic
front. Now, with the price of oil nearing $40 a barrel and OPEC
scheduled to gather here this week for a conference of its heads of
state, he is about to step out onto the world stage in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with Venezuela's president, a 46-year-old
former paratrooper who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt,
the experience promises to be overwhelming. When it comes to
international relations, Chavez is a whirlwind of ideas, plans and
visions (as he is with every other subject that interests him), and
many of these are intended to reshape the world order. This leaves
him often critical of or even hostile to U.S. positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela is just too small for him,'' said Michael Shifter,
senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based
policy analysis group. ``He fancies himself as a regional and
hemispheric leader, wants to play a major role on the global stage,
and is testing the limits of how far he can go in terms of pushing
his ideas and showing off his posture in global politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ambitions may seem messianic and way out of proportion in a
country of modest size and huge economic and social problems. But
Venezuela has twice as many people as Cuba, and Chavez has a pair
of arrows in his quiver that his friend and mentor Fidel Castro
could never claim: the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East
and a long history as a main supplier of gasoline and heating oil
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That situation of mutual dependence gives Venezuela considerable
leverage in its dealings with the United States, and Chavez, by
arranging to have his energy minister named the president of OPEC,
has been skillful in using oil as an instrument of foreign policy.
As befits a former soldier, his own view of the world and how it
should be shaped is strongly colored by geopolitical and strategic
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 20th century was a bipolar century, but the 21st is not
going to be unipolar,'' he vowed in a speech here in August. ``The
21st century should be multipolar, and we all ought to push for the
development of such a world. So long live a united Asia, a united
Africa, a united Europe.``
</P>
<P>
   On this, as in several other areas, Chavez's views are similar
to those of one of his early advisers, a neo-fascist Argentine
theorist named Norberto Ceresole, who contends that Latin America
must forge alliances with the Middle East and Asia to
counterbalance the power of the United States and what he (but not
Chavez) calls ``the Jewish financial mafia.'' In its opposition to
American hegemony, this view has something in common with those of
countries like France and above all China, with whom Chavez has
sought closer ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soviet power has collapsed, but that does not mean that
neoliberal capitalism has to be the model followed by the peoples
of the West,'' he said during a visit to Beijing last fall. ``If
only for that reason, we invite China to keep its flag flying,
because this world cannot be run by a universal police force that
seeks to control everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In more concrete terms, Chavez believes that ``his mission in
the world is to restore some sort of equilibrium that favors less
developed countries,'' said Janet Kelly, a professor at the
Institute of Higher Administrative Studies in Caracas who is
working on a book about Venezuelan-American relations. ``When you
combine that with his liking of the center stage, it means he is
going to be acting constantly to promote any movement in the world
that goes against what he would perceive as the U.S.-dominated
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to pursuing that goal is closer ties with what he calls
``our 10 partners, friends and brothers in OPEC.'' In August,
Chavez visited all the OPEC countries to invite their leaders to
the summit meeting this week, raising hackles in Washington when he
became the first head of state to call on Saddam Hussein in Baghdad
since the gulf war and when, during a stop in Libya, he described
Moammar Gadhafi as his ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``In geopolitical terms, the OPEC tour was masterful,'' said
Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Program at Johns
Hopkins University. ``It demonstrated that Venezuela was not just a
Latin American backwater.'' He added that while the State
Department may have complained about the Iraq trip, ``more people
in the Third World now know about Chavez than they do about any
other Latin American leader except Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's relationship with the Cuban leader is complex. While he
said last year that Venezuela and Cuba are swimming together
``towards the same sea of happiness and of real social justice and
peace,'' he also seems to realize that Castro's star has faded,
leaving a vacuum that he, with all his eloquence, exuberance and
personal warmth, can perhaps fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is admiration for Fidel, but it is linked not so much to
Cuba's domestic system, which I do not think Chavez is interested
in trying out, as it is adopting some of Fidel's style, such as the
David against Goliath stance and the sense of humor that galls the
other side,'' Kelly said. ``He is more a student of Fidel the
defiant than Fidel the Communist.'' Like Castro, Chavez seems to
enjoy nothing more than tweaking the United States, which
Washington, in a reflection of Venezuela's importance as an oil
supplier, thus far has generally endured with patience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there are real policy differences, too. Chavez has withdrawn
the Venezuelan military from regional naval exercises in the
Caribbean and refused to allow U.S. planes monitoring drug
trafficking to fly in Venezuelan airspace. Washington's decision to
use $1.3 billion to support Colombia's government in its war
against guerrillas and drug dealers promises to make the
relationship even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Chavez's former associates accuse him of supplying guns
to leftist Colombian insurgents known as the FARC. He has denied
that, but has also made it clear that he dislikes the
U.S.-sponsored Plan Colombia, warning that it may lead to ``the
Vietnamization of the entire Amazon region'' and describing the
helicopters Washington is sending to the Colombian government as
``death machines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, Hugo Chavez and his government are on the side of
the FARC,'' Richard Gott writes in ``The Shadow of the Liberator:
The Impact of Hugo Chavez on Venezuela and Latin America'' (Verso),
a new and flattering biography. ``Chavez wants the FARC to win, or
at any rate to be so successful in the peace negotiations that its
incorporation into the government will entirely change the
political complexion of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's principal intellectual hero is Simon Bolivar, the hero
of South American independence who dreamed of and fought for a
united continent. Chavez has argued for the formation of a South
Atlantic Treaty Organization, a Latin American counterpart to the
International Monetary Fund and a single currency for all of South
America, but he clearly wants more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a reunified America, of a Bolivarian America, has
arisen again,'' he said in a speech in July on the Liberator's
birthday. And to Hugo Chavez, there is a natural leader of that
movement _ himself.

<P>
   In Russia, rulers don't just fight to take or keep power. They
also fight to make sure they don't have to share it. This was true
for the czars, it was true for the Communist Party and, so far, it
seems to be true for President Vladimir Putin, who came to the
Kremlin by way of the KGB and its successor agency, the FSB, where
he learned to look on people as either patriots or traitors.
</P>
<P>
   This trait has been most apparent in his dealings with the
media, where Putin, more than his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, seems
determined to bring wayward journalists and media barons onto his
team.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Dorenko, arguably Russia's most famous and most
controversial television journalist, is no stranger to the power
games that pass for politics in Russia. A one-time anchorman and
board member at ORT, the country's largest channel, he has been on
both sides: a victim when he was summarily tossed off the air two
years ago by Yevgeny Primakov, who was then prime minister, and a
victimizer who has used his prime-time weekly program to mock,
condemn, expose and generally excoriate members of the anti-Kremlin
opposition (who happen to include Primakov).
</P>
<P>
   But since early summer, Dorenko has put distance between himself
and the Putin Kremlin. He criticized the arrest of the media baron
Vladimir Gusinsky in June, and in August he broadcast interviews
with angry relatives of the sailors who died when the submarine
Kursk sank. Two weeks ago, his regular Saturday night program was
suddenly yanked from the air, on what he is certain were orders
from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference a few days later, Dorenko gave an account
of his firing, and of his dealings with Putin over the last year,
that was extraordinary in its detail. The account was one-sided, to
be sure, and the world may never know Putin's version. But
Dorenko's account was accepted in Russia as entirely believable,
which speaks volumes about the skewed relationship between power
and the press in Russia today, less than 10 years after communism's
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko's account almost evokes St. Peter. He was asked three
times to prove his loyalty and three times he ducked, saying he is
too ``cantankerous'' to be on anyone's team. After that, he got no
more chances.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, which was held Sept. 11, Dorenko first
recounted a conversation with Konstantin Ernst, general director of
ORT, on the night before the program was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found me, summoned me and said that my previous program
caused strong indignation in the Kremlin and that it threatened the
ORT channel,'' Dorenko said. ``And that I had to be a patriot of
the channel and I had to make a program which they would like.'' He
said Ernst suggested a pro-Putin show, rather than repeating his
criticism. ``It could even be interesting from a dramatic point of
view,'' he recalled Ernst as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko refused, comparing the strategy to strangling oneself in
order to protect oneself from being strangled. The next day,
Dorenko said, Ernst told him the program would not be broadcast.
``His last words were . . . `As they say in the American movies:
Nothing personal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko, asked if he thought Ernst had acted on instructions
from the Kremlin, warmed to the theme of how power is exercised in
Russia. He went back over his encounters with Putin, who became
president in August after having been named acting president in
January and then winning a March election. ``The first time Putin
invited me to just have a talk with him was in September last year.
I said: `Is it an interview? I am ready' . . . He said: `No, I
wanted only to have a talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two met a second time that month for an interview, and again
on Jan. 15. At that meeting, Acting President Putin told Dorenko he
considered him a member of his team. Dorenko demurred, noting that
team play was not in his nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June, when Gusinsky was put in prison for four days,
Dorenko responded with a dramatic appearance on Gusinsky's NTV,
ORT's rival. He warned that the old ghosts of Russia's
authoritarian past were being called back to life, revived by
secret signals coming from on high.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, according to Dorenko, summoned him soon afterward. ``He
said: `Something's wrong? . . . Something is going on, I
understood, something is going on with you.' I said: `Nothing is
going on, I am still the same.' He said that he thought that we
were people from the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We met one-to-one, it was in the back room, behind his office,
we had tea,'' Dorenko said. `` `We should not sort out relations
like this,''' Dorenko recalled Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on Aug. 29, after the Kursk sank, Dorenko was again
called to the Kremlin and wound up in Putin's office. During this
conversation, Dorenko said, he spoke of his admiration of the
president's ability to fit in with different audiences. `` `But
looking at you I see two people,'' he recalled saying. `` `One of
them has a Patek Philippe watch, and the other one has epaulettes
of the FSB.' He said, `We have the kind of country where it is
always good to have epaulettes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Putin urged Dorenko to stay on at ORT despite recent changes in
ownership. Dorenko, puzzled, asked, ``Am I leaving or did I tell
anybody that I am leaving?'' The president then clarified his
point. ``No, to stay and work as a member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   I SAY: `Vladimir Vladimirovich, I am saying it for the third
time . . . I am not a member of the team, no matter how offensive
it may sound, of anybody's team. I work for my viewer and for the
guy I see in the mirror when I shave and for those who scream at me
demanding to free the bathroom when I am shaving. This is all, here
is my team, it's a small team, a very compact one.' And he said: `I
see you have not made a decision.' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that my arguments were in vain, because he either
did not understand or pretended that he didn't. His last words
were: `Think, don't rush.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know the bureaucrats' logic in general and bureaucrats'
logic in Russia in particular, you have a clear understanding that
after the president says, `Think, don't rush,' no one will dare to
make a decision to take off the air or fire me or do something
against me until he has at least waved his hand. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, it became clear to Dorenko, who knows better than
most how power works in Russia, that its latest czar had indeed
waved his hand. After his program was canceled, Dorenko desperately
tried to reach the president but could not get through, and no one
called him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no answer,'' he said. ``Which is why I think that it
was a serious answer.''

from the Kremlin, warmed to the theme of how power is exercised in
Russia. He went back over his encounters with Putin, who became
president in August after having been named acting president in
January and then winning a March election. ``The first time Putin
invited me to just have a talk with him was in September last year.
I said: `Is it an interview? I am ready' . . . He said: `No, I
wanted only to have a talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two met a second time that month for an interview, and again
on Jan. 15. At that meeting, Acting President Putin told Dorenko he
considered him a member of his team. Dorenko demurred, noting that
team play was not in his nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June, when Gusinsky was put in prison for four days,
Dorenko responded with a dramatic appearance on Gusinsky's NTV,
ORT's rival. He warned that the old ghosts of Russia's
authoritarian past were being called back to life, revived by
secret signals coming from on high.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, according to Dorenko, summoned him soon afterward. ``He
said: `Something's wrong? . . . Something is going on, I
understood, something is going on with you.' I said: `Nothing is
going on, I am still the same.' He said that he thought that we
were people from the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We met one-to-one, it was in the back room, behind his office,
we had tea,'' Dorenko said. `` `We should not sort out relations
like this,''' Dorenko recalled Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on Aug. 29, after the Kursk sank, Dorenko was again
called to the Kremlin and wound up in Putin's office. During this
conversation, Dorenko said, he spoke of his admiration of the
president's ability to fit in with different audiences. `` `But
looking at you I see two people,'' he recalled saying. `` `One of
them has a Patek Philippe watch, and the other one has epaulettes
of the FSB.' He said, `We have the kind of country where it is
always good to have epaulettes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Putin urged Dorenko to stay on at ORT despite recent changes in
ownership. Dorenko, puzzled, asked, ``Am I leaving or did I tell
anybody that I am leaving?'' The president then clarified his
point. ``No, to stay and work as a member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   I SAY: `Vladimir Vladimirovich, I am saying it for the third
time . . . I am not a member of the team, no matter how offensive
it may sound, of anybody's team. I work for my viewer and for the
guy I see in the mirror when I shave and for those who scream at me
demanding to free the bathroom when I am shaving. This is all, here
is my team, it's a small team, a very compact one.' And he said: `I
see you have not made a decision.' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that my arguments were in vain, because he either
did not understand or pretended that he didn't. His last words
were: `Think, don't rush.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know the bureaucrats' logic in general and bureaucrats'
logic in Russia in particular, you have a clear understanding that
after the president says, `Think, don't rush,' no one will dare to
make a decision to take off the air or fire me or do something
against me until he has at least waved his hand. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, it became clear to Dorenko, who knows better than
most how power works in Russia, that its latest czar had indeed
waved his hand. After his program was canceled, Dorenko desperately
tried to reach the president but could not get through, and no one
called him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no answer,'' he said. ``Which is why I think that it
was a serious answer.''

   WASHINGTON _ Much has been made in the presidential campaign
about Vice President Al Gore's stint with the Army in Vietnam, but
one striking fact has gone largely unnoted: If elected, Gore would
be the first president in a century to have served as an enlisted
man and one of only four ever.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, of course, has been replete with men who served
their country in uniform _ 27 of the 42 presidents _ but the
overwhelming majority did so in the officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 12 generals (Washington, Jackson, Harrison,
Taylor, Pierce, Andrew Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur,
Harrison and Eisenhower), though no admirals. And there has been a
colonel (Theodore Roosevelt), a commander (Lyndon B. Johnson) and a
lieutenant commander (Ford), a major (Truman), a captain (Reagan)
and three lieutenants (Kennedy, Nixon and Bush).
</P>
<P>
   But not since William McKinley, who was president from 1897
until his assassination in 1901, has there been a president who
served in the humbler ranks.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley enlisted as a private in the 23rd Regiment of the Ohio
Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War. (He went on to receive a
battlefield promotion to lieutenant after the Battle of Antietam
from a colonel who went on to become a general and a president,
Rutherford B. Hayes.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McKinley, only two other presidents had served in
the enlisted ranks, according to several presidential reference
books.
</P>
<P>
   James Buchanan served in a company of dragoons _ essentially
cavalrymen _ in the defense of Baltimore during the War of 1812.
And Abraham Lincoln volunteered as a private when the Illinois
militia mobilized to fight in the Black Hawk wars in 1832. His
company promptly elected him captain, but when that unit stood
down, he re-enlisted as a private.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, in August 1969, he walked into a draft center in
Newark, N.J. and enlisted as a private. And a private he remained
through basic training at Fort Dix, a tour at Fort Rucker and five
months as an Army journalist in Vietnam. (He was granted an early
discharge to attend divinity school.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore, of course, was no ordinary buck private. His father was a
senator, and GIs like him were on what one Army general and Vietnam
veteran called ``a watch list,'' a sort of unwritten order to keep
them out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Charles C. Moskos, a sociologist at Northwestern University who
has long studied the military, said that the dearth of enlistees
among the presidents reflected the social and economic backgrounds
of the nation's politicians and officers, who with few exceptions
were of the educated elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical military experience is to be an enlisted man,'' he
said. ``It has not been shared by our presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has made the most of his military record, which
starkly contrasts to the lack of service by President Clinton, but
it remains to be seen how much it will help him on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, scores higher in the
polls on military matters, and in recent years people in uniform,
particularly in the officer corps, have tilted increasingly toward
the Republican Party. The tradition in which the majority usually
considered themselves independent is weakening, a trend that has
raised concerns about the increasing politicization of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year of up and coming officers found that 64
percent identified themselves as Republicans, compared to only 8
percent who were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point, an array of veterans, including
senior officers who served under Clinton and Gore, last week
endorsed Bush, who served as a fighter pilot in the Texas National
Guard during the Vietnam War and was, for the record, a lieutenant.

CUT DOWN ON OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS, WIN CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ariz., Ill., Mich.)   (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Four years ago, as the whole debate over ``family values,''
single mothers and welfare dependency reached its peak, Congress
plopped a $400 million ``illegitimacy bonus'' program into the
welfare reform act.
</P>
<P>
   The program, financed for four years, gives an annual award of
$100 million, to be split among the five states that show the
largest decrease in out-of-wedlock births with no increase in
abortion rates.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human
services, announced the second round of winners: the District of
Columbia (which Congress regards as a state for this program),
Alabama, Arizona, Illinois and Michigan will each get $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing out-of-wedlock births is a significant way to reduce
the risk of welfare dependency,'' said Olivia A. Golden, an
assistant secretary at the department. ``We look forward to
continued results of state efforts to use the flexibility and
resources provided by welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But what the bonus really rewards, whether it has anything to do
with welfare _ and what, if anything, it accomplishes _ remains
murky, said Cory Richards, vice president for policy at the Alan
Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization focusing on
reproductive health and rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the best you can say for the bonus is that it advertises
the issue,'' Richards said. ``There's no requirement that the
states tell the government what they're doing to bring down the
rates, or even that they do anything at all, so there's no way
states can learn from each other's successes. The federal
government gives no guidance to the states as to what they should
or shouldn't do to bring down the rates. And much of the period
covered was before the welfare act even went into effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, defend the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research has demonstrated over and over again that
single-parent families live in poverty, so asking states to try to
reduce illegitimacy rates is clearly a way of addressing the
welfare issue,'' said Susan Orr of the Family Research Council, a
conservative policy group in Washington. ``The extra money will let
the states that are doing a good job help more women and children.
It's a way to encourage responsible behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about a third of all births in the United States are
to unmarried mothers _ a ratio that has been nearly constant for
the last six years. But that leveling off comes after decades of
rapid increases and growing concerns that children raised in
single-parent households do not fare as well as those who live with
both parents.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Health Statistics says births to unwed
mothers accounted for only 5.3 percent of the nation's newborns in
1960, rising to 10.7 percent in 1970, 18.4 percent in 1980 and 28
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The bonuses awarded this month are based on statistics from
1995-1996 to 1997-1998. And most of the winners showed only tiny
decreases in births to unmarried mothers: a 0.02 percent drop in
Illinois, 0.29 percent in Alabama, 1.34 percent in Michigan, and
1.38 percent in Arizona. (Only one other state, Oregon, showed any
decline.)
</P>
<P>
   The only large decline was in Washington, D.C., where
out-of-wedlock births dropped 4.13 percent. The District of
Columbia, along with Alabama and Michigan, also won bonuses last
year in the first round of the program.
</P>
<P>
   The District has long had the highest out-of-wedlock birthrate
in the nation, running above 60 percent. But that, like the recent
declines, probably reflects its racial mix: The capital's
population is mostly black, and while black women have
traditionally had the highest rate of unmarried births, their rates
are declining, while unmarried births to white women are on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and
Human Services, does not dispute the idea that the bonus, so far,
is rewarding demographic changes rather than effective state
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what this is based on precedes the welfare reform act,
and most of it is demographics,'' Kharfen said. ``And it's true
that it doesn't target welfare recipients, since it's based on all
out-of-wedlock births, and doesn't distinguish among economic
background, or the age group, of the unmarried mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why the program wasn't more targeted to welfare
recipients, he said, ``you have to remember this was part of that
whole welfare reform exchange with the states, that we give you the
money and you have to achieve the goals, but we won't tell you what
to do.''

GUNS AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT DEBATE: IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU READ

<P>
   A federal judge in Texas gave gun groups a startling victory
last year and set off an appeals battle that legal experts say
could be the most important dispute over the constitutional right
to firearms in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Sam R. Cummings, held that history proves that the
right ``to keep and bear arms'' in the Second Amendment gave
individual citizens a right to weapons. His decision, with its
emotional resonance for gun supporters, was in conflict with the
vast weight of modern rulings, which have held that the amendment
merely gave the states a right to keep armed militia units.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed gun possession charges that had been filed
against Timothy Joe Emerson, a doctor in San Angelo, Texas.
Prosecutors appealed and the case is awaiting a decision by the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, which heard
arguments in June.

<P>
   A federal judge in Texas gave gun groups a startling victory
last year and set off an appeals battle that legal experts say
could be the most important dispute over the constitutional right
to firearms in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Sam R. Cummings, held that history proves that the
right ``to keep and bear arms'' in the Second Amendment gave
individual citizens a right to weapons. His decision, with its
emotional resonance for gun supporters, was in conflict with the
vast weight of modern rulings, which have held that the amendment
merely gave the states a right to keep armed militia units.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed gun possession charges that had been filed
against Timothy Joe Emerson, a doctor in San Angelo, Texas.
Prosecutors appealed and the case is awaiting a decision by the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, which heard
arguments in June.
</P>
<P>
   Friend-of-the-court briefs were filed by more than 50 groups on
every side of the issue, presenting the judges with a fierce
historical debate about what the nation's founders meant when they
wrote, ``A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security

<P>
   The right of the individual to keep and bear arms was closely
associated by the framers with the militia tradition that the
American colonists brought with them from England. Many Americans
of the late eighteenth century were mistrustful of standing armies,
and the Federalists and Anti-Federalists were agreed on at least
one fundamental point: liberty was more secure on these shores than
in England because the American people were armed. . . .

<P>
   Henry . . . did state that ``((t))he great object is, that every

to mention: ``But we have learned, by experience, that, necessary
as it is to have arms, and though our Assembly has, by a succession
of laws for many years, endeavored to have the militia completely
armed, it is still far from being the case. When this power is
given up to Congress without limitation or bounds, how will your
militia be armed?''
</P>
<P>
   When Henry's statement is read in context, it is clear that his
goal that ``every man be armed'' was directed toward a successful
state militia (in which each militia member had the use of a gun) _
not toward arming members of the public for their individual needs.

<P>
   Congress . . . upheld the beliefs of the Framers of our
Constitution, who were avid supporters of individual gun ownership
and its protection under the Second Amendment. Many of them also
detailed the value of individual firearm ownership toward the
preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia. . . . These
same Framers feared the destruction of the general militia. . . .
Some of the Framers' statements include:
</P>
<P>
   . . . ``I ask, Who are the militia? They consist now of the
whole people, except a few public officers.'' George Mason, June
16, 1788. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Framers' intent was to have an armed populace capable of
defending themselves from all forms of tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms
</P>
<P>
   The district court misinterprets the historical record by basing
its holding almost entirely on an equation of the ``militia'' with
the public . . . and concluding from that equation that the Framers
must have intended that the right to bear arms belong to individual
members of the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the militia was drawn from the general
population _ in other words, that many citizens were eligible for
membership _ is entirely different from saying that the militia
should simply be indiscriminately equated with the population at
large. The district court's failure to understand this distinction
is well illustrated by its reliance on a statement by George Mason:
``Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people.''
</P>
<P>
   What the district court overlooks, however, is that Mason's
discussion continues: ``. . . the militia of the future day may not
consist of all classes, high and low, and rich and poor; but they
may be confined to the lower and middle classes of the people,
granting exclusion to the higher classes of the people. . . . Under
the present government, all ranks of people are subject to militia
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason's concern, quite clearly, was that if Congress were
permitted full control over the militia, it might grant exemption
from military service to federal elites, rather than distributing
militia ``duty'' among the people generally. No such concern would
be implicated if the Second Amendment conferred a right to bear
arms wholly unrelated to militia service.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the logic of politicians when they think
about popular culture: Many of today's films and music and
videogames are vile, not like the John Wayne movies or Elvis
records they enjoyed when they were young.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of American adults tell pollsters they
think the violence in the culture contributes to violent acts by
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the evidence of a relationship between culture and
actual violence is highly uncertain, it is good politics to wax
indignant about entertainment corrupting the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the First Amendment makes if almost impossible to
draft a law that would place meaningful restrictions on the
entertainment. Freedom of speech is sacrosanct, and any real
crackdown on entertainment would amount to an extension of
regulation from Washington, something the Republicans especially
deplore.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the entertainment industry is a big source of campaign
money for both major parties, and especially for Democrats. As of
early August, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan watchdog group, people and companies in the industry
had donated $23.7 million to candidates and parties for this year's
federal elections, 61 percent of it to Democrats. By Election Day,
the total will doubtless be much larger.
</P>
<P>
   So what is likely to come out of Congress this year is the same
thing it has produced almost every other time the evils of popular
culture have become a political issue. Whether the entertainment in
question was peep shows (turn of the 20th century) or gangster
movies (1930s) or comic books (1950s) or disco (1970s), the result
was always a lot of hot air and no consequential legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that
would prohibit the broadcast of television shows with violence in
the daytime or early evening, when children could be expected to be
watching. Under the legislation, the Federal Trade Commission would
define what was violent.
</P>
<P>
   The debate gave the senators a fine opportunity to sound off.
But it is a sure bet that the bill will never become law. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., the Commerce Committee chairman, explained why:
``The notion of letting five unelected bureaucrats at the
commission decide what can be broadcast and when it can be
broadcast is objectionable to most free people.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for good reason: It is impossible to prospectively define
what constitutes `violent' programming in a way that will not
prohibit the transmission of `Saving Private Ryan' or `Schindler's
List,' for example. A telecast featuring murder, suicide, gang
violence and knife fighting is violent, but does anyone want the
FTC to ban the broadcast of `Romeo and Juliet'? Parents, not
bureaucrats, should decide whether children should be exposed to
Shakespeare or even, for that matter, arguably violent cartoons
about coyotes and roadrunners.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, incidentally, voted ``present.'' If he had voted against
the bill, some political opponent someday would surely have used it
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Even if by some fluke of politics the bill were to be passed and
signed by the president, the Supreme Court would almost certainly
declare it unconstitutional. Just last May, the court struck down a
law that required cable systems to limit sexually explicit channels
to late-night hours, on the ground that the law violated the basic
principle of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, when the FTC reported that the vast majority
of adult-rated films, recordings and electronic games were being
advertised to appeal to children, Vice President Al Gore and Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, his running mate, suggested that
if the entertainment companies did not voluntarily clean up their
act, the commission should move against the industry by using its
power to prohibit false and deceptive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   That also might not pass constitutional muster, said William Van
Alstyne, a First Amendment expert at Duke University Law School.
Van Alstyne observed, for example, that children under 17 were
allowed into R-rated movies if accompanied by an adult. So
moviemakers were on firm legal and ethical ground when they aimed
ads for movies at children in the hope that they would persuade
their parents to take them.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are not completely powerless, however. They can
hector, threaten and badger the industry, or, to use the Yiddish
word that Lieberman used last week, ``noodge'' it into doing a
better job of policing itself.
</P>
<P>
   This has sometimes worked in the past. Arm-twisting by lawmakers
led the movie studios in the 1960s to introduce the current rating
system. While not perfect, it gives parents some idea of a film's
content and gives theaters grounds for turning children away from
inappropriate movies.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Lynne Cheney, whose husband is the Republican
vice presidential nominee, suggested that political pressure could
induce music companies to include written lyrics with their
recordings so parents could see what their children were listening
to.
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, the education secretary in the Bush
administration who offers himself as a guardian of American moral
values, believes the strongest weapon politicians have is their
ability to inflict public shame. In that context, the Commerce
Committee has called executives of the large movie studios to
testify on Wednesday and say publicly what, if anything, they
intend to do to limit children's exposure to violent entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, then, self-regulation by the industry is probably
the politicians' only recourse to objectionable content. But there
may be a price to even voluntary censorship _ a diminution of the
country's artistic energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, the film studios adopted a voluntary code of
conduct in which they agreed not to portray gangsters (James Cagney
or Edward G. Robinson) as heroic, police officers as corrupt or
loose women (Jean Harlow) as happy _ the notion being that children
would not learn from the movies that crime pays or that there is
value in promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, ``the movies lost some of their bite,'' said
Francis G. Couvares, an authority on movie censorship who is now
dean of freshmen at Amherst College. ``The rules blunted these
electric and dynamic characters who defied social values and
limited the capacity of some great actors.''

movies (1930s) or comic books (1950s) or disco (1970s), the result
was always a lot of hot air and no consequential legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that
would prohibit the broadcast of television shows with violence in
the daytime or early evening, when children could be expected to be
watching. Under the legislation, the Federal Trade Commission would
define what was violent.
</P>
<P>
   The debate gave the senators a fine opportunity to sound off.
But it is a sure bet that the bill will never become law. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., the Commerce Committee chairman, explained why:
``The notion of letting five unelected bureaucrats at the
commission decide what can be broadcast and when it can be
broadcast is objectionable to most free people.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for good reason: It is impossible to prospectively define
what constitutes `violent' programming in a way that will not
prohibit the transmission of `Saving Private Ryan' or `Schindler's
List,' for example. A telecast featuring murder, suicide, gang
violence and knife fighting is violent, but does anyone want the
FTC to ban the broadcast of `Romeo and Juliet'? Parents, not
bureaucrats, should decide whether children should be exposed to
Shakespeare or even, for that matter, arguably violent cartoons
about coyotes and roadrunners.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, incidentally, voted ``present.'' If he had voted against
the bill, some political opponent someday would surely have used it
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Even if by some fluke of politics the bill were to be passed and
signed by the president, the Supreme Court would almost certainly
declare it unconstitutional. Just last May, the court struck down a
law that required cable systems to limit sexually explicit channels
to late-night hours, on the ground that the law violated the basic
principle of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, when the FTC reported that the vast majority
of adult-rated films, recordings and electronic games were being
advertised to appeal to children, Vice President Al Gore and Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, his running mate, suggested that
if the entertainment companies did not voluntarily clean up their
act, the commission should move against the industry by using its
power to prohibit false and deceptive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   That also might not pass constitutional muster, said William Van
Alstyne, a First Amendment expert at Duke University Law School.
Van Alstyne observed, for example, that children under 17 were
allowed into R-rated movies if accompanied by an adult. So
moviemakers were on firm legal and ethical ground when they aimed
ads for movies at children in the hope that they would persuade
their parents to take them.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are not completely powerless, however. They can
hector, threaten and badger the industry, or, to use the Yiddish
word that Lieberman used last week, ``noodge'' it into doing a
better job of policing itself.
</P>
<P>
   This has sometimes worked in the past. Arm-twisting by lawmakers
led the movie studios in the 1960s to introduce the current rating
system. While not perfect, it gives parents some idea of a film's
content and gives theaters grounds for turning children away from
inappropriate movies.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Lynne Cheney, whose husband is the Republican
vice presidential nominee, suggested that political pressure could
induce music companies to include written lyrics with their
recordings so parents could see what their children were listening
to.
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, the education secretary in the Bush
administration who offers himself as a guardian of American moral
values, believes the strongest weapon politicians have is their
ability to inflict public shame. In that context, the Commerce
Committee has called executives of the large movie studios to
testify on Wednesday and say publicly what, if anything, they
intend to do to limit children's exposure to violent entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, then, self-regulation by the industry is probably
the politicians' only recourse to objectionable content. But there
may be a price to even voluntary censorship _ a diminution of the
country's artistic energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, the film studios adopted a voluntary code of
conduct in which they agreed not to portray gangsters (James Cagney
or Edward G. Robinson) as heroic, police officers as corrupt or
loose women (Jean Harlow) as happy _ the notion being that children
would not learn from the movies that crime pays or that there is
value in promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, ``the movies lost some of their bite,'' said
Francis G. Couvares, an authority on movie censorship who is now
dean of freshmen at Amherst College. ``The rules blunted these
electric and dynamic characters who defied social values and
limited the capacity of some great actors.''

   WASHINGTON _ When the idea of tapping the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve was floated last winter, in the face of high home
heating prices in the Northeast, no one was more skeptical than
Vice President Al Gore. Oil-producing nations, he explained to a
Massachusetts audience in February, could easily counter the move.
``All they would have to do is cut back a little bit on supply and
they'd wipe out any impact from releasing oil from that reserve,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis of the realpolitik of the oil market rings as true
today as it did then. But the approach of a presidential election
has a way of altering the way candidates parse the laws of supply
and demand. Thus the decision, announced on Friday, to tap the
reserve for 30 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Gore, stung by Gov. George W. Bush's
criticism that the administration has stumbled along with no energy
policy, feels he is facing a political crisis. Inventories of oil
are running low and everyone from truckers to commuters in SUVs is
getting angry. The Energy Department predicted early this month
that home heating oil bills would be 30 percent higher than last
winter, and today that looks conservative. Inconveniently for Gore,
the people most dependent on oil for heat live in many of the swing
states in the Midwest, which are likely to determine the outcome of
the election, now only 44 days away.
</P>
<P>
   But is there an oil crisis?
</P>
<P>
   If you ask the oil experts, the answer is no, or at least not
yet. Rather, there is a mismatch between supply and demand that is
causing prices to spike upward and has begun to prompt hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a classic price shock, and it goes back
to the Asian financial crisis,'' said Daniel Yergin, who has
tracked the oil markets since the Arab embargoes and sees today's
problems as very different. After the financial crisis hit, in
1997, he said, ``companies cut back on their investments around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, everyone was guessing that it would take Southeast
Asia years to pull itself out of the hole it had dug. Few expected
the boom in the United States to last this long, or for Europe to
be posting strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   So in an industry where profits depend on managing the cost of
exploration and inventory, caution prevailed. Exploration firms dug
fewer holes and scaled back on new storage facilities. The result,
as calculated by Yergin's firm, Cambridge Energy Associates, is
that ``world productive capacity is seven million barrels a day
less than we would have otherwise expected.'' And last year, with
the price of oil low, OPEC began cutting back production. Even so,
by most estimates, the world produces two or three million barrels
a day more than the 77 million barrels it burns. But even if it
were being distributed and stockpiled with precision, there would
not be much left over. And meanwhile, demand is strong _ even in
places that a few years ago most experts expected would still be
fighting off recession.
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily a crisis _ but it could become one fairly
quickly. The Pentagon warns that Saddam Hussein might cut off some
of Iraq's production or that his renewed threats against Kuwait may
force it to cut it off for him. And if any kind of natural or
man-made disaster _ hurricane, earthquake, a further political
meltdown in Indonesia or a confrontation in the Taiwan Straits _
there is little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Yergin puts it, ``We're at the extreme end of a market
cycle. That is always when risk is highest.''
</P>
<P>
   All these realities collided in the Roosevelt Room of the White
House the other day with the political demands of two campaigns _
Al Gore's and Hillary Rodham Clinton's. Just as Gore is worried
about the Midwest, Mrs. Clinton is worried about upstate New York.
And neither could make a convincing case that the administration
was easing anyone's pain.
</P>
<P>
   So with prices rising and the election ever nearer, a furious
debate broke out within the administration about whether to tap the
570-million-barrel strategic reserve, a legacy of the 1973-74 Arab
oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
   That put the ball in the court of Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, who had had a bad year in Washington, blamed for doing
too little to keep oil flowing in and nuclear secrets at Los Alamos
labs from flowing out. Richardson wrote President Clinton arguing
for the release of 60 million barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he acknowledged, the emergency reserve was created in case
of major supply disruptions, not to manipulate prices. But those
who live in Michigan or Pennsylvania and are paying exorbitant
amounts for heating oil, he argued, probably don't care whether the
cause of the problem is Saddam or Exxon. Voters just want it
solved.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, a veteran of many
currency market interventions (some that worked, some that
flopped), took the other side. Richardson's proposal, he said in a
memo that was almost instantly leaked in an effort to embarrass
Summers, would ``set a dangerous precedent.'' Echoing Gore's point
last February, he noted that OPEC could easily neutralize the
release of the stockpiled oil. He suggested that oil traders,
seeing the approach of an election, might dismiss any action as a
political ploy rather than a commitment to reverse oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   He even invoked the name of Washington's other great power, Alan
Greenspan, declaring that ``Chairman Greenspan and I believe that
using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time, as proposed by
DOE, would be a major and substantial policy mistake.''

   Maybe so, but in Washington losing an election is also
considered a major mistake. So on Thursday the vice president stood
in front of some oil tanks in southern Maryland and publicly called
on his boss to begin opening the spigots on the reserve. That
hardly came as a surprise to Clinton, who had gotten a call from
Gore two days earlier, informing him of the new campaign
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, a happy-looking Richardson announced the release
of the 30 million barrels, about 5 percent of the reserve, a far
larger amount than Gore had sought in public. The White House hopes
that it is enough to drive down prices without leaving Gore
vulnerable to Bush's charge that the release ``threatens national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have a hard time arguing that the release leaves
America in peril, but he has a point in his criticism of the
Clinton-Gore administration's energy policy. When oil was trading
at $20 a barrel, as it was a few years ago, few in Washington
worried about the oil market. The administration focused on the
economic problems in front of it _ keeping the world economy on an
even keel _ and didn't spend much time looking at what might happen
if demand for oil picked up while inventory and production capacity
were still low.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is almost certainly right when he says the
administration is redefining the purpose of the reserve, which was
created to protect against real supply disruptions. ``We think this
is a rainy day,'' Richardson said. ``We think that between now and
winter, because of the low stocks of home heating oil, we're in
danger of potential disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   And, by remarkable coincidence, the 30 days of government-led
oil infusions will end just two weeks before the election. Then,
Richardson said, there will still be time to ``reassess.'' Whether
he meant reassessing the oil supplies, or the polls, or both, was
not entirely clear.

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With her Danish mother, her Syrian
father, her French passport and her Oxford education,
Annie-Christine Habbard, 31, seems every inch the global citizen
equipped to succeed in a shrinking world. Yet here she is, chic in
black, articulate in several tongues, at the annual meeting of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, protesting the
state of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   What she wants is more social justice, respect for human rights,
a ``counterpower'' to high finance and, for good measure, a more
equitable distribution of the spoils from a new Chad-Cameroon oil
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Say ``anti-globalization'' and stormy images come to mind:
ransackers of McDonald's restaurants in France, smashers of Seattle
storefront windows. The police on every corner here, and the
shuttered shops, confirm the power of such specters, and indeed
some protesters say they want a repeat of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But the specter of violence can deceive. The deeper reality is
more significant: that of an increasingly sophisticated,
intellectually robust protest movement, mixing idealism with
pragmatism, that is fast playing catch-up with the forces of
multinational capital.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to change icons: Replace the angry visage of Jose
Bove, the French farmer recently imprisoned for storming a
McDonald's, with the cool features and articulate aplomb of
Habbard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a new planetary citizenship, reflecting the fact that
decisions have migrated from state level,'' said Habbard, the
deputy secretary general of the Paris-based International
Federation of Human Rights. ``Voting for national representatives,
an old expression of citizenship, achieves nothing, because they
have scant power. We have to be here to fight the political battles
that will ensure globalization does not continue to accentuate
inequities.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. More than 350 citizens' organizations are here
_ debt-reliefers, save-the-Earthers, human-dignity-firsters, and
everything in between, representing lands from Mauritius to Mexico.
Forget right and left and the stale duels of national politics: the
battle of universal principles against universal capital now
unfurls.
</P>
<P>
   It might be argued that the lines are being drawn in the wrong
place. The $1.2 trillion traded daily on world money markets equals
the entire lending of the World Bank over its 55 years of
existence. But all that fast-moving money has no identifiable face.
By contrast, the altar of market liberalization, privatization and
public spending cuts is identifiable, and the protesters are sure
such orthodoxy has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   Habbard is determined to change the world through international
human-rights law where her predecessors deployed Marxist revolution
or flower power. She is intensely pragmatic. She has lawyers behind
her, ready to use the body of international law to compel the World
Bank to avoid loans to any projects that might compromise human
rights. Multinational corporations are more difficult to control,
she concedes, but they are the next target. The Internet links her
to other groups like Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, with their
own batteries of lawyers. Nothing dreamy here: this fight to shape
globalization has all the romance of a corporate takeover battle.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like Attac in France, whose membership has
increased in two years to 26,000, including more than 20 members of
Parliament, argue for taxes on international capital flows, codes
of conduct obliging multinationals to respect human rights and
restraints on the activities of U.S. pension funds that pursue
returns in Europe in ways that cut back jobs. For Bruno Jetin, a
French economist, such measures are essential to ``put equality and
human beings back at the center of economic debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas have a particular resonance in France, where equality
is a founding principle of the republic and rapid Americanization
in recent years has stirred uneasiness. But everywhere in Europe,
where the state's heavy role in balancing the excesses of the
market had been widely accepted, the triumph of the private sector
causes some unease. One challenge before these Europeans _ and all
the anti-globalists _ is to make the case that their concern for
equity will not hobble growth in the developing world, as it
sometimes has done on this continent. On the other hand, the
intellectual ammunition of the anti-globalists has also been
reinforced by the spread of poverty in places that include Eastern
Europe _ a trend that has led James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank
president, to use some very strong language here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you have 20 percent of the world controlling 80 percent
of the gross domestic product,'' he said. ``You've got a $30
trillion economy and $24 trillion of it in developed countries. The
income of the top 20 is 37 times the income of the bottom 20, and
it has doubled in the last decade. These inequities cannot exist.
So if you are looking for systemic breakdown, I believe you have to
think today in terms of social breakdown.''

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With her Danish mother, her Syrian
father, her French passport and her Oxford education,
Annie-Christine Habbard, 31, seems every inch the global citizen
equipped to succeed in a shrinking world. Yet here she is, chic in
black, articulate in several tongues, at the annual meeting of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, protesting the
state of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   What she wants is more social justice, respect for human rights,
a ``counterpower'' to high finance and, for good measure, a more
equitable distribution of the spoils from a new Chad-Cameroon oil
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Say ``anti-globalization'' and stormy images come to mind:
ransackers of McDonald's restaurants in France, smashers of Seattle
storefront windows. The police on every corner here, and the
shuttered shops, confirm the power of such specters, and indeed
some protesters say they want a repeat of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But the specter of violence can deceive. The deeper reality is
more significant: that of an increasingly sophisticated,
intellectually robust protest movement, mixing idealism with
pragmatism, that is fast playing catch-up with the forces of
multinational capital.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to change icons: Replace the angry visage of Jose
Bove, the French farmer recently imprisoned for storming a
McDonald's, with the cool features and articulate aplomb of
Habbard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a new planetary citizenship, reflecting the fact that
decisions have migrated from state level,'' said Habbard, the
deputy secretary general of the Paris-based International
Federation of Human Rights. ``Voting for national representatives,
an old expression of citizenship, achieves nothing, because they
have scant power. We have to be here to fight the political battles
that will ensure globalization does not continue to accentuate
inequities.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. More than 350 citizens' organizations are here
_ debt-reliefers, save-the-Earthers, human-dignity-firsters, and
everything in between, representing lands from Mauritius to Mexico.
Forget right and left and the stale duels of national politics: the
battle of universal principles against universal capital now
unfurls.
</P>
<P>
   It might be argued that the lines are being drawn in the wrong
place. The $1.2 trillion traded daily on world money markets equals
the entire lending of the World Bank over its 55 years of
existence. But all that fast-moving money has no identifiable face.
By contrast, the altar of market liberalization, privatization and
public spending cuts is identifiable, and the protesters are sure
such orthodoxy has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   Habbard is determined to change the world through international
human-rights law where her predecessors deployed Marxist revolution
or flower power. She is intensely pragmatic. She has lawyers behind
her, ready to use the body of international law to compel the World
Bank to avoid loans to any projects that might compromise human
rights. Multinational corporations are more difficult to control,
she concedes, but they are the next target. The Internet links her
to other groups like Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, with their
own batteries of lawyers. Nothing dreamy here: this fight to shape
globalization has all the romance of a corporate takeover battle.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like Attac in France, whose membership has
increased in two years to 26,000, including more than 20 members of
Parliament, argue for taxes on international capital flows, codes
of conduct obliging multinationals to respect human rights and
restraints on the activities of U.S. pension funds that pursue
returns in Europe in ways that cut back jobs. For Bruno Jetin, a
French economist, such measures are essential to ``put equality and
human beings back at the center of economic debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas have a particular resonance in France, where equality
is a founding principle of the republic and rapid Americanization
in recent years has stirred uneasiness. But everywhere in Europe,
where the state's heavy role in balancing the excesses of the
market had been widely accepted, the triumph of the private sector
causes some unease. One challenge before these Europeans _ and all
the anti-globalists _ is to make the case that their concern for
equity will not hobble growth in the developing world, as it
sometimes has done on this continent. On the other hand, the
intellectual ammunition of the anti-globalists has also been
reinforced by the spread of poverty in places that include Eastern
Europe _ a trend that has led James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank
president, to use some very strong language here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you have 20 percent of the world controlling 80 percent
of the gross domestic product,'' he said. ``You've got a $30
trillion economy and $24 trillion of it in developed countries. The
income of the top 20 is 37 times the income of the bottom 20, and
it has doubled in the last decade. These inequities cannot exist.
So if you are looking for systemic breakdown, I believe you have to
think today in terms of social breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic words. But another side to the story clearly exists.
Open markets and free trade have slashed poverty in East Asia, and
a few countries in Africa have also begun to respond to this recipe
of economic opening.
</P>
<P>
   As Daniel Bachman, chief economist at The Globalist.com, an
online magazine, pointed out: ``Globalization can also improve
conditions by forcing a race to the top.'' In states like
Argentina, the dismantling of local oligarchies caused by open
markets has had a tremendous liberating effect. In a place like
Haiti, subsistence wages may be undignified, but they are better
than starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization can also be a very fertile process. Much has been
made of the Americanization of the world, but cultural currents are
more mixed than that, and the United States has also been
Europeanized, from its coffee to its eating habits. In some areas,
such as data privacy, stricter European standards seem likely to
prevail, to Americans' benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the president of the World Bank warns of a social breakdown
because of the very global economic system he is deemed to
personify. So there is clearly a problem, and a growing one. Its
nature is economic and political. Some basic statistics are not
encouraging _ about 1.2 billion people still living on less than $1
a day, another 1.3 billion people on $2 _ and the diverse protests
stirred by such numbers are now so vigorous that dialogue and
compromise have become essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not succeed in making clear to citizens that
globalization is to their benefit, we run a big political risk,''
said Caio Koch-Weser, a senior German economic official. ``There's
a feeling in the population that nobody's in charge. People are
afraid of losing jobs to the whims of multinationals. We need to
bring Wall Street to Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   This sharpening of official concern reflects the fact that a
decade of globalization has allowed a keener dissection of its
characteristics. The wild denunciations of the inhuman scourge of
rampaging global capital in the French author Viviane Forrestier's
immensely popular ``The Economic Horror'' (1 million copies sold
worldwide, but unpublished in the United States), have given way to
subtler analysis. Often this has concentrated on the way a global
economy can prompt a ``race to the bottom,'' as the cheapest labor
and lowest taxes are relentlessly sought out. The net effect has
been described by the German sociologist Ernest Beck as ``the
Brazilianization of the West'' _ the progressive recourse to
uninsured, temporary workers _ and the slow dismantlement of the
welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Clark, a development specialist on leave from the World
Bank, has argued that globalization was always a highly selective
thing. Advocates of free trade really wanted only an unrestrained
market for capital. The result has been to maximize returns on
capital, while minimizing returns to labor. ``The world over, gaps
between rich and poor have widened as richer populations and
countries raced ahead of poorer,'' Clark wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists dispute that view.
</P>
<P>
   But officials seem convinced that beyond debt relief, an
enormous effort must now be made to give more people the basic
tools to benefit from a global economy: education, lifetime
training, access to technology, encouragement for the stock
ownership that alone will spread America's brand of popular
capitalism, in which even blue-collar workers benefit from
investing. Without such measures, the distorting effects of the
wild premium placed by modern markets on talent and technology seem
likely to grow, miring a third of humanity in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The other new priority seems to be dialogue. Wolfensohn spent
time Friday with non-governmental organizations including the
Bolivian Episcopal Conference, the Coalition for Democracy and
Civil Society of the Kyrgyz Republic, and a representative of
something called World Vision from Uganda. Questions ranged from
corruption to control of multinationals to that Chad-Cameroon oil
pipeline. The meeting, in such a setting, amounted to a first. But
the evolution is natural enough: world politics, however
cumbersome, for a global economy.

   Now Comes the Real Revolution
</P>
<P>
   On the annual Woman's Day in Iran last week, a conservative
bureaucrat named Farah Khosravi announced that she wanted to run
for president in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up 25 percent of Iran's labor force and half of the
university population. They drive their own cars and run their own
businesses, vote in elections and hold political office. So why not
a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Khosravi, who is 41 years old and is in charge of the
exercise curriculum for Iran's schools, is not the first woman to
express such ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   During her successful campaign for Parliament in 1996, Faezeh
Hashemi, the daughter of then-President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, declared that there was no reason under Iran's
constitution why a woman could not run for president. Her musings
fueled speculation that she might seek the office, but she
eventually said she was just trying to stir things up.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was picked up the following year by Azam Taleghani,
the daughter of the late Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani, a celebrated
cleric who had been prominent in the Iranian revolution. She
announced her candidacy for president. Taleghani had been elected
to the revolution's first parliament and ran an outspoken (now
banned) weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Her action forced a debate on Iran's constitution, which said
that only a rajol _ a person of consequence _ could run. In Arabic,
the concept is masculine, but Taleghani argued that in Persian its
meaning is not clear, and she asked the opinion of the religious
scholars who drafted the 1979 constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that women could not become president; others said
they could; still others said they didn't know. One said that even
hermaphrodites could be president.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Guardian Council, which vets political
candidates, disqualified Taleghani, as it did all but 4 of 230
would-be candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taleghani counted the ruling a victory. She was told she
couldn't run because she was not ``a religious and political
personality,'' not because she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   A Kiss for the Ages
</P>
<P>
   First Al Gore planted a big one on his wife, Tipper, at the
Democratic convention, and the pollsters said it worked wonders
with women. So after Oprah Winfrey jokingly complained that Gore
failed to kiss her in a cheery appearance on her talk show, Gov.
George W. Bush delivered a strategic smooch to her cheek last week
and declared that his favorite gift to his wife, Laura, was a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spilled our guts on everything,'' said the author and
television personality Barbara Howar. ``We may as well show our
tonsils.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? As with so much in American politics, Bill
Clinton is the leading suspect. For two terms, Clinton has made his
family's domestic turmoil successful grist for the political mill,
from his mother's battles with his alcoholic stepfather to his own
quest for spiritual renewal after an adulterous affair. He and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were also accused of cynically
allowing photographers to capture them dancing in bathing suits
just weeks before word of Clinton's affair with a White House
intern became public.
</P>
<P>
   So the attention to this year's crop of kisses has everything to
do with last year's loves. However sincere or spontaneous the
Gores' embrace (which lasted from four to seven seconds, depending
on how much of the hug is counted), it seemed to stand in stark
contrast to Clinton's marital complications. Ditto Bush's
endorsement of spousal smacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll have a pucker-ometer here pretty soon that will
help us gauge our candidates,'' said Dayton Duncan, who was press
secretary to Gov. Michael Dukakis during his 1988 presidential
campaign. Duncan seems to find it all a bit mystifying. ``In my
high school, in Indianola, Iowa, the people who were known as good
kissers, everybody knew who they were,'' he said. ``And sometimes
that was good, and sometimes that was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A Billion Consumers Live In China. Next Question?
</P>
<P>
   In a major triumph for the Clinton administration and American
business, the Senate cast a bipartisan vote to remove trade
restraints and expand commerce with China, the world's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   After an often tumultuous nine-month battle, the actual vote was
slightly anticlimactic, and passed with minimal debate, 83-15.
Coupled with approval by the House in May, the vote ends the annual
congressional review of China's trade status, a Capitol Hill ritual
for 20 years that Beijing considered degrading but that critics
contended was necessary to force China to improve its record on
human rights and religious freedom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gone, but Not Forgotten
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Ray, the independent prosecutor, ended a six-year,
almost $60 million investigation by delivering a report that
cleared both President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the Whitewater
real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   The failed Arkansas real estate venture was the beginning of an
inquiry that broadened into wholly unexpected areas, including
Clinton's relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
which led to the impeachment drama in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence ``to
prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt'' that or Clinton
committed any crimes, though Clinton could still be indicted after
leaving office over his sworn statements in connection with his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic Oddities in Sydney
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics began to look a little like a soap opera, which
could only boost NBC's anemic ratings.
</P>
<P>
   First, the French runn Marie-Jose Perec, the defending champion
in the women's 200 and 400 meters, said she would not compete and
flew to Singapore. Perec claimed to have been threatened by a man
who forced his way into her Sydney hotel room, but Australian
newspapers gleefully claimed she was running away from a showdown
in the 400 meters with Australian Cathy Freeman. One labeled her
``Mademoiselle La Chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, for the first time in memory, technicians set the vault
apparatus at the wrong height for the women's gymnastics, causing
Russia's Svetlana Khorkina, then leading in the overall
championship competition, to fall. She later fell from the uneven
bars as well and, with her chance of a medal gone, refused to vault
once more on the readjusted piece of equipment. Afterward, she
angrily told reporters to ``get lost.''

almost $60 million investigation by delivering a report that
cleared both President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the Whitewater
real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   The failed Arkansas real estate venture was the beginning of an
inquiry that broadened into wholly unexpected areas, including
Clinton's relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
which led to the impeachment drama in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence ``to
prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt'' that or Clinton
committed any crimes, though Clinton could still be indicted after
leaving office over his sworn statements in connection with his
relationship with Lewinsky.

   Athletic Oddities in Sydney
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics began to look a little like a soap opera, which
could only boost NBC's anemic ratings.
</P>
<P>
   First, the French runn Marie-Jose Perec, the defending champion
in the women's 200 and 400 meters, said she would not compete and
flew to Singapore. Perec claimed to have been threatened by a man
who forced his way into her Sydney hotel room, but Australian
newspapers gleefully claimed she was running away from a showdown
in the 400 meters with Australian Cathy Freeman. One labeled her
``Mademoiselle La Chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, for the first time in memory, technicians set the vault
apparatus at the wrong height for the women's gymnastics, causing
Russia's Svetlana Khorkina, then leading in the overall
championship competition, to fall. She later fell from the uneven
bars as well and, with her chance of a medal gone, refused to vault
once more on the readjusted piece of equipment. Afterward, she
angrily told reporters to ``get lost.''

   What Price Power?
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in power, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru
faced his most serious challenge, but after several days of
uncertainty appeared to have beaten back the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced new elections and the dissolution of the
national intelligence service after a damaging bribery episode came
to light. His spy chief, implicated in the scandal, dropped from
sight, and opposition groups called for Fujimori's immediate
resignation. On Thursday, a statement of support from the armed
forces solidified his position even if it left the price extracted
by the military and the fate of the intelligence boss unclear.

   Whitewashing History

   A billionaire homebuilder from the West Coast is giving the

</P>
<P>
   Officials at the federally financed museum welcomed the chance

museum in 1997.

   Quitting While He's Ahead
</P>
<P>
   When he was appointed the top antitrust cop at the Justice
Department, Joel Klein was sharply criticized for being too soft,
particularly on telecommunications mergers.

   ``We've got an antitrust fellow here who rolls over and plays
dead,'' Senator Ernest Hollings said at the time.

<P>
   Bill Gates would probably disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Klein has now announced his intention to resign, after compiling
a formidable prosecutorial record that included the order to break
up Microsoft Corp., the dissolution of a global vitamin cartel and
the compilation of a list of proposed corporate mergers that were
abandoned or restructured after the government's antitrust
objections.  &QL;

   Complaints, complaints everywhere _ but New York City police
investigators said there was no evidence that anyone was tampering
with the bottled water sold in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The deluge began with three initial complaints, in which ammonia
and a lye-type cleaning agent were found in three water samples.
The police were leaning toward a theory that all three were
accidents, in which cleaning supplies had somehow come in contact
with bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of complaints had been filed after the first incidents
were reported, but investigators said they viewed them as the
products of fear, fantasy and flimflam.

   Trading in Human Lives
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors accused Robert E. Porges, a New York lawyer
whose Chinatown firm has represented thousands of Chinese
immigrants seeking political asylum in the United States, of
participating in the smuggling of illegal immigrants into the
country from China.
</P>
<P>
   The Porges firm, with roughly 40 lawyers and paralegals, was
also accused of helping smugglers, also known as snakeheads, to
``abduct'' illegal immigrants and of falsifying the applications of
some 6,000 asylum seekers, who paid the firm a total of $12
million. Porges' wife, Sheery Lu Porges, is accused of helping
smugglers kidnap 17 Chinese immigrants since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Porgeses and five of their employees pleaded not guilty to
all the charges, including racketeering, conspiracy and immigration
fraud.

<P>
   The scandal over defective Firestone tires prompted Congress to
approve money for rating vehicles' tendency to roll over. This
follows evidence that most of the 103 deaths blamed on defective
tires occurred in Ford Explorers that flipped over when their tires
lost their treads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another tire maker, Continental, recalled 160,000
tires mounted mostly on Ford's Lincoln Navigator sport utility
vehicle, while regulators began studying whether an Explorer front
suspension component was prone to defects.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that neither the Continental tires nor the suspension
component had caused any serious crashes.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR SALT LAKE CITY CHIEF, STRESS THE GAMES, NOT THE
SCANDALS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Mass.)   (Sports of the Times) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ This is Mitt Romney's first Olympic
experience, and he is having a great time, donning an official Salt
Lake Organizing Committee outfit and joining the staff for a jog up
the Sydney Harbor Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   There is time to go to events and say, what a city, what
wonderful people, but by the way, there is no way Salt Lake City
can match Sydney in national fervor or expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the headline `Our Finest Hour,''' Romney said the other
day. ``I doubt that any paper would say that in the States, even in
Salt Lake City _ maybe for D-Day or landing on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   He is enjoying these Summer Games because they are not his. He
doesn't have to worry about escaping convicts or grass fires or bus
snarls. All he has is a lingering scandal back home and concerns
about putting on modest but uplifting Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Romney, 53, is the fresh breeze imported from back East during
revelations about the inbred burghers who bought the Games. But
first, he had to give himself an education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no notion of who Juan Antonio Samaranch was,'' Romney
said. ``I had no idea what the International Olympic Committee did.
I didn't know it was located in Lausanne. I knew nothing about the
United States Olympic Committee. The only thing I read on the
sports pages were the results.''
</P>
<P>
   He walked into an organization on the eve of destruction, but
Romney does not lack for confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specialize in turnarounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his work for the management consulting firm Bain &AMP; Co., he
was a leader among alpha males in nearly identical dark suits and
blue shirts and red suspenders who worked long hours and shared a
secret handshake and made tons of money. You've heard of Moonies?
These guys are called Bainies. He's not exactly a naif. He saw his
father, the late George W. Romney, run into a buzz saw when he
ventured outside Michigan to try to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my business, you don't want any free publicity,'' Mitt
Romney said. ``Politics are the exact opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that in 1994 when he ran for the Senate against a
man with an even more familiar name. ``I learned a lot from Ted
Kennedy,'' Romney said. ``He's the master. I used to say, `Wow, are
they good.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy campaign put Romney on the defensive for his Mormon
religion, his wealth, his father, his party. What else could
anybody say about him if he ran a troubled Olympic committee?
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife talked me into it,'' Romney said, referring to Ann
Romney, who grew up in Birmingham, Mich., and attended Brigham
Young University, just as he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me, `You have exactly the background.' The more I
thought about it, I realized, we're only here for one lifetime. I
was making more money than I should have. It was time to do
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing his first Olympic Games, Romney has discovered he
cannot afford what these folks are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sydney is the high water mark in investment,'' Romney said,
noting that Sydney organizers have said their budget ``was $1.5
billion, American, but I've read it was really $5.6 billion, if you
add everything in. That's not something you do in the U.S. It's
politically unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it's national pride. For us, it's city and state. I doubt
that somebody in Vermont would feel the same way about the Games,
even the people who love winter sports.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the Salt Lake City committee has rebounded since the
dreary days of February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went a whole year without new sponsors,'' Romney said.
``The scandal sent a shudder through the country.''
</P>
<P>
   One tremor came when David D'Alessandro, the chief executive of
John Hancock Financial Services, whom Romney respected from the
opposite side of Massachusetts politics, threatened to pull out as
a major sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that John Hancock was visibly critical, it sent
a signal,'' Romney said. ``David's a smart guy, a nice guy. He sent
a message. But ultimately he re-upped. It was symbolically
important. I think corporate America wants to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, I was like a deer in the headlights, but we
hired good people, I knocked on doors, and now we've raised $770
million from U.S. marketing. We're clearly on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney concedes that damage has been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not rebuilt excitement and enthusiasm,'' he said.
``The cloudy history has many people feeling less proud of the
Games in Salt Lake City. We let our country down the way we got the
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit, when I took over, I asked, `Should we turn back
the Games?' My personal view is that the best way to make amends is
to replace the scandal with great Games.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Games are going to be run with a budget that cannot
match Sydney's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be like the family that says it doesn't have
money at Christmas and is going to have to get back to the old
spirit,'' Romney said. ``There are 8,000 banners around here
costing $200 each. You multiply it, and it comes to $1.6 million.
We're going to celebrate the athlete the best way we can, but we're
going to cut way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Will his Winter Games suffer because the legal cases will still
be pending during the Games?
</P>
<P>
   ``People can distinguish between athletes and managers,'' Romney
said. ``If the managers are in trouble, so be it. They will get a
fair legal hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been legal troubles in Atlanta and Sydney. The
organizers in Nagano, Japan, burned their records, an option not
available for Mitt Romney. But right now, Sydney is bustling, and
Salt Lake City is 17 time zones and 17 months away.

<P>
   GLOBAL-PROTEST-REVIEW (Prague, Czech Republic) _ Say
``anti-globalization'' and a stormy image tends to come to mind:
ransackers of McDonald's restaurants in France, smashers of Seattle
store-front windows. The police on every corner here and the
shuttered shops reflect the power of such specters. But they
deceive. The deeper reality is more significant: that of an
increasingly sophisticated, intellectually robust protest movement,
mixing idealism with pragmatism, that is fast playing catch-up with
the forces of multinational capital. By Roger Cohen. (Moved in `i'
category.)
</P>
<P>
   FUEL-CRISIS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Listening to Al Gore's
warnings last week that America was being ``manipulated by foreign
oil and big oil,'' or watching President Clinton's top aides argue
their way to a decision to start tapping the country's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve for only the second time in history, it would
have been easy to conclude that the country was in the midst of
another energy crisis. Actually, it isn't. At least not yet. But
whether or not there is an oil crisis, there is no question there
is a political crisis. By David E. Sanger. (Moved in `a' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-FICTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ What's the point of writing
fiction in a world like this? These are the days of miracles and
wonder, as Paul Simon wrote in 1986: We are living closer than ever
to the future, having already been 20,000 leagues under the sea and
up to the moon. We own personal computers. The Internet has made
its way into more than half of America's homes; the geeks did
inherit the earth. Open any given newspaper and the day's events
outpace most fiction on the weird-o-meter. Science fiction writers
create the literature of escape, but are scrambling to outrun the
present. By John Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ More than 80 percent of
American adults tell pollsters that they think that violence in the
culture contributes to violent acts by young people. Even though
the evidence of a relationship between culture and actual violence
is highly uncertain, it is good politics to wax indignant about
entertainment corrupting the nation's youth. Of course, the First
Amendment makes it almost impossible to draft a law that would
place meaningful restrictions on entertainment. Besides, the
entertainment industry is a big source of campaign money for both
major parties, especially for Democrats. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-DECISION-TEXT (Undated) _ A federal judge in Texas gave gun
groups a startling victory last year and set off an appeals battle
that legal experts say could be the most important dispute over the
constitutional right to firearms in recent memory. The judge, Sam
R. Cummings, held that history proves that the right ``to keep and
bear arms'' in the Second Amendment gave individual citizens a
right to weapons. His decision, with its emotional resonance for
gun supporters, was in conflict with the vast weight of modern
rulings, which have held that the amendment merely gave the states
a right to keep armed militia units.
</P>
<P>
   UNWED-MOTHERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Four years ago, as the whole
debate over ``family values,'' single mothers and welfare
dependency reached its peak, Congress plopped a $400 million bonus
program into the welfare reform act. The so-called ``illegitimacy
bonus'' promised $100 million a year, for four years, to be split
among the five states that produced the largest decrease in
out-of-wedlock births, with no increase in abortion rates. Last
week, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala
announced the second round of winners. But what the bonus really
rewards remains murky. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-MILITARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Much has been made in the
presidential campaign about Vice President Al Gore's stint with the
Army in Vietnam, but one striking fact has gone largely unnoted: If
elected, Gore would be the first president in a century to have
served as an enlisted man and one of only four ever. By Steven Lee
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   PUTIN-MEDIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ In Russia, rulers don't just fight
to take or keep power. They also fight to make sure they don't have
to share it. This was true for the czars, it was true for the
Communist Party and, so far, it seems to be true for President
Vladimir Putin, who came to the Kremlin by way of the KGB. This
trait has been most apparent in his dealings with the media, which
Putin, more than his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, seems determined
to bring onto his team. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-CHAVEZ-REVIEW (Caracas, Venezuela) _ Hugo Chavez spent
his first 18 months as president of Venezuela consolidating his
power on the domestic front. Now, with the price of oil nearing $40
a barrel and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
scheduled to gather here this week for a conference of its heads of
state, he is about to step out onto the world stage in a big way.
For those unfamiliar with Venezuela's president, a 46-year-old
former paratrooper who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt,
the experience promises to be overwhelming. By Larry Rohter.

the evidence of a relationship between culture and actual violence
is highly uncertain, it is good politics to wax indignant about
entertainment corrupting the nation's youth. Of course, the First
Amendment makes it almost impossible to draft a law that would
place meaningful restrictions on entertainment. Besides, the
entertainment industry is a big source of campaign money for both
major parties, especially for Democrats. By David E. Rosenbaum.

   GUNS-DECISION-TEXT (Undated) _ A federal judge in Texas gave gun
groups a startling victory last year and set off an appeals battle
that legal experts say could be the most important dispute over the
constitutional right to firearms in recent memory. The judge, Sam
R. Cummings, held that history proves that the right ``to keep and
bear arms'' in the Second Amendment gave individual citizens a
right to weapons. His decision, with its emotional resonance for
gun supporters, was in conflict with the vast weight of modern
rulings, which have held that the amendment merely gave the states
a right to keep armed militia units.

   UNWED-MOTHERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Four years ago, as the whole
debate over ``family values,'' single mothers and welfare
dependency reached its peak, Congress plopped a $400 million bonus
program into the welfare reform act. The so-called ``illegitimacy
bonus'' promised $100 million a year, for four years, to be split
among the five states that produced the largest decrease in
out-of-wedlock births, with no increase in abortion rates. Last
week, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala
announced the second round of winners. But what the bonus really
rewards remains murky. By Tamar Lewin.

   GORE-MILITARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Much has been made in the
presidential campaign about Vice President Al Gore's stint with the
Army in Vietnam, but one striking fact has gone largely unnoted: If
elected, Gore would be the first president in a century to have
served as an enlisted man and one of only four ever. By Steven Lee
Myers.

   PUTIN-MEDIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ In Russia, rulers don't just fight
to take or keep power. They also fight to make sure they don't have
to share it. This was true for the czars, it was true for the
Communist Party and, so far, it seems to be true for President
Vladimir Putin, who came to the Kremlin by way of the KGB. This
trait has been most apparent in his dealings with the media, which
Putin, more than his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, seems determined
to bring onto his team. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-CHAVEZ-REVIEW (Caracas, Venezuela) _ Hugo Chavez spent
his first 18 months as president of Venezuela consolidating his
power on the domestic front. Now, with the price of oil nearing $40
a barrel and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
scheduled to gather here this week for a conference of its heads of
state, he is about to step out onto the world stage in a big way.
For those unfamiliar with Venezuela's president, a 46-year-old
former paratrooper who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt,
the experience promises to be overwhelming. By Larry Rohter.

BRITISH JOURNALIST REVELS IN UNCOVERING IOC SCANDALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Well before the International Olympic
Committee became easy to mock for its excesses and before the
investigation of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal uncovered
internal corruption, Andrew Jennings symbolized a one-man, cheeky
and obsessive opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Other reporters were critical, but through three freewheeling
books written during the past decade, Jennings, a shaggy
gray-haired British journalist in the sleeveless photographer's
vest, has made sport of detailing malfeasance within the IOC. His
reporting led to a lawsuit against him by the IOC in 1994 and a
conviction by a court in Lausanne, Switzerland, for his
``distasteful'' portrait of his constant target.
</P>
<P>
   There is little objectivity to Jennings' work; his reporting
includes heavy doses of ridicule. He is convinced that Juan Antonio
Samaranch's 20 years as IOC president have shown him to be no less
an authoritarian than he was during his service in Generalissimo
Francisco Franco's fascist government in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franco was his mentor and Samaranch hasn't changed,'' Jennings
said. ``He learned the gift-giving culture from Franco. He did
nothing about corruption until Salt Lake, because that's what
dictators do.''
</P>
<P>
   There is great glee and passion in this stance; it makes
Jennings chortle and rant, and it shapes almost everything he says.
He is elated to leaf through his new book, ``The Great Olympic
Swindle'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), and display newly found photographs
of Samaranch in his Franco-era togs _ ``his funny clothes,''
Jennings calls them.
</P>
<P>
   He is no less amused to turn to another photo, one of Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz, holding his head in one hand during the vague and
unprepared testimony at a hearing last year when Anita DeFrantz, an
IOC member from the United States, said that she could not remember
the organization's budget.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Jennings is reveling in essentially being right
about the IOC. Maybe not in every detail, but Jennings' books
largely foreshadowed the revelations about corruption in the
organization that came to light when the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal erupted in late 1998 and forced the IOC into reforms that
Jennings calls drivel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're third-rate clowns,'' he said of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor of the All Seasons Menzies Hotel, where the
news media watched the IOC's pre-Olympic session by closed-circuit
television, Jennings was interviewed more than he worked. His
yellow cell phone rang incessantly. He chatted in a coffee shop or
while reclining on a lobby couch. His voice, filled with high
spirits and cool calculation, could be heard well above most
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt Lake was my vindication,'' he said. ``I got interviewed
even more after the scandal first broke.''
</P>
<P>
   The bull market in Jennings' loquaciousness rose here recently
because his book _ which described the alleged organized crime
connections of Gafur Rakhimov, an international boxing official
from Uzbekistan _ came out several months before the Australian
government decided this month to bar Rakhimov from entering the
country because of national security concerns. Rakhimov has denied
any links to organized crime, and Samaranch pressed the Australians
to allow Rakhimov to attend the Games, but the government stood by
its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine my happiness when The Australian commissioned me to
write an article about it,'' he said, referring to a newspaper.
``And they gave a freelancer a front-page byline with a picture!''
</P>
<P>
   More controversy occurred when the makers of a German
documentary about the IOC's recovery from the Salt Lake City
scandal received unprecedented access. Franklin Servan-Schreiber,
an IOC spokesman, wore a miniature microphone that picked up an
embarrassing exchange involving Kevan Gosper, Australia's IOC vice
president. What Servan-Schreiber did not know was that Jennings was
hired to write the documentary. Jennings added the revelations
about Rakhimov, whose dossiers from the FBI and British and Russian
authorities are posted on Jennings' Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Franklin,'' Jennings said, with little sympathy. ``I
didn't film it, but I played a significant role.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is usually outraged and frequently outrageous. One
evening the week before the Games opened, he stood in the back of a
news conference held by Francois Carrard, the IOC's
director-general, and fired a question about Mohamad Hasan, the
IOC's Indonesian member being held on charges of financial
corruption by his government. Samaranch tried to persuade the
Indonesian attorney general to free Hasan, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings shouted his question about Hasan, his familiar voice
creating a knowing murmur from other reporters, something he
prefers to think is borne of anticipation, not contempt for his
clamorous presence. ``A lot of us would be keen to hear how a man
so patently evil, a man detained for so much venality, is on the
IOC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An interesting question, Mr. Jennings,'' said Carrard, who
would probably not respond to a Jennings query about the weather.
``Next question, please?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jennings was not going to get the answer he wanted.
He knows that his presence can be entertaining, but likes to
believe that the core of his question informs ``the boys and
girls'' of the news media, even if the response does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only ask the question to set the answer against the
truth,'' he said. ``Their only answer about Hasan is not to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, who, along with Jacques Rogge, is considered a
leading candidate to become IOC president next year after Samaranch
retires, said Jennings ``writes well, but it's so unbalanced that
it eventually becomes white noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' running theme, Pound added, ``is that every member of
the IOC is a raging crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound and Samaranch may be heartened by Jennings' insistence
that he has done all he can and will soon depart the IOC beat.
``I've said what I had to say,'' Jennings said. Asked what he
gained from his decade of informed scorn about the organization,
Jennings cited something he claimed Seymour Hersh, the well-known
investigative reporter, has told young reporters about the rewards
of detailing the My Lai massacre in South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wealth! Power! Fame! Glory!'' Jennings said, his voice rising,
his face beaming.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A foot of snow fell in parts of Wyoming on Saturday as a jet
stream disturbance combined with chilly air from Canada to bring
the season's first heavy snow to the Rockies. Sunday, the
disturbance will reach the Plains, causing a cool rain in Kansas
and Oklahoma. Snow is likely early Sunday in parts of eastern
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico will fuel
thunderstorms from Central Texas to the lower Mississippi and
Tennessee valleys. A few of the storms will be severe with damaging
winds and hail.
</P>
<P>
   Partial sunshine and warm weather will cover the Eastern
seaboard, though a brief afternoon shower may occur in the
Northeast as a cool front approaches from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, cloudy and cool weather will cover the Great Lakes
while the West Coast stays dry and warm.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MAXI TORNADO
</P>
<P>
   A damage survey in the aftermath of the deadly tornado which
struck Xenia, Ohio, on Wednesday indicated that the twister briefly
produced winds over 200 mph. This ranked the twister an RF4S on the
Fujita Scale, with winds estimated at 207 to 260 mph. Such ``maxi''
tornadoes, which include the most powerful F5 twisters, account for
only 1 percent to 2 percent of the nearly 1,000 tornadoes that
occur each year in the United States. Maxi tornadoes that strike
highly populated areas are even less common. Yet they account for
approximately two-thirds of all twister-related deaths. &QL;

COMMENTARY: TIN CUP COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Liberties)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An opulent mansion drenched in sex and money, where
business and bedroom adventures abound, the over-the-top saga of a
twisted, dysfunctional family.
</P>
<P>
   It's not ``Titans,'' the new Aaron Spelling soap opera on NBC.
It's ``Clintons'' in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The White House finally released the list of overnight guests at
the White House and Camp David since Hillary Clinton began
campaigning in New York in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And _ no surprise _ a herd of Hillary's donors has been
stampeding through the White House in pj's and calling friends from
the Lincoln Bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Why should she care if people trample the place? She doesn't
even live there anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It's a national embarrassment to have a president and first lady
who never stop rattling their tin cups.
</P>
<P>
   The First Couple have not repented their 1996 fund-raising
outrages, when they sold Air Force One, the Lincoln Bedroom and
lots and lots of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Past presidents were content selling ambassadorships. The
Clintons may as well have listed the Lincoln Bedroom on eBay.
Lately, they have packed state dinners with politicians, donors and
journalists they hope will boost Clinton's Senate campaign. They
even put up circus tents on the lawn for the India state dinner.
They have to jam them in fast _ only 118 days left to peddle the
People's House.
</P>
<P>
   How can they can spend so much time in this awesome mansion,
blessedly haunted by the highest-class ghosts in American history,
and have none of it rub off?
</P>
<P>
   They do not grasp the notion of the White House as a hallowed
place where hustling is off-limits. They're more into a ``Titans''
philosophy _ What if you had  &UR; everything &LR; , and still wanted  &UR; more &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gives a whole new meaning to the term ``hostess gift.''
Guests at Motel 1600, who sometimes even stayed when Hillary was
out of town, gave $108,000 to her Senate campaign and $516,000 to
related fund-raising committees. All in all, they gave nearly $5.5
million to the Democrats in this election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Westchester on Friday, Clinton defended the
Oldest Established Permanent Floating Slumber Party in D.C.,
calling overnighters ``friends and supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have slowly and steadily redefined the nature of
friendship so that its highest expression becomes the writing of a
check.
</P>
<P>
   How could someone who wrote a $100,000 check for Hillary and a
$500,000 check for the Democrats, as S. Daniel Abraham, the
billionaire Slim-Fast founder, did, not be considered a friend?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the donor/friends were listed under the category ``Arts
and Letters and Sports.'' There were no letters, unless you count
former CNN executive and Clinton sympathizer Rick Kaplan. And the
``arts'' were represented by Kenny G and Chevy Chase. The Clintons
made friends in Hollywood because Hollywood gives the Clintons a
lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe was listed on the ``Longtime Friends'' list. For
the first time in history, the president's best fund-raiser became
the president's best friend. McAuliffe has raised money for Bill's
campaigns, legal defense fund and presidential library, and
Hillary's Senate campaign. The Clintons barely knew him before
coming to Washington, but McAuliffe was willing to write a $1.35
million check so they could qualify for a mortgage in Chappaqua,
N.Y. When the president strode on stage at the L.A. convention,
following the transcendentally cheesy Gladiator Walk, the only
person he hugged was his pal Terry.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bill Clinton calls public service his only calling,
that bear hug with McAuliffe illustrated how the president has
mixed money and politics. After all, the lawyers and pollsters and
admen _ and even plaintiffs like Paula Jones _ need to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons complained during the Lewinsky scandal that their
critics did not appreciate the difference between public and
private. But they are the ones who relentlessly blur public and
private. Their donors are their friends and their friends are their
donors. They used our capital to accumulate their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman said, If you want a friend in Washington, get a
dog. The Clintons have changed it to, If you want a friend in
Washington, get a donor.

SHORTER TERM FOR PRESIDENT? THE FRENCH SAY HO HUM. 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ At a rally for his own local party leaders last week,
France's Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, tried to whip up
some enthusiasm for the referendum France is holding on Sunday to
decide whether to cut the president's term from seven to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   A ``yes'' vote would institute the most radical constitutional
reform in decades. Some say the measure _ though only a
sentence-long amendment to the constitution _ would be tantamount
to creating France's Sixth Republic.
</P>
<P>
   But inside a small theater in Paris where Jospin waited to
speak, the atmosphere was hardly electric. The prime minister took
his turn at the podium after five other party officials, who read
off their arguments for the change much as if they were making a
presentation in front of their social studies teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin argued that the shorter term would likely eliminate
France's awkward periods of cohabitation like the one France is
experiencing now, where the president and the prime minister belong
to different parties. This has happened three times in the last 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   A five-year term would also keep the president on his toes,
Jospin said. ``Let him come more often before the French people,''
he said. ``It is a way of making sure he is responsible to them.''
But he acknowledged that the vast majority of French citizens were
unlikely to bother to go to the polls this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, you could scour Paris for a poster on the issue and
not find one, or flip television channels for hours and not hear a
word about the vote. The one newspaper that did bother earlier this
month to print two full pages of interviews with voters indicated
that most felt that the referendum was either too complicated or
too boring to bother with.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout is expected to help the ``no'' vote. But experts
still believe that the measure will pass. Surveys suggest that the
French _ though unmotivated by the referendum _ are overwhelmingly
in favor of shortening the presidency, bringing it into line with
other presidential terms in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the issue lacks the excitement of a
good political battle. On this issue, Jospin and his archrival,
France's Gaullist president, Jacques Chirac, are awkward
bedfellows. And unsure who will get credit for victory, neither has
campaigned much or loosed party purse strings for advertising.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jospin's speech on Tuesday to party officials who are supposed
to bring in the vote was the prime minister's first and only
scheduled effort in support of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac is hardly doing better. Since he dropped his longstanding
opposition to the idea and proposed the five-year term last June,
he has campaigned for the vote on fewer than a half-dozen
occasions. Earlier this month, for instance, he went to a Paris
suburb and parried with school children.
</P>
<P>
   One young boy asked if seven years did not give a president more
time to think things through. ``If five years isn't enough,''
Chirac answered, ``then you were not born for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac was actually making one of his rare appearances to
promote his view when news broke on Thursday that a former aide who
died last year had made a confession on videotape accusing the
president of taking kickbacks in the 1980s. But whether the images
of the former fund-raiser detailing how he ran a slush fund under
Chirac's instructions will affect Sunday's vote remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe it may prod voters to go to to the polls
to increase the accountability of their president, but others think
that France's already cynical voters may stay away to register
their disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone who has run for the presidency since Charles de
Gaulle left politics in 1969 has promised to cut the presidential
term. But once ensconced in the Elysee Palace, the winners have all
let the matter gather dust. The former president, Francois
Mitterrand, called the seven-year terms ``an ongoing coup d'etat''
when he was running for office. Then, he served two of them.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac had always opposed the five-year term until June when he
abruptly changed his mind. But political analysts see a clever
political end run by Chirac, who is 68 years old. He plainly
intends to run again in 2002 and is likely to face a tough battle
from Jospin, 63, who though currently suffering in the polls
because of recent fuel protests has generally won extraordinarily
high approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules of the game, Chirac would be 77 at the
end of another term, which might put some voters off. By reducing
the president's term to five years, Chirac could help eliminate the
issue of his age in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, however, found himself with little room to maneuver.
Having called for the change for years, he could hardly try to
block the issue.

INDONESIAN OFFICIAL IS UNDER FIRE FOR COMMENTS ON TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The appointment of a little-known academic
as Indonesia's new defense minister has raised widespread concerns
both here and abroad not only because he has no experience in
military affairs but also because of the statements he has made
about East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the helm of the defense agency in a Cabinet
reshuffle three weeks ago, Dr. Muhammad Mahfud, a constitutional
law expert, has said repeatedly that the people of East Timor, who
voted overwhelmingly for independence in a U.N. referendum last
year, want to return to Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that East Timor independence has been a disaster
because the United Nations has failed to establish a government
there,'' Mahfud said in an interview on Friday. ``The East Timor
people want to come back to Indonesia, but foreign countries that
were behind the independence movement are creating violent
situations to stop that from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``foreign spies'' instigated the recent violence in the
West Timor border town of Antambua, where three U.N. refugee
workers were hacked to death by machete-wielding militia members,
while Indonesian military and police officers reportedly stood by
and watched.
</P>
<P>
   After the slayings, the United Nations withdrew its aid
organizations from West Timor and has demanded that Indonesia
disband the militias. The groups pillaged East Timor after last
year's independence vote, which freed the territory from decades of
brutal military control. The United States has warned Indonesia
that it risks diplomatic and economic sanctions if it does not act
quickly to control the militias, which are linked to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats and government officials have expressed dismay
over the defense minister's comments, which they said reflect not
only his dearth of diplomatic experience but also the deep sense of
resentment and humiliation over East Timor's secession that runs
across Indonesian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``These type of remarks feed into a national sentiment, and many
Indonesians, even those who are well educated, believe them,'' said
a former Cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong tradition in Indonesia of standing defiant
against international pressure and blaming your own shortcomings on
an international plot. It's a convenient scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Indonesians are still stunned that East Timor voted
for independence and that foreign troops had to restore order after
the militias went on a rampage that the military proved incapable
of controlling.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mahfud accused other countries of picking on
Indonesia, and he repeated many of his previous claims, notably
that the East Timor independence vote was marred by fraud and that
foreign governments were deliberately stirring up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor has been under a transitional U.N. administration
since the Aug. 30 independence vote last year. The territory is
expected gain full nationhood after it holds formal elections next
year. About 120,000 refugees, who fled the militia's mayhem
following the independence vote, are living in camps on the West
Timor border. Aid workers say the refugees are often intimidated by
the militias, who do not want them to return to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Jakarta last week, U.S. Defense Secretary William
S. Cohen delivered a strong warning that Indonesia would face
reprisals if it did not disband the militia groups.
</P>
<P>
   While Mahfud said that Indonesia would abide by a U.N. Security
Council resolution calling for the disarming of the militia in West
Timor, he said it was unjust and discriminatory for the United
States to threaten economic reprisals. ``The world is treating
Indonesia unfairly,'' Mahfud said. ``No matter what we do, how hard
we try, we are always in the wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahfud said that the Indonesian military would begin disarming
the militia groups this weekend in a two-stage approach that would
allow them to turn in their weapons voluntarily before the military
begins to confiscate them. He noted, however, that there several
difficulties in disarming the militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militia are mingling with the indigenous people, and in
terms of race and ethnicity, it's not easy to differentiate who is
refugee and who is militia, who is from West and who is from East
Timor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahfud also said that the Indonesian military, which was accused
of human rights abuses during its occupation of East Timor, is
uncertain just how far it should go to track down weapons. ``If we
are too aggressive then we will be accused of violating human
rights, but if we are too lax then we are accused of not doing our
jobs,'' he said.

CHINA CLERICS DENY REPORTS THAT CHURCHES ARE BULLIED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Leaders of the official Protestant church defended
China's policies on religious freedom last week, asserting that a
record 15 million Chinese now worship in approved Protestant
churches and that persecution of so-called underground Christians
is rare.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference that appeared intended in part to
contradict reports _ like one from the State Department this month
_ that religious persecution in China is on the rise, the church
leaders charged that meddling by hostile foreign evangelists has
caused many of the reported conflicts between Christians and the
police.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the claim that tens of millions of Chinese attend
illegal ``house churches'' is exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some hostile forces overseas are still reluctant to see the
Chinese Protestant church become independent,'' said the Rev. Cao
Shengjie, deputy director of the China Christian Council, one of
two government-affiliated organizations that run the
nondenominational Protestant church. Foreign religious groups use
secret donations ``to attract Chinese into illegal activities,''
she said, and their secret missionaries seek to ``undermine the
stability of the country and the running of the official church.''
</P>
<P>
   The news conference by four elderly church leaders on Thursday
was tied to their celebration of the 50th anniversary of the
Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement, founded to direct
Protestant affairs after the communist victory in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   At midcentury, building a new church dedicated to
``self-government, self-support and self-propagation'' was
essential, the leaders said, because the Chinese people saw
missionaries as agents of Western colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imperialist powers used Christianity to invade China,''
said Luo Guanzong, chairman of the Three-Self organization. ``But
now we have changed the old image that Christianity is a foreign
religion. We've shown that Christians can love the country and
actively participate in building a socialist society.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Christians were severely persecuted during Mao's
Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976, over the last 20 years the
government has allowed the gradual growth of official Protestant
and Roman Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
   Within the legal constraints _ pastors, liturgy and church
construction are subject to official controls, public proselytizing
is forbidden and children may not be baptized, for example _ many
followers say they enjoy genuine Christian worship. On Sundays,
legal churches tend to be packed.
</P>
<P>
   But groups that refuse to register with the authorities have
come under increased pressure, with leaders sometimes fined,
detained or sent to labor camps, giving rise to charges that human
rights and freedom of worship are being violated.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Department's Sept. 5 report on religious
freedom, in 1999, ``some unregistered religious groups were
subjected to increased restrictions _ including, in some cases,
intimidation, harassment, and detention,'' but the degree of
repression varied by region.
</P>
<P>
   Unregistered Protestant groups, often strongly evangelical in
nature, have grown fast in recent years, according to outside
experts who say such groups may have 30 million followers or more.
Their leaders say they cannot pledge allegiance to the atheistic
Communist Party, or accept restrictions on their work to spread the
Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Christians from Asia, Europe and the United States
provide encouragement and funds for this ``house church'' movement,
and in one recent case three Taiwan-born Americans on a brief
mission were detained in central China and expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that some groups have not registered due to
theological difficulties,'' said Han Wenzao, chairman of the China
Christian Council. ``They believe the church belongs to heaven, not
to earth, so they don't get registered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unrealistic,'' said Han, who argues that Christians
should be thankful for the growth of the official church and the
fact that a church-run company can print large numbers of Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church in China is also split, with an
official ``patriotic'' church that rejects the authority of the
Vatican and a large, illegal church that is loyal to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and the Chinese government have reportedly held
secret talks on such issues as the appointment of bishops and the
Vatican's recognition of Taiwan. Earlier this month, a cardinal
from Rome met Chinese religious officials while attending a
conference here.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrests of pro-Vatican priests have continued, while the
Vatican has just angered China by announcing that on Oct. 1 it will
canonize 120 Chinese Catholics and missionaries, considered
martyrs.

IRAN LEAVES U.S. PUZZLED ON CLEMENCY IN SPY TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The reports flowed steadily into the White House
and State Department in recent days: Iran's foreign minister, Kamal
Kharazi, was telling foreign officials, members of the Jewish and
Iranian-American communities and human rights leaders that some of
the 10 Iranian Jews convicted of cooperating with Israel would go
free, and that the rest would have their sentences reduced sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Kharazi's spokesman, Hamid-Reza Asefi, said Saturday that the
foreign minister had said no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion underscores the difficulty of communicating with
Iran through third parties in the absence of an official dialogue
with the United States. It also reflects the personal negotiating
style of Kharazi, a reserved, English-speaking former ambassador to
the United Nations who speaks in a barely audible voice and is
inclined to reply to questions with a smile, a nod or a barely
understandable monosyllable.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, an appeals court on Thursday reduced the sentences
of all of the Iran 10, as they are called in the United States, by
two to six years. But all were kept behind bars, a ruling that has
been sharply criticized by the Clinton administration, Jewish
leaders and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we have assurances? Not exactly,'' a White House official
said. ``This was more a case of drawing inferences from Kharazi's
body language.''
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials knowledgeable about Iran said
they had listened to the various second-hand reports about clemency
and imminent freedom with hope, but not certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have the impression that at least some of the prisoners
would be released,'' a senior State Department official said. ``But
we had no basis to think that this was a commitment or an
authoritative prediction. I also suspect there was a lot of wishful
thinking, both in the administration and among the interlocutors.''
</P>
<P>
   The conviction of the Iranian Jews has been loudly condemned
around the world as a miscarriage of justice that flouted
international norms for a free and fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright added her voice
to the chorus of critics, telling reporters at the State
Department: ``We do not think that due process existed, either, in
the whole way this was set up. So I think this is a disappointing
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where he is
accompanying Kharazi, Asefi, his spokesman, denied that his boss
had given any concrete pledges during his meetings at the United
Nations this month.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in all of his meetings with his counterparts,
Kharazi ``underscored the separation of powers in the Islamic
Republic,'' adding that the court was adjudicating the case in
Shiraz with full independence and uninfluenced by political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Asefi also said, ``The defendants have experienced Islamic
compassion to the extent possible under the circumstances.'' All
that Kharazi did was to ``express his hope that within the
framework of the laws in Iran, the sentences for those convicted
would be mitigated on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Horton, president of the International League for
Human Rights, said he had heard things differently. Pulling Kharazi
away for a brief private conversation during a speech and dinner
last Wednesday at the Century Club in New York, Horton said he had
been told that the Iranian Jews would be granted a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no particular interest in embarrassing him,'' Horton
said. ``His heart is in the right place on this issue. Obviously he
doesn't want to appear as a fool or out of touch at home. I don't
think he was attempting to mislead me on this. But I know I didn't
mishear him.''

COMMENTARY: WAG THE DOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (Reckonings)  
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is still using the four-dollar routine in his
public appearances _ the one where he pulls out four dollar bills
to represent the projected budget surplus, then says that he plans
to use only one of those bills, one-quarter of the surplus, for tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has looked at his campaign's own numbers (or who read
this column a week and a half ago) knows that this isn't right _
that the tax cut would actually use up more than a third of the
surplus. But most commentators seem to think that this is a minor
detail _ a quarter, a third, what's the difference? (About $450
billion, but who's counting?)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Al Gore got a pummeling from some commentators _ and,
of course, Bush's campaign _ over the dog story, in which he told
an anecdote about an expensive human drug that costs only one-third
as much if prescribed by a veterinarian. It turns out that he was
looking at wholesale prices; when you look at retail prices, the
number is more than one-third, though less than one-half. My God!
Does this man have the integrity to be president?
</P>
<P>
   Although both cases involve misstated fractions, they are very
different in other ways. Gore's numbers were off, but the thrust of
his story _ that drug companies engage in price discrimination,
charging what the traffic will bear _ is true. On the other hand,
the intended moral of Bush's story _ that the budget will easily
accommodate his tax cut, that it leaves plenty of money with which
to secure the future of retirees, rebuild the military, and all
that _ isn't at all true.
</P>
<P>
   Just to revisit the arithmetic one more time: Let one dollar
bill represent $100 billion of projected surplus. If we put Social
Security and Medicare in ``lock boxes,'' the remaining surplus
amounts to $18 _ of which $16 will be used up by Bush's tax cut.
And Bush has promised new spending that is more than twice, though
less than three times _ hey, I don't want to be inaccurate! _ as
much as the money he actually has left.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore got the details wrong but represented the basic
situation correctly; Bush also got the details wrong but
fundamentally misrepresented the situation. And that's not the only
difference. Gore told his story once, and didn't repeat it after
the details were questioned. Bush continues to tell his story even
though it is demonstrably inconsistent with the numbers his own
campaign has put out.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Gore has an occasional habit _ odd in someone who
is so obsessed with detail _ of making the story he is telling a
bit better than it deserves to be. And public figures are, and
should be, held to a higher standard on such matters than ordinary
raconteurs. But Gore's occasional overstatements, while
embarrassing, don't come close to those of many other politicians.
Remember Ronald Reagan's tale of the welfare queen driving her
welfare Cadillac _ a fantasy that was not only untrue but
mean-spirited too.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Bush's campaign believe that the dog story offered an
opportunity to challenge Gore's integrity _ and that Bush's own
problems with fractions would not raise questions about his own
truthfulness?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I suspect, is that political strategists believe
that voters don't pay attention to big numbers, numbers that are
outside their ordinary experience. And maybe they're right. If a
candidate were to declare that gasoline costs $1 a gallon when
everyone knows that it costs at least $1.60, he would be shouted
off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bush declares (as he often does on the stump) that his
tax cut will cost $1 trillion, when his own budget numbers indicate
that the right number is roughly $1.6 trillion, everyone shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   This tendency to focus on the small, supposedly revealing story
rather than the big picture may be ingrained in human nature. But
voters _ and the press _ ought to fight this tendency if it means
that minor slips are punished and major fibs are ignored. If this
campaign is about ``real policies for real people,'' then we should
demand that the candidates get the really important numbers right.

<P>
   YUGO-ELECTION (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The people of Yugoslavia
will vote on Sunday in what everyone agrees is a watershed election
for the future of President Slobodan Milosevic, who trails his main
challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, in the opinion polls. But no one
knows how Milosevic and his government will react to the vote, or
how the people of Yugoslavia will respond to that reaction. By

</P>
<P>
   YUGO-KOSOVO (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ With its Serb population
largely departed, and an Albanian population refusing to take part
in Sunday's Yugoslav elections, Kosovo would seem unimportant in
the overall battle for votes. Yet, in one of the ironies in which
the Balkans abound, the one part of Yugoslavia that the West
controls may supply the swing that brings victory for the incumbent
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. By Carlotta Gall.

   FRANCE-REFERENDUM (Paris) _ At a rally for his own local party
leaders, France's Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, tried to

five years. By Suzanne Daley.

   RUSSIA-CAVIAR (Astrakhan, Russia) _ Along the shores of the
Caspian, the world's largest inland sea, competition for resources
threatens extinction of the last great sturgeon population on
earth. After a century of supplying the world with caviar, which
today fetches as much as $2,000 a pound in Geneva, Paris and New
York, the Caspian sturgeon population, 70 percent of the world's
reserves, is being harvested at a rate that can be sustained for
only a few more years, experts and law enforcement officials say.

begins just 40 miles away, this castle is haunted. As the Czech
authorities make final preparations to switch on Temelin's first
reactor, fiercely antinuclear Austria has intensified its threats
to block the Czech Republic's effort to join the European Union. By

   ANGOLA-OIL (Aboard the Pride Angola, off Ambriz, Angola) _ Next
year Angola hopes to pump a million barrels of oil daily from the
ocean floor. By 2010 rigs like this one may export more crude than
Kuwait. But if the gods rained gold on Angola, the wealth has been
largely consumed by the government and its war machine, fueling
what has become the continent's longest-running civil conflict. By

But the spy agency has so thoroughly penetrated Peruvian government

the state's security system will be difficult to carry out, even if
Fujimori really means what he says. By Larry Rohter.

railroad developers are determined to push a new generation of

   HOUSTON-SMOG (Houston) _ For decades, the stench of the nearby

summer breezes often carried a brown haze over the downtown skyline
and, with it, an odor that the business elite regarded as the sweet
smell of money. ``Smell that,'' went a popular local refrain during
the 1960s. ``That's prosperity.'' But no one is bragging about the

big oil, big drug companies, big health insurers, big polluters.

HUMBLING DAYS FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE'S SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ The court clerk choked up as he recalled his
agony of conscience. One justice called the last six months a
nightmare. Another said the court was made up of five prima donnas.
And Thursday, a former justice who resigned amid scandal discussed
the humiliation of his publicly torturous divorce.
</P>
<P>
   These are humbling days for the highest court in New Hampshire,
as the impeachment trial of the court's chief justice puts it on
display on live public television, its justices stripped of their
robes, baring their feelings and foibles for all the state to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just about words, it's about human beings, and the
ambiguity that comes with everyone just trying to make their way
through life, and trying to remember what did they say, and what
did they do, and why did they do it?'' said Albert E. Scherr,
associate dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center here. ``It's
almost operatic in the story lines that are playing out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Drama aside, legal authorities like Dean Scherr say the trial,
which has lasted a week and is expected to continue at least
another week, also carries broad legal and political significance.
In particular, it highlights the tension in many states, some say,
between the need to keep the courts safely removed from political
meddling and the need to keep a strong check on a court's power
when it steps out of line.
</P>
<P>
   Where this trial fits in that picture is open to interpretation:
Some New Hampshire observers see the Legislature's impeachment of
Chief Justice David Brock as payback for politically unpopular
decisions that the Supreme Court has made, particularly one that
revamped the state's system for paying for schools. Others see the
trial as a necessary housecleaning by lawmakers of a judicial
system that got too chummy with old-boy connections and too sloppy
with ethical practices.
</P>
<P>
   What is undisputable is that the trial is lifting the curtain
behind which the court operates, revealing it in all its complex
dynamics, including the isolation some justices say they feel in
their legal seclusion where the phone rarely rings, the feeling of
family they develop together and the tensions that arise around
disputes over law and proper behavior.
</P>
<P>
   When Justice John T. Broderick Jr. decided that he had to report
a colleague in an ethical violation, ``It was like a death in the
family, that's what it felt like,'' he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was that ethical violation that ultimately led to the current
trial: Justice W. Stephen Thayer III, who has since resigned and
been given immunity in the case by prosecutors, was in the middle
of a divorce. His wife, Judith, former chairwoman of the state
board of education, was appealing a decision in the case. Thayer's
colleagues all recused themselves from hearing it. So other judges
were needed to serve on a special panel for the Thayer divorce.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, according to a report by the state attorney general
and recent testimony, Thayer explosively objected to the choice of
a particular judge for that panel. In response, Brock tried to
prevent the court clerk, Howard Zibel, from calling that judge but
was too late.
</P>
<P>
   It had been known for months that Zibel had acted as a critical
whistleblower by reporting the incident in a memo to a judicial
watchdog panel; what had not been quite clear until he testified
last week was just how badly Zibel had agonized before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He kept thinking, Zibel said, about a colleague's recent talk
describing how court clerks had handled the transport orders for
the Jewish children of Vichy France in World War II; he had lost
his great-grandparents in the Holocaust, he said, and while he was
not equating the ethical dilemma of the Vichy court clerks to his
own, still, ``I think all of that has a bearing on why I couldn't
sleep that night,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he said, was that ``my obligation was to report
unprofessional conduct, and this crossed a line I couldn't abide.''
</P>
<P>
   Broderick, who also reported Thayer, described sleeplessness of
his own, and agonizing through ``a week I would not want to
relive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the choice I would make, and the court would make,
would be to ultimately end a person's professional life at age
54,'' he said, referring to Thayer. ``I would pass that cross to
anyone in this room. I didn't want it. He was my friend. He was my
colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Brock, 64, stands accused on four articles of
impeachment: of making a phone call to a Superior Court judge 13
years ago seeking to influence a case; of allowing Thayer to
influence the appointment of judges in his own case; of allowing
judges to comment on cases from which they had recused themselves,
and of repeatedly lying under oath. He denies lying or seeking
undue influence, and says that while he has made mistakes, nothing
rises to the level of an impeachable crime. The court's recusal
policy has been overhauled since the case began, as has the state's
procedure for appointing justices.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer and other justices also testified that though they
sometimes commented on cases that they had recused themselves from,
they never saw a justice try to change the outcome of a case in his
own interest.
</P>
<P>
   Brock is expected to take the stand in his defense, and has been
attending every day, a snowy-haired, ruddy-faced figure accompanied
by his wife and sometimes some of their six children. Several
colleagues have said that one of Brock's daughters had been found
to have cancer just before the Thayer incident, and he could well
have been distracted and under unusual stress.
</P>
<P>
   Every justice to speak has praised Brock; Justice Sherman Horton
said that though ``the court consists of five prima donnas and
they've all got their own ideas,'' Brock ``does an excellent job of
moving the ball forward with five prima donnas, and I don't think I
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the trial is no easy call, legal observers say.
Though some New Hampshire state representatives who backed
impeachment said they expected that their charges would not
withstand the state Senate trial, no one is confidently predicting
the verdict. The 22 senators who are hearing the case are keeping
their views to themselves, though some do sometimes betray a slight
predilection toward speeding the trial, which is inconveniently
scheduled just as campaigns are heating up.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick may have offered the saddest assessment of the
situation: ``There are no winners here. I feel badly for Justice
Thayer, for the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, for the time,
effort and money that's gone into this whole process.''

HOUSTON, HURTING ECONOMICALLY FROM SMOG, SEEKS REMEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For decades, the stench of the nearby refineries never
seemed to concern city leaders here. The hot summer breezes often
carried a brown haze over the downtown skyline and, with it, an
odor that the business elite regarded as the sweet smell of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smell that,'' went a popular local refrain during the 1960s.
``That's prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one is bragging about the city's bad air anymore. This
year, Houston is narrowly leading Los Angeles for the unwanted
title of the nation's smog capital. It had 38 days in which smog
levels exceeded federal standards. The Environmental Protection
Agency is threatening sanctions if something is not done. On
Monday, readings of ozone, a primary ingredient in smog, were so
high that residents in some neighborhoods were advised to stay
indoors.
</P>
<P>
   So, for Houston, famous for its lack of zoning and its pursuit
of free-wheeling capitalism, the polluted skies are forcing the
city to do something that once seemed almost blasphemous here _
submit to government regulation. Even more, the proposed remedy
calls for self-restraint that represents a major philosophical
shift in this city.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ultimately, the same economic self-interest that fueled
Houston's unchecked growth is shaping its response to its air
quality problems. In a new economy that prizes ``clean'' industries
over polluting manufacturers, Houston is at a competitive
disadvantage. Local technology companies are finding it harder to
recruit employees, while business leaders fear that the city's
image as the ``pollution capital'' is hurting its efforts to
recruit companies and industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely necessary that we solve this problem if we
want to continue having economic growth and the lifestyle to which
we are accustomed,'' said George Beatty Jr., an official with the
Greater Houston Partnership, the region's chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Despite broad agreement on the severity of the problem, there is
plenty of opposition to the proposed solution. Last week, state
officials held public hearings on a 19-point proposal to bring
Houston into compliance with the federal Clean Air Act by 2007. The
plan mandates a 90 percent reduction of industrial emissions, bans
the use of heavy construction equipment and lawn mowers in the
morning, reduces speed limits on highways and calls for coating new
air-conditioning condensers with an experimental spray that
supposedly eats ozone.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, 800 furious people in suburban Brazoria County
threatened to sue. They said they should be exempted because most
of the pollution is generated elsewhere. On Tuesday, the
air-conditioning industry argued that the condenser spray is
unproven and would double prices. Landscape architects and
contractors blanched at restricting work hours, and leaders of the
petrochemical industry suggested that a 90 percent reduction in
emissions might be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough on a lot of people,'' Commissioner
Ralph Marquez of the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission said at a hearing Tuesday in downtown Houston. ``But the
consequences of not doing it are greater.''
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest burden falls on the petrochemical companies that
dominated the local economy until the collapse of the oil economy
during the 1980s. The companies are responsible for the bulk of the
pollution. Even today, nearly half of the petrochemical capacity in
the United States remains on the eastern side of Harris County,
which includes Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clean air is important and has to be achieved, but at the same
time we have to maintain a strong economy,'' said Paula McLemore, a
chemical company executive speaking for the East Harris County
Manufacturers Association, which represents 120 plants and
refineries.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore said her group was encouraging its members to do
everything possible to meet the proposed goals, but she added that
technology might not exist to enable every industry to reduce
emissions 90 percent. ``Technology exists to get us to the 70 or 75
percent level,'' she said. ``Beyond that, it remains to be seen.''
She added, ``We're going to support this to the best of our
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the same men who ran the city's refineries also ran
the city, and did so with the attitude that government should stay
out of the way of business and development. As a result, Houston
has perhaps the worst urban sprawl in the nation; its borders
encompass 617 square miles, enough space to contain Chicago,
Philadelphia, Baltimore and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place where you could make a lot of money, a place
where the entrepreneurial spirit was unmolested,'' said Stephen
Klineberg, a Rice University sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   But public criticism of the refineries is becoming increasingly
acute. At Tuesday's hearing, one man called for a moratorium on new
petrochemical plants, an unthinkable proposition in the past.
Another woman criticized state officials for approving plans to
expand the Port of Houston and to build a chemical plant near the
suburb of Clear Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first recommendation is simple, and it falls under what is
called common sense,'' said Tamara Maschino of Clear Lake. ``You
clean up what you got before you add any more pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Klineberg, who conducts an annual survey of attitudes in
Houston, said the changing attitudes partly reflect the fact that
the city's economy is no longer dominated by the petrochemical
industry. He described the willingness of groups like the Greater
Houston Partnership to embrace pollution reduction as ``a sudden
180-degree turn in the business leadership,'' even if the motives
remain largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal has always been the same _ exploit whatever
advantages you have to maximize profits,'' he said. ``That's
exactly what's happening now. Suddenly, in the new world, our
location next to the East Texas oil fields is no longer enough to
get people to move here.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for completing a plan is approaching. The last of
14 public hearings is scheduled for this week, and state officials
will accept written comments through September. The conservation
commission must make a recommendation to the EPA by December. The
agency will spend about a year negotiating with state officials
before implementation begins in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists note that much of this could have been avoided
had state officials heeded warnings more than five years ago to
seek reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxide, a primary raw
material in the creation of ozone. Ground-level ozone is formed in
hot, sunny climates when nitrous oxides from smokestacks,
automobiles and other sources react in the air with hydrocarbons
such as unburned gasoline. Unlike Houston, Los Angeles began
fighting nitrous oxides roughly a decade ago, and its ozone levels
have dropped significantly.
</P>
<P>
   About 55 percent of Houston's nitrogen oxide is generated by
industry, 25 percent comes from cars and trucks and 20 percent can
be traced to airplanes, trains, ships, lawn mowers and construction
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the home of NASA and the first indoor baseball
stadium, the Astrodome, must find creative ways to clean up the air
without killing the golden egg of its economy. Jim Marston, head of
the Environmental Defense Fund, which is part of a task force
working on the ozone plan, said Houston's businesses must consider
an array of ideas: paying employees the value of a monthly parking
spot as an incentive for them to car-pool; encouraging more
telecommuting; charging lower registration fees and insurance rates
for people who buy gas-efficient cars; and other strategies.
</P>
<P>
   None is a panacea, but Houston must consider just about
anything. At the Tuesday hearing, for example, one woman
recommended using robotic emission-free lawn mowers. It was an
interesting concept with a familiar angle _ her company makes them.

 &HT;    OIL COMES GUSHING BACK AS A NATIONAL PRIORITY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For most of the past decade, the politics and
geopolitics of oil have bubbled quietly beneath the surface of
American life, as low-cost crude fueled an unprecedented economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, like a long-dormant well tapped by an errant drill,
oil has come gushing back as a powerful influence on the country's
economy, diplomacy and politics.
</P>
<P>
   As crude oil supplies have tightened, sending prices to their
highest level in a decade, election-year politics has merged with
consumer anxiety and international gamesmanship to create, for
policy makers, something like a perfect storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have front-page energy news for the rest of the
year,'' said Dale Steffes, executive director of the Houston Energy
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vice President Al Gore who sent the topic vaulting from
the business section to the front page last week, when he publicly
pressed President Clinton to tap the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to help head off high prices for home heating oil in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the October release of 30 million barrels from
the reserve. That's nearly twice as much as President Bush released
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the only other major drawdown in
the reserve's 26-year history.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the reserve is to be used to address severe supply
shortages, not as a tool for governing prices, and Gore's
presidential opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, cried foul.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve ``is meant for a national emergency, a national war,
a major disruption of supply,'' Bush said Friday in Florida. ``The
Strategic Petroleum Reserve should not be used as a short-term
political fix for somebody whose administration has been asleep at
the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his fellow Democrats, though, see the move as a
political triple play.
</P>
<P>
   First, it appeals to consumers in New York, where First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for a U.S. Senate seat, and
elsewhere across the Northeast, where 75 percent of the nation's
heating oil consumption is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it gives Democrats a claim to victory if oil prices
slide downward between now and election day, and political cover
should costs move upward. On Friday, crude oil for November
deliveries fell $1.32 a barrel to $32.68 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, down about $4 a barrel from its peak last week.
</P>
<P>
   Third and perhaps most important, Gore placed the perennial
bogeyman of imported oil _ now nearly 60 percent of the oil the
country consumes _ at the center of the presidential campaign. Gore
has sought to portray Bush and running mate Dick Cheney, both
former executives in the oil business, as the ticket of large
petroleum conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the big factors involved here is whether or not
we're going to have a president who is willing to fight for people,
willing to stand up to big oil and foreign oil,'' Gore told
reporters traveling with him Friday in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1980, when President Carter portrayed the Republicans
as a party whose ``policy was dictated by the big oil companies''
as he accepted the Democratic nomination for re-election, has the
issue been given so much prominence in a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Voters replaced Carter with GOP rival Ronald Reagan that year,
and Carter's projections of an enduring energy crisis fed by
ever-spiraling oil prices faded as the cost of crude abated.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's own successor, President Bush, sent half a million
American troops and allies to the Persian Gulf a decade later to
evict Iraqi invaders from neighboring Kuwait, a move that ushered
in 10 years of cheap oil _ and along with it, the spectacular
American growth largely credited to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, in the fading months of his presidency, has Clinton
been forced to confront the prospect of a serious hike in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The subject was on the front burner two weeks ago when Clinton
journeyed to the United Nations for a summit of leaders from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   There, Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spent
much of their time meeting privately with officials from Saudi
Arabia, the world's largest oil-producing state. Clinton pressed
for production hikes aimed at trimming crude prices below the
$28-a-barrel ceiling agreed to earlier this year by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis later agreed to pump an additional 800,000 barrels a
day into world markets.
</P>
<P>
   As OPEC oil ministers gather this week in Venezuela, the Clinton
administration intends to keep pressing for further output hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is spending this
weekend meeting with his counterparts from the other wealthy
industrialized countries that make up the Group of Seven, in hopes
of uniting the G-7 behind that message on the eve of the OPEC
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card for OPEC, though, could well be Iraq. Ever since
his defeat in the Gulf war, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been
bridling under U.N.-imposed sanctions that limit his oil exports to
2.3 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam could find this a useful time to put the shoe on the
other foot, cutting his output to further tighten global crude
supplies and ratchet prices upward.
</P>
<P>
   That ploy could only work if Saddam's OPEC partners _ the
U.S.-backed Saudis chief among them _ agree not to undercut him by
opening their own spigots to make up for his cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hoping that the memory of U.S. action in the Gulf
war, when Iraq threatened Saudi oil fields, will weigh heavily in
the decisions that Gulf states make at the OPEC meeting in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   In a rich historical irony, Gore's hopes for election now partly
rest on the central legacy of Bush's father: U.S. victory in the
Persian Gulf.

PLANS FOR A WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL LURCH TOWARD APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``It has taken twice as long to build this monument
than it took to fight the war,'' said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio,
the other day as the National Capital Planning Commission prepared
to approve the National World War II Memorial, which would be built
on the Washington Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Kaptur introduced the bill to build the memorial 13 years ago
and, with approval from Congress, presidents and commissions, most
of the hurdles had been crossed.
</P>
<P>
   It should be built, she said, before all of the war's veterans
have died.
</P>
<P>
   After a public hearing in which 100 people spoke for and against
the monument, the commission on Thursday approved it, 7-5, a
surprisingly close vote.
</P>
<P>
   The final approval is expected soon from Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt. His approval would set the stage for a
groundbreaking presided over by President Clinton on Veterans Day,
Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the 1996 Republican presidential
nominee, spoke in his role as chairman of the campaign to build the
memorial, urging the commission to approve the monument to the
400,000 Americans killed in World War II and the 800,000 disabled.
``I think they would agree that this is an appropriate site,'' Dole
said.
</P>
<P>
   The site is between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln
Memorial, which proponents find appropriate because it links World
War II with the heroes of the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.
Opponents say it will clutter the Mall, obstructing the views of
both memorials.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Kramer, who said that he went ashore at Utah Beach on D-Day,
told the commission, ``I am 78 years old, and I would like to see
this memorial built in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He was followed by Virgil M. Davis, who said he was at Pearl
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and opposed the memorial. ``My message is
to keep the Mall clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have vowed to go to court to try to block the
monument, which organizers hope will open in 2003. One of the
opponents, Judy Scott Feldman, co-chairwoman of the National
Coalition to Save Our Mall, said that approval was illegal because
the monument would replace the Mall's Rainbow Pool, which she said
was part of the Lincoln Memorial and therefore protected by
existing law.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, which was designed by Friedrich St. Florian, is
expected to cost $100 million. The Rainbow Pool is to be replaced
by a slightly larger oval pool flanked by two semicircles of 56
pillars and two arches. A wall on the Lincoln Memorial side would
display 400 gold-colored stars, each one representing 1,000
Americans who died in the war.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign that Dole leads has already raised almost all of
its $140 million goal, which includes the monument's cost plus
fund-raising and administrative expenses.

R-RATED MOVIES: HOLLYWOOD WRITING SCRIPT FOR SENATE HEARINGS
SEQUEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the second round of Senate hearings approaches
on Wednesday over a Federal Trade Commission report critical of the
way some R-rated movies have been marketed to children, the
Hollywood studios are in the throes of deciding what exactly they
are going to say and how the movie industry can repair any damage
that the report might have caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight high-ranking executives from eight companies will
testify and answer questions,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the
Motion Picture Association of America, which represents most of the
major movie studios in Washington and administers the 32-year-old
movie ratings system. ``In addition, the MPAA is working to develop
initiatives that each of our member companies can sign on to, and
we are in the last stages of putting that together. I am pleased
that what I think we are going to present will be responsive and
show that we care about doing what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the studios was interested in saying, on the record,
what they intended to tell the senators on Wednesday. ``Frankly, we
have been told by every political consultant in the business that
it would be political suicide for us to do so,'' said one studio
official. ``Plus, it would be rude.''
</P>
<P>
   But several officials were willing to speculate on what types of
proposals the industry would probably put forward in an effort to
convince the senators _ and parents _ that they were serious about
addressing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many said that the new proposals would probably be similar in
tone and thrust to guidelines announced on Sept. 12 by Walt Disney
Co. At that time, Disney promised that it would, among other
things, include more information for parents in its advertising,
previews and World Wide Web sites about why individual films
received their ratings, refrain from testing R-rated films on
anyone under 17, prohibit theaters from showing previews for
R-rated films before any film bearing the Disney banner (all of
which are rated either G or PG) and establish a regular internal
review process to make sure that the new guidelines are followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the last stages of putting together our list and
will probably finish it up on Monday or Tuesday, certainly in time
to present it to the Senate committee on Wednesday,'' Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrusts of the industry's response are expected to be
self-policing and finding ways to help parents by giving them more
information about the content of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the studio executives end up saying, the session will
be in high contrast to the first round of hearings, on Sept. 13,
when Valenti alone represented Hollywood and not a single top
studio executive appeared, much to the consternation of Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., the Commerce Committee chairman, and others on the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Hollywood will be there in force.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report, released on Sept. 11, caught many in Hollywood
by surprise. The report cited instances in which it said some of
the studios, unnamed in the report, had specifically aimed their
marketing campaigns for some R-rated films to entice children under
17. The commission also found instances in which even younger
children were used to test-market films that eventually earned an R
rating. An R rating means children under 17 must be accompanied by
an adult to attend.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate held hearings two days after the report's
release _ and none of the studios sent representatives, saying that
their executives were unavailable or had not been officially
invited _ it turned into a political pile-on and a hot issue in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, whose campaign has received millions of
dollars from the entertainment industry, said that if he were
elected he would give the industry six months to clean up its act
before considering some sort of government regulation. Earlier this
month, however, at a fund-raiser in Beverly Hills, Calif., the vice
president took a more conciliatory tone, saying that his
administration would never be interested in playing the role of
censor.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has been seized upon by many Republicans as evidence
that the Democrats are hypocritical on the issue, too beholden to
Hollywood donors and unlikely to put any real muscle behind their
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the major studios on Wednesday will be Robert G.
Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group; Jim
Gianopulos, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment Group; Mel
Harris, president of Sony Pictures Entertainment; Alan Horn,
president of Warner Brothers; Robert A. Iger, president of Disney,
which includes the Disney movie studio and the ABC television
network, theme parks and other divisions; Chris McGurk, vice
chairman of MGM; Walter F. Parkes, one of the heads of film
production at DreamWorks; and Stacey Snider, chairman of Universal
Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said that he hoped to appear before the committee to
outline proposals that the studios have been able to agree upon.
Each of the studio executives would then testify for a few minutes
and answer questions _ some, perhaps, offering to take action that
would go beyond what had been agreed upon for the group.

40 STATES FORFEIT U.S. AID FOR POOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The 10 states that will not forfeit federal aid are listed in
the 14th graf, beginning ``The states that have ...'') 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forty states will soon lose hundreds of millions of
dollars of federal money that was supposed to provide health
insurance to children in low-income families, federal and state
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The money _ 45 percent of the $4.2 billion provided by Congress
_ remains unspent by the states after three years. It will be given
to the 10 states that used their full allotments of federal money
under the Children's Health Insurance Program, which was created by
Congress, with much enthusiasm and fanfare, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be able to keep that money and use it to
provide health care to children,'' said Helene Robinson, director
of the state program in Louisiana, which expects to lose $63.7
million, or 63 percent of its federal allotment of $101.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   California and Texas account for more than half of the unspent
money _ $590 million and $446.3 million, respectively. Together
they have 29 percent of the nation's 11 million uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   Health care for children has become a major issue in the
presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
nominee, says that Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican candidate,
has a dismal record of providing health insurance to children in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejects the criticism. Texas officials say 100,000 children
have enrolled in the new program since they began taking
applications in April.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said Gore
``should address the problems on his own watch.'' Bartlett said
that the number of uninsured children nationwide had increased
since the Clinton administration took office, and Census Bureau
reports show that the 11-million figure is up from 9.6 million in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   States have until Sept. 30 to spend the money they were
allotted. In interviews with The New York Times, officials in 20
states gave these reasons for failing to use their full allotments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some states took a year or more to start enrolling children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some were reluctant to put up the state money they had to
spend to obtain the full amount of federal money available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some states said they could not find enough eligible uninsured
children to use all their federal money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some states inadvertently deterred enrollment by using complex
application forms and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some states complained that the federal government had
administered the program in a rigid, inflexible way that prevented
them from spending the money for children who might have benefited.
</P>
<P>
   The states that have used all of their 1998 allotments are
Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New
York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Those states
will have one year to spend the extra money, which reverts to the
Treasury after Sept. 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group, celebrated
creation of the program as a landmark in social policy. But Gregg
Haifley, deputy director of the fund's health division, said the
group was now telling states: ``Get off the dime. Spend this money
on what it's intended for. Don't let it just pile up or trickle
through your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Health Insurance Program is meant to help
children in families with too much income to qualify for Medicaid
and too little to afford private insurance. State officials said
the program had done immense good, by providing care to over 2
million children while also stimulating improvements in Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   But spending has lagged behind expectations. Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services, said, ``A significant
portion of the allotments will be unspent.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado illustrates the experience of many states. It has spent
$22.7 million of its 1998 allotment of $41.8 million and expects to
lose the remaining $19.1 million, or 46 percent of its allocation.
</P>
<P>
   William N. Lindsay, president of the Child Health Policy Board
in Colorado, which supervises the program, said: ``If we enrolled
every single eligible child in Colorado, we still couldn't spend
our full allocation of federal money. Our economy is doing so well,
there are fewer eligible kids than what was estimated when the
federal government did its initial allocation of money.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lindsay said, state spending is limited by
provisions of the Colorado constitution. To draw the full amount of
federal money, he said, ``state legislators would have to make
conscious decisions to shift resources to health care from other
areas like public education, and so far they have been unwilling to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress provided a total of $40 billion over 10 years. States
had three years _ from Oct. 1, 1997, to Sept. 30, 2000 _ to use the
first year's installment of $4.2 billion. State and federal
officials said that $1.9 billion of that amount would be unspent at
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Frank C. Ullman, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute
here, said, ``It is likely that even fewer states will exhaust
their 1999 allotments,'' which remain available through September
2001.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   New York has the biggest child health program in the country. It
has used all of its federal money for 1998 and 1999 and much of its
allotment for 2000. Enrollment in New York has reached 550,000,
about one-fourth of the national total, and is growing by more than
15,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has spent $25.5 million of its $35 million
allocation and expects to lose $9.5 million, or 27 percent of its
money.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Edward J. Rogan, a spokesman for the Department
of Human Services, said the state had spent $78.4 million of the
$88.4 million available from the federal government.
``Unfortunately,'' Rogan said, ``that leaves a balance of $10
million. We would like to have spent the entire allotment.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government pays from 65 percent to 84 percent of the
costs of state programs to insure low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, state Sen. Donald Hines, a Democrat who is also a
family physician, said: ``We were not able to take advantage of
some of the federal money, because we had difficulty coming up with
the state matching money. We had a shortfall in our budget in the
last two years. This year we made cuts in the health and hospitals
budget. I don't think we needed the entire amount of federal money
anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico said it would use just $5.1 million of its $62.9
million allotment, leaving $57.8 million, or 92 percent, unspent.
</P>
<P>
   J. Barry Bitzer, deputy secretary of the Human Services
Department in New Mexico, said: ``The federal law and regulations
provided New Mexico with a lot more money than we could possibly
use. We have 30,000 uninsured kids, of whom no more than 1,000 are
eligible for the new program.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida has spent $201 million of its 1998 allotment of $270
million, leaving $69 million, or 26 percent, unused.
</P>
<P>
   Justin J. Sayfie, a spokesman for Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida,
said: ``There was a lag in getting the program up and running. The
Florida Legislature didn't meet until March 1998, and Florida
started implementing the program in October 1998. We were one year
behind the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois has used $55 million of its allotment of $122.5
million, leaving $67.5 million, or 55 percent, unspent.
</P>
<P>
   Eric P. Robinson, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of
Public Aid, said: ``We are aggressively reaching out to enroll
children, but it's unrealistic to think we could have used $122
million in three years. We can't just flip a switch and achieve
full enrollment.''
</P>
<P>
   California, with an allotment of $854 million, expects to lose
$590 million, or 69 percent of its federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Diana M. Bonta, director of the California Department of Health
Services, said the program got off to a slow start under Gov. Pete
Wilson, a Republican. But, she said, since Gov. Gray Davis, a
Democrat, took office in January 1999, enrollment has increased at
a brisk pace, to 330,000 from 56,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ken August, a spokesman for the California agency, said: ``The
application form was long and confusing. It's been greatly
simplified. It was 28 pages. It's now four pages. And it's
available in 11 languages.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has used $4 million of its 1998 allocation of
$11.5 million, leaving $7.5 million, or 65 percent, for
redistribution to other states. Kathleen A. Dunn, a state official
who supervises the child health program in New Hampshire, said the
federal government ``allocated more money to us than we needed to
bring this program online.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Indiana found more uninsured children than
expected, and it has spent all of its allotment of $70.5 million to
cover them.
</P>
<P>
   States may not use the new federal money to cover children
eligible for Medicaid. This has created problems for states like
Minnesota and Washington, which expanded Medicaid eligibility
before 1997 and were already covering most low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota says it has spent less than $500,000 of its $28.4
million allotment. Washington state has spent $2.2 million of its
$46.7 million allocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did something progressive, but we did it too early,'' said
Mary B. Kennedy, the Medicaid director in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia, one of the poorest states in the nation, has used
$12 million of its $23.6 million, leaving $11.6 million unspent.
The state says that its new program covers 11,600 children, but
that 14,000 youngsters still have no health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's regrettable that, for whatever reason, we didn't have our
plan approved until September of 1998,'' said Dorothy V. Yeager,
acting director of the West Virginia program. ``We lost one of the
three years we had to spend the money.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Four years ago, the Atlanta Games played on
with them in the audience, not on the track. Marion Jones was
recovering from a broken foot, Maurice Greene from a bruised ego,
having failed to qualify for the 100 meters at the U.S. track and
field trials. Sitting in tears as Donovan Bailey of Canada won the
gold medal, Greene told himself, ``This will never happen again
without me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Greene ran a wonderfully patient and blistering
race to win a gold medal in the 100 meters in 9.87 seconds. He did
not threaten his world record of 9.79 seconds, but his time was
superb into a head wind and he demonstrated a consistency and
technical mastery that not even Carl Lewis could equal. This was
the 31st time that Greene had run the 100 under 10 seconds, twice
as many as Lewis had during his own brilliant career.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, in the women's 100 meters, Jones burst from the
starting blocks and accelerated with a bounding spring as if the
track were a trampoline. Essentially, the race was over in the
first five meters. She accelerated into her long searing stride and
skipped across the finish line in 10.75 seconds, the fastest time
in the world for a woman this year and the preamble to her attempt
to become the first female athlete in track and field to win five
gold medals in the same Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time U.S. athletes had won the men's and
women's 100-meter sprints since Lewis and Florence Griffith Joyner
were awarded first place at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South
Korea. Lewis actually finished second in that race but was later
declared the winner after Ben Johnson of Canada was stripped of his
gold medal for testing positive for anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   So dominant was Jones' performance Saturday night that her
margin of victory _ 37 hundredths of a second _ was the greatest in
the Olympic 100 meters since Marjorie Jackson of Australia won a
hand-timed race in 1952. Saturday night, Ekaterini Thanou of Greece
finished far behind in 11.12 seconds for the silver, and Tanya
Lawrence of Jamaica won the bronze in 11.18. This was the 35th
consecutive victory at 100 meters for Jones over the past three
years, and even before Saturday night's race began, there was no
doubt even among the competitors who would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running only for the silver medal,'' Thanou said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones reached the finish line with an ecstatic vault but soon
broke into tears as she hugged her mother, Marion Toler, and
grabbed a flag of Belize, her mother's home country. She had been
anticipating this moment since the 1984 Summer Games in Los
Angeles. As an 8-year-old, she had traveled with her family from
their suburban Southern California home to see the torch relay.
That night, she went to her room and wrote on a chalkboard, ``I
want to be an Olympic champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at age 24, she is. Before her senior year of high
school, Jones declined a spot on the American 400-meter relay at
the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. Depending on who is
telling the story, Jones either wanted her first gold to come in an
individual event or her mother would not let her participate
because her grades were insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a broken foot sustained in her second favorite
sport, basketball, prohibited her from competing in the Atlanta
Games and she had to watch as her boyfriend, now husband, C.J.
Hunter, competed in the shot put.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Jones crossed the finish line in a tangle of
emotions _ joy, relief, the shedding of her Olympic frustrations
and the expectation that four more gold medals are possible in the
200 meters, long jump, 400-meter relay and 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 16 years of believing and dreaming about this,'' Jones
said of her emotional outburst at the finish. ``It comes down to
one moment and one race. There's a lot of pressure. To have it all
realized is a huge relief.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt the burden of expectation of her attempt at five gold
medals, and a swarm of moths bothered her at the start, but it
became clear to the 110,000 at Olympic Stadium Saturday night that
she won the race shortly after she left the starting blocks. Her
starts had been troublesome this year, but Saturday night she drove
low and hard from the blocks, hands open, chopping the air, the
exertion of breathing in her cheeks, a calm insistence in her face,
an exquisite fluidity in her stride as her knees piston-pumped her
toward the finish line in silvery spikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beautiful,'' said Karen Dennis, coach of the U.S.
women's track team. ``Marion did what she does best _ explode out,
lift her knees, finish strong. She looked like she was having
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it appears that Jones' attempt to win five
gold medals has been seriously threatened by uncertainty in the
U.S. relays. No other U.S. woman reached the final of the 100,
compared with three from the Bahamas and two from Jamaica. And no
U.S. woman even advanced to the semifinals of the 400 meters. Inger
Miller of Los Angeles, the only real challenger to Jones in the
sprints, withdrew from the 100 with a strained hamstring, and
remains questionable for the 200 and the 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we are still going to be in the hunt,'' Dennis said.
``It takes four people to run a relay. I don't think we're going to
lead the whole way. If we can keep it close for Marion, I think we
can still win.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who is 26, has now demonstrated a reliability on the
track that only Lewis and Johnson had previously achieved. With a
mastery of the science of sprinting that belies his playful
behavior, Greene has now won two consecutive world championships
and an Olympic gold medal at 100 meters. He will attempt to win a
second gold by anchoring the U.S. 400-meter relay next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Greene dedicated his victory to his coach, John
Smith, with whom he began training after the Atlanta Games.
Determined to improve after sitting on the sidelines, Greene packed
his things into a sport utility vehicle and drove to Los Angeles
with his father from his hometown of Kansas City, Kan. He was a
talented but largely unknown sprinter and it was Smith who turned
him into the world's fastest man.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also coaches Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, who won
the silver medal Saturday night in 9.99 seconds. Obadele Thompson
of Barbados took the bronze in 10.04. Athletes trained by Smith
have now produced six gold medals in the sprints. The victories
serve as consolation for the fact that Smith had been a favorite at
400 meters at the 1972 Munich Olympics only to become injured
before those Games and to withdraw 80 meters into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he has a big hole in his heart,'' Greene said. ``I
can't fill the hole he has, but I hope I can put a little back for
him. There's nothing like winning a gold medal in the Olympics. I
owe him a lot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Greene has become the embodiment of Smith's coaching style. He
emerged from the blocks calmly, keeping his head down for half the
race, instead of popping up, and accelerating immediately at full
speed. The idea was to delay his top-end speed until he reached 70
meters, leaving himself a shorter distance to decelerate toward the
finish line. The cords in his neck bulging, Greene finally became
fully upright after 23 strides and he took control of the race with
tactical brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everyone wants to get up and run, he stays down and
drives,'' said Boldon, who trains with Greene at UCLA and who won
the bronze medal at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   After touching hands with Greene during the semifinals, Boldon
slowed slightly, hoping to draw an outside lane for the final. Both
sprinters tend to drift slightly, and, in an outside lane, Boldon
would avoid more contact with Greene. He drew lane 8, but, on the
outside, he did not have Greene to drag him along toward the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he ran tonight, he destroyed us,'' Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene wished Jones luck, saying he would not try such an
ambitious feat. He said he had grown tired after running four
rounds apiece of the 100 and 200 meters, plus the 400 relay, at the
1999 world track and field championships in Seville, Spain. Jones
won the 100 but pulled up with back spasms in the 200 in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish her the best because I wouldn't try it,'' Greene said.
``She's a phenomenal athlete, and it's going to take a phenomenal
athlete to accomplish this. I think she can do it. I hope her body
holds up and doesn't break down like in Seville, so everyone can
see her reach her goals.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE FASTEST WOMAN HAS WORK TO DO
</HEADLINE>
   (Sports Of The Times) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ By 8:25 Saturday night, you could virtually
hear the moths breathing at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This was start of the long-awaited women's 100-meter final.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a booming voice penetrated the silence. ``Let's go,
Marion!'' roared C.J. Hunter, Marion Jones' husband and bodyguard,
and a world-champion shot-putter himself.
</P>
<P>
   This was the most electric day of track and field. Who are the
fastest man and woman in the world? Maurice Greene and Marion
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's victory was the first step in Jones' quest to
win an unprecedented five gold medals in track and field at one
Olympics. Each event will become more difficult than the previous
one.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she felt relieved now that the first event was out of
the way, she said: ``I don't see it as a relief. To me, I'm out
here having a ball. This is not a stressful time in my life. This
is a very happy time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the race, Ekaterini Thanou of Greece
false-started. Hunter threw his hands up. Then, with moths flying
aggressively around the runners' heads, helicopters came buzzing
into the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the false start that was so bad,'' Hunter said, ``it
was the damn helicopter or whatever it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had won her heats without being pushed, had won her
semifinal without being pushed. Saturday night, with camera flashes
slashing through the darkness in the 100-meter final, Jones
decimated the field. She jumped out of the starting blocks, and by
50 meters the race was over. Her time was 10.75 seconds, and her
winning margin, 0.37 seconds over Thanou, was the biggest for a man
or a woman since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days, Jones watched the Games in her
apartment. She watched the joyous reaction of gold medal winners as
they cried, sank to their knees, praised this deity and that.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 24, vowed that when she finished, she was going to keep
her cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I crossed that line,'' she said, ``all of that was out
the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones felt as though she had fallen into a never-never world of
uncontrollable celebration. She ran over to her mother, her
brother, her uncle and three cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately, when I crossed the line I felt joy,'' she said.
``I looked over and I saw my family over there and I pretty much
lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I can remember, they've been the ones encouraging
me and believing in me. From the beginning they were there, and to
see them over there and to have them here in Sydney supporting me _
you couldn't ask for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Her older brother, Albert Kelly, said he kept thinking about his
little sister coming all the way to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with some words on a blackboard,'' he said. ``A
goal, she wrote it down on her blackboard and she kept it there,
envisioned it and followed her dreams. The whole thing she just
wanted to do was make sure that she did the best that she could do,
not just for herself, but to bring it home for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter ended a news conference by saying, ``We have to start all
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is savoring every moment. After the medal ceremony,
she stood near the track, examining her medal. She held her gold
medal and studied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to know how it felt,'' she said. ``Feels
smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' victory was smooth as well. She literally leaped out of
the blocks and hit the track running. Jones nailed the start.
Thanou said she knew after a few steps that she was going for
silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was too strong,'' Thanou said. ``Even in the
preliminaries, you can see this tension.''
</P>
<P>
   In her first heat Saturday, the semifinals, Jones lined up in
the lane next to her teammate Chryste Gaines. The stadium was cold
and windy; all the competitors knew about the swirling winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big factor,'' Gaines said. ``I mean, it's cold out
there. And you know when you're trying to fire your muscles up as
fast as they can go, you got to rewarm up and come over here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold plays with your mind. You think, `Oh, it'll be just like
it is on the warm-up track.' But it's not. Track is a lot mental,
so you have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The million-dollar question of these Olympics is: Can Marion do
it? Can she deal with the cold and the pressure and win five gold
medals?
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, her grueling quest continues: Jones has to run two
200-meter qualifying rounds as well as compete in a long-jump
qualifying round. On Thursday, she has the 200-meter final, and on
Friday she has the long jump final and qualifying heats for the 400
and 1600 relays.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Hunter put it all in context: One medal down,
four to go. Can she do it? Nothing he saw Saturday night was
discouraging. Hunter even compared Jones to the U.S. men's
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she performs as well as she can perform in all of her
events, nobody else is close to that,'' he said. ``That's just as
simple as it is. It's like the Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the basketball team goes out and plays as well as they can
possibly play _ nothing against the other country _ what can they
do? If they don't play well, they can lose; if she doesn't compete
well, she can lose.''

ADORING CROWDS TREATING NADER LIKE A STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The main act came dressed in a wrinkled blue suit,
file folders tucked under his arms. As he stepped onto the stage,
squinting into the klieg lights, he looked more like an accountant
than a performer. Yet the 12,000 boisterous fans who paid $7 each
to get inside the Target Center erupted like teen-agers at a
Smashmouth concert, chanting his name and waving signs that read,
``Let Ralph Debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, superstar?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, is getting
plenty of star treatment these days. Though he has been locked out
of the presidential debates, struggling for media attention and
fading in many polls, he has managed to attract huge and adoring
crowds in the college towns and union strongholds he has visited in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as part of his ``nonvoter tour'' of the Midwest,
Nader addressed capacity audiences of 1,800 in Madison, Wis., and
1,000 in Flint, 1,200 in Ann Arbor and 1,700 in East Lansing, Mich.
Last month, he drew more than 10,000 fans in Portland, Ore., in
what his campaign claimed was the largest political rally for any
candidate this year _ until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   To Nader and his supporters, those crowds are clear evidence
that his campaign has finally gained steam, building a movement of
disaffected voters _ one might call them angry white liberals _
that will put the Green Party on the political map.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the spinners and handlers of the major parties who would
dismiss us as a distraction, we want you to know we will not go
away,'' Phil Donahue, the former talk-show host and a Nader
supporter, told the Target Center crowd Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the great paradox of the Nader campaign that even as
his crowds have grown, his poll numbers have shrunk. When once
Nader seemed destined to break double digits in important states
like California and Michigan, he has dropped below 5 percent there
and in most other states.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, Democrats who not long ago feared he would
undermine Vice President Al Gore are increasingly viewing Nader as
a storm whose thunder has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nader is fading,'' said Amy Isaacs, national director
for Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group that has
endorsed Gore. Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said, ``The
Nader vote has really collapsed, and that is another indication
that Democrats are coming home to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it might sound, Nader does not mind that Gore's
supporters are feeling so confident. For months, he has battled the
perception that a vote for him would essentially be a vote for the
Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So, Nader now asserts, if the race begins to seem like a
runaway, many liberals and independent voters will feel freer to
vote for him. And for that reason, Nader and his supporters have
begun telling audiences not to worry, because Gore is going to win
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker Michael Moore, who has been touring with Nader,
put it this way: ``This podium I'm leaning on is smarter than
George W. Bush,'' he told a crowd at Michigan State University on
Thursday. ``You have to trust me on this one. He is not going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared, but not everyone was convinced. ``I really
want to vote for him,'' Pat Lee, 53, who teaches at a prison near
East Lansing, said of Nader. ``But I really don't want Bush to be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garvey, a lawyer in Madison who ran for governor of Wisconsin
on the Democratic line in 1998, admires Nader so much that he
appeared with him in Madison last week. But Garvey said he would
vote for Gore because he believed the race would remain tight to
the end.
</P>
<P>
   If his recent events are any indication, Nader has no plans to
slink quietly into the night. At every stop, he slashes at Gore's
credibility, using language that might make a Republican blush. In
Lansing, the vice president is ``forked-tongued, Pinocchio-nosed Al
Gore.'' In Minneapolis, he is ``a certified political coward.'' In
Milwaukee, he is an ``identity thief,'' guilty of stealing Nader's
populist oratory.
</P>
<P>
   But if Nader can sound like the Republicans in attacking Gore's
character, his platform is a smorgasbord of liberal ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He would place a moratorium on federal death penalty cases, push
for decriminalizing marijuana, increase federal drug treatment
programs and legalize industrial hemp. He would require public
financing of campaigns and same-day voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   He would also seek to establish universal health care and a
guaranteed minimum income. He would abolish the Taft-Hartley Act,
which prohibits certain kinds of labor organizing. He would step up
enforcement of federal civil rights and antitrust laws, and work to
``end corporate welfare as we know it.'' And he would cut the
military budget by a third, push for the complete dismantling of
the nation's nuclear forces and bring all American troops overseas
back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Germany and France and Italy and England and East Asia
defend themselves,'' he said. ``Against who? I don't know. Maybe
it's Inner Mongolia.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the two major-party candidates, Nader would do
nothing to the Social Security system, which he argues is in sound
shape. Talk of the system being in crisis is ``a hoax,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Winona LaDuke, a Native American activist from Minnesota who is
Nader's running mate, brings her own agenda to the ticket. She has
proposed a ``seventh generation'' Constitutional amendment that
would require federal officials to consider the impact of all
decisions on seven generations to come. She also advocates the
return of all federal lands improperly seized from Indian tribes
and payment of reparations to descendants of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   With his left-tilting platform and shoestring budget, Nader is
not out to win any states; his goal is to take 5 percent of the
vote nationwide, a figure that would entitle the Green Party to
millions in federal matching funds for the 2004 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he plans to focus his energies on states where
either Bush or Gore holds a commanding lead, particularly Texas,
where Bush is far ahead, and New York, Massachusetts and probably
California, where Gore is expected to win handily.
</P>
<P>
   Nader events always draw eclectic crowds of ex-hippies with
graying ponytails, well-dressed professionals, purple-haired
20-somethings and blue-jeaned union activists. And always there are
people protesting things: sanctions against Iraq, welfare reform,
mines, aid to Colombia, the World Trade Organization, the execution
of Mumia Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, his campaign is loose-knit to the point of
disorganization. Planes and meetings are routinely missed or almost
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greens, they think we photosynthesize,'' Tarek Milleron,
Nader's nephew and travel companion, said with a touch of disgust
after campaign volunteers forgot to provide lunch on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At another point during the tour, Donahue asked Nader and his
aides for advice about how to handle a radio interview. When no one
answered, Donahue said with some exasperation, ``It's hard to march
without orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a funny man in private, Nader, 66, makes little effort to
indulge in the small gestures of politicking, like mingling with
supporters or making small talk with voters. Neither does he try to
soften his sometimes sharp-edged manner or warm up his cool,
intellectual demeanor in quest of votes.
</P>
<P>
   And though fans, usually students, frequently crowd around him
after speeches, Nader rarely takes time to work the crowds. Asked
why, he replied: ``Bishops do that. This is deliberative
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people at his events last week seemed to get just what
they had come for: bristling indignation with American politics,
sweeping ideas about how to fix it and strong advice about how to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up with voting for the lesser of two evils,'' said
John Sherman, 61, a coordinator for a food cooperative in
Minneapolis, as he left the Target Center on Friday night. ``I
think it's time to make a statement.''

RELEASE OF SOME RESERVE OIL WILL ACT FAST ON MANY PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced the
release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he said seven
times in 10 minutes that the goal was to deliver more fuel to heat
homes. But in fact, almost all of the oil will be turned into other
products, and the effects of the release will be felt by consumers
whenever they fill up at a gas station, pay for an airline ticket,
or even pay the family's bill for electricity or natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 million barrels that the government will lend to
refineries in the next several weeks from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, 85 to 90 percent will be turned into products other than
home heating oil, Energy Department officials said. Fixing a
shortage of heating oil is like confronting a shortage of brisket,
they said; you have to kill the whole steer, which will also
produce hamburger and sirloin, along with leather.
</P>
<P>
   Refineries will vary the proportions slightly, depending on
market prices for products, but in general half of each barrel of
crude oil becomes gasoline, a quarter becomes heating oil or diesel
fuel (which are nearly identical) and a tenth becomes jet fuel. The
rest goes to everything from lubricating oils to asphalt to floor
wax.
</P>
<P>
   Because of futures markets, which send price signals faster than
oil can flow physically through pipelines, consumers can expect to
see prices declining fairly soon. But because the oil that will be
released must be paid back later by oil companies, prices may
rebound later, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effect is that ``the speculators will run,'' said
Gary N. Ross, the chief executive of Energy Group, a consulting
firm in New York. People who hold contracts today that specify that
oil will be delivered to them this winter will sell some of those
contracts because more oil will be available in the winter, and as
they sell, prices will fall, he and others said. In fact, that has
already begun to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil for November delivery fell by $1.32 cents
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday, closing at
$32.68. Heating oil for delivery in October fell by 4.41 cents a
gallon, to 95.48 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In pennies per gallon, it could be heating oil that sees the
greatest effect, because stocks are so low and prices so high, but
only about 10 percent of households use heating oil or kerosene as
their primary fuel, according to the Energy Department's most
recent survey, in 1997. (That is down from 22 percent in 1978.)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reiterated Saturday the argument that the
intervention was aimed mainly at heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands, overall heating oil inventories are more than 20
percent lower than they were last year, 50 percent lower on the
East Coast. More than 60 percent lower in New England,'' he said.
``The overriding purpose for our action is to increase supply and
help consumers make it through the cold winter.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How big will the effect be?
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and other officials refused to predict. ``The reason
we are doing this is not for price, but to deal with disruption, to
deal with the problems of extreme shortages,'' he said. ``This is
not a price issue.''
</P>
<P>
   People closer to the industry were a little less delicate.
Philip K. Verleger Jr., of Brattle Group, an economic consulting
firm based in Cambridge, Mass., said that the sudden gush of oil
onto the market would probably push the price of crude down by $5
to $7 a barrel, which comes to 10 to 15 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal winter, a typical house uses 680 gallons of home
heating oil, according to the Energy Department. The last several
winters have been considerably warmer than usual, but given normal
temperatures, a 10-to-15-cent-a-gallon price cut, would come to $70
to $100 a household, assuming that the effect lasts all the way
through the heating season.
</P>
<P>
   It might happen that way; Richardson said that in 30 days, the
administration would decide whether to release even more oil from
the reserve, which holds about 570 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The average car uses about 550 gallons a year; vans, pickup
trucks and sport utilities typically use about 700 gallons, the
Energy Department says. A household that owned one of each type of
vehicle would save $100 to $150 in gasoline bills over the next six
months, depending, of course, on how far and how fast they drive.
</P>
<P>
   The price of all goods transported by trucks would also be held
down, too. And because oil and gas are sometimes substituted for
each other _ in electricity generation and various other industrial
uses _ a decline in the price of one fuel would hold down the price
of the other, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The price of natural gas is up sharply in the last few months,
but the government has no natural gas reserve to tap.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced prices cannot last forever, though. The oil is not
being sold, but borrowed, and the refiners that take it will repay
in kind, plus interest, taking oil off the market to replenish the
borrowed stocks. How much interest and how long a term depends on
negotiations between the companies and the Energy Department, but
likely repayment times are next spring and fall, when demand is
lower. Some may wait until then to buy the oil needed for
repayment, but others could arrange to buy that oil immediately
with contracts on the futures exchanges for deliveries next year.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the effect may be to drive down prices now and raise
them later.
</P>
<P>
   But the prices this winter are unknowable; even after the winter
is over, the effects of the oil swap may not be clear. Ross, of the
New York consulting firm, pointed out that two hurricanes have
recently passed through the Gulf Coast and narrowly missed areas
that produce oil and gas, and that in late 1995, Hurricane Roxanne
reduced Mexican production by 50 million barrels. The plan
announced by Richardson on Friday would dampen the impact of any
such upsets, he said.

<P>
   ABOARD THE PRIDE ANGOLA, off Ambriz, Angola _ A mile beneath the
emerald waves lies some of the hottest real estate in the world.
Next year Angola hopes to pump a million barrels of oil daily from
the ocean floor. By 2010, rigs like this one in the South Atlantic
may export more crude than Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Angola's first black government dreamed
of harnessing this energy to improve the lives of its desperately
poor people. But if the gods rained gold on Angola, the wealth has
been largely consumed by the government and its war machine,
fueling the continent's longest-running civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Angola, a symbol of the worst kind of subversion of natural
riches, now teeters on the brink of fresh opportunity. With the
civil war ebbing and oil prices soaring, the government is taking
tentative steps to redirect its vast oil revenues toward rebuilding
this shattered country.
</P>
<P>
   In a detailed agreement with the International Monetary Fund
made public last month, the government has promised to increase
spending on health and education nearly threefold and to allow
independent auditors to scrutinize its figures on oil profits,
which make up 90 percent of export income and have not previously
been fully disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The government apparently hopes to gain access to the fund's
low-interest loans and to shed its image of callous corruption that
has allowed a generation to grow up with only faint memories of
electricity or running water or houses without bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's history is littered with broken promises and squandered
opportunities, and whether President Jose Eduardo dos Santos will
make good on his commitments remains unclear. But the government's
shift corresponds with strong signals that the public is
increasingly unwilling to keep enduring misery.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, people here have stood up by the thousands
to protest the endless war, corruption and wasted oil revenues in a
country that is at once the eighth-largest supplier of oil to the
United States and one of the poorest nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In June, in the largest of a series of protests that began eight
months ago, about 6,000 people walked through the cracked and
buckled streets of the capital, Luanda, to a stadium to call for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Catholic leaders met in the provincial town of Uige
to press the government to respect human rights and to begin a
dialogue with the rebels, who have been considerably weakened by
government soldiers in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   They are small but significant steps for a people who have shied
from challenging a government that often arrests and jails
journalists and demonstrators who question the status quo. But it
only takes a visit to Angola's crumbling cities to understand the
mounting discontent.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, as the country marks a quarter-century of
independence from Portugal, at least eight people have starved to
death in prison because the government did not provide enough food,
the state-controlled newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the children admitted to the country's best
pediatric hospital die, partly because they get inadequate care
there, the hospital's annual report concedes. And while oil
revenues have surged in recent years, the government investment in
health has dropped from 8 percent of total spending in 1991 to 2.8
percent in 1999, according to the International Monetary Fund and
health experts.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise then that Angola, which suffers from chronic
shortages of food, syringes and textbooks, routinely runs short of
optimists, too.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the unusual convergence of recent events has ignited
unexpected flickers of optimism. An international campaign against
diamond smuggling, the primary source of income for the rebels who
have opposed the government for virtually the entire period of
independence, has made it difficult for them to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   The government no longer threatens to kill the rebel leader,
Jonas Savimbi, and promises pardons to rebels willing to lay down
their guns.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, more oil has been found in Angola than
in any other country, and companies are expected to offer millions
just to peek below the waves. This month, the world's biggest oil
companies began frenzied bidding for the right to explore the
latest underwater expanse opened by the government.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, some dare to dream that this bountiful oil _
which has increased profits of U.S. companies like Chevron and
Texaco, helped buy government tanks and AK-47s and reportedly lined
some official pockets _ may someday end up helping the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few years ago, this hope we have now would have been
unthinkable,'' said Luis Maria Perez de Onraita, the bishop of
Malanje province and one of the most outspoken Catholic leaders in
the fledgling peace movement, which held its first national
congress in July.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen two peace accords collapse over the past ten years.
He has watched children die from malnutrition in a country that
once exported food to the world. He is 67 now; creases line his
forehead and silver glimmers in his hair. He has grown old waiting
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times we feel like voices in the desert, worthless,'' the
bishop said. ``Perhaps we are fighting for a utopia. But we cannot
continue as we are. Angola is rich, but what good is that if the
Angolan people themselves do not benefit?''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese, who began exporting oil in the 1950s, made no
pretense of sharing the wealth. And after independence in 1975,
Angolans watched their own leaders turn on one another in Cold War
battles that ravaged the country.
</P>
<P>
   On one side was dos Santos' party, the Marxist Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, backed by the Russians and the
Cubans. On the other was the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, led by Savimbi and supported by the United
States and the apartheid regime of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cold War ended, the fighting continued, financed with
the profits from diamond and oil sales. Savimbi violated both peace
treaties of the 1990s and returned to war, most recently in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But even during a period of relative peace from 1994 to 1998,
the government accomplished little, despite huge oil revenues.
Today, fewer than 5 percent of municipalities have functioning
justice systems and fewer than half of school-age children attend
school, according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   And without the World Food Program, about 1.5 million people
would be at risk of starvation. Yet the nation's oil accounts have
remained largely secret until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about corruption, and I think there is corruption
here and there,'' conceded Hendrik Vaal Neto, the minister of
communications, who works in a shabby office where the elevator
seems permanently frozen between floors. ``But I don't think this a
corrupt government or a corrupt country, no. There is corruption
everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to forget there was a need for rapid re-equipping
of the army and air force, and you don't get that for nothing. That
is why a large part of the revenue from oil had to be used for the
armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation now is different, he continued. ``We are in a
better position, and the economy and social problems of the people
are our main concern. Can we miraculously solve our problems? No,
no one can do that. But now you will see the government doing
more.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as he was speaking earlier this month, government
officials were considering which accounting firm would pore over
the murky oil accounts, drawing up strategies for reducing poverty
and improving health care, and scrambling to meet the International
Monetary Fund's December deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The United States needs Angola's oil, and some U.S. officials
concede that this need dampens their willingness to chastise Angola
or demand too much, too quickly. The government, which has billions
of dollars in bad debts, needs the fund's seal of approval to
restore its creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is unlikely that officials will meet that December
deadline, economists familiar with the negotiations said it would
probably be extended to allow the government more time to redirect
its spending and to carry out reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best chance at the moment that we have of any
leverage on the government,'' said Alex Vines, the Angola
researcher for Human Rights Watch, who has been critical of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility, a glimmer of hope,'' Vines said in a
telephone interview from London. ``They understand they have to
improve their image. But whether their action is very cosmetic and
superficial is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   In their report last month, officials of the fund said they were
``encouraged by the authorities' commitment to the reform
program.'' But the disparity between oil revenues and the lives of
ordinary people is still enormous.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pride Angola, the deep-water drill plunges through the
waves and bores through the sea bottom, using technology
unavailable even 10 years ago. The British oil company BP-Amoco has
been exploring this stretch of water known as Block 18 for over two
years. So far, in every place it has drilled it has hit gold.
</P>
<P>
   Interest among foreign oil companies is so intense that the
government plans to inaugurate direct corporate jet service between
the oil capitals of Houston and Luanda by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not many places around to make these kind of
discoveries,'' said Martin Eldon, the managing director of Texaco's
Angola office. ``That's what all the excitement is about.''
</P>
<P>
   But that means nothing in Uige, where the town clock is stuck at
three o'clock and the only oil anyone seems to know about is the
metal cans of kerosene and gasoline sold in the state oil-company
shop.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when electricity and piped water coursed
through the town and the authorities lined the avenues with street
lights and installed faucets and sinks in hospitals and schools.
</P>
<P>
   These days, hospital orderlies lug in sloshing jugs and buckets
of water to bathe patients and flush latrines. And at night, when
the sun falls, the town sinks into a smoky haze of charcoal fires
and candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I had electricity? I can't remember, maybe in
1997,'' said Natalia Monteiro, a 39-year-old schoolteacher who was
waiting patiently in line for a sack of donated corn. ``But at
least we have oil for light.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For those who mock George W. Bush as a
daddy's boy who slouched through life reaping the dividends of his
name, the lovely Texas Rangers baseball stadium here is a useful
rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Walking around the ballpark as it was under construction in
1993, Bush explained proudly to a Texas reporter, ``When all those
people in Austin say, `He ain't never done anything' _ well, this
is it.''
</P>
<P>
   This stadium is the house that Bush built _ and the one that
allowed him, in a sense, to become a presidential candidate. As the
owner of a baseball team in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, Bush
laid the groundwork for his race for the governor's mansion, and
that in turn may prove his steppingstone to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As an owner, Bush proved himself an outstanding manager, still
remembered fondly by the players who pitched and batted for him, by
the fans he wooed, even by the executives he fired. Bush helped
turn the Rangers into a greatly improved team, and he presided over
the complex arrangements for the new ballpark, one of the finest in
major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Bush became a multimillionaire in the process, setting himself
up financially for his run for the presidency. In one blow, he
acquired not only wealth but also the resume he would need to
triumph in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a close look suggests that Bush got the opportunity to be a
baseball owner mostly because of his connections. Moreover, his
investment was immensely profitable in part because he and his
co-owners were shrewd bargainers who charmed and bullied the city
of Arlington into giving them a great deal, with the local
taxpayers paying more than $135 million to help build the Rangers a
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest welfare recipient in the state of Texas is George
W. Bush,'' said professor Mark S. Rosentraub, a sports economist
who formerly taught in Arlington and is now at Indiana University.
``The numbers speak for themselves. You cannot accept $135 million
from the taxpayers of Arlington and then be against welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his fellow owners even got the local government to
seize the property of other landowners and, in effect, hand it over
to the Texas Rangers so that they could make a profit on it. All
this was shrewd business and a tribute to Bush's savvy and vision,
but critics complain that it is hard to reconcile with his speeches
about limited government and private property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a conservative is one who believes in limited government,
this whole transaction shows how hypocritical it is for Bush to
claim to be a conservative,'' said Jim Runzheimer, a lawyer in
Arlington who opposed the public subsidy to build the stadium. ``He
got the government to pay his expenses, and that flies in the face
of capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush was simply doing, exceptionally successfully, what
sports franchises everywhere have frequently tried: getting
taxpayers to swallow some of their business costs. And to the
extent that Bush's job at that time was to make money for the
team's owners, he was eminently successful.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime friend of Bush's and a fellow Rangers' owner, Roland
W. Betts, noted that the criticisms in effect confirm Bush's
success in doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't he profit off Arlington?'' Betts asked. ``Is it
politically right to pit one community against another? Well, you
have to say that at that point, George wasn't the governor of
Texas. He was a general partner, he was a fiduciary, and a
fiduciary's obligations are to perform well for investors. And
that's what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   `I Just Grabbed Onto It'
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has frequently claimed to have cobbled together
the deal to buy the Rangers in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like a pit bull on the pant leg of opportunity,'' Bush
said in a long interview about his past. ``And I just grabbed onto
it. I was going to put the deal together. And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is a bit like Vice President Al Gore claiming to have
taken the initiative in creating the Internet: There is something
to it, but it is also an exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, Bush acknowledges, came from Bill DeWitt, a
businessman and friend of the family. DeWitt had heard that the
Rangers were on the market and wanted to recruit Bush as a partner
to buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   The attractiveness of Bush as a partner had little to do with
his business ability; at that time, his business record was a bleak
one involving faltering oil companies. Rather, Bush was useful
because his father was then the president and because he and his
parents were longtime friends of the seller, Eddie Chiles. If
anybody could get a good deal buying the team from Chiles, it would
be Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Chiles said he would be delighted to sell the team
to Bush. So Bush, always a brilliant fund-raiser, persuaded a group
of relatives and acquaintances to invest in the team. But most were
not from Texas, and the baseball commissioner, Peter Ueberroth,
wanted the teams to have local owners.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was flummoxed.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Ueberroth and other baseball executives convinced
a legendary Texas financier, Richard Rainwater, to help buy the
team. By all accounts, the attraction of Bush in the deal was his
name and connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly helped,'' Dr. Robert W. Brown, then the president
of the American League, said of Bush's status as First Son. Brown,
a former Yankee third baseman better known as Bobby, added: ``He
came from a very prominent group. I was very friendly with his
father. So it wasn't just a strange happenstance.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's path to becoming a baseball owner was remarkable because
at first he did not put up a cent of his own money. Instead, he
borrowed $500,000 from United Bank of Midland, a Texas bank of
which he had previously been a director, and used it to buy a stake
in the team.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Merritt, who was then the president of the bank (it has
since been merged out of existence), said he could not discuss the
loan because it was ``Bush's private business.'' But Robert A.
McCleskey, Bush's longtime accountant, said that as collateral for
the loan, Bush had pledged oil company stock then worth more than
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a year later Bush sold the stock and paid off the
loan. He also raised his investment in two stages to a total of
$606,000, or 1.8 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself seemed to acknowledge the advantage that came with
his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the president's son puts you in the limelight,'' he told
a reporter for Time magazine after buying the team. ``While in the
limelight, you might as well sell tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   A Passion for the Game
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, baseball has been one of Bush's truest
loves. As a child, he collected baseball cards and was a catcher on
the all-star Little League team in Midland, Texas. As governor, he
decorated his office with his collection of baseballs autographed
by the likes of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. And even these days
on the campaign plane, he perks up when baseball teams are
mentioned and seems more intimate with the fine print of the sports
pages than of the foreign news pages.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's passion for baseball and his deep understanding of it
helped him as he settled into his new role as an owner. While he
initially grated on some Texans who saw him as a spoiled rich kid
playing on his connections, he worked hard and impressed people in
the baseball world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching games from an enclosed suite, as many owners
do, Bush made it a practice to sit and eat peanuts in an ordinary
seat in Section 109, Row 1, right behind the Rangers' dugout. He
got to know all the hot dog vendors and ticket-takers by first
name, tirelessly introduced himself to fans and aggressively
cultivated reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Reeves, a sports columnist for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
recalled that he had initially been skeptical of Bush, thinking
that he had gotten the opportunity to be an owner simply because of
his name. But Bush then wooed him, golfing with him twice and
stopping frequently to chat, and Reeves changed his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him as a down-to-earth guy,'' Reeves recalled. ``He
would come to spring training and do his running and hang around
the weight room or the clubhouse and stop and chat about the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was,'' Reeves added, ``excellent with the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also worked to charm the players, dropping by the clubhouse
and socializing easily with them. He came across as the direct
opposite of the stereotype of an imperious, pretentious owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the get-go, I liked him,'' said Kenny Rogers, who pitched
for the Rangers then and rejoined the team this season. In
particular, Bush became friendly with Nolan Ryan, the legendary
pitcher who had just agreed to sign with the Rangers when Bush's
group bought the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan had been expected to play just one year with the Rangers
before retiring. But he ended up playing five years, and when he
was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year, he wore his Rangers
cap, even though he had played more seasons with other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had ranked sixth in the American League's Western
Division the two years before Bush came on board; they had clawed
their way up to second place by his last year of full-time
involvement. Since then, they have won the division three times,
although it is not clear how much credit, if any, Bush should get
for that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a particular knack for getting media attention,
beginning when he got his mother, then the first lady, to throw out
the first ball in a game. He also managed to get his father
photographed wearing a Texas Rangers cap, and he took advantage of
his family's prominence by giving speeches throughout the region
proclaiming the virtues of baseball and urging people to go to
games.
</P>
<P>
   All this promotion paid off. The Rangers had never drawn as many
as 1.8 million fans in a season in previous years, but attendance
exceeded 2 million each year of Bush's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   It was less obvious to the fans, but Bush also proved an astute
businessman and a first-class manager. In his presidential
campaign, he sometimes describes leadership using the model of a
chief executive in business, and that is what his colleagues
remember him as: a leader who set an agenda, inspired those around
him, acted predictably and was comfortable delegating authority.
</P>
<P>
   Owners in baseball are notorious for being haughty and
difficult, but Bush cultivated the opposite image. Instead of
micromanaging _ suggesting a pitching change during a game, for
example _ Bush proved then (as now) relatively uninterested in
details and happy to delegate to those beneath him. It is hard to
find anybody who worked in the ballpark who did not like him and
did not periodically chat with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always picked my mind about what Latinos went through in
baseball and, indirectly, what Latinos went through in the USA,''
said Luis Mayoral, who was then the Latin American liaison for the
Rangers. ``We'd kid a lot in Spanish. He'd see me in the distance
and raise his arms and say `a la victoria.'''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Bush came across not as a rich boy but as a
notorious cheapskate. He regularly wore shoes with holes in the
soles, until a fellow owner, Edward W. Rose III, bought him a $150
pair of fancy Italian shoes at Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he took them back,'' Rose laughed. ``The way he
remembers it, with his convenient memory, is he traded them in for
two shirts. But that's not the way it really was. Actually, he
traded them in for cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Bush made management mistakes _ the Rangers traded
away Sammy Sosa on his watch, although Bush simply approved a
decision that had been made well below him _ but his management
style also won him fierce loyalty. Tom Grieve, then the Rangers'
general manager, says that owners typically try to tell tales of
their old college baseball days to show off, but Bush won his heart
by doing the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``George came in here and said, `Tommy boy, let me tell you
about my days with the Yale freshman team,''' Grieve recalled with
a chuckle. ``You know it's going to be funny, because that's like a
high school junior varsity team down here. And he was the relief
pitcher! And he says how one day the pitcher really screwed up, and
the coach decides to pull him, and George is really excited and
thinks he's got his big chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the coach calls in a second baseman even though he'd
never thrown a pitch. And Bush says, `That's when I figured my
aspirations of becoming a major league player might not be
achieved.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although he charmed people, Bush was not a patsy. In the end he
fired three key people: Grieve as general manager, Bobby Valentine
as manager, and Mike Stone as president. Stone declined to talk
about it, but Valentine and Grieve rave about the man who fired
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been him, I'd have done the same thing,'' said Grieve,
who is now one of the Rangers' television announcers. ``It was the
logical thing to do, based on the baseball facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they handled the whole thing made me feel better about
them after it was all done with,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who has been the manager of the New York Mets since
late in the 1996 season, said of Bush, ``Once the emotion was out,
I still really liked him.''.
</P>
<P>
   While in baseball, Bush demonstrated a grasp not just of tactics
but also of strategy. His central strategic goal was to get a new
stadium for the Rangers without making the owners pay for all of
it.
</P>
<P>
   A Huge Public Investment
</P>
<P>
   The old Arlington Stadium was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the early 1960s as a minor league ballpark and later
remodeled with extra seating, it lacked the scale _ and the
lucrative extras like sky boxes _ that these days help generate
revenue for a professional baseball team. The previous owners had
spoken with the city of Arlington about renovating the stadium, but
studies had suggested that would be prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a new stadium would cost close to $200
million, and the owners were already saddled with debts and did not
want to inject more capital into the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   So what could they do? Get the people of Arlington to build them
a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts to get public financing have raised eyebrows because
they seem to conflict with much of what Bush has stood for as a
politician. While running for office, he has always called for
limited government and low taxes, and the 2000 Republican Party
platform in Texas (which he does not publicly embrace) explicitly
states, ``Public money or public powers should not be used to fund
or implement any private projects such as high-speed rail or sports
stadiums.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Rangers negotiated a huge public investment of taxpayer
money, largely by hinting that without it they might leave. To a
place like Arlington, already overshadowed by neighboring Dallas
and Fort Worth, the Rangers were an emblem of local pride, and the
possibility that it might lose the franchise was shattering.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there was an awkwardness in the negotiations:
Arlington Mayor Richard Greene, who negotiated the deal with the
Rangers, was a defendant in two civil suits with federal regulators
involving his former activities as a savings-and-loan executive. He
settled one, in the middle of the stadium debates, by paying
$40,000, and he later settled the other by paying $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you negotiate on behalf of the city when you've got a
lawsuit against you from the administration of the father of the
guy across the table?'' asked Runzheimer, the stadium critic.
``Bush had him over a barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene dismisses the criticism. ``George had no knowledge of my
problems; there is no connection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two sides in Arlington agreed on a deal in which
the city would put $135 million into building a stadium; the
Rangers would get $17 million in cash to pay off a debt, while
giving the city land worth considerably less than that; the Rangers
would get virtually full control over the project but be exempted
from obligations of ownership like paying school taxes; and the
Rangers would have the right to get the entire stadium complex for
nothing after 12 years of paying a modest rent. (It would have been
foolish for the Rangers to take the stadium, even for nothing,
because then they would have had to pay taxes, and the later owners
of the team gave up that option to buy the stadium.)
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also contributed a sum to the ballpark that was
originally put at $90 million. But this was arguably illusory, and
the owners were not asked to invest a penny of fresh capital.
Instead, the team raised its share by dedicating future revenues
from seats, luxury suites and concessions _ in the stadium that the
city was building for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayers took it in the shorts,'' said William M.
Eastland, an accountant in Arlington who studied the agreement and
came to oppose it. Eastland, a lifelong Republican, emphasizes that
he supports Bush in the election _ indeed, he was a Bush delegate
at the Republican National Convention _ but he still objects to
public financing of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it anything you want, but it's corporate
welfare,'' Eastland said. ``And I don't like corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, whatever one thinks of such deals for sports complexes,
they have become frequent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say, `Why are we building this for owners
and for right fielders who get $14 million a year?''' said Jeff
Smulyan, who owned the Seattle Mariners when Bush ran the Rangers.
``But the reality is that if you want a ball team in a place like
Arlington, there has to be a public-private partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Smulyan describes himself as a lifelong Democrat, but he has
nothing but praise for Bush. And he adds that the kind of stadium
arrangement Bush worked out is almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rosentraub calculates in his book about stadium
economics, ``Major League Losers,'' that governments in two places,
Seattle and Cleveland, provided more than $500 million in subsidies
for sports, and four others provided subsidies of more than $300
million. St. Louis was so desperate to get a football team that in
the mid-1990s it built a $280 million stadium to attract any
football team that might be feeling restless. It worked: the Rams
moved in from Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, after voters rejected a series of four
proposals for public financing of a new stadium for the San
Francisco Giants between 1987 and 1992, the team went ahead with a
new $320 million ballpark that was privately financed, and that has
been widely praised.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, there was plenty of controversy about the
subsidies for the Rangers, but the verdict that really mattered
came from the voters in January 1991. The city's contribution was
to be paid by an increase in the sales tax, and that had to be
approved in a referendum. With a huge turnout, voters endorsed the
agreement and the sales tax increase by almost a two-thirds
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is the final judge of whether you made money on the backs
of the city of Arlington?'' asked Rose, Bush's fellow owner. ``Is
it some journalist who wants to sell papers, or the people who
think or know that they made a good deal?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the stadium is clearly popular, there is disagreement
about the economic outcome. Supporters note that the local economy
is booming and credit the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the ballpark made a huge difference
for this franchise,'' said J. Thomas Schieffer, who succeeded Bush
as general partner of the Rangers. ``But we think the citizens of
Arlington benefited as much as the owners did.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosentraub, in contrast, attributes the boom to the vibrant
metropolitan area and new malls. The stadium itself, he asserts,
was a losing economic investment, although he adds that he has
nothing against voters who want to lose money as a way of boosting
civic pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I don't like it,'' Rosentraub said of the
stadium. ``I like it. I'm a baseball fan. It's just that it's a
regressive tax taking money from the poor and middle-income people
and shifting it to a very wealthy group of people. It's a
redistribution of wealth upward.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions About Fairness
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the public subsidy, another aspect of the ballpark
project angers some people.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rangers' owners arguably had enough land for the new
ballpark and parking lots, they foresaw that one way to make money
would be to own and develop property around the new stadium. Over
time, a popular stadium could make the surrounding land more
desirable so that it could be profitably transformed into strips of
hotels, restaurants, gas stations, office buildings or even houses.
</P>
<P>
   The owners always tried to keep their partnership agreement
secret, but a copy of the 110-page document, obtained recently,
lists among the purposes of the partnership not just profiting on
baseball but also ``owning, managing, operating, exploiting,
selling or disposing of real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush told a local reporter after buying the team, ``The idea
of making a land play, absolutely, to plunk the field down in the
middle of a big piece of land, that's kind of always been the
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that some of the land belonged to other people.
</P>
<P>
   As a politician, Bush has repeatedly sided with the property
rights movement, which aims to protect property owners from
government attempts to take land or limit its use. Often this issue
comes up in environmental cases, and the national Republican
platform this year _ which Bush's aides helped mold _ has an entire
section titled ``Protecting Property Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, in my first term, we enacted one of the strongest
property rights laws in the nation,'' Bush declared in a speech on
the environment late last year. ``As president, I would follow the
same policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Bush was running the Rangers, the team got Arlington to
use its power of eminent domain to seize private land for the new
stadium complex. At one level, this was simply one more way for
Arlington to give the Rangers an incentive to stay. But the
practice raised questions about fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Confidential memos among the Rangers owners became part of the
public record in subsequent litigation, and they paint a picture of
the owners casting a proprietary eye over the area and then telling
the city what land to seize. In one internal memo, for example, an
owner referred to a privately owned parcel and told the other
owners that it ``sounds like another condemnation candidate _ if
you want to work the site into your master plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the memos, Bush was not directly involved in the
mechanics of the condemnation. But he supervised those who were,
and the process reflected his own philosophy of how to make money
in baseball: move beyond tickets and hot dogs to seek new sources
of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Mathes family was one of those that tangled with the Rangers
when they were under Bush. The family, the heirs of a television
tycoon named Curtis Mathes, owned a piece of land near the stadium,
and agreed to sell if the price was fair.
</P>
<P>
   What would be fair? The city had previously paid $10 a square
foot for a sliver of that same property to expand a road, Horace B.
Kelton, a family member and spokesman, said. But in the end, court
documents show, the city warned off another potential buyer and
seized the property for less than $1.50 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Matheses went to court, and a final settlement gave the
family more than $11 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us seven years and we spent millions of dollars on
legal costs,'' Kelton said. ``It was grossly unfair, until it was
rectified by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers see it differently. Schieffer notes that property
values had fallen in Texas and insists that it was the Matheses'
lawyers who hijacked the process and got more than the land had
been worth.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlements, the Rangers, tough bargainers to the end,
refused to pay, noting that the legal obligation to pay lay with
the city of Arlington. It was only last year, after Bush and his
group had sold the Rangers, that the new owners agreed to repay the
city for the losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a heck of a deal,'' Glenn Sodd, the lawyer who
represented the landowners against the Rangers, said of Bush and
his fellow owners. ``If he was the architect of it, it indicates
some brains on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sodd, who said he had voted Republican in every presidential
election since 1968, added that he would not vote for Bush this
time around because of what he said was his repugnance for the
``dirty pool'' played by the Rangers owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is whether billionaires and powerful people are
going to run the government the way they ran that deal,'' Sodd
said. ``Otherwise I'd be voting for the guy. If it weren't for this
nightmare we went through, I'd be voting for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Road Not Taken
</P>
<P>
   One of the skills Bush demonstrated with the Rangers was an
ability to disagree with people without coming across as
disagreeable.
</P>
<P>
   It was that talent that almost led his career in a different
direction, one that would have kept him in baseball and out of
politics. There had been a bitter dispute among major league owners
about Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner and an old friend of
the Bush family. Bush had been Vincent's most vocal supporter, but
in the end the other owners _ led by Bud Selig, the owner of the
Milwaukee Brewers _ forced Vincent to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bush was on the losing side, he was widely respected
among the owners for his conciliatory style and commitment to
baseball, and some suggested that he be appointed to replace
Vincent as a way of healing the rift among the owners. Several
friends say that in early 1993 Bush was very interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``George wanted to be commissioner, and Selig said he'd support
him but didn't,'' Vincent said. ``And if George had become
commissioner, he wouldn't be running for president. So if he's
elected, he'll owe the job in some way to Selig.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who was then acting commissioner and eventually was given
the job permanently, has a different memory. He said he recalled no
specific discussions with Bush about him getting the job, adding
that in any case a decision on a new commissioner was put off until
long after Bush had decided to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   When he began campaigning for governor, Bush's full-time
involvement in baseball came to an end. But he retained his
financial interest until 1998, when he and his fellow owners sold
the Rangers _ very shrewdly, at the top of the market _ for $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good deal for all the owners. The limited partners, who
had leveraged their capital with loans, made a 450 percent profit
on their investment. And Bush did far better.
</P>
<P>
   As general partner of the Rangers, Bush was paid $200,000 a
year. But, more important, he was rewarded with a provision that
after the investors got their money back plus 2 percent interest
per year, he would get a gift of a 10 percent share of the
remaining profits.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that his investment of $606,000 turned into $14.9
million. In addition, he is likely to receive a final distribution
of another $1 million or $2 million over the next year. That will
amount to at least a 2,500 percent profit.  &QL;

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For those who mock George W. Bush as a
daddy's boy who slouched through life reaping the dividends of his
name, the lovely Texas Rangers baseball stadium here is a useful
rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Walking around the ballpark as it was under construction in
1993, Bush explained proudly to a Texas reporter, ``When all those
people in Austin say, `He ain't never done anything' _ well, this
is it.''
</P>
<P>
   This stadium is the house that Bush built _ and the one that
allowed him, in a sense, to become a presidential candidate. As the
owner of a baseball team in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, Bush
laid the groundwork for his race for the governor's mansion, and
that in turn may prove his steppingstone to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As an owner, Bush proved himself an outstanding manager, still
remembered fondly by the players who pitched and batted for him, by
the fans he wooed, even by the executives he fired. Bush helped
turn the Rangers into a greatly improved team, and he presided over
the complex arrangements for the new ballpark, one of the finest in
major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Bush became a multimillionaire in the process, setting himself
up financially for his run for the presidency. In one blow, he
acquired not only wealth but also the resume he would need to
triumph in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a close look suggests that Bush got the opportunity to be a
baseball owner mostly because of his connections. Moreover, his
investment was immensely profitable in part because he and his
co-owners were shrewd bargainers who charmed and bullied the city
of Arlington into giving them a great deal, with the local
taxpayers paying more than $135 million to help build the Rangers a
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest welfare recipient in the state of Texas is George
W. Bush,'' said professor Mark S. Rosentraub, a sports economist
who formerly taught in Arlington and is now at Indiana University.
``The numbers speak for themselves. You cannot accept $135 million
from the taxpayers of Arlington and then be against welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his fellow owners even got the local government to
seize the property of other landowners and, in effect, hand it over
to the Texas Rangers so that they could make a profit on it. All
this was shrewd business and a tribute to Bush's savvy and vision,
but critics complain that it is hard to reconcile with his speeches
about limited government and private property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a conservative is one who believes in limited government,
this whole transaction shows how hypocritical it is for Bush to
claim to be a conservative,'' said Jim Runzheimer, a lawyer in
Arlington who opposed the public subsidy to build the stadium. ``He
got the government to pay his expenses, and that flies in the face
of capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush was simply doing, exceptionally successfully, what
sports franchises everywhere have frequently tried: getting
taxpayers to swallow some of their business costs. And to the
extent that Bush's job at that time was to make money for the
team's owners, he was eminently successful.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has frequently claimed to have cobbled together
the deal to buy the Rangers in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like a pit bull on the pant leg of opportunity,'' Bush
said in a long interview about his past. ``And I just grabbed onto
it. I was going to put the deal together. And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is a bit like Vice President Al Gore claiming to have
taken the initiative in creating the Internet: There is something
to it, but it is also an exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, Bush acknowledges, came from Bill DeWitt, a
businessman and friend of the family. DeWitt had heard that the
Rangers were on the market and wanted to recruit Bush as a partner
to buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   The attractiveness of Bush as a partner had little to do with
his business ability; at that time, his business record was a bleak
one involving faltering oil companies. Rather, Bush was useful
because his father was then the president and because he and his
parents were longtime friends of the seller, Eddie Chiles. If
anybody could get a good deal buying the team from Chiles, it would
be Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Chiles said he would be delighted to sell the team
to Bush. So Bush, always a brilliant fund-raiser, persuaded a group
of relatives and acquaintances to invest in the team. But most were
not from Texas, and the baseball commissioner, Peter Ueberroth,
wanted the teams to have local owners.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was flummoxed.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Ueberroth and other baseball executives convinced
a legendary Texas financier, Richard Rainwater, to help buy the
team. By all accounts, the attraction of Bush in the deal was his
name and connections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's path to becoming a baseball owner was remarkable because
at first he did not put up a cent of his own money. Instead, he
borrowed $500,000 from United Bank of Midland, a Texas bank of
which he had previously been a director, and used it to buy a stake
in the team.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had pledged oil company stock then worth more than
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ayear later Bush sold the stock and paid off the loan. He also
raised his investment in two stages to a total of $606,000, or 1.8
percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, baseball has been one of Bush's truest
loves. As a child, he collected baseball cards and was a catcher on
the all-star Little League team in Midland, Texas. As governor, he
decorated his office with his collection of baseballs autographed
by the likes of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. And even these days
on the campaign plane, he perks up when baseball teams are
mentioned and seems more intimate with the fine print of the sports
pages than of the foreign news pages.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's passion for baseball and his deep understanding of it
helped him as he settled into his new role as an owner. While he
initially grated on some Texans who saw him as a spoiled rich kid
playing on his connections, he worked hard and impressed people in
the baseball world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching games from an enclosed suite, as many owners
do, Bush made it a practice to sit and eat peanuts in an ordinary
seat in Section 109, Row 1, right behind the Rangers' dugout. He
got to know all the hot dog vendors and ticket-takers by first
name, tirelessly introduced himself to fans and aggressively
cultivated reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also worked to charm the players, dropping by the clubhouse
and socializing easily with them. He came across as the direct
opposite of the stereotype of an imperious, pretentious owner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had ranked sixth in the American League's Western
Division the two years before Bush came on board; they had clawed
their way up to second place by his last year of full-time
involvement. Since then, they have won the division three times,
although it is not clear how much credit, if any, Bush should get
for that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a particular knack for getting media attention,
beginning when he got his mother, then the first lady, to throw out
the first ball in a game. He also managed to get his father
photographed wearing a Texas Rangers cap, and he took advantage of
his family's prominence by giving speeches throughout the region
proclaiming the virtues of baseball and urging people to go to
games.
</P>
<P>
   All this promotion paid off. The Rangers had never drawn as many
as 1.8 million fans in a season in previous years, but attendance
exceeded 2 million each year of Bush's stewardship.

 ARLINGTON, Texas: Bush's stewardship.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was less obvious to the fans, but Bush also proved an astute
businessman and a first-class manager. In his presidential
campaign, he sometimes describes leadership using the model of a
chief executive in business, and that is what his colleagues
remember him as: a leader who set an agenda, inspired those around
him, acted predictably and was comfortable delegating authority.
</P>
<P>
   Owners in baseball are notorious for being haughty and
difficult, but Bush cultivated the opposite image. Instead of
micromanaging _ suggesting a pitching change during a game, for
example _ Bush proved then (as now) relatively uninterested in
details and happy to delegate to those beneath him. It is hard to
find anybody who worked in the ballpark who did not like him and
did not periodically chat with him.
</P>
<P>
   Although he charmed people, Bush was not a patsy. In the end he
fired three key people: Tom Grieve as general manager, Bobby
Valentine as manager, and Mike Stone as president.
</P>
<P>
   While in baseball, Bush demonstrated a grasp not just of tactics
but also of strategy. His central strategic goal was to get a new
stadium for the Rangers without making the owners pay for all of
it.
</P>
<P>
   The old Arlington Stadium was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the early 1960s as a minor league ballpark and later
remodeled with extra seating, it lacked the scale _ and the
lucrative extras like sky boxes _ that these days help generate
revenue for a professional baseball team. The previous owners had
spoken with the city of Arlington about renovating the stadium, but
studies had suggested that would be prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a new stadium would cost close to $200
million, and the owners were already saddled with debts and did not
want to inject more capital into the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   So what could they do? Get the people of Arlington to build them
a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts to get public financing have raised eyebrows because
they seem to conflict with much of what Bush has stood for as a
politician. While running for office, he has always called for
limited government and low taxes, and the 2000 Republican Party
platform in Texas (which he does not publicly embrace) explicitly
states, ``Public money or public powers should not be used to fund
or implement any private projects such as high-speed rail or sports
stadiums.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Rangers negotiated a huge public investment of taxpayer
money, largely by hinting that without it they might leave. To a
place like Arlington, already overshadowed by neighboring Dallas
and Fort Worth, the Rangers were an emblem of local pride, and the
possibility that it might lose the franchise was shattering.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators ultimately agreed on a deal in which the city would
put $135 million into building a stadium; the Rangers would get $17
million in cash to pay off a debt, while giving the city land worth
considerably less than that; the Rangers would get virtually full
control over the project but be exempted from obligations of
ownership like paying school taxes; and the Rangers would have the
right to get the entire stadium complex for nothing after 12 years
of paying a modest rent.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also contributed a sum to the ballpark that was
originally put at $90 million. But this was arguably illusory, and
the owners were not asked to invest a penny of fresh capital.
Instead, the team raised its share by dedicating future revenues
from seats, luxury suites and concessions _ in the stadium that the
city was building for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayers took it in the shorts,'' said William M.
Eastland, an accountant in Arlington who studied the agreement and
came to oppose it. Eastland, a lifelong Republican, emphasizes that
he supports Bush in the election _ indeed, he was a Bush delegate
at the Republican National Convention _ but he still objects to
public financing of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it anything you want, but it's corporate
welfare,'' Eastland said. ``And I don't like corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, there was plenty of controversy about the
subsidies for the Rangers, but the verdict that really mattered
came from the voters in January 1991. The city's contribution was
to be paid by an increase in the sales tax, and that had to be
approved in a referendum. With a huge turnout, voters endorsed the
agreement and the sales tax increase by almost a two-thirds
majority.
</P>
<P>
   While the stadium is clearly popular, there is disagreement
about the economic outcome. Supporters note that the local economy
is booming and credit the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the ballpark made a huge difference
for this franchise,'' said J. Thomas Schieffer, who succeeded Bush
as general partner of the Rangers. ``But we think the citizens of
Arlington benefited as much as the owners did.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosentraub, in contrast, attributes the boom to the vibrant
metropolitan area and new malls. The stadium itself, he asserts,
was a losing economic investment, although he adds that he has
nothing against voters who want to lose money as a way of boosting
civic pride. ``It's a regressive tax taking money from the poor and
middle-income people and shifting it to a very wealthy group of
people,'' he said. ``It's a redistribution of wealth upward.''
</P>
<P>
   When he began campaigning for governor, Bush's full-time
involvement in baseball ended. But he retained his financial
interest until 1998, when he and his fellow owners sold the Rangers
_ at the top of the market _ for $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good deal for all the owners. The limited partners, who
had leveraged their capital with loans, made a 450 percent profit
on their investment. And Bush did far better.
</P>
<P>
   As general partner of the Rangers, Bush was paid $200,000 a
year. But he was rewarded with a provision that after the investors
got their money back plus 2 percent interest per year, he would get
a gift of a 10 percent share of the remaining profits.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that his investment of $606,000 turned into $14.9
million. In addition, he is likely to receive a final distribution
of another $1 million or $2 million over the next year. That will
amount to at least a 2,500 percent profit.

STURGEON POACHING ON CASPIAN SEA THREATENING SUPPLIES OF CAVIAR

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASTRAKHAN, Russia _ On a dusty finger of land in the sprawling
delta where the Volga River drains into the Caspian Sea, Vera
Visokogorskaya is a Mary Poppins figure in a white smock, hovering
and fussing over 75,000 baby sturgeon she is raising in a run-down
state hatchery.
</P>
<P>
   On another finger of the Volga delta, a fisherman named Aleksei
is knocking back shots of vodka at the table of his friend, Boris,
describing their lives as poachers. Like tens of thousands of other
fishermen in the hinterland of the delta, they slaughtered a
mountain of sturgeon this spring under the cover of darkness to eat
the meat and sell caviar ripped from the females to black
marketeers.
</P>
<P>
   These two residents of Russia's caviar-producing region
represent the intensifying clash of interests among Russians and
their newly independent neighbors: along the shores of the Caspian,
the world's largest inland sea, competition for resources threatens
extinction of the last great sturgeon population on earth. Just two
centuries ago, sturgeon were abundant throughout the Northern
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei _ who would only give his first name _ admits that he is
part of a problem that no one in Russia is doing much to solve: ``I
am not Greenpeace,'' he said with mock bravado. ``My anxiety will
not change the fate of this fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Visokogorskaya is proud to be a nurturer, part of the solution.
But the destroyers are legion, and the damage they are inflicting
may soon be irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   After a century of supplying the world with caviar, some Russian
varieties of which today may fetch as much as $2,000 a pound in
Geneva, Paris and New York, the Caspian sturgeon population, 70
percent of the world's reserves, is being harvested at a rate that
can be sustained for only a few more years, experts and law
enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Though Russia and Iran have been stocking the Caspian Sea with
up to 100 million baby sturgeon a year since the 1960s, the fish
population is plummeting. This spring's official sturgeon catch of
400 tons was the lowest in a century and represented a 60-percent
drop from 1999, the Russian State Fishing Committee said.
Scientists estimate that the adult sturgeon population, which
numbered 1.5 million in 1986, has fallen below 300,000. And the
health of many fish is in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Caviar production is expected to drop to 40 tons this year, down
from 1,200 tons in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to have caviar banned,'' said Uldry Thierry, the
chief executive of the Geneva-based Caviar House, one of Europe's
largest retailers, which processes 25 tons a year in a market
estimated at 80 tons to 100 tons. (Americans consume 40 tons to 50
tons a year.) ``But the Russian government has got to find an
answer, and the only answer is stricter controls against
poaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The illegal sturgeon catch is estimated to be five times to 10
times the official catch. Strict export licensing and DNA testing
of caviar samples has led to some spectacular hauls of illegal
shipments to the United States in the last year, but the black
market has grown phenomenally over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the depredations of poachers, up to a third of the
female sturgeon are suffering from chemical poisoning severe enough
to render them infertile, scientists report. And the proportion of
female sturgeon reaching spawning grounds has also fallen, to
between 20 percent to 30 percent by some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very serious,'' said John Sellar, the chief
of enforcement for the secretariat of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species in Geneva. With caviar
bars and restaurants multiplying in the West, Sellar suggested that
``people are behaving in a very irresponsible manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing very well the population problem among sturgeon, they
continue to order as much caviar as they possibly can get and
promote it to the market in an unsustainable manner.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In December, scientists from the convention that regulates trade
in endangered species will meet in West Virginia to decide whether
to declare the Caspian sturgeon so endangered as to warrant a total
ban on trade until the species recovers.
</P>
<P>
   To stop fishing would be an economic and political catastrophe
feared by every national government bordering the Caspian Sea _
Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.

</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet Union rigorously policed the fishing grounds
of the Caspian, but also sowed the seeds for the current decline.
Sixty years of dam building eliminated 70 percent to 80 percent of
the sturgeons' spawning grounds along the Volga, where since
prehistoric times belugas, the largest sturgeon, whose plump gray
caviar is most prized, ranged 1,000 miles inland to spawn.
</P>
<P>
   As Soviet planners diverted water supplies to artificial
reservoirs, the level of the Caspian dropped nearly 10 feet. The
spread of agriculture and industrialization dealt another blow, as
pesticide runoff killed thousands of fish.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the discovery of huge oil and gas reserves off
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan may represent an added threat depending
on how those resources are exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Given poverty in the region, poaching sturgeon is simply a means
to survive for thousands of families here, who send their men out
in small boats at night to kill fish for their table at home and,
with luck, to sell a little caviar on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at Boris' table in a run-down apartment on the outskirts
of Astrakhan, Russia, Aleksei described theirbusiness.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 50,000 people in the area once worked at a paper
mill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it closed, these people had no other way to earn money or
to eat, and so the river feeds them.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In wooden boats, the poachers lay submerged lines dangling
hundreds of hooks to snag migrating sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night is what hides us,'' Aleksei said. ``If you hear the
sound of a motor boat, you hide among the bushes on the shore.''
The motorboats are usually the police, who regularly drag an anchor
behind them to pull up as many poacher lines as they can. But the
lines are quickly laid again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep our catch in the water on a rope and the rope is in my
hand,'' Aleksei said. ``If the police come to my side of the boat
to inspect us, I just let it go. If they come from the opposite
side, I keep my hand in the water and smoke a cigarette with my
other hand and try to act natural until they can see there are no
fish in the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Few poachers are ever caught, and, when they are, they face a
light fine and confiscation of their fish.
</P>
<P>
   The damage from small-scale poachers is compounded by the
organized poaching that occurs at sea by criminal gangs with
bigger, faster boats, satellite navigation systems and possibly the
protection of corrupt police or military officials.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Bios, a state hatchery and research center 25
miles southwest of Astrakhan, the director, Lidia Vassileva, is in
charge of one of 13 fish farms trying to sustain the sturgeon
population by releasing 60 million palm-sized fish into the Volga
and the Caspian every year.
</P>
<P>
   The state company for which she works has developed a modest
business in selling fertilized caviar _ which is, after all, just
eggs _ to fish farms in Russia, China, Europe and the United
States, where the fish are raised for meat and sold to restaurants
and food-processing industries.
</P>
<P>
   Bios is trying to raise sturgeon until they are sexually mature,
a process that takes 10 years to 20 years, and then harvest caviar
without killing the females. The technique has been demonstrated at
a handful of fish farms, but requires long-term investment before
there is any return.
</P>
<P>
   Vassileva's assistant, Visokogorskaya, each year supervises the
fertilization of 20 million sturgeon minnows for release into the
Volga, and helps raise 75,000 sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Moving among their tanks like a matriarch, she snatched a
6-pounder out of one tank. She looked with pride over what she
calls her flock and said, ``In Russia, we have an economic crisis,
but in the world, they only want caviar.''

VOTE IN YUGOSLAVIA IS REFERENDUM ON MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The people of Yugoslavia will vote on
Sunday in what everyone agrees is a watershed election for the
future of President Slobodan Milosevic, who trails his main
challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows how Milosevic and his government will react to
the vote, or how the people of Yugoslavia will respond to that
reaction. And no one believes that Milosevic will suddenly
disappear on Monday morning in a cloud of steam, like some wicked
witch of the east, leaving only his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica himself believes that Milosevic will pick from a set
of alternatives once the size of the turnout and the electoral
results are clearer. A large turnout of 5 million people would make
the election hard to steal, because Milosevic would have to come up
with nearly a million extra votes to win outright in the first
round. If no one wins 50 percent of the vote, there will be a
runoff on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Milosevic knows what to do,'' a hoarse Kostunica
said in an interview Saturday. ``The opposition has not broken, and
my candidacy has attracted tremendous support. In these last hours
they are hesitating, and Milosevic is going from one solution to
another. Those around him cannot tell the emperor everything _ they
cannot tell the simple truth that the emperor is naked. And that is
sometimes fatal to the emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica is confident that the regime is shaken, and that
Milosevic cannot win in the first round if the count is fair. ``But
what the exact results will be and the consequences of two sides
claiming victory is another matter,'' he said. ``We'll do our best
to avoid any sort of violence and tension, but people will be
decisive in defending their victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to an election perceived to be stolen could be
aggressive in some cities controlled by the opposition. Whatever
happens, opposition leaders believe that the political situation in
Yugoslavia has been altered permanently after 13 years of
Milosevic's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won, and Serbia will never be the same after this
election,'' said Zoran Djindjic, who led the opposition's campaign.
``Milosevic will never again be able to claim that he is supported
by a majority of the people. The question is how to implement this
victory. But there is a new reality, this new majority, which will
remain regardless of what happens after Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Djindjic said, up to 75 percent of Serbs voted for
politics founded in nationalist ambitions, whether promoted by
Milosevic, Vojislav Seselj of the Serbian Radical Party or Vuk
Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, a majority of Serbs support a normal
European democracy,'' Djindjic said. Kostunica is himself a
moderate nationalist, but a democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Zarko Korac, another opposition leader, said Milosevic will not
suddenly disappear. ``He's a formidable opponent and it will be a
death of a thousand cuts,'' he said. ``This election is a serious
cut, which will delegitimize him. But it's a process.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's aides say his victory is not in doubt. His campaign
has been based on appeals to patriotism, fear of the future and a
fight against an opposition he has called traitors, NATO lackeys
and ``enemies of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljubisa Ristic, the president of the Yugoslav United Left party
of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, says he supported new
elections within a few months of last year's NATO bombing, and that
it has been a mistake to wait. ``But there is no question that
Milosevic will win,'' Ristic said. ``Whether in the first round or
the second round, it's just a matter of prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic could decide to declare victory in the first round and
wait to see how Kostunica and his supporters react; he could say he
is ahead but enter a runoff, hoping for lower turnout; he could
challenge the results in the courts, citing voter fraud, postponing
any resolution; he could have the Federal Election Commission
declare the election a fraud and order a new election later.
</P>
<P>
   That new election could coincide with early elections for the
Serbian Parliament, where real power lies here. Or he could even
say that he accepts a loss, if he in fact loses, and then maintain
power by concentrating on running Serbia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In any event, in voting that also takes place on Sunday,
Milosevic is expected to retain control over the federal Parliament
_ aided greatly by the boycott of this election by Montenegro's
President Milo Djukanovic. In local elections, Milosevic's
coalition is expected to win back some key towns from the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will also succeed, most experts believe, in cutting
down the power of Seselj, an increasingly ambitious coalition
partner. Milosevic may then turn again to Draskovic, who refused to
back Kostunica and whose party has lost support.
</P>
<P>
   But given the personal nature of the system here, Milosevic is
unlikely to want to show weakness, which would diminish his control
over his party, the security forces and the country. So the most
likely outcomes are a declaration of victory or a legal maneuver
that buys time.
</P>
<P>
   International reaction will also be important, especially from
Russia, which has backed Milosevic. Russia is a member of the
Contact Group on Yugoslavia, which has jointly called for a free
and fair election. A result that Moscow does not support will do
little to help Milosevic achieve the legitimacy that these early
elections are designed to provide.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the regime's nervousness in the last two
days, some Western journalists, especially from television
companies like NBC, Canadian Broadcasting Co. and ARD, the German

POLITICAL MEMO: GORE'S CALCULATED RISK IN TAKING ON BIG BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are bad. Really bad. Malevolent even.
</P>
<P>
   And not just bad. They are big. Big and bad, like those
nightmarish, saw-toothed meanies that lurk beneath the bed.
</P>
<P>
   They are Vice President Al Gore's bogeymen _ big oil, big drug
companies, big health insurers, big polluters. For good measure,
Gore still throws in big tobacco from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   They are out there, threatening America's prosperity. And like
politicians before him, Gore hopes to ride the public's trepidation
about them all the way to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   America has a tradition of populist politics, and in most cases
the strategy has worked best when the enemy has been given a face.
For William Jennings Bryan it was the banks. For Theodore Roosevelt
it was the railroads and other ``malefactors of great wealth.''
William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt
busted the trusts. John F. Kennedy took on U.S. Steel.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been decades since a politician denounced such a
broad array of corporate targets with such pointed language. For
Gore, it is all part of the broader positioning of his campaign as
``for the people,'' and the other side _ Gov. George W. Bush and
the Republicans _ as ``for the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never hesitated,'' Gore said in Pennsylvania on Friday,
``to take on big oil or the big pharmaceutical companies or the
HMOs or whoever was operating in a way that was not in the best
interest of the middle-class families of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most campaign messages these days, Gore's assault is rooted
in extensive polling and focus-group surveys that suggest deep
public frustration with rising prices and, in the case of health
maintenance organizations, confounding red tape. Populism has
proven most effective, historians say, in times of economic
inequality, and Gore's target audience includes those who feel they
have not shared in the good times.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's tactic is not without risk. Another important
component of his message is the taking of credit for the country's
economic health, including the 22 million jobs created in the
Clinton years. By setting his sights on central industries, Gore
may create the perception that he is fighting the very businesses
that have generated those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the risk of being branded a hypocrite. One major
industry that Gore does not group with his litany of corporate
offenders is big entertainment, which he condemns separately in
speeches for marketing violence to children even as he solicits its
executives for hefty campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has been so long since any prominent politician tried
Gore's approach, it is hard to predict how it will be received,
said Alan Brinkley, a presidential historian at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is using it very carefully, making attacks against
specific targets and not more broadly against concentrated economic
power,'' Brinkley said. ``I don't see how he could be perceived as
antibusiness given the very centrist economic policy he's promoting
and has been identified with over time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association
of Manufacturers, said that Gore had convinced the business sector,
particularly the leaders of small companies, that he is against
private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know in an election that things are said and done that
wouldn't happen in normal times,'' Jasinowski said. ``But words
mean something, and these words are irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Gore long ago discarded any instinct to soft-pedal his
message. This week, in speeches about oil pricing on Thursday and
Friday, he pledged to ``work toward the day when we are free
forever of the dominance of big oil and foreign oil.'' Because Bush
and his running mate, Dick Cheney, both served as executives in the
oil business, Gore said the Republican ticket was ``of big oil, for
big oil and by big oil.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gore turns his sights on managed care, he laments that
doctors' decisions are being ``overruled by some bean counter'' who
``doesn't have a right to play God.'' When the target is the
prescription drug manufacturers, he describes them as having ``so
much power and so much wealth _ by all odds the most profitable
industry in America.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim is true, according to a Fortune magazine survey that
placed pharmaceutical profits in 1999 at 18.9 percent. The industry
responds that it spends a hefty portion of profits on developing
new drugs, though studies show that a larger share is devoted to
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this pattern of attack may be good politics for the vice
president,'' said Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, ``it misleads the public
about the industry that continues to develop important new
medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry officials and analysts said this week that they
were distressed by Gore's offensive because, they maintain,
domestic petroleum pricing is primarily a product of foreign
supply. Profits are up this year, but the industry was battered
last year by plummeting prices. Oil profit rates for the first half
of this year were 6.8 percent, according to Business Week, compared
with 7 percent for all United States industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is either extremely badly informed or he's being
extremely disingenuous,'' said J. Robinson West, the chairman of
Petroleum Finance Co., which provides strategic advice to oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, said the
primary impact of Gore's ``screechy left-wing populism'' was to
stem the flow of liberal support to Ralph Nader and the Green
Party. And he pointed out that Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, had received heavy campaign contributions
from the insurance and pharmaceutical industries, and that Gore's
family had profited from Occidental Petroleum mineral leases.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Fabiani, Gore's deputy campaign director, said the vice
president had credibility because he fought against price-fixing in
the oil and natural-gas industry in Congress and was an early
supporter of generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In good times,'' he said, ``you have economic power built up
and sometimes it builds up to excess. Now it's time to make sure
that elements of the economy that are blocking the prosperity of
others, primarily families, is brought under control.''

bar most U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba. If the latter measure
wins final approval, it could prove a bonanza for the Cuban tourism

But the land that once threatened us with Russian nukes has built

   CHINA-SEX _ BEIJING _ Prostitution is rampant in China. From the

the seediest roadside stalls, women are making a living with their
bodies. Experts say it is one of the major reasons for a
skyrocketing number of cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Although the government is
starting to recognize the seriousness of the problem, few believe
it will be brought under control anytime soon. With an ever-more
mobile population, a dismal level of sex education for young people
who are becoming increasingly sexually active and a sex industry
that is almost institutionalized, government efforts to limit the
spread of STDs seem like a drop in the bucket. (Chao, Cox News

war. One of the locals is a new citizen who's working the

cloaking its mistakes in judges' orders designed to protect ``trade

Transportation Safety Administration has many key records.

Georgians are farmers today, about 7 percent are high-tech workers,
such as computer engineers and programmers. In metro Atlanta alone,
roughly 10,000 tech companies employ about 220,000 people. But
while the tech sector is driving up the state's population and
wealth, Georgia's 13-member delegation to Congress remains outside
the inner circles of tech political power. Though they won't speak
on the record, many of Georgia's business executives and lobbyists
grumble about their lawmakers' lackluster leadership on tech
issues. (Geewax, Cox News Service)

   FLIGHT-SERV _ When Todd Bottorff was brought in to help pull

90 percent from its 52-week high, after ranking as Georgia's
best-performing stock last year. A New York money manager had
cancelled the second half of a $10 million investment. Few business
travelers were using Flightserv's Web site, www.flightserv.com.,
which offers individual seats on private jet flights between
Atlanta and New York. And the company was running out of cash. So,
over the next several weeks, Flightserv's new president and chief
operating officer cut the staff and marketing budget and suspended
flights. Bottorff also plunged into retooling Flightserv's business
model and rounding up new investors and business partners.

   BOOKMAN-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ We are a unique nation, created not
by a common ethnic background, or a shared history that goes back
centuries, or a single religious faith or even a single language.
We are instead a nation created by a commitment to shared ideals,
by a civic understanding with each other that must be created anew
with each generation of Americans, and with each influx of
immigrants. In that sense, we are more fragile and vulnerable than
more traditional countries. And should our commitment to those
shared ideas ever falter, our ability to act as a nation, to
sacrifice for a common cause, might falter as well. (Bookman,

   GARCIA-COLUMN _ Political memories are notoriously short, a
Republican friend reminded me during a conversation about Gov.

convention in Philadelphia and suddenly was portrayed as inevitable
in the national press, which now leads to stories about how badly

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ If you leave by speedboat from the

West and the Dry Tortugas. You land there, you're in America.
You've succeeded, according to Bill Clinton's controversial wet
foot/dry foot Cuban Adjustment Act, in reaching our shores and
almost assuredly will not be repatriated. Therefore, more and more
are headed for the Marquesas as that is the shortest distance
between Cuba and the United States, about 80 miles. (Kleinberg, Cox

glowed in the aura of an invincible winner. But that ended in the
dog days of August and it's unlikely to return even if he manages,
against high odds, to stitch together the 270 electoral votes he
needs to win. (Glass), Cox News Service)

   SAVING-CAVES _ Rusty's Cave is as quiet as a tomb and as artful

don't stumble upon it, it's safe. For Rusty's, while not a secret,
is not well known, which has protected the formations growing from
the floor and the ceiling. They took thousands of years to form.
They can shatter in seconds. In the darkness, Diane Cousineau of
Lafayette and Bill Putnam of Lawrenceville murmur about enjoying
quiet moments in the cool embrace of the earth. ``You know how some
people are beautiful and stunning and others are just as plain as
plain can be?'' Cousineau says. ``Caves are like that too. Every
one is different.'' Putnam is a director the Atlanta-based
Southeastern Cave Conservancy Inc., which Cousineau chairs. For the
past several years, the 600-member organization has rapidly
acquired caverns from West Virginia to Florida both to hold and to
protect. Most are near Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia border, a region
with perhaps more caves per square mile than anywhere in the United
States. ``Land acquisition is our mission,'' says Cousineau. ``We
just need to go out and buy most of the Southeast. It's a modest
goal.'' (Visser, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS

gardening season of all, is officially here _ so get organized.
True, spring holds lots of promise for gardeners, avid and amateur

because they'll have all winter to rest up before they're forced to
battle the summer stresses of heat, drought, insects and disease.

eradicate polio - which WHO hopes to accomplish shortly. To set up

U.S. IS RALLYING ALLIES' SUPPORT TO AID GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The top U.S. financial officials, fresh
from parallel plunges into world oil and currency markets, sought
to rally allies in the Group of 7 industrialized nations on
Saturday to fight what they labeled twin threats to the
record-breaking U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, met their European, Canadian and
Japanese counterparts in Prague ahead of the annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The officials
negotiated a joint communique expected to be released Saturday
night that will be closely scrutinized as an indicator of how far
authorities intend to extend market interventions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States joined Group of 7 counterparts Friday in a
concerted intervention in currency markets to support the tumbling
euro, Europe's single currency, catching traders off guard and
giving the euro at least a temporary boost. On the same day, U.S.
officials announced plans to dip into the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserves to fight the surge in oil prices as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts to correct currency rates and oil prices cast the
United States, which typically argues that such markets should take
care of themselves, as an aggressive interventionist, evoking
expressions of surprise even from some generally less
market-sensitive counterparts. Many expressed satisfaction that the
action to bolster the euro had gone smoothly, though it remained
unclear how markets will react when they reopen for trading this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surprising how well the action went,'' Germany's
finance minister, Hans Eichel, told reporters Saturday morning.
``Especially before the U.S. election, it was surprising the U.S.
even participated.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-level talks on how best to corral market prices
underscored how officials have come to view the euro's weakness and
oil's strength as major inflationary threats that pose an immediate
danger to what has been seen as an almost unprecedented streak of
global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rhetoric has been understated, the United States
participated in the defense of the 21-month-old European common
currency, led by the European Central Bank, because of what Summers
called a ``threat to the world economy.'' It was the first time
since 1998, when the United States and Japan joined forces to back
the yen in the midst of the Asian financial crisis, that the
Clinton administration had agreed to sell dollars in support of a
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   Summers in the past has stressed his reluctance to tap the
national oil reserve as a way to put downward pressure on oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to do so sent a clear
signal that the price of oil, which has hit its highest level since
the Persian Gulf war, threatens the health of the U.S. economy and
the presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   European officials on Saturday praised the U.S. action on oil
and suggested that the European Union should also adopt a unified
political response to the challenge posed by rising oil prices.
Several European nations, including Britain and France, have
sustained protests by truck drivers and other groups hurt by high
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at the pump in Europe, already far higher than those in
the United States, have risen even more dramatically because oil is
bought and sold in dollars, which have been rising in value against
the euro almost in tandem with the oil-price spike.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union should also devise a common response to the
oil-price rise, said Ernst Welteke, who heads Bundesbank, Germany's
central bank. He said the failure to adopt a common approach after
the United States took action demonstrated a weakness in political
coordination among European governments that he suggested was one
of the factors that have hurt the euro since its launch in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discrepancy between European governments' response to the
oil shock does not demonstrate that a common financial and economic
policy is being pursued within the euro zone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   France's finance minister, Laurent Fabius, pushed Group of 7
ministers to coordinate an assault on high oil prices, possibly
through a joint meeting with OPEC nations, European officials said.
But Gordon Brown, Britain's finance minister, threw cold water on
that idea Saturday. He said his counterparts had not endorsed the
idea of a joint meeting, though he said several bilateral meetings
had been arranged.

<P>
   Meanwhile, Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, invited 200
charity and pressure groups concerned about globalization to debate
the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund at
Prague Castle.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour session, followed by a walk through the
gardens of the sprawling historic residence of Czech rulers,
numerous environmentalists and political activists presented an
extensive list of demands to James D. Wolfensohn, president of the
World Bank, and Horst Koehler, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Several called for the complete abolition of the two
Washington-based lending agencies, which were founded just after
World War II to finance the reconstruction of Europe and stabilize
world currencies. Both have been under heavy pressure recently to
help improve the economies of poorer nations that receive most of
their loans.
</P>
<P>
   On Prague's streets, anti-globalization protesters who have
vowed to shut down the annual meetings did not disrupt Saturday's
closed-door sessions of the Group of 7. Security around the
historic city center was tight.
</P>
<P>
   So far the protests have been muted, but thousands more are
expected to arrive in the Czech capital ahead of a planned march
for debt relief on Sunday and an attempt to disrupt the formal
ceremonies of the meetings on Tuesday.

AUSTRIA FIGHTS NUCLEAR PLANT NEAR CZECH BORDER  
</HEADLINE>
   By LADKA BAUEROVA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The four cooling towers of the Temelin
nuclear power station overlook the rolling hills of the southern
Czech Republic like a gigantic castle. But for most Austrians,
whose country begins just 40 miles away, this castle is haunted.
</P>
<P>
   As the Czech authorities make final preparations to switch on
the first reactor at the Soviet-designed plant, fiercely
antinuclear Austria has intensified its threats to block the Czech
Republic's effort to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Austria is the only country in the world to have built a
complete nuclear power plant and then to have decided _ in a 1978
referendum _ not to put it or any other nuclear plant on line. The
country, which suffered from the radiation cloud released by the
1986 Chernobyl accident, has become a vigorous campaigner against
nuclear power, particularly in the former Communist countries whose
nuclear plants often include Soviet designs.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Czech authorities ``arrogant'' and ``irresponsible''
for deciding to put Temelin on line, Austria's Parliament voted
unanimously on Sept. 5 not to approve the energy chapter of the
Czech Republic's application to join the European Union. A Czech
government spokesman, Libor Roucek, replied by saying that the
Austrian reaction to Temelin was ``hysterical to the point of being
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, the European Parliament in Brussels passed a
nonbinding resolution urging the Czech Republic to carry out
additional studies on Temelin's environmental impact before it is
put into operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech government, which has already invested nearly $2.5
billion in the power plant, had refused to do more testing, arguing
that the safety features bought from Westinghouse meet American
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The only Czech leader who appeared to sympathize with the
concerns about Temelin was President Vaclav Havel, whose voice
carries much moral weight, but who wields little actual political
power. ``It would be unwise, even suicidal,'' to prevent a further
check of Temelin's safety, Havel said.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the Czech cabinet and Temelin's director,
Frantisek Hezoucky, were critical of the Brussels vote. ``It is
irritating that the European Parliament wants to vote on a thing it
knows nothing about,'' Hezoucky said. ``The Czech delegates were
not even allowed to speak. This is a decision made about us without
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Edmund Stoiber, the premier of the German state of
Bavaria, sent a letter to Prime Minister Milos Zeman, protesting
the plan for the Temelin plant.
</P>
<P>
   And for the fourth time, Austrian environmental activists
blocked virtually the whole border with the Czech Republic on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Temelin is a nuclear power plant of old Soviet design whose
construction began in 1987 under the Czechoslovak Communist regime.
After Communism fell in 1989, the Czech authorities decided to
continue the work. Its opening has been postponed several times for
financial and technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deadline, Sept. 15, was moved back because of
recurring water leaks in the reactor's cooling circuit. Temelin
officials now say the reactor could be operational in October, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The environment ministers of Austria and Germany say the plant
will not pass the rigorous nuclear safety standards in their
countries. Czech officials say Temelin is safe according to the
standards recognized in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue about the technical details endlessly,'' said
David Kyd, the spokesman for the Vienna, Austria-based
International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. body that oversees
nuclear safety. ``The truth is, this is more a political issue than
a technical one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyd noted that Austria's protests at new nuclear power plants in
other countries have usually fizzled once the facility is on line.
He said that although Temelin has weak spots, like loosely mounted
cooling pipes and flawed water-steam valves, the U.N. agency does
not anticipate any difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The particular Soviet pressurized water reactor used in Temelin
has never had an accident, he added. ``Chernobyl had a completely
different technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosina Luger, a representative of the Austrian antinuclear
organization, Mothers Against Nuclear Hazard, disagrees. ``We are
sure that Temelin is not safe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``EU countries are phasing out nuclear energy, so why should we
accept countries that are just opening new plants now?'' she said.
Josef Puehringer, the spokesman for the Upper Austrian Platform
Against Nuclear Danger, said, ``Temelin is not only Austria's
matter, it is a problem for all of Europe.''

they are going to continue to do what they want,'' said Fernando
Rospigliosi, author of ``The Art of Deceit'' and other books about
Peruvian politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a personalized dictatorship, rather than an
institutional one, in which a very corrupt elite has maintained
control through blackmail and bribes. And only if they lose power
altogether can you take the state security apparatus apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has been fighting to remain in power since the
broadcast of a video late last week that shows his national
security adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos, paying $15,000 to an
opposition congressman, apparently to get him to favor the
government. Fujimori's response was to call new elections in which,
he said, he will not be a candidate and to announce the
``deactivation'' of the intelligence agency, which Montesinos
supervises.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, though, Montesinos' whereabouts and status
continue to be a mystery. On Thursday, the armed forces announced
their support for Fujimori, ending fears of a coup. But they
conspicuously avoided any reference to Montesinos, who had a hand
in the selection of most of the members of the military high
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montesinos, as we understand it, is out, or is fired,'' a
diplomat here said on Wednesday. ``He is not exercising his
function any longer as national security adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori has also said that Montesinos still has a full
security detail to protect him and that no criminal charges have
yet been filed against him in connection with the bribery scandal,
or any other of the multitude of accusations made against him.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the government sent a bill to Congress that would
formally disband the spy agency within 15 days, and also promised
to announce Montesinos' dismissal by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The location of an estimated 2,500 videotapes that were said to
have been in Montesinos' possession _ an electronic dossier on
leading political, business and military figures _ is also unclear.
Susana Higuchi, Fujimori's former wife and now a member of the
opposition group that released the tape showing Montesinos, said
this week that the group had other tapes but hesitated to release
them because ``the result could be chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the video scandal, the government, trying to deflect
a barrage of criticism of Montesinos, had presented legislation
that would create a new National Intelligence Center to oversee
state security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But independent experts dismissed the government's efforts as
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montesinos has suffered a major blow and is not going to be
able to regain the position of supreme power he had,'' said Carlos
Tapia, a former lecturer at the Army Intelligence School. ``But the
apparatus he created, though weakened, remains in place, and many
of its members are simply going to transfer to the army
intelligence service, which is certain to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, each of the three branches of the armed forces, as well
as the National Police, has its own intelligence service. But they
too have been implicated in human rights abuses and what Jose
Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of
Human Rights Watch, called ``the whole system of bribes, threats,
extortion, privileges and surveillance by which this government has
preserved and accumulated power.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the National Intelligence Service, known by the
Spanish acronym SIN, is meant to be a supervisory body, with fewer
than 100 employees divided among three divisions: terrorism,
counternarcotics and public security. But Tapia estimates that the
agency's ranks have swelled to more than 1,200 people, not
including several thousand informants in the military and the
police.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos and his associates have infiltrated other important
institutions _ from the customs service and electoral commission to
the news media and the court system. That makes it highly unlikely,
some argue, that he will ever be held legally accountable for any
actions that violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is a better chance to eventually prosecute
Pinochet in Chile than Montesinos in Peru,'' Vivanco said,
referring to Chile's former dictator. ``I don't see an independent
court or judge in a country where Montesinos, and not Fujimori, has
been able to rule the country for seven years by firing and
transferring judges, drafting legislation and changing
constitutions.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY MAY END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence service was created during the authoritarian
military government that ruled Peru in the 1970s, when there were
fears that border disputes with Ecuador and Chile could turn to
war. The complaints about its domestic activities accelerated after
Fujimori was first elected in 1990 and set about crushing left-wing
guerrilla groups like Shining Path, and they intensified after
Fujimori shut down Congress and the courts in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone closed their eyes because it was the most difficult
period of the war against terrorism, so the attitude was that
anything that works is fine,'' Tapia said. ``But then it became a
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, Montesinos and the intelligence service
also gave valuable help to the United States that resulted in a
pronounced drop in coca cultivation and trafficking here. But
experts contend that Montesinos has now finally exhausted American
patience, pointing to his apparent involvement in a
still-unresolved scandal involving the sale of arms to left-wing
guerrillas in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Noriega situation,'' Rospigliosi said, referring
to the Panamanian dictator who after many years as an American ally
was eventually deposed in a U.S. military invasion in December
1989. ``The CIA, which has been his support, has now let him
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts also say that any effort to reform the apparatus
Montesinos created is certain to run into practical obstacles. This
country, they argue, does not have the legal framework,
institutional capacity or civilian expertise that would be required
to bring the agency to heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to any dismantling of the intelligence service is to
create mechanisms of control, and right now we don't have those,''
said Santiago Pedraglio, a political expert here. ``Even if
Montesinos and his people leave, no laws enable any entity outside
of the executive to monitor and supervise the intelligence service
by looking into its activities and accounts, and so what you are
left with is an untouchable power.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NIGHT BELONGS TO GREENE; FUTURE BELONGS TO JONES
</HEADLINE>
   (Sports of The Times) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Off the track and into his new and
long-awaited life as an Olympic gold medalist, Maurice Greene made
the rounds, hammed it up with the men who had finished in his dust
and then happened to glance at the television, mounted high on the
backstage wall. There, was a scene that is likely to be repeated
several times over the following week. There, was a face that
Madison Avenue will undoubtedly soon come to love.
</P>
<P>
   There, Marion Jones was beating him to the medal stand, on her
way to becoming a transcendent American star.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of dueling sprinters and sexes, Greene did all he
could, with his flamboyant swagger, with no way to surprise people
unless he failed, which he most certainly did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got destroyed,'' said Ato Boldon, silver medalist, after
Greene powered out of the blocks, shifted into warp drive the last
50 meters and won the men's 100 meters in 9.87 seconds Saturday
night at the beautiful Olympic Stadium that holds 110,000
spectators and accommodates a fair amount of oversized moths.
</P>
<P>
   The moths were circling but Greene was flying. No doubt was left
regarding the identity of the world's fastest human, unless you
were in Lane 8, and trying to claim that title yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought we were even, until I saw the replay,''
Boldon said. ``But that's what peripheral vision does to you.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Boldon hit the interview area, he had come to grips
with the realization that his training partner, the 26-year-old
first-time Olympian he had taken under his wing, had ascended to
that place in time when the moon, the stars and the moths are
perfectly aligned. Too bad Greene had to stoop to all the
trash-talking and tongue-wagging. Performance is the greatest form
of intimidation, and his world-record 9.79 and his 30 sub-10-second
times coming into Sydney were enough to remind the others, at least
subliminally, that they were racing for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely a down year for mere mortals in the 100,'' Boldon
said, a club in which Greene was not being counted as a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff is day by day, moment by moment,'' said
the bronze medalist, Obadele Thompson. ``He puts things together
very well, day by day, moment by moment. Ergo, we don't beat him
very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Boldon of Trinidad told Thompson of Barbados, ``Two-hundred,
let's do it,'' referring to a race that will be free of Greene and
Michael Johnson, open to them and the other mere mortals. They
gratefully took their silver and bronze and left Greene to his just
rewards, including a victory lap that included a stop to sit,
remove his shoes and hurl them into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, Nike executives were cheering wildly somewhere, or merely
applauding the flawless execution of a pre-arranged plan. While
Greene maintained, ``I'm not into sport for fame and fortune,''
let's be serious. Cashing in on gold has become almost a corporate
Olympics in itself, witness the silver shoes that Jones, another
soldier of the swoosh, high-stepped in to the finish, as her face
transformed from a mask of determination to a smile that in a power
outage, could light up the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If Michael Johnson proved one thing after Atlanta four years
ago, it is that extending Olympic celebrity beyond those
welcome-home nights on the couch next to Letterman or Leno is
getting harder and harder. Greene could have thrown Imelda Marcos'
entire collection into the stands along with his, but he'll soon
find out that only Jones, five golds or not, will step up to the
next level of stardom from these Games.
</P>
<P>
   She's got that unique and magnetic aura, the ability to enhance
a moment with a valedictory gesture, or verbal gem.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother is a native of Belize, so, along with the American
flag, Jones carried around the flag of that country, which doesn't
have a single track and whose runners train on a dusty soccer
pitch. On the subject of what her gold medal felt like, she might
have been describing herself when she said: ``No rough edges, very
smooth and glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, naturally, was asked his opinion of Jones' attempt to do
the unfathomable, as many U.S. track stars undoubtedly will in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish her the best because I wouldn't try it,'' he said. ``I
was very tired last year after Seville after running all the rounds
of the 100 and 200 and all the relays. I just hope her body doesn't
break down.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the trials last summer, both Greene and Johnson pulled up
lame, trying to outdo each other in the 200 meters. Everyone here
is in awe of what Marion Jones is trying to do, and that includes
the world's fastest human, still a title of renown, even when
Marion Jones was on the program, too.
</P>
<P>
   It was Greene's night, but it was also a one-night stand. With
all due respect to Cathy Freeman and Johnson, the Olympics, from
hereon out, belong to Jones.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Much has been made in the presidential campaign
about Vice President Al Gore's stint with the Army in Vietnam, but
one striking fact has gone largely unnoted: If elected, Gore would
be the first president in a century to have served as an enlisted
man and one of only four ever.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, of course, has been replete with men who served
their country in uniform _ 27 of the 42 presidents _ but the
overwhelming majority did so in the officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 12 generals (Washington, Jackson, Harrison,
Taylor, Pierce, Andrew Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur,
Harrison and Eisenhower), though no admirals. And there has been a
colonel (Theodore Roosevelt), a commander (Lyndon B. Johnson) and a
lieutenant commander (Ford), a major (Truman), a captain (Reagan)
and three lieutenants (Kennedy, Nixon, Carter and Bush).
</P>
<P>
   But not since William McKinley, who was president from 1897
until his assassination in 1901, has there been a president who
served in the humbler ranks.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley enlisted as a private in the 23rd Regiment of the Ohio
Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War. (He went on to receive a
battlefield promotion to lieutenant after the Battle of Antietam
from a colonel who went on to become a general and a president,
Rutherford B. Hayes.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McKinley, only two other presidents had served in
the enlisted ranks, according to several presidential reference
books.
</P>
<P>
   James Buchanan served in a company of dragoons _ essentially
cavalrymen _ in the defense of Baltimore during the War of 1812.
And Abraham Lincoln volunteered as a private when the Illinois
militia mobilized to fight in the Black Hawk wars in 1832. His
company promptly elected him captain, but when that unit stood
down, he re-enlisted as a private.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, in August 1969, he walked into a draft center in
Newark, N.J. and enlisted as a private. And a private he remained
through basic training at Fort Dix, a tour at Fort Rucker and five
months as an Army journalist in Vietnam. (He was granted an early
discharge to attend divinity school.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore, of course, was no ordinary buck private. His father was a
senator, and GIs like him were on what one Army general and Vietnam
veteran called ``a watch list,'' a sort of unwritten order to keep
them out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Charles C. Moskos, a sociologist at Northwestern University who
has long studied the military, said that the dearth of enlistees
among the presidents reflected the social and economic backgrounds
of the nation's politicians and officers, who with few exceptions
were of the educated elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical military experience is to be an enlisted man,'' he
said. ``It has not been shared by our presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has made the most of his military record, which
starkly contrasts to the lack of service by President Clinton, but
it remains to be seen how much it will help him on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, scores higher in the
polls on military matters, and in recent years people in uniform,
particularly in the officer corps, have tilted increasingly toward
the Republican Party. The tradition in which the majority usually
considered themselves independent is weakening, a trend that has
raised concerns about the increasing politicization of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year of up and coming officers found that 64
percent identified themselves as Republicans, compared to only 8
percent who were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point, an array of veterans, including
senior officers who served under Clinton and Gore, last week
endorsed Bush, who served as a fighter pilot in the Texas National
Guard during the Vietnam War and was, for the record, a lieutenant.

   Democrats Gain Hope In Pennsylvania Race
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are taking heart from a Pennsylvania poll that shows
Rep. Ron Klink gaining in his effort to unseat Sen. Rick Santorum,
a freshman Republican.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the campaign, Democrats looking to regain
control of the Senate viewed Santorum as one of the most vulnerable
Republicans. They recalled that he barely squeaked into office in
1994, and since then, they noted, he had compiled an unusually
conservative record for someone representing a state with more
Democrats than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Santorum proved to be a formidable raiser of campaign cash,
and poll after poll showed him with a lead of 10 points or more
over Klink, a moderate from suburban Pittsburgh. Democratic hopes
began to slump, particularly when Klink proved a poor fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the new poll, released on Tuesday by the Knight Ridder
news service and Wayne State University. It indicated Klink had
closed the gap to 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Santorum all of a sudden was pleading campaign
poverty and saying it was ``imperative'' that his supporters come
up with more money so he could continue an advertising blitz he had
been running.
</P>
<P>
   Then, within a matter of hours, Klink was on the air with his
own television blitz. How?
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which had been
sending him mixed messages about possible help from the national
party, had finally come through with an $800,000 infusion.
</P>
<P>
   Afoul of the Law With Emery Boards  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1976 presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter's supporters
were given a cease-and-desist order by Oregon election officials
when they started handing out Georgia peanuts to voters. State law
prohibits giving gifts of value to a voter, even a gift worth,
well, peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Boquist, a Republican businessman running for the House in
Oregon's 5th Congressional District, south of Portland, may or may
not have known about that little incident. But in any case, his
supporters were spotted the other day handing out free emery boards
_ 6,000 of them, bought for 9 cents each, including the emblazoned
``Boquist for Congress'' message.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials are investigating. Boquist, who is struggling
uphill to unseat Rep. Darlene Hooley, a two-term Democrat, could be
fined $100 if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a Legend, Of the Opposing Party  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the races that could be especially important in
determining control of the House of Representatives is the race in
Florida's 22nd Congressional District. This is the Gold Coast
district, stretching from Miami Beach to Palm Beach and chock full
of retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The race, in which state Rep. Elaine Bloom, a popular Democrat,
is trying to unseat the 10-term Republican incumbent, E. Clay Shaw
Jr., looks to be close, with perhaps a slight edge going to Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   But he's taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio ad, Shaw, a moderate, boasts of how well he has
looked after the concerns of his aging constituents, and he invokes
the name of Rep. Claude Pepper, a legend in South Florida for his
watchful legislative care of the aged.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Pepper died 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he was a classic liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he was a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The point, says Shaw, is that Claude Pepper cared about
America's old, and so does Clay Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud to call Claude Pepper my friend,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for 82-year-old Frank Pepper. He says he knew
Claude Pepper, that Claude Pepper was his brother, and that Clay
Shaw is no Claude Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any animosity toward Clay Shaw,'' he said. ``I've
just known Elaine for years. I try to pray for Republicans. All I
can. If Claude were still with us, he would be devoting himself to
campaigning for Elaine Bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing the Buck, In a Fashion  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a new twist on fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, former Lt. Gov. Dennis Rehberg, a Republican running
for the state's lone House seat, is mailing 9,000 $1 bills to past
contributors, hoping the unusual approach will spur them to give
some more, including sending back the $1 bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to compete,'' his campaign manager, Alan Mikkelsen,
argues.
</P>
<P>
   Rehberg's Democratic opponent, Nancy Keenan, the state's
superintendent of public instruction, has a different take. She
says Rehberg is ``just trying to pass the buck.''

   WASHINGTON _ Much has been made in the presidential campaign
about Vice President Al Gore's stint with the Army in Vietnam, but
one striking fact has gone largely unnoted: If elected, Gore would
be the first president in a century to have served as an enlisted
man and one of only four ever.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, of course, has been replete with men who served
their country in uniform _ 27 of the 42 presidents _ but the
overwhelming majority did so in the officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 12 generals (Washington, Jackson, Harrison,
Taylor, Pierce, Andrew Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur,
Harrison and Eisenhower), though no admirals. And there has been a
colonel (Theodore Roosevelt), a commander (Lyndon B. Johnson) and a
lieutenant commander (Ford), a major (Truman), a captain (Reagan)
and four lieutenants (Kennedy, Nixon, Carter and Bush).
</P>
<P>
   But not since William McKinley, who was president from 1897
until his assassination in 1901, has there been a president who
served in the humbler ranks.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley enlisted as a private in the 23rd Regiment of the Ohio
Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War. (He went on to receive a
battlefield promotion to lieutenant after the Battle of Antietam
from a colonel who went on to become a general and a president,
Rutherford B. Hayes.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McKinley, only two other presidents had served in
the enlisted ranks, according to several presidential reference
books.
</P>
<P>
   James Buchanan served in a company of dragoons _ essentially
cavalrymen _ in the defense of Baltimore during the War of 1812.
And Abraham Lincoln volunteered as a private when the Illinois
militia mobilized to fight in the Black Hawk wars in 1832. His
company promptly elected him captain, but when that unit stood
down, he re-enlisted as a private.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, in August 1969, he walked into a draft center in
Newark, N.J. and enlisted as a private. And a private he remained
through basic training at Fort Dix, a tour at Fort Rucker and five
months as an Army journalist in Vietnam. (He was granted an early
discharge to attend divinity school.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore, of course, was no ordinary buck private. His father was a
senator, and GIs like him were on what one Army general and Vietnam
veteran called ``a watch list,'' a sort of unwritten order to keep
them out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Charles C. Moskos, a sociologist at Northwestern University who
has long studied the military, said that the dearth of enlistees
among the presidents reflected the social and economic backgrounds
of the nation's politicians and officers, who with few exceptions
were of the educated elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical military experience is to be an enlisted man,'' he
said. ``It has not been shared by our presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has made the most of his military record, which
starkly contrasts to the lack of service by President Clinton, but
it remains to be seen how much it will help him on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, scores higher in the
polls on military matters, and in recent years people in uniform,
particularly in the officer corps, have tilted increasingly toward
the Republican Party. The tradition in which the majority usually
considered themselves independent is weakening, a trend that has
raised concerns about the increasing politicization of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year of up and coming officers found that 64
percent identified themselves as Republicans, compared to only 8
percent who were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point, an array of veterans, including
senior officers who served under Clinton and Gore, last week
endorsed Bush, who served as a fighter pilot in the Texas National
Guard during the Vietnam War and was, for the record, a lieutenant.

U.S. MAKES BIGGEST, AND THE FINAL, WAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Between the bodysuits and the 15 new world
records and the routine brilliance of two Dutch swimmers named Inge
de Bruijn and Pieter van den Hoogenband, it was an unusual Olympic
meet. But when it came down to the final two events of the final
day, it ended as Olympic meets almost always end: With the
Americans dominating the medley relays.
</P>
<P>
   The women went first, with B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann, Jenny
Thompson and Dara Torres smashing China's six-year-old world mark
by more than 3 seconds to finish in 3 minutes 58.30 seconds. The
men went last, with Lenny Krayzelburg, Ed Moses, Ian Crocker and
Gary Hall Jr. improving on the United States' four-year-old world
mark by more than a second to finish in 3:33.73.
</P>
<P>
   It was an appropriate finish to a competition that was both a
fan's and a statistician's delight. Though a greater number of
countries are producing remarkable swimmers _ the Netherlands in
particular _ the United States remains the lone superpower. Despite
concerns about the team's inexperience, about the strength of Ian
Thorpe and the Australian men, and about the small time gap between
the U.S. Olympic trials and Games, the Americans put together their
most impressive collective performance in the pool since Montreal
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Both the men and the women finished atop the medal and
gold-medal counts, and the U.S. team's 14 gold medals were its most
since 1972 in a nonboycotted Olympics (the Americans won 21 in Los
Angeles in 1984, the year the Soviet Union and most other Eastern
European nations boycotted).
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team's 33 medals in Sydney were its most in a Games not
boycotted by the superpowers since 1976, when it won 34. ``When
faced with a worthy opponent, it forces you to get your act
together and step up,'' said Hall in reference to Australia. ``We
were able to use that threat of being dethroned as the best
swimming nation as motivation to reach a level that otherwise we
might not have reached.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkably balanced effort. The only Americans to win
two individual gold medals were Krayzelburg, who swept both men's
backstroke events, and Brooke Bennett, who won the women's 400 and
800 freestyle. The rest of the individual victories ranged from the
predictable (Tom Dolan in the 400 individual medley; Tom Malchow in
the 200 butterfly) to the mildly surprising (Quann in the 100
breaststroke; Hall and Anthony Ervin, who tied for gold in the 50
free) to the very surprising (Misty Hyman in the 200 butterfly).
</P>
<P>
   But the success did not come only at the top of the pyramid.
According to Dennis Pursley, the U.S. national team director, more
than 50 percent of the U.S. swimmers improved on their personal
bests in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Seoul in 1998, that figure was down in the 20s, and in
Atlanta it was in the 40s,'' Pursley said. ``We really clicked
here, and it was like a club team or college team where everybody
gets in on the action. We had people from Lane 8 grabbing a medal.
It wasn't just two or three superstars getting the job done.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Superstars were the explanation for the unprecedented success of
the Netherlands, a country with only a handful of full-time elite
swimming coaches and only about 20,000 registered competitive
swimmers compared with the United States' 220,000 and Australia's
100,000. De Bruijn and van den Hoogenband were a two-headed medal
detector, combining for five individual golds and five world
records.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, De Bruijn, who had never won a medal in an Olympics
or a world long-course championships until Sydney, won her third
gold medal, holding off the silver medalist Therese Alshammer of
Sweden and the 33-year-old Dara Torres of the United States to win
the 50 free in 24.32 seconds, 19 hundreds of a second slower than
the world record she set in Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   A 27-year-old who declined to compete in the last Olympics
because she was unmotivated and out of shape and afraid she might
embarrass herself, De Bruijn has now broken or re-broken 11 world
records in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Olympics I thought all my world records couldn't be
broken, and I broke them all here,'' De Bruijn said. ``They're all
going bananas back in the Netherlands. They are even letting
children out of school to watch the Olympics. It's getting crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it's only soccer in the Netherlands,'' she said. ``Now
everyone is talking about swimming because of what we've done here.
It's a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The home team also had its moments, none more memorable than
Thorpe's phenomenal freestyle anchor leg on opening night to give
the Australians a victory over the Americans in the 400 freestyle
relay. But while it finished with five gold medals and 18 overall
medals, Australia did not entirely live up to its pre-meet
potential. Thorpe was beaten by van den Hoogenband in the 200.
Susie O'Neill was upset by Hyman, and neither Michael Klim nor
Geoff Huegill won the 100 fly (that honor went to Lars Froelander
of Sweden).
</P>
<P>
   But there was still enough gold and more than enough emotion to
give the eight consecutive sellout crowds their Australian dollar's
worth, and in the men's 1,500 freestyle on Saturday, the
Australians Grant Hackett and Kieren Perkins were accompanied by a
constant roar.
</P>
<P>
   The enormously popular Perkins was trying to become the first
man to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics, but though
he managed to break 15 minutes in the semifinal and improve on that
slightly in the final, it was only good enough for silver. Hackett,
who like Perkins hails from the northern state of Queensland, would
win the gold in 14 minutes, 48.33 seconds. Perkins finished in
14:53.59, well short of his six-year-old world record of 14:41.66.
The American Chris Thompson finished third in a national-record
time of 14:56.81.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Grant appreciates it as much as the rest of the team
does,'' Perkins said of the opportunity to swim in Sydney.
``Because no matter what any of us do in the rest of our careers,
or what we've done before the last eight days, will never come
close to it. Just because of this place and this atmosphere. It's
quite exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   The question that continues to nag swimming is whether all the
exceptional times and performances are legitimate. Though
blood-testing was introduced in Sydney in an attempt to detect the
banned synthetic hormone known as EPO, Pursley said he was
disappointed that only four of the 48 American swimmers here were
required to submit to blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see us get to a point where every swimmer is blood
tested,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pursley also indicated that the percentage of U.S. swimmers who
were administered urine tests during the competition was the same
as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting to see a lot more,'' he said. ``It does
bother us. We would like to see a lot more aggressive effort. Our
big fear is there is going to be some complacency because we don't
see the big mass use by a whole team of swimmers as we did with the
Chinese and East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people sit back and think we've got it beat, we're going to
be right back to where we were, if not worse, and we may be already
no better off,'' Pursley said. ``It may just be spread out. I don't
know. There are a lot of suspicions, and I have no idea to what
degree they are accurate. I think we'd be a little naive to think
it's cleaned up.''

JAPAN'S NEW TRAIN RUNS AT 270 MPH, INTO THE RED 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOFU, Japan _ When the invited guests had finished boarding the
gleaming new train, sitting on a custom-built test track high above
green fields growing thick with rice, a uniformed young stewardess
passed through, handing out refreshments and bowing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all seemed familiar to train passengers in Japan, down
to the Chiclet-shaped windows and the feel of the seats. Then the
train began to move. In 90 seconds flat, without even a shudder,
the latest wonder of Japan's train developers blurred the
landscape, reaching 270 miles an hour as the director of the test
program unleashed a wicked grin.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Japan's ``bullet train'' lines, already among the
world's fastest, have been losing money for years.
</P>
<P>
   And yet money seemed like an annoying afterthought in a
demonstration that made it clear that this nation's eager railroad
developers are determined to push a new generation of
ultra-high-technology trains able to travel almost twice as fast as
today's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a variety of ways to consider the costs of a
train,'' said the test director, Hiroshi Suruga, who shifted
uncomfortably as a reporter sought to change the subject back to
nitty-gritty questions of development spending and operating costs
and away from magnetic levitation. That exotic technology propels
the train through a combination of expensive components cooled by
liquid helium and super-high voltage.
</P>
<P>
   If Suruga's answer resembled a fudge, it was one all too
familiar to the growing chorus of critics of Japan's huge
government-sponsored projects. Duplicate space programs spend
billions of dollars and yet are unable to successfully launch
rockets; extraordinary bridges lead to sparsely populated islands.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Japan is the world's most indebted country, with
public debt recently estimated at 130 percent of the gross national
product.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the Japanese public might have watched all this with
resignation. But the new train, the maglev (for magnetic
levitation), may turn out to be the latest in a recent string of
dubious projects that have raised the hackles of increasingly wary
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the countryside often support these kinds of
projects because they need jobs to survive in these hard times, and
it must be pointed out that our political system is heavily skewed
in favor of rural voters,'' said Akio Ogawa, a professor of policy
studies at Chuo University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But urban residents have completely lost their faith in this
kind of project. For them it is just runaway fantasy, and it has
been going on for 30 years or 40 years now.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bit of prodding, Sugura, the head of testing for the
train, said the maglev had cost about $3 billion to develop _ a
figure that almost certainly omitted a multitude of hidden
subsidies _ and would require about three times as much energy to
run as the country's existing bullet trains.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than build a test range for the new train in an area
of relatively flat, open spaces, the 25-mile track was built in
this heavily mountainous farmland west of Tokyo, requiring a huge
span of elevated concrete, a truss bridge and numerous long
tunnels. This has meant huge contracts for construction companies
and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And the local government of Yamanashi put up close to $200
million to subsidize the test center to ensure that as big a piece
of the action as possible came to this prefecture of 895,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   But in the ultimate sign that this system is in crisis, even the
local residents who could once be counted on to support spending on
big public works have begun calling the projects into question. And
in an ominous foretaste of what lies ahead for planners should they
decide to introduce a magnetic levitation train from Tokyo to
Osaka, residents of the very Yamanashi Prefecture where the
project's test phase was held have begun to lodge protests against
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago only the Communist Party would have opposed a
project like this,'' said Keiji Kato, a member of a local Yamanashi
residents' group that opposes the construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are company heads, lawyers, housewives, accountants
and students here against it. The only people who stand to profit
are a handful of construction companies and landowners, and not the
general population. We must save our money for other needs.''

A CONTROVERSY OVER JUDGING, AND A SURPRISE U.S. LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ In the Olympics, there is the quaint notion
that the fight game can be domesticated _ headgear is worn, fights
are short and savage knockouts are few _ but it is still boxing.
And that means that sooner or later there will be a judging
controversy and intrigue over scoring decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The latest dispute involved the unexpected defeat Friday of
light flyweight Brian Viloria, a gold medal favorite for the United
States. The Viloria decision left U.S. coach Tom Mustin wondering
if there was a movement afoot to limit the success of the U.S.
team, which has eight fighters alive in the 12 divisions of the
Olympic tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they want one team to come in and have nine or
10 guys progress round after round,'' said Mustin, whose fighters
have also been heartily booed at the boxing venue during the last
two days. ``Other countries want to get gold medals too, and
they're going to have to get them from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   After Viloria lost his close fight on points, Mustin suggested
that the dozens of body punches Viloria threw at his opponent,
Brahim Asloum of France, were not counted in the scoring by the
five judges. It is a longstanding belief in international amateur
boxing that North American judges _ more influenced by professional
boxing where a premium is placed on power punching _ tend to give
fighters credit for blows to the stomach and ribs while judges from
other parts of the world do not.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of room for interpretation on whether a punch
landed or not, but it is true that neither Viloria nor Asloum
received a point for a body shot in their bout. When the judges
score a punch as a point it is registered on videotape, and of the
dozens of punches these two speedy, small fighters threw in four
rounds, the judges registered that only six punches landed for
Asloum and four punches landed for Viloria _ all blows to the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Brian's body shots had counted,'' Mustin said. ``He would
have been ahead by five points.''
</P>
<P>
   The five judges for the Viloria-Asloum fight were from South
Korea, Germany, Tahiti, the Dominican Republic and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, in a press conference with reporters, Loring
Baker, the general secretary of the Amateur International Boxing
Association, said he thought Viloria's punches to the body should
have counted.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been coincidental, but suddenly Saturday, during
many bouts, body shots were indeed being counted in the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   This change did not have much effect on the Americans who fought
Saturday as the U.S. team bounced back from Viloria's disheartening
defeat with two victories in three fights. Ricardo Juarez, last
year's featherweight world champion, won a tough second-round fight
with Germany's Falk Huste, 17-15. Huste and Juarez were given
credit for punches to the body.
</P>
<P>
   Light middleweight Jermain Taylor followed his knockout in a
first-round fight earlier this week with another dominating
performance. Taylor outpointed Canada's Scott MacIntosh, 23-9. The
U.S. super-heavyweight Calvin Brock, who was not considered a medal
favorite, lost his first fight of the Olympics to Paolo Vidoz of
Italy, 21-5. Vidoz built part of his early lead by punching to
Brock's body.
</P>
<P>
   But Viloria's loss was still a hot topic at ringside, even if
Mustin said the U.S. team declined to lodge a protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you protest a decision and it makes things worse,''
he said. ``We had to think of the whole team, too. We've got a lot
of guys left.''
</P>
<P>
   If the judges have adjusted their scoring philosophy after the
Viloria loss, it appeased Mustin, but not entirely. ``I do believe
the judges have consistently identified the winner of the fights,''
he said. ``It's been good. But it can be arbitrary when it comes to
what they're counting and not counting.''
</P>
<P>
   More puzzling to Mustin is how unpopular his boxers have become
inside the boxing venue at Sydney's busy Darling Harbor. As the
Olympic boxing tournament moves into the latter rounds and
attendance increases, the crowds have turned vociferous in their
disdain for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.S. boxers are considered favorites in many
divisions, it is not unusual that the fans of boxers from other
countries are rooting against the Americans. But the many
Australian fans in attendance, whose boxers have not fared well,
have added to the anti-American cheering. And U.S. fans at the
venue are a small minority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taylor overwhelmed his Canadian opponent but he was hooted out
of the ring when his lopsided decision was announced. Brock's loss
Saturday night to an Italian brought about a standing ovation from
the crowd, by far the loudest fan reaction in the eight days of
boxing in the venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why there's such an anti-American crowd,'' Mustin
said. ``We're not coming out of the locker room cocky. We're trying
to be quiet and humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Juarez both said they felt it was important to win
their bouts Saturday after Friday's disappointments. Before Viloria
lost, the American David Jackson also was disqualified from the
tournament because he failed to make the 132-pound lightweight
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday took a piece out of all of us because Brian was like
the backbone of the team,'' Taylor said. ``I'm sorry for Brian, but
the show must go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's somebody who understands boxing.

U.S. RALLYING CRY ISN'T ENOUGH TO BEAT CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Manager Tommy Lasorda insists he was not
playing politics when he said he wanted his U.S. baseball team to
win its preliminary game Saturday night against Cuba for Cuban
exiles in Miami. He was not rattling sabers, he said; he was making
a baseball pledge to friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played there,'' he said. ``I have friends who evacuated
their homes. But it wasn't anything political, I was just thinking
about winning the game. I wanted to win the game before for my
cousin. I'll try to win one tomorrow for my brother Smokey.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's team delivered for his cousin on Friday, beating
Italy. But Cuba beat the United States, 6-1, behind 14 strikeouts
by pitchers Jose Ibar and Pedro Luis Lazo. With their hitting in a
funk, the Americans never recovered from the Cubans' four-run first
inning off Rick Krivda, whose major-league experience did not help
him keep his pitches down in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing: We're not hitting the way we're supposed
to'' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   But as ordinary as the game was, things happened to cast it in a
political light. Anything untoward between the teams of two
geopolitical enemies whose national pastimes are baseball is
destined for overinterpretation, if not as an ideological duel then
as evidence of endemic animosity.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Ibar plunked right fielder Ernie Young on
the left shoulder. Cuba already led by 4-0, and Ibar was making
U.S. batters look like the minor-leaguers they nearly all are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy had pinpoint control, and I get the benefit of a
94-mile-an-hour fastball on my shoulder blade,'' Young said.
``Yeah, I'm upset. I know he did it on purpose.'' As he stepped
toward the plate, Young and Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano bumped into
each other, clearing both benches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catcher crossed paths with me, and I politely nudged him
out of the way,'' Young said. He offered no reason that Ibar would
hit him but added: ``I didn't think he'd want to fuel a fire with
us. It didn't work this time, but maybe next time it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibar said he intended no ill will toward Young, who was leading
the team with a .533 batting average going into the game. ``There
were no intentions,'' Ibar said through an interpreter. ``It was
badly interpreted, badly understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Rauch, who struck out eight Cubans in four innings of relief
for Krivda, said he contemplated retaliation, but the umpires
warned him he would be ejected if he tried. ``The thought goes
through your mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said, ``It's too bad that the team that gets warned
can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A second incident inflamed passions anew. In the eighth inning,
pinch runner Yobal Duenas scored Cuba's sixth run by sliding hard
into catcher Pat Borders, who caught a relay throw far up the third
base line. Rodriguez's left foot flew between Borders' legs and
spiked his left ankle. The ball flew out of Borders' glove. It was
a meaningless run but a meaningful episode in this pseudopolitical
drama. Borders said later that he felt the slide was designed to
injure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strong play, but not a dirty play,'' said Servio
Borges, Cuba's manager. ``The runner has the right to go and get
the base and he was being blocked. It was a strong play and the one
who's protected is the catcher. He wears the gear to protect
himself at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges said there was no political overlay to the game, nor
anything special to playing the United States. ``On our part, there
is no time for any antagonism,'' he said. ``We just go out and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will play Australia to end the preliminary round,
but with its 5-1 record it is already guaranteed a spot in the
semifinals. Cuba, also with a 5-1 record, will face Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said he refuses to think publicly about playing Cuba
again. But after Saturday night's game, he may rethink his claim
that he has seen no better team in this tournament than his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we will play them again,'' he said. ``Do you
know for sure if we will? 'Cause I don't. I don't answer
hypotheticals. Should we face them again? That's a hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Lasorda's trying to win the game for his Cuban exile
friends, Borges declined to involve himself in a debate about those
who have left the island since Fidel Castro became president.
``This victory is dedicated to the Cuban people, the 11 million who
saw us train and supported us,'' Borges said. ``This is for the
people of C-U-B-A.''

CLINTON MAKES FURTHER MOVES TO LOWER COST OF HEATING OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subbed for updating and new lede)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration took several additional
steps Saturday to cushion the oil market against shortages this
winter and to soften the shock of higher prices on consumers. Like
the temporary release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
announced on Friday, the new measures are intended mainly to ease
tight supplies of heating oil, President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental regulators are to explore ways to permit more
varieties of heating oil to be burned, the government will try to
smooth out the effects of its own fuel purchases, and the
administration will ask state utility regulators to keep a sharp
eye on fuel inventories at power plants and factories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton directed the Department of Health and
Human Services to release $400 million in aid to poor families to
help them buy fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding purpose for our action is to increase supply
and help consumers make it through the cold winter,'' Clinton said.
He defended as ``plainly a prudent thing to do'' his decision to
release crude oil from the reserve, which had been recommended by
Vice President Al Gore but was denounced by Gov. George W. Bush as
a political ploy.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the avowed focus on home heating oil, the broader
effects of the intervention in energy markets will be felt by
consumers whenever they fill up at a gas station, pay for an
airline ticket, or even pay the family's bills for electricity or
natural gas, according to energy experts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 million barrels that the government will lend to
refineries in the next several weeks from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, 85 to 90 percent will be turned into products other than
home heating oil, Energy Department officials said. Fixing a
shortage of heating oil is like confronting a shortage of brisket,
they said; you have to kill the whole steer, which will also
produce hamburger and sirloin, along with leather.
</P>
<P>
   Refineries will vary the proportions slightly, depending on
market prices for products, but in general half of each barrel of
crude oil becomes gasoline, a quarter becomes heating oil or diesel
fuel (which are nearly identical) and a tenth becomes jet fuel. The
rest goes to everything from lubricating oils to asphalt to floor
wax.
</P>
<P>
   Because of futures markets, which send price signals faster than
oil can flow physically through pipelines, consumers can expect to
see prices declining across the spectrum fairly soon. But because
the oil that will be released must be paid back later by oil
companies, prices may rebound later, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effect is that ``the speculators will run,'' said
Gary N. Ross, the chief executive of the Energy Group, a consulting
firm in New York. People who hold contracts today that specify that
oil will be delivered to them this winter will sell some of those
contracts because more oil will be available in the winter, and as
they sell, prices will fall, he and others said. In fact, that has
already begun to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the announcement on Friday, which came after futures
markets closed, heating oil for delivery in October fell by 4.41
cents a gallon, to 95.48 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 10 percent of households use heating oil or
kerosene as their primary fuel, according to the Energy
Department's most recent survey, in 1997. (That is down from 22
percent in 1978.)
</P>
<P>
   Philip K. Verleger Jr., of the Brattle Group, an economic
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., said that the sudden gush of
oil onto the market would probably push the price of crude down by
$5 to $7 a barrel, which comes to 10 to 15 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   That could be enough, depending on such factors as the weather,
to save a typical oil-heated household up to $100 over the winter,
and a family might well experience similar savings for gasoline
over several months of driving.
</P>
<P>
   The price of all goods transported by trucks would also be held
down, too. And because oil and gas are sometimes substituted for
each other _ in electricity generation and various other industrial
uses _ a decline in the price of one fuel would hold down the price
of the other, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced prices cannot last forever, though. The oil is not
being sold, but borrowed, and the refiners that take it will repay
in kind, plus interest, taking oil off the market to replenish the
borrowed stocks. Likely repayment times are next spring and fall,
when demand is lower.
</P>
<P>
   Some may wait until then to buy the oil needed for repayment,
but others could arrange to buy that oil immediately with contracts
on the futures exchanges for deliveries next year.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the effect may be to drive down prices now and raise
them later.

ATLANTA FORGOTTEN, GREENE AND JONES WIN GOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Four years ago, the Atlanta Games played on
with them in the audience, not on the track. Marion Jones was
recovering from a broken foot, Maurice Greene from a bruised ego,
having failed to qualify for the 100 meters at the U.S. track and
field trials. Sitting in tears as Donovan Bailey of Canada won the
gold medal, Greene told himself, ``This will never happen again
without me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Greene ran a wonderfully patient and blistering
race to win a gold medal in the 100 meters in 9.87 seconds. He did
not threaten his world record of 9.79 seconds, but his time was
superb into a head wind and he demonstrated a consistency and
technical mastery that not even Carl Lewis could equal. This was
the 31st time that Greene had run the 100 under 10 seconds, twice
as many as Lewis had during his own brilliant career.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, in the women's 100 meters, Jones burst from the
starting blocks and accelerated with a bounding spring as if the
track were a trampoline. Essentially, the race was over in the
first five meters. She accelerated into her long searing stride and
skipped across the finish line in 10.75 seconds, the fastest time
in the world for a woman this year and the preamble to her attempt
to become the first female athlete in track and field to win five
gold medals in the same Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time U.S. athletes had won the men's and
women's 100-meter sprints since Lewis and Florence Griffith Joyner
were awarded first place at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South
Korea. Lewis actually finished second in that race but was later
declared the winner after Ben Johnson of Canada was stripped of his
gold medal for testing positive for anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   So dominant was Jones' performance Saturday night that her
margin of victory _ 37 hundredths of a second _ was the greatest in
the Olympic 100 meters since Marjorie Jackson of Australia won a
hand-timed race in 1952. Saturday night, Ekaterini Thanou of Greece
finished far behind in 11.12 seconds for the silver, and Tanya
Lawrence of Jamaica won the bronze in 11.18. This was the 35th
consecutive victory at 100 meters for Jones over the past three
years, and even before Saturday night's race began, there was no
doubt even among the competitors who would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running only for the silver medal,'' Thanou said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones reached the finish line with an ecstatic vault but soon
broke into tears as she hugged her mother, Marion Toler, and
grabbed a flag of Belize, her mother's home country. She had been
anticipating this moment since the 1984 Summer Games in Los
Angeles. As an 8-year-old, she had traveled with her family from
their suburban Southern California home to see the torch relay.
That night, she went to her room and wrote on a chalkboard, ``I
want to be an Olympic champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at age 24, she is. Before her senior year of high
school, Jones declined a spot on the American 400-meter relay at
the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. Depending on who is
telling the story, Jones either wanted her first gold to come in an
individual event or her mother would not let her participate
because her grades were insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a broken foot sustained in her second favorite
sport, basketball, prohibited her from competing in the Atlanta
Games and she had to watch as her boyfriend, now husband, C.J.
Hunter, competed in the shot put.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Jones crossed the finish line in a tangle of
emotions _ joy, relief, the shedding of her Olympic frustrations
and the expectation that four more gold medals are possible in the
200 meters, long jump, 400-meter relay and 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 16 years of believing and dreaming about this,'' Jones
said of her emotional outburst at the finish. ``It comes down to
one moment and one race. There's a lot of pressure. To have it all
realized is a huge relief.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt the burden of expectation of her attempt at five gold
medals, and a swarm of moths bothered her at the start, but it
became clear to the 110,000 at Olympic Stadium Saturday night that
she won the race shortly after she left the starting blocks. Her
starts had been troublesome this year, but Saturday night she drove
low and hard from the blocks, hands open, chopping the air, the
exertion of breathing in her cheeks, a calm insistence in her face,
an exquisite fluidity in her stride as her knees piston-pumped her
toward the finish line in silvery spikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beautiful,'' said Karen Dennis, coach of the U.S.
women's track team. ``Marion did what she does best _ explode out,
lift her knees, finish strong. She looked like she was having
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it appears that Jones' attempt to win five
gold medals has been seriously threatened by uncertainty in the
U.S. relays. No other U.S. woman reached the final of the 100,
compared with three from the Bahamas and two from Jamaica. And no
U.S. woman even advanced to the semifinals of the 400 meters. Inger
Miller of Los Angeles, the only real challenger to Jones in the
sprints, withdrew from the 100 with a strained hamstring, and
remains questionable for the 200 and the 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we are still going to be in the hunt,'' Dennis said.
``It takes four people to run a relay. I don't think we're going to
lead the whole way. If we can keep it close for Marion, I think we
can still win.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who is 26, has now demonstrated a reliability on the
track that only Lewis and Johnson had previously achieved. With a
mastery of the science of sprinting that belies his playful
behavior, Greene has now won two consecutive world championships
and an Olympic gold medal at 100 meters. He will attempt to win a
second gold by anchoring the U.S. 400-meter relay next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Greene dedicated his victory to his coach, John
Smith, with whom he began training after the Atlanta Games.
Determined to improve after sitting on the sidelines, Greene packed
his things into a sport utility vehicle and drove to Los Angeles
with his father from his hometown of Kansas City, Kan. He was a
talented but largely unknown sprinter and it was Smith who turned
him into the world's fastest man.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also coaches Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, who won
the silver medal Saturday night in 9.99 seconds. Obadele Thompson
of Barbados took the bronze in 10.04. Athletes trained by Smith
have now produced six gold medals in the sprints. The victories
serve as consolation for the fact that Smith had been a favorite at
400 meters at the 1972 Munich Olympics only to become injured
before those Games and to withdraw 80 meters into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he has a big hole in his heart,'' Greene said. ``I
can't fill the hole he has, but I hope I can put a little back for
him. There's nothing like winning a gold medal in the Olympics. I
owe him a lot.''
</P>

<P>
   &UR; BC-R-OLY-RUN-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; SYDNEY, Australia: a lot.'' &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greene has become the embodiment of Smith's coaching style. He
emerged from the blocks calmly, keeping his head down for half the
race, instead of popping up, and accelerating immediately at full
speed. The idea was to delay his top-end speed until he reached 70
meters, leaving himself a shorter distance to decelerate toward the
finish line. The cords in his neck bulging, Greene finally became
fully upright after 23 strides and he took control of the race with
tactical brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everyone wants to get up and run, he stays down and
drives,'' said Boldon, who trains with Greene at UCLA and who won
the bronze medal at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   After touching hands with Greene during the semifinals, Boldon
slowed slightly, hoping to draw an outside lane for the final. Both
sprinters tend to drift slightly, and, in an outside lane, Boldon
would avoid more contact with Greene. He drew lane 8, but, on the
outside, he did not have Greene to drag him along toward the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he ran tonight, he destroyed us,'' Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene wished Jones luck, saying he would not try such an
ambitious feat. He said he had grown tired after running four
rounds apiece of the 100 and 200 meters, plus the 400 relay, at the
1999 world track and field championships in Seville, Spain. Jones
won the 100 but pulled up with back spasms in the 200 in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish her the best because I wouldn't try it,'' Greene said.
``She's a phenomenal athlete, and it's going to take a phenomenal
athlete to accomplish this. I think she can do it. I hope her body
holds up and doesn't break down like in Seville, so everyone can
see her reach her goals.'' &QL;

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Under the mirror-ball effect from the sudden
flurry of flashbulbs in the aquatic center, beneath the thundering
sound of the foot-stomping Australians erupting at the buzzer, the
American Maureen O'Toole finally pulled herself out of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to let go, especially like this. Stunned by the
controversial game-winning goal that gave the 4-3 victory and the
gold medal in women's water polo to the Aussies Saturday night,
crestfallen to see her amazing career in this sport end with a
cruel twist, there was no way to disguise her sadness. A few yards
away, her 8-year-old daughter, Kelly, was empathizing with tears in
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she understands the full perspective of it, but
she understands that we lost and I was sad,'' said the 39-year-old
O'Toole, fidgeting with the silver medal the each U.S. team member
received after the loss. ``Losing the way we did, I think it just
makes it hurt a little bit more. It's pretty painful.''
</P>
<P>
   One moment, their spirits were soaring after Brenda Villa scored
a game-tying goal with 13 seconds left. The next moment, they were
devastated. With only 1.3 seconds left, the bizarre end unfolded.
Just after a foul was called on the American Julie Swail,
Australia's Yvette Higgins quickly whirled a shot that was
deflected outside the outstretched arms of goalkeeper Bernice
Orwig. A roar from 18,000 strong erupted. The tension-filled match
was over, time had run out.
</P>
<P>
   But for several minutes, the Americans remained bobbing in the
water like corks, unsure of what just happened. Under the
impression that the referees had called the foul inside of 7
meters, they believed the goal should have been discounted because
Higgins did not pass the ball first, which is required under the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the chairman of the technical commission, Gianni
Lonzi, released a statement saying the foul happened outside of 7
meters. Therefore, Lonzi said Higgins was allowed ``an instant shot
and a goal was scored.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the foul occurred outside of 7 meters, at least two
American players argued that Higgins moved forward and pump-faked,
which would also disallow the goal because the movement has to be
uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an anticlimatic way for it to end,'' Swail said. ``To
have 1.3 seconds left, and to have it come down the way it did,
that's difficult to take. But I think we can leave here with our
heads held high. There were a lot of people who didn't think we'd
be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans squeezed into the Olympics, qualifying on one last
chance in May by defeating the favored Italians in Italy. In a way,
it seemed fitting for the Americans to play for the first gold
medal in water polo against the Australians. For over a decade,
members from both teams tirelessly campaigned for the sport's
inclusion into the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Several Aussies planted themselves at the Sydney airport and
held up signs of protest when Juan Antonio Samaranch visited
several years ago. And O'Toole, who began playing the sport on
boys' teams because there were no girls' programs, had been
lobbying since the early '80s. In 1994, she retired with the belief
that women's water polo was never going to gain acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Once the unthinkable occurred, O'Toole was forced to make an
emotionally wrenching decision. While she trained with the team in
Los Angeles, she sent her daughter to live with her parents in
Northern California. For the bulk of three years, O'Toole caught a
Friday afternoon flight to see her daughter for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful to lose like this, but there's a lot more to
life,'' O'Toole said. ``I have an 8-year-old. That's going to be my
focus after this. I don't think any of us will forget how we lost.
It will always be in my mind. But retiring doesn't make me sad at
all. I'm definitely ready to retire. I knew this was going to be
it. It's been a hard three years of training. It will be really fun
to be a full-time mom.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She'll get to keep up with one 8-year-old instead of a U.S. team
full of players half her age. For three years, O'Toole had to push
her body to its boundaries; and, as a leader for the U.S. team,
manufacture a positive attitude even when her energy was petering
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your body just doesn't recover as well,'' O'Toole said. ``It's
hard to snap back.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, she stood as an example of endurance. For 23
years, she has absorbed blows in a physical sport where most of the
pain is inflicted underwater, out of the referee's watch. Over that
time, the player with the whip-snap throws and keen sense on
defense has been recognized as the sport's greatest player. As much
as anyone, the Australian team appreciated what she has given to
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the post-match interview session, members of the
Australian team applauded O'Toole as she sat at the other end of
the table. When asked why, Higgins piped up, ``She's a legend, a
living legend.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, O'Toole's daughter will understand that. Saturday
night, all she knew was that her mother was sad. The history lesson
will come later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what she understands at this point,'' O'Toole
said. ``I think when I'm back with her on a daily basis, and she
starts seeing me again, she'll understand it.''

 ONLINE GROCER DELAYS EXPANSION PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The online grocer that was scheduled to open two large
warehouses in the the Bronx, N.Y., and Bergen County, N.J.,
bringing more than 1,900 jobs to the region, said on Friday that it
would delay its most immediate expansion plans, including the New
Jersey warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Technology industry analysts said the delay also cast doubt on
plans by the company, Webvan Group Inc., for the Bronx warehouse,
which was supposed to provide more than 900 jobs, a project that
New York City officials promoted on Thursday. Officials at Webvan
would not comment on Friday on the plans for that distribution
center.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been offered $11 million in incentives from
economic development officials in New York and more than $3 million
from New Jersey for the respective warehouses. Economic development
officials in both states said they were hopeful that Webvan would
be able continue its plans.
</P>
<P>
   George T. Shaheen, president and chief executive of Webvan,
which is based in San Francisco, said that company officials
believed ``that by focusing our key resources on bringing our
existing operations to profitability, we will be in a better
position to significantly reduce the capital needed to drive our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Webvan officials said they would postpone the scheduled opening
of the New Jersey warehouse, already under construction in Logan
Township, for at least six months. The warehouse was to begin
operating in 2001 and create 1,000 jobs. Webvan also announced
plans to postpone the opening of a warehouse in Glen Burnie, Md. It
was supposed to serve the Baltimore and Washington markets.
</P>
<P>
   Technology analysts said that the move came after signals from
Wall Street that investors are not happy with the performance of
Webvan, a publicly traded Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Like many business-to-customer Internet companies, Webvan has
sustained significant losses. Webvan recently acquired
HomeGrocer.com in a deal valued around $1 billion. Together, the
two companies posted losses of $103.7 million in the first quarter.
Much of those losses have come from capital investments into new
distribution centers like the $40 million warehouse the company
opened in Atlanta in May.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan's stock climbed to more than $34 per share almost
immediately after its initial public offering last November. But
the stock has dropped in recent weeks to record lows of about $2
per share. On Friday, analysts said that they were still optimistic
about Webvan's future because of its corporate leadership,
technology and the merger with HomeGrocer.com. But they were less
positive about expansion in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch released a bulletin on Friday on Webvan's decision
to delay its expansion plans, saying that while analysts there
supported the notion of conserving capital financing and focusing
on profitability, they were ``discouraged by the rescheduled launch
of Webvan's two newest'' distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their concerns that Webvan is operating in areas
where there are not enough families willing to spend the money
needed to make grocery deliveries profitable, Merrill Lynch
analysts have long held that they were most concerned with the
company's ability to successfully perform a national rollout and
enter new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan now operates in nine markets, including San Francisco,
Chicago and Atlanta, and was expected to be in 13 metropolitan
areas by the end of 2000 and 15 by the end of 2001. ``We now expect
Webvan to be in 13 markets by the end of 2001 and believe plans to
enter Boston and New York could be permanently delayed,'' Merrill
Lynch said in its bulletin.

 A LINEMAN AT HARVARD FINDS NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Mike Clare remembers when he was not allowed
to play football.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Rutherford, N.J., it was decided that Clare was
too big to participate in the Pop Warner leagues. Turning to other
sports like basketball and soccer while growing up, Clare hoped he
would not have to wait long before his age caught up with his
imposing physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not start playing football until he entered high
school, time turned out to be Clare's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 6-foot-4-inch, 315-pound Clare is not only the starting
left tackle on the Harvard football team, but the senior is gaining
recognition as a national force. His coach, Tim Murphy, calls him
``the best offensive lineman in the Ivy League.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has great instincts, quickness and technique,'' Murphy
said. ``He doesn't have an easy job, because, as our left tackle,
he draws the opposing team's best pass rusher.''
</P>
<P>
   Rated as the nation's fourth-best offensive tackle by The Sports
Network, Clare is a mix of strength and athleticism, clearing space
through the opposing team's defensive line as if he were burning
weeds off a vacant lot.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Clare was named first team All-Ivy League and first
team All-New England, playing every snap of Harvard's 10 games
despite a troubling left elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   Clare, 21, is not standing on his laurels. He is bent on
improving his pass blocking, specifically his first step, and is
working extensively with the Crimson offensive line coach, Jim
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Clare thinks he has already made improvements in other areas.
``I am more mature than I used to be,'' Clare said. ``I don't let
the little things bother me. If I get a penalty, or the team gets a
penalty, I just move ahead instead of worrying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a team captain for Harvard (0-1), which opened its Ivy League
season against Brown in Providence on Saturday, Clare has added
tact to his repertory. He has learned to pick and choose his spots
with teammates who need guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very vocal person, but I choose to lead by example,''
Clare said. ``If a player messes up, I let him know and correct
him, but I don't think yelling in his face is the right way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   He displays the same sensitivity away from the field, working
with inner-city children in the Mission Hill Program in Boston. On
Monday afternoons, he can be found tutoring the students in the
program, helping them with their schoolwork, and humoring them on
the playground.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday afternoons last spring, Clare was involved in
the National Football League Flag Football Program, intended to
promote and teach the game to young people. Working directly with a
group of 9- and 10-year-olds, Clare said he was impressed with
their enthusiasm. At one point, he had them drawing plays in the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to teach these kids that a good education comes
first,'' said Clare, a psychology major who said he would like to
work with children if he did not succeed in professional football.
``A lot of them ask me about football, but I stress to them that if
they hit the books, then everything will fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the lessons Clare has learned from his parents, Tom
and Kathie. Over the last four seasons, they have never missed a
game at Harvard, making the six-hour drive from New Jersey. After
each game, instead of jumping back onto the Interstate for the long
drive home, Tom and Kathie Clare regularly hold tailgate picnics in
the parking lot, cooking more than a hundred hot dogs for the rest
of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Following the disappointing conclusion to last season, when the
Crimson lost their last three games by a combined 14 points in the
last few minutes, Clare says the team entered this season
determined to capture the Ivy League title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team looks strong right now, but we now if we set our
goals any lower than a championship, we won't win,'' Clare said.
</P>
<P>
   Clare, who is in his third season as a starter, inherited the
left tackle position from Matt Birk before the 1998 season. Clare
and Birk, currently the starting center on the Minnesota Vikings,
have remained friends since Birk sponsored Clare during his
recruiting trip to Cambridge. ``He is the reason I came to
Harvard,'' Clare said.

EDITORIAL: TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 24:
</P>
<P>
   The national debate over health policy, which first occupied the
top rungs of the political agenda in the 1992 presidential
campaign, shifts focus as the nature of problems shifts. In the mid
1990s, the focus was on the soaring cost of health insurance.
Toward the end of the '90s, attention shifted to alleged excesses
of managed care plans. But one problem never fades away. That is
the shameful fact that the United States is the only industrialized
power that does not provide some form of universal health coverage
for its people. Some 45 million Americans still lack health
insurance, and despite a decade of prosperity, the number is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not just that the uninsured live in constant fear
of financial catastrophe. They also suffer medically from the lack
of ongoing basic treatment. Studies show that the uninsured are
substantially more likely to require hospitalization for festering
medical problems like diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed in 1993 to achieve universal coverage
with a massive overhaul of the entire health care sector. But after
the plan self-destructed, the administration did little to attack
the problem. The issue flickered momentarily as Bill Bradley posed
a thoughtful solution during his presidential campaign. Vice
President Al Gore, after he snuffed out Bradley's bid in the
primaries, also turned away from the issue, and in the general
election campaign, he and Gov. George W. Bush have offered
piecemeal plans for extending health insurance coverage. But none
of their proposals would knock more than a few million off the
dreadful 45 million total that includes 10 million children.
</P>
<P>
   Such tentativeness is unwarranted. There is no more important
use of the $4.5 trillion surplus expected over the next 10 years
than to do what other wealthy countries have proved is affordable.
</P>
<P>
   The straightforward way to reduce the number of uninsured
Americans is to provide them refundable tax credits to help pay for
their health coverage. Tax credits lower a family's tax bill
dollar-for-dollar to offset the cost of insurance premiums. By
making credits refundable, families too poor to owe much tax
receive the offset as cash.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposed tax credits of up to $5,000 per family to buy
coverage from private plans, including those that cover federal
employees. The plan would not have reached everyone _ perhaps
leaving 5 percent or more of the population uninsured. Yet the plan
would still have cost perhaps $50 billion a year, a price tag that
at one time paralyzed debate. But burgeoning surpluses _ estimates
of which have risen by trillions of dollars since Bradley proposed
his idea _ make a Bradley-like program affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, proposes a tax credit of up to $2,000,
costing about $60 billion over 10 years. He would also spend $8
billion to build community health centers. But the tax credit is
too skimpy to draw many uninsured families to policies that could
cost them thousands of dollars a year more than the Bush credit
would cover. Nor does the Bush proposal include requirements that
parents buy coverage for children or strong penalties for states
that fail to drive down the number of uninsured residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's platform calls for spending about $140 billion over 10
years to raise coverage among the uninsured. He proposes a
refundable tax credit for individuals equal to 25 percent of the
cost of their coverage. For a $2,000 premium, that would amount to
a credit of only about $500.
</P>
<P>
   Gore fears that tax credits large enough to attract the
uninsured would encourage employers to drop coverage for workers.
So he would also make more low-income children eligible for the
Children's Health Insurance Program, an existing state-run program,
and open that program to the parents of eligible children. The Gore
plan would permit children from families that earn too much to
qualify for the program to buy coverage at an unsubsidized premium.
But state programs have been slow to soak up many uninsured
children, so Gore's proposal, though overall a more effective
approach than Bush's, offers little prospect of making a giant step
toward universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is unconscionable that the richest country in the
world refuses to cover the insurance needs of all its residents,
neither candidate proposes to do much about the problem anytime
soon. True, they have plans to spend the surplus on other purposes,
some of which are worthy in their own right. But if this moment _ a
moment of unprecedented economic prosperity and looming budget
surpluses _ is the wrong one for an aggressive move toward
universal health insurance, when will it be right?

U.S. IS RALLYING ALLIES' SUPPORT TO AID GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Inserts ``because of higher taxes,'' in graf that begins
``Prices at the pump ...'' Changes ``Britain's finance minister''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The top U.S. financial officials, fresh
from parallel plunges into world oil and currency markets, sought
to rally allies in the Group of 7 industrialized nations on
Saturday to fight what they labeled twin threats to the
record-breaking U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, met their European, Canadian and
Japanese counterparts in Prague ahead of the annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The officials
negotiated a joint communique expected to be released Saturday
night that will be closely scrutinized as an indicator of how far
authorities intend to extend market interventions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States joined Group of 7 counterparts Friday in a
concerted intervention in currency markets to support the tumbling
euro, Europe's single currency, catching traders off guard and
giving the euro at least a temporary boost. On the same day, U.S.
officials announced plans to dip into the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserves to fight the surge in oil prices as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts to correct currency rates and oil prices cast the
United States, which typically argues that such markets should take
care of themselves, as an aggressive interventionist, evoking
expressions of surprise even from some generally less
market-sensitive counterparts. Many expressed satisfaction that the
action to bolster the euro had gone smoothly, though it remained
unclear how markets will react when they reopen for trading this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surprising how well the action went,'' Germany's
finance minister, Hans Eichel, told reporters Saturday morning.
``Especially before the U.S. election, it was surprising the U.S.
even participated.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-level talks on how best to corral market prices
underscored how officials have come to view the euro's weakness and
oil's strength as major inflationary threats that pose an immediate
danger to what has been seen as an almost unprecedented streak of
global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rhetoric has been understated, the United States
participated in the defense of the 21-month-old European common
currency, led by the European Central Bank, because of what Summers
called a ``threat to the world economy.'' It was the first time
since 1998, when the United States and Japan joined forces to back
the yen in the midst of the Asian financial crisis, that the
Clinton administration had agreed to sell dollars in support of a
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   Summers in the past has stressed his reluctance to tap the
national oil reserve as a way to put downward pressure on oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to do so sent a clear
signal that the price of oil, which has hit its highest level since
the Persian Gulf war, threatens the health of the U.S. economy and
the presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   European officials on Saturday praised the U.S. action on oil
and suggested that the European Union should also adopt a unified
political response to the challenge posed by rising oil prices.
Several European nations, including Britain and France, have
sustained protests by truck drivers and other groups hurt by high
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at the pump in Europe, already far higher than those in
the United States, because of higher taxes, have risen even more
dramatically because oil is bought and sold in dollars, which have
been rising in value against the euro almost in tandem with the
oil-price spike.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union should also devise a common response to the
oil-price rise, said Ernst Welteke, who heads Bundesbank, Germany's
central bank. He said the failure to adopt a common approach after
the United States took action demonstrated a weakness in political
coordination among European governments that he suggested was one
of the factors that have hurt the euro since its launch in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discrepancy between European governments' response to the
oil shock does not demonstrate that a common financial and economic
policy is being pursued within the euro zone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   France's finance minister, Laurent Fabius, pushed Group of 7
ministers to coordinate an assault on high oil prices, possibly
through a joint meeting with OPEC nations, European officials said.
But Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, threw cold
water on that idea Saturday. He said his counterparts had not
endorsed the idea of a joint meeting, though he said several
bilateral meetings had been arranged.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, invited 200
charity and pressure groups concerned about globalization to debate
the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund at
Prague Castle.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour session, followed by a walk through the
gardens of the sprawling historic residence of Czech rulers,
numerous environmentalists and political activists presented an
extensive list of demands to James D. Wolfensohn, president of the
World Bank, and Horst Koehler, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Several called for the complete abolition of the two
Washington-based lending agencies, which were founded just after
World War II to finance the reconstruction of Europe and stabilize
world currencies. Both have been under heavy pressure recently to
help improve the economies of poorer nations that receive most of
their loans.
</P>
<P>
   On Prague's streets, anti-globalization protesters who have
vowed to shut down the annual meetings did not disrupt Saturday's
closed-door sessions of the Group of 7. Security around the
historic city center was tight.
</P>
<P>
   So far the protests have been muted, but thousands more are
expected to arrive in the Czech capital ahead of a planned march
for debt relief on Sunday and an attempt to disrupt the formal
ceremonies of the meetings on Tuesday.

week, he will leave enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws in
better shape than when he took over the antitrust division in 1996.
He will, of course, be remembered most for taking on Microsoft. But
beyond that celebrated case, Klein brought new energy and
credibility to a division whose enforcement arm had lain dormant
since the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's tenure did not start well. As acting head of the
antitrust division, he approved unconditionally the merger of Bell
Atlantic and Nynex, eliminating the benefits that would come from
future competition between these regional phone giants. But Klein
made sound judgments in subsequent cases, showing that mainstream
antitrust principles can be effectively applied to modern markets.
</P>
<P>
   He went after Microsoft for using its dominant market position
to thwart entry by competitors and won a court order to break the
company in two. Klein brought another challenging case against Visa
and MasterCard for using their dominant position in credit cards to
stifle innovation and block rivals. He also charged American
Airlines with engaging in predatory practices. The ultimate
outcomes of these cases are uncertain, but Klein deserves credit
for bringing potentially abusive tactics by dominant firms under
judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   Klein blocked a series of mergers _ between Lockheed Martin and
Northrop Grumman, WorldCom and Sprint, and Northwest and
Continental _ that had the potential to harm consumers. He also
broke up price-fixing cartels, notably between international
vitamin companies. He has not forged bold new antitrust principles
or direction. What he has done is take antitrust enforcement
seriously. For that alone he warrants the nation's gratitude.

EDITORIAL: DON'T MAR THE MALL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Before he leaves office, President Clinton hopes to break ground
for a suitable memorial to the veterans of World War II, who are
dwindling in number with each passing day. The veterans of that
brutal and pivotal conflict, so important to the protection of
democratic freedoms everywhere, richly deserve such a memorial. But
neither their memory nor Clinton's legacy will be well served by
the proposed memorial approved Thursday by the National Capital
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, when Congress approved and Clinton signed the
enabling legislation, the $100 million project has gone through one
revision after another, without acquiring anything approaching a
consensus in its favor. It has powerful friends, including Bob
Dole, who is helping to raise money for the memorial. It also has
powerful enemies, including many prominent architects and even some
of Clinton's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The one person who could halt the project _ or at least call a
time out _ is Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the interior, who
must still sign the construction permits. But he is unlikely to
take such a step without some signal from the president, who would
be well advised to review the design to see whether this is really
what he had in mind back in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version suffers from the same fundamental defects
that led this page to oppose a slightly more grandiose version in
1997. The design calls for a sunken stone plaza, flanked by 56
17-foot pillars representing the states and territories during the
war. There will also be two triumphal arches, one symbolizing the
European theater, the other the Pacific. It is, in short, a weighty
structure, complete with decorative touches like bronze eagles and
wreaths. Some critics have compared it to the totalitarian
architecture of the old Soviet Union or _ the unkindest cut of all
_ the Third Reich. Still missing is the centerpiece of the
memorial, a sculpture that has yet to be designed.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disqualifying is the location _ smack dab on the axis
that runs for two largely uninterrupted miles down the Mall from
the Capitol through the Washington Monument to the Lincoln
Memorial. Unlike the memorials to the Korean and Vietnam Wars,
which stand rather quietly in the wings to the south and north of
the Lincoln Memorial, this one will occupy center stage. It will
not only mar a glorious piece of open space, but also break the
visual connection between the monuments to Washington and Lincoln
memorializing the two events that did the most to shape this
Republic, the Revolution and the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   America's participation in World War II, of course, was also
supremely important in the life of this nation. Indeed, the
memorial's proponents argue that only a central location on the
Mall's axis can do World War II justice and give it the
hierarchical recognition it deserves. This argument is powerful but
insufficient, and the administration should ask the commission to
find another location. One earlier suggestion was a site known as
Constitution Gardens, on the Mall but just to the side. Another
site, potentially grander than Constitution Gardens, is an unused
circle at the entrance to Arlington National Cemetery on the
Virginia side of the Potomac. World War II's centrality deserves an
eloquent memorial, but not one that diminishes two of the nation's
most treasured icons.

DAWN LANGLEY SIMMONS, 77, WRITER WHO SCANDALIZED CHARLESTON, S.C. 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a
sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized
her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her
daughter's home there. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress
Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter,
Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels,
biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books
understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey
that started on an English estate, touched down on an American
Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era
Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the
street from Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered
her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ``a
Dippity-Do hairstyle _ a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Hitt said. She
lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden
garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her
dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room,
dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at
Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in
Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of
Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard
Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Simmons
always said, from a high social class.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that
causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised
as a boy. She always maintained that she was _ unequivocally _
female.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel
Nicolson. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation
from England last Friday. ``We called him `Dinky,' and I always
think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always
looked like a boy.
</P>
<P>
   At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf,
Sackville-West's lover and the author of ``Orlando,'' a novel about
a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ``Had she lived a little
longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child
`Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,''
Simmons wrote in her memoir, ``Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995,
Wyrick &AMP; Co.).
</P>
<P>
   In his late teens, Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as
a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians,
according to his book about his experiences, ``Me Papoose Sitter''
(Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press,
and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail
in Missouri. Nicolson said he was ``a very good journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy
and American Evangelism. According to the reference work
``Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W.H. Archer praised Hall's
``Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon
Press, 1970), calling it ``scrupulously researched'' and written in
``a charmingly premeditated style.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York in his 20s, Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became
enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted
him.
</P>
<P>
   In that period Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney,
who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that
time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on
Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay
population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames,
restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture,
mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to
have been owned by Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black
butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ``Dawn: A Charleston
Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial
marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple
to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and
the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Rutherford was reported to have said, ``I am
delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that
Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that
Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man
is a Baptist!''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began
strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she
called Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Simmons
claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask
and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period
of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her
belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some
time later, her husband was confined to a mental institution near
Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she
was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of
its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter
on her meager earnings as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's
past. ``I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that
she was, as a family woman,'' Simmons said. ``She was devoted to my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and daughter, Simmons is survived by
three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After she published ``Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her
childhood friend, Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator.
``I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and
refused to meet her,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,''
he wrote, ``and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to
Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ``I
saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he
continued. ``For the first time I was touched.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,''
Nicolson marveled. ``Like everything else about Dinky, it is
gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''

GORE'S RACE IN FLORIDA HAS SOME REPUBLICANS POINTING FINGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD L. BERKE   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. _ As Gov. George W. Bush on Saturday devoted a
second day to stumping in a state where he never expected fierce
competition, Republicans have begun to second-guess the Bush
campaign, saying it took Florida for granted, failed to explain his
position on issues of concern to the many elderly people here and,
overall, failed to see signs of Vice President Al Gore's potential
to win.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has drawn even or overtaken Bush in other critical
states, the governor's advisers say they are most unnerved by the
upended electoral reality in Florida, which has 25 electoral votes,
making it one of the biggest prizes on Election Day. And now with
only six weeks remaining, Republicans face polls showing a dead
heat in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually impossible to construct a strategy for Bush to
capture the White House if he does not win New York, California or
Florida, and polls show Gore is comfortably ahead in the first two
states.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of moving aggressively over the summer to secure
Florida, Republican lawmakers and party officials in and out of the
state said in interviews last week, the Bush forces seemed lulled
into complacency here. The assumption of many Bush advisers, these
Republicans said, was that Bush would not have to worry about
Florida because his brother Jeb is the popular governor, and
because Florida historically backs Republicans for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was coasting with an easy smile and the thrill of
victory in their mind,'' said Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla). ``The stakes
are very high now for Jeb. You don't want your own brother calling
and saying, `What happened? I thought we were in pretty good
shape?'''
</P>
<P>
   Besides costing campaign time for Bush, the miscalculation has
forced Republicans to divert millions of dollars here to the
fourth-largest state _ money that would have been pumped into
battleground states in the Midwest, where he also faces a powerful
threat from Gore. A secondary yet significant concern among many
Republicans is that the tight race here complicates the party's
drive to win the state's open Senate seat as well as its prospects
in two ferociously competitive House races.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Republicans assess their own performance, they also
credit the changed dynamic to demographic factors and to the Gore
campaign's deftness at sensing Bush's vulnerability. One after
another, Republicans said Democrats had more skillfully tailored
their issues to Florida voters.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said an incalculable benefit for their
opponents was Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut as his running mate. In picking the first Jewish
candidate for a major party presidential ticket, Gore emboldened
Jewish voters, even though most were widely expected to favor
Democrats anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) said many party stalwarts had never
considered the advantages of a sitting vice president. ``What
people failed to understand is the power of incumbents,'' said
Mack, who is retiring. ``They understand it in every other race.
Why they wouldn't in a presidential race is beyond me.'' One
explanation, he said, was that the ``enthusiasm and excitement for
George Bush set them up for wrong expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because they were so optimistic, many Republicans now
grouse that Bush and his party did not move early enough to
advertise in the state. They also say the campaign was slow to
explain Bush's stands on issues that are critical to the aging
population here, from prescription drugs to protecting Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that Jeb Bush warned his brother months ago that Gore
could effectively scare elderly voters _ and that those warnings
never seemed to be acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been off the block a bit earlier on our senior
citizen issues,'' said Tom Slade, a former chairman of the State
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans said Jeb Bush had disappointed them as well
because he had not stumped as visibly, and doggedly, for his
brother as they had expected. He has been a potent fund-raiser for
the party but has been far less active publicly for the ticket than
many other Republican governors. Concerns about Jeb Bush's
commitment intensified earlier this month when he did not show up
at a rally here with his brother, prompting the Texas governor to
crack, ``I'm a little disappointed the chairman of my campaign is
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to explain Jeb Bush's low profile, Al Cardenas, the
state Republican chairman, said the Florida governor had retreated
because he did not like being compared to his brother in the press.
``Another reason is he's got a lot of things to do,'' Cardenas
said. ``But he'll do more.''
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raising event in Coconut Grove near here on Friday
night, it appeared that Jeb Bush got the message. The Florida
governor played an important role in organizing what appeared to be
a wildly successful event; thousands of partisans mobbed a
convention center to hear George W. and Jeb Bush and see their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is Bush country!'' Jeb Bush exulted. His father won
the state in 1988 and 1992, but President Clinton carried it four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   George W. implored the crowd: ``We're going to win Florida.
We're going to win. Let's redouble our efforts. Let's talk to those
Democrats who want new leadership. Let's get those independent
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The close competition has led the nominees to travel here
several times since their conventions. Bush was in Orlando on
Saturday, on the second day of a two-day swing. His father, former
President Bush, was here on Friday. Gore arrives on Monday; his
running mate, Lieberman, was in Florida on Thursday and Friday.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Even when the principals are not here, their messages are front
and center in a relentless barrage of commercials in virtually
every major media market.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans take some solace in the belief that voters of
Florida could turn on Gore just as they have on Bush. They also
said the unanticipated potency of the Democratic ticket might shake
Republicans out of their complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are reading polls and saying, `It's over,''' said Al
Austin, a Tampa real estate developer who is the finance chairman
of the state Republican Party. ``Well, it's not over. If Gore wants
to cause George W. to spend time in Florida and keep him out of the
battleground states, I'm sure that's part of their strategy. But at
the same time, they've motivated the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush carries Florida, the Gore campaign can claim
something of a victory, because the Bush operation and the
Republican Party have spent more than $4 million in advertisements
here since the Democratic convention. The money could have been
spent on campaign efforts in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said the Bush organization's excessive
confidence and less-than-enthusiastic operation in Florida reminded
them of how the governor and his top advisers were brimming with
certainty about their prospects on the eve of the New Hampshire
primary, in which Sen. John McCain's upset Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce competition here was perhaps inevitable, given
changes in the voting population. In recent years, there has been
an influx of young, suburban families, many of whose members are
independent voters with no partisan allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that the second generation of Cuban-Americans,
long reliable Republicans, do not seem as resolutely committed to
the party, in part because they are not as fiercely guided by their
sentiments against Fidel Castro. Yet another opportunity for
Democrats has been that the pool of Cuban-American voters has been
stagnant, while there has been a surge in Hispanics from Central
America and elsewhere, who would be more likely to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Florida was a Republican state was never a
correct interpretation,'' said Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.).

said the unanticipated potency of the Democratic ticket might shake
Republicans out of their complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are reading polls and saying, `It's over,''' said Al
Austin, a Tampa real estate developer who is the finance chairman
of the state Republican Party. ``Well, it's not over. If Gore wants
to cause George W. to spend time in Florida and keep him out of the
battleground states, I'm sure that's part of their strategy. But at
the same time, they've motivated the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush carries Florida, the Gore campaign can claim
something of a victory, because the Bush operation and the
Republican Party have spent more than $4 million in advertisements
here since the Democratic convention. The money could have been
spent on campaign efforts in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said the Bush organization's excessive
confidence and less-than-enthusiastic operation in Florida reminded
them of how the governor and his top advisers were brimming with
certainty about their prospects on the eve of the New Hampshire
primary, in which Sen. John McCain's upset Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce competition here was perhaps inevitable, given
changes in the voting population. In recent years, there has been
an influx of young, suburban families, many of whose members are
independent voters with no partisan allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that the second generation of Cuban-Americans,
long reliable Republicans, do not seem as resolutely committed to
the party, in part because they are not as fiercely guided by their
sentiments against Fidel Castro. Yet another opportunity for
Democrats has been that the pool of Cuban-American voters has been
stagnant, while there has been a surge in Hispanics from Central
America and elsewhere, who would be more likely to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Florida was a Republican state was never a
correct interpretation,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla..

CANADIANS APPEAR TO MISS THEIR BID TO AVOID THE U.S.
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Steve Nash was dribbling away as the shot
clock wound down, taking care of the basketball and _ as ridiculous
as it sounds _ unsure whether to preserve an 18-point loss to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, the Canadian point guard, had at times been spectacular
over the last week, directing his team, the most surprising of the
Olympic tournament, to three straight victories before Saturday's
77-59 loss. In the last 30 seconds at the Dome in Olympic Park, he
dribbled maybe 10 seconds off the shot clock before looking over at
the bench for instruction.
</P>
<P>
   His coaching staff told Nash to run a play, but the Canadians
were unsure whether they needed to avoid losing by more than 18
points, to maintain a point-differential advantage over Australia
for medal-round seeding purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for Russia (2-2), Canada (3-1) and Australia (2-2) was
to avoid a quarterfinal matchup with the United States, which
routed New Zealand, 102-56, Saturday. With the possibility they all
might finish 3-2 in preliminary play, the Canadians at least needed
the tiebreaker over Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But then something inexplicable happened, something Team Canada
may regret for four years. Moments after coach Jay Triano explained
to the news media that the rules needed to be changed to avoid
point-shaving and admitted his players did not attack the basket in
the final moments, new math came to the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians apparently misunderstood the rules. Under the
regulations of FIBA, basketball's international governing body,
goal average, and not point differential, is used as the tiebreaker
when three teams are knotted. A team's points against the other two
teams are divided by the opposition's points, to arrive at a goal
average.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in this system, a team winning 40-20 would have the
advantage over a team winning 80-60 because they would have a
higher percentage of points scored.
</P>
<P>
   Russia won out, with a 1.10447 average. Australia nipped Canada
by the slimmest of margins, 0.9593 to 0.9581. Should the three
teams wind up with identical records, the Canadians will take no
solace in this brutal statistic: One point would have put them
ahead of Australia. A free throw. One point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit weird to find that out after the game,''
John Lee, the Canadian team trainer, said. ``If we had just made
one free throw, there would be no controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians still have a chance to win Group B if they can
upset unbeaten Yugoslavia on Monday or if Australia is upset by
Spain. But should all three teams finish 3-2, Nash and his
teammates will forever bemoan the confusing end to Saturday night's
game. The way the Yugoslavians have been playing, an upset by Spain
over Australia, which held off Angola, 86-75, is more plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men cruised past New Zealand to move to 4-0 in this
tournament. Vince Carter dunked often, ending with 18 points. Allan
Houston contributed 17 points, burying four of the five 3-pointers
he attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Marks, who played in the NBA for two seasons with Toronto,
led New Zealand with 10 points. Unlike some of the more unfriendly
competitions between the U.S. men and their opponents here, a
genuine respect between the teams developed.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the game, the New Zealanders paid the Americans
the ultimate form of homage in their sporting culture. Putting
their hands on their knees in the center of the court and bending
down slightly, they suddenly broke into the Haka, a legendary war
dance used by the Maori people to show respect to their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, Kevin Garnett and the U.S. players hugged and high-fived
the New Zealand players after their baritone chant and dance was
complete. The crowd of 8,392 erupted as the two teams walked off
together toward the locker room. ``I didn't know what they were
doing,'' Garnett began, ``but I thought it was pretty cool. They
asked for the floor and for us to turn around. So I just sat back
and watched.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men played for the first time without Alonzo Mourning,
who left Sydney on Friday to return home to Miami for the birth of
his daughter. Flying commercial to Los Angeles, Mourning was met at
the airport by a charter jet belonging to Micky Arison, the Miami
Heat owner.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the Miami hospital 17 minutes before his wife,
Tracy Wilson-Mourning, gave birth to the couple's daughter, Myka
Sydney. Mourning is expected to return to Sydney on Monday night
and play in the medal-round games, completing a round trip of
18,660 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Olympic Village, the Canadians were ruing their
misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   In the final six minutes against Russia, they scored only five
points. Todd MacCulloch missed a free throw with one minute four
seconds left. Nash missed a field goal with 1:43 remaining. And
then came the final seconds, when Nash, the Dallas Mavericks' point
guard, may have unknowingly dribbled Canada's medal chances away.
</P>
<P>
   One point: Possibly the difference between leaving with a medal
and being run off the floor by Team USA in the quarterfinals.  &QL;

HENRY WEINSTEIN, 76, PRODUCER FOR FILM, TELEVISION AND THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry T. Weinstein, a veteran movie producer who may be best
known for trying to help Marilyn Monroe complete her last film,
died Sept. 17 in Boca Raton, Fla., where he lived. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   He had been ill for some time, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein retired from the movie industry in the mid-1990s after
producing films and working in television and theater for more than
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   He became a producer of the last movie in which Monroe was cast,
``Something's Got to Give,'' when, as David Brown of 20th Century
Fox recalled later, ``Her therapist said it would be better if
Marilyn had someone who understood her and could deal with her.''
</P>
<P>
   After disagreements arose about the script shortly before
filming was to begin, Weinstein concluded that Monroe was ``one
very ill, very paranoid lady.'' Some weeks before, he had come to
her aid when she suffered a barbiturate overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe was dismissed from the film for absenteeism in 1962,
after several weeks of shooting at Fox. Two months later she died
from a drug overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Weinstein told her biographer, Anthony Summers,
that she had an extreme fear of performing, sometimes to the point
of retching when she arrived at the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all experience anxiety, unhappiness, heartbreaks,''
Weinstein recalled, ``but that was sheer, primal terror.''
</P>
<P>
   He ``was very close with Monroe,'' recalled Jill Jacobson, the
wife of his nephew, Marc Jacobson. Jacobson said that during the
movie shoot, Monroe ``cried on his shoulder a lot.'' The film was
never completed.
</P>
<P>
   Another highlight of Weinstein's career came years later, in
1985. He was executive producer of the movie ``Runaway Train,''
which received three Academy Award nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein also produced the film of F. Scott Fitzgerald's
``Tender Is the Night'' (1962), starring Jennifer Jones and Jason
Robards Jr., and ``Joy in the Morning'' (1965), based on a novel by
Betty Smith.
</P>
<P>
   His work in television included the vice presidency of creative
affairs and production for American Film Theater, which produced
film versions of serious plays for subscription audiences in movie
theaters. Among them were ``A Delicate Balance,'' starring
Katharine Hepburn, Paul Scofield and Joseph Cotten, and ``The Three
Sisters'' with Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright.
</P>
<P>
   He was also an executive producer of ``American Playhouse,''
which presented live dramas on public television.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was born and raised in Brooklyn. He graduated from
City College and received a master's degree in drama from Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sisters, Judge Ruth Pearlman of Jersey
City, N.J., and Naomi Warren, his twin, of Boca Raton.

AMID THE COMPETITION, SOME TUGGING AT THE HEARTSTRINGS
</HEADLINE>
  By NEIL AMDUR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are stories of the heart, unscripted Olympic moments of
poignancy, tenderness and sportsmanship that live for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the dead heat between two U.S. teammates, Gary Hall
Jr. and Anthony Ervin, who trained together, ate together, reached
the finish of the men's 50-meter freestyle in the same time and
stood on the same victory platform for the national anthem provided
another thread in this rich Olympic tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Hall is white and Irvin is the first swimmer of
African-American descent to win a gold medal is almost incidental
to their friendship and their ability to overcome two of the
premier names in swimming, Alexander Popov of Russia and Pieter van
den Hoogenband of the Netherlands. Hall Jr. already had his place
in another memorable moment in Olympic history. For amazingly, it
was Hall Jr. who had been carried around the pool to the medal
stand by his father during the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics have provided the backdrop for any number of these
stories that touch the heart.
</P>
<P>
   At another Australian Olympics, 1956 in Melbourne, an American
hammer thrower, Harold Connolly, and a Czech discus thrower, Olga
Fikotova, overcame the chill of the Cold War in the Olympic
Village, won separate gold medals and then carried their
international romance to Prague, where 40,000 well-wishers attended
their wedding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Vera Caslavska, a Czech gymnast, survived the Soviet
invasion of her homeland earlier in the year and won four gold
medals and two silvers, including the all-around title, in Mexico
City. During the medal ceremony for the floor exercise, where
Caslavska shared first place with Larisa Petrick of the Soviet
Union, when the Soviet national anthem was being played, in a
silent moment of protest, Caslavska bowed her head and turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours later, with the Games still on, Caslavska was
married in a civil ceremony at the house of the Czechoslovak
ambassador and then serenaded by a crowd of 10,000 as she and Josef
Odlozil, a runner, were married at a Roman Catholic church in
Xocalo Square.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Landon, the 1920 Olympic high jump champion, met his future
wife Alice, a diver, shipboard en route to Antwerp, Belgium. At
Helsinki, Finland, in 1952, it was a husband-wife gold-medal double
when Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia won the men's 5,000 meters.
After joyfully inspecting her husband's gold medal, Dana Zatopkova
followed by setting an Olympic record in the javelin.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of Derek Redmond was embraced by millions of television
viewers. The British 400-meter runner was assisted to the finish of
a semifinal heat in Barcelona, Spain, by his father, Jim, after
tearing a hamstring during the 1992 Olympic race.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious, but equally touching, was a medal ceremony in
shooting during the Montreal Games in 1976, when Lanny Bassham and
Margaret Murdock of the United States tied for first place in the
small-bore rifle, three positions. Bassham was awarded the gold
medal on a technicality but felt that the rule was so inane that he
pulled Murdock up to the gold-medal platform, where she became the
first woman to win an Olympic shooting medal.
</P>
<P>
   Not all gold-medal stories end happily. Olga Connolly carried
the American flag during the opening ceremony in Munich, but she
and her husband were divorced the following year. Vera Caslavska is
currently an IOC member from the Czech Republic. She and her
husband were divorced in 1992. The following year, their son,
Martin, killed his father during a fight.

 &HT;    'Marla Runyan's inspiration is invaluable'
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ All she wanted was some steamed broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I walked into the dining hall at the Olympic
Village, I was a little intimidated,'' she said. ``The place was
about the size of an indoor track arena and my quest was to find a
tray, some silverware and that broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a while, but I finally found something that looked
green and I had them put it on my plate, But when I got back to my
table and tasted it, it wasn't broccoli. I went back again and
again and by the fourth time, I asked someone, 'Hey, can you go
with me and find some broccoli?' ``
</P>
<P>
   She started to laugh: ``Now, I'm getting all kinds of help. I've
even got one of the cooks who comes out, reads me the menu and
gives me the fat, protein and calorie count of all the foods.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Marla Runyan's way.
</P>
<P>
   She takes a dilemma and turns it into a deli platter of
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   That 1500-meter runner for the United States Olympic track and
field team is one of the best success stories _ in all of sports,
not just these Summer Games _ that you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Runyan is the first ever legally-blind U.S.
Olympian. And what makes her participation here even more
improbable is that until three years ago, she was a heptathlete
competing in the Paralympics. Not only did she switch disciplines,
but in no time at all, she became one of the elite metric milers in
the entire world.
</P>
<P>
   She suffers from Stargardt's Disease, a degeneration of the
retina that destroys a person's central vision. That's means she
can only see things in her periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Her sight began to fade when she was a child and continued to
worsen until she was 15. Today, she has 20/400 vision in both eyes.
With corrective contacts, her sight improves to 20/300. She
described her sight as ``very soft, unable to distinguish many
details. Like a camera with bad film.''
</P>
<P>
   On the track, she can see neither the lap clock just off the
running surface or the finish tape as she comes down the stretch.
Opponents appear in a blur of streaking color and melted feature.
Her best sensor for other runners is their breathing. She can hear
them coming, hear who's laboring and who sounds steady and strong.
</P>
<P>
   When she showed up at Olympic Park the other day to talk about
her event _ she runs her first 1500 heat Wednesday _ she felt her
way along the wall as she made her way up a small flight of stairs.
Sitting on a chair across from you, she tilted her head a bit
sideways so she could make out where you were. Even from four feet
away, she still couldn't make out facial features.
</P>
<P>
   Translated to every day life that means pressing cans to her
forehead while grocery shopping so she can see the picture on the
front. She said she can't read the messages that come up on her
cell phone screen and has trouble reading the time on her
wristwatch. Reading anything else _ from bills and birthday cards
to newspapers and E-mails _ requires a magnifying glass and a
closed circuit device that enlarges everything. Driving requires
special lenses _ ``telescopes mounted on my glasses,'' is how she
described it _ and then she can only drive during the day in
California. Her license isn't recognized in Oregon where she now
lives
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be careful _ for my safety and others,'' she said.
``A lot of my friends don't want to ride with me. We joke about it.
But my blind friends _ they think I drive just great.''
</P>
<P>
   When you press her too long on the sight issue, Runyan gets
restless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm trying to avoid the question,'' she said.
``I'd just rather be known as somebody who made the Olympic team in
the 1500 after coming from the heptathlon. And then, oh, by the
way, she's got a sight problem, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd like the storyline to be about possibilities, not
limitations. After all, that's how she's lived her life since she
was 9 and began losing her vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very slow deterioration,'' she said. ``But I remember
when I came to school for my fourth-grade year, I could no longer
see the chalkboard. I had been playing soccer, but I had to quit
because I couldn't see the ball anymore. I was so young, though
that I didn't fully understand the consequences of what was
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   As her parents came to grips with their daughter's problem, they
adopted a philosophy that could not have been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marla was an inspiration right off,'' said Gary, her dad.
``Valerie and I didn't create barriers for her. We let her do what
she wanted. We let her find her own barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   And she found few. At her California high school, she was a
track star and graduated with a 3.98 grade-point average _ that
after her mom painstakingly had written out enlarged versions of
her reading material.
</P>
<P>
   She walked onto the track team at San Diego State, became one of
the leaders on the team and graduated cum laude. She now has a
master's degree in the education of deaf and blind children.
</P>
<P>
   During her college career, she drifted into the heptathlon, a
grueling two-day, seven- event marathon. She learned to high jump
by meticulously counting the steps to the bar. Sometimes she
trained with a piece of reflective tape on the bar so she could
guide herself on the reflections of the sun. Because she could see
none of the hurdles strung out in front of her, her coach taped
playing cards to the top of them so she'd pick up the white blur as
she approached.
</P>
<P>
   Come race time, the visual aids were removed and she was on her
own. And that's how she loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running is one of the things I can do independently,'' she
said. ``I have a sense of strength on the track that I don't have
in other areas of my life. I've got a true freedom out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Runyan has won five gold medals at the
Paralympics, the Olympic Games for handicapped athletes. In the
Paralympics at Atlanta, she ran the fastest 800 in American women's
heptathlon history _ which includes the regular Olympics. As she
sat in a medical tent with another sight-impaired friend at the
Paralympics she told her, ``You know one day I'm going to run in
the Olympics. ``
</P>
<P>
   Runyan laughed at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she believed me,''she said.
</P>
<P>
   Switching to the 1500 meters, she made great strides and
finished 10th at the World Championships in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   That race was an eye opener _ so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the stadium and it all hit me,'' she said. ``The
flashes of color from the uniforms. The lights around the stadium
and most of all, the roar of a big crowd. I know it sounds odd for
a person with 20/400 vision to say everything got crystal clear,
but everything was so magnified it seemed clear. I remember
thinking, 'I've been healed. I can see.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't, but I could. It helped me set my goals for
Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a numbing setback. She suffered a knee injury six
weeks before the U.S. Track and Field Trials in Sacramento and was
sidelined until seven days before the event. She considered
dropping out, but finally realized, ``this was just one more
obstacle.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1500 finals _ with the top three finishers going to
Sydney _ she ran gimpily down the stretch for a dramatic
come-from-behind surge into third place at the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just stood there with our arms around each other, hugging
and crying,'' Valerie said. ``That run pretty much captured Marla's
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Huebner, the executive director of the United States
Association for Blind Athletes, said spirit is something others can
share: ``Marla Runyan's inspiration is invaluable. Many blind kids
aren't told how they can dream. But Marla is a tremendous role
model. She proves a person with sight problems can do well in
college, become a world class athlete and make it to the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Sydney, she's still not quite back to her old self on
the track. Her boyfriend and trainer Matt Lonerga estimated that in
her training regimens, she's been able to do about 50 percent of
what she's capable of. Runyan shook her head at the calculation.
``Like before, this is just another obstacle in my way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after the response I got following the Trials, I've come
to realize there's something else at play here. There's a side
effect to what I'm doing. My race might only last four minutes or
so, but for others, hopefully, what I do out there might last a
lifetime. I never realized the impact I could have until I started
getting letters, calls and E-mails from all around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me I was an inspiration and I like that. A boy
from Turkey wrote me a letter. I've gotten E-mails from Israel and
phone calls from Brazil, Argentina and South Africa. And then there
was that letter from a lady in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me her son has Stargardt's disease. He wanted to be a
skateboarder and wanted to build a ramp so he could practice. She
told him 'No, not with your condition.' Then she said she read my
story and that's when she went to her son and told him. Go ahead,
get your ramp.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Runyan may have trouble with her own vision, but as the
Tennessee lady learned, she sure helps the rest of us see so much
better.

 &HT;    Buford-Bailey a deserving representative of her hometown
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Tonja Buford-Bailey, quite literally, has a captive
audience.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the Olympic hurdler's biggest fan club are the
prisoners at the Warren Correctional Institution in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom tells me a lot of the guys there are following me,''
she said as she prepared for tonight's 400-meter hurdles prelim at
Sydney's Olympic Stadium. ``She told me they always ask how I'm
doing and they follow me in the newspaper. I appreciate their
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgianna Buford is a corrections officer at the state prison
and her daughter's biggest champion. Ironically, one of her charges
at the prison is Dayton's Chris Nelloms, the former NCAA sprint
champ from Ohio State, who was an Olympic hopeful himself. In 1996,
the City of Dayton gave him $5,000 to fund his barebones training
and, hopefully, carry the city's banner onto the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Nelloms didn't make it out of the Olympic Trials and then
earlier this year, he was convicted of repeatedly raping a young
girl and given several life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Dayton's money would have been better spent on
someone like Buford- Bailey, who's in her third straight Olympics
and already has a bronze medal from the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Other Dayton Olympians have certainly felt the communal embrace.
Edwin Moses has a boulevard named after him. Long jumper Joe Greene
got a Riverside street. Even Wright State swimmer Leonard Ngoma _
representing Zambia at these Olympics _ has had part of his college
education funded thanks to support elicited from local charities by
City Manager Valerie Lemme.
</P>
<P>
   As for Buford-Bailey _ as with Lavonna Martin-Floreal, a Dayton
Olympian in 1988 and 1992 _ there have been no permanent honors at
home. But both women are deserving.
</P>
<P>
   Buford-Bailey is a great representative of Dayton. Even though
she now lives in Dallas with husband, Victor Bailey, a former NFL
receiver, she continues to make sure she's listed and announced as
being from Dayton when she runs in competitions.
</P>
<P>
   And if you followed the 29-year-old hurdler around Sydney, you'd
see the way people are drawn to her. That was Muhammad Ali posing
with her for a picture. And at the Opening Ceremony, that was her
marching and hobnobbing with tennis champ Lindsay Davenport and
soccer stars Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   Buford-Bailey is one of the comeback stories of these Games.
After the '96 Olympics, Buford-Bailey took off two years because of
injuries and the birth of her son VJ. When she finally did return,
she ran so poorly she considered retiring. But then came the
rousing performance at the Trials _ she surged from sixth place
with two hurdles left _ that got her to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``This experience is so much different than the others,'' she
said. ``I'm not a wide-eyed kid like I was in Barcelona and it's
not the all-business atmosphere I had as a favorite in Atlanta. I
know this is probably my last Olympics and I'm trying to soak
everything in.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it seems like each Olympics, someone else joins me. First,
it was just my mom. Then, Victor joined us at Atlanta and now,
we've got (2-year-old) VJ, though he's just along for the ride.
He's having fun and not paying real close attention to what Mom's
doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's OK.
</P>
<P>
   She already has a captive audience.

 &HT;    More sleaze, please
 &HT;    By Ron Rollins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when we thought we'd seen and heard everything,
along comes Spin magazine, whose October cover carries the headline
(in barfy neon green, no less), ``The 100 Sleaziest Moments in
Rock.'' The mind boggles, wondering what the editors might pick
from the unspeakably vast pantheon of potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these you know, of course. Michael Jackson's
well-publicized and unusual, um, preference for spending lots of
time alone with young boys clocks in at No. 6.
Thug-turned-rap-producer ``Suge'' Knight's business practices,
including his occasional use of a lead pipe to arrange artist
contracts, sneaks in at No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   You want groupies? Van Halen singer David Lee Roth's backstage
shenanigans with same were extremely well-organized in order to
minimize the time he had to spend between leaving stage and hopping
in bed. He rates No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   You want cradle-robbing? Jerry Lee Lewis steals No. 38 with his
13-year-old bride, while Rolling Stone Bill Wyman takes No. 12 for
marrying a 19-year-old fan at the age of 52 (he started sleeping
with her when she was 15, though).
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but it's only rock 'n' roll. Which is probably what Nico was
telling herself while shooting up, or what Keith Moon was telling
himself while running over his chauffeur, or what Tommy and Pamela
Lee were thinking while they made that silly little sex tape.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just the musicians who roll around in it, though. There
are friends nobody needs, such as the guy who helped Kurt Cobain
buy a shotgun when he knew what he might do with it (No. 34). There
are even politicians _ in this case, Richard Nixon, who in addition
to his other lapses of judgment certified Elvis (yes, that Elvis)
as an honorary DEA agent in a bid to look cool with the younger set
(No. 15).
</P>
<P>
   The entire event of Woodstock III, including the eight rapes,
10,000 injuries and countless fires, rates No. 4. Everything
Courtney Love ever did in her life crowds her into the lucky No. 13
position. Some bands we thought were kinda goody-goody, such as the
Go-Gos, turn out not to have been very nice after all. (They liked
to stop in public restrooms and play a game called ``Corner
Cleaners.'' Don't ask.) And some presumed evildoers _ such as, say,
Billy Idol, get off fairly light (Billy got busted for powder that
turned out to be nothing more than powder, alas).
</P>
<P>
   After all this, you wonder, what are the top three sleaziest
moments? Col. Tom Parker's abusive, Frankensteinish handling of
Elvis is No. 3; Sid Vicious' freakish handling of
groupie/girlfriend/co-junkie Nancy Spungen (he killed her) makes a
smashing No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Led Zeppelin takes the top spot, with an incident so
historically indecent we can't even come close to describing it
here (though a couple of people who saw the magazine said, ``Yeah,
I thought that would be No. 1'').
</P>
<P>
   It's great copy, but we all know rock provides too easy a target
_ and besides, the repellent and the grotesque have always been
part of the circus, and we all know it. We hate to admit it, but we
were more shocked by the fact that we weren't all that shocked by
any of this stuff. Not anymore, anyway. A friend suggested that the
top 100 sleaziest moments from the Supreme Court might be
interesting reading. Come to think of it, did anyone see a Coke can
around here?

 &HT;    Toronto Film Festival a moosley humorous affair
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Toronto International Film Festival celebrated its
silver anniversary in a city populated by life-size fiberglass
moose.
</P>
<P>
   The brightly painted figures, inspired by Chicago's Parade of
Cows, proved to be an appropriate symbol for this year's festival,
which ran Sept. 7-16 and presented 328 films _ including a record
178 world and North American premieres _ from 56 countries. In
contrast to the dark, premillennial angst that marked many of
1999's selections, the 25th Toronto International Film Festival was
more heavily weighted toward comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The festival opened with Denys Arcand's celebrity spoof,
``Stardom,'' and closed with Kenneth Branagh as a creatively
blocked playwright in ``How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Other comedies that unspooled over the 10 days included Rob
Sitch's ``The Dish,'' which puts a humorous spin on events in
Australia related to the Apollo XI moon landing; David Mamet's
witty Hollywood film-industry satire, ``State and Main;'' Robert
Altman's Richard Gere-topped ensemble piece, ``Dr. T and the
Women;'' and Christopher Guest's ``mockumentary'' on eccentric dog
owners, ``Best in Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Considered the second most important film festival in the world
after France's Cannes, Toronto has become a springboard for
potential Academy Award contenders, by virtue of its position at
the start of the fall season. Last year's festival launched Oscar
winners ``American Beauty'' and ``Boys Don't Cry,'' as well as top
contender ``The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Crowe's engaging cinematic memoir, ``Almost Famous,''
emerged as an early Oscar favorite. The funny and touching film,
set amid the circus-like atmosphere of the 1973 tour of an
up-and-coming rock band, opened nationwide on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also earning Oscar buzz _ whether for the film, its screenplay
or performances _ were Rod Lurie's ``The Contender,'' Stephen
Daldry's ``Billy Elliot,'' Jonathan Glazer's ``Sexy Beast,''
Kenneth Lonergan's ``You Can Count on Me'' and E. Elias Merhige's
``Shadow of the Vampire.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the one to beat may be Ang Lee's ``Crouching Tiger,''
``Hidden Dragon.'' The astonishing martial-arts epic starring Chow
Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi won the People's Choice
Award, voted on by festival audiences, as ``American Beauty ``did
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's stunning masterpiece, an early 19th century Chinese love
story whose fight sequences were choreographed by ``The Matrix'''s
Yuen Wo-Ping, also earned enthusiastic bursts of applause from
usually reticent film critics at the press and industry screenings.
</P>
<P>
   The response no doubt comes as a relief to Sony Pictures
Classics, the film's North American distributor, which reportedly
was concerned about how well ``Crouching Tiger'' would play here
with English-language subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dish,'' which stars Sam Neill and Patrick Warburton,
placed second in the People's Choice balloting. Another Australian
film, Paul Cox's Innocence, tied with the British comedy ``Billy
Elliot `` for third place.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unexpected standout was Joel Schumacher's
``Tigerland.'' Following his high-profile flops with Batman &AMP; Robin
and 8MM, Schumacher steps back from summer blockbusters with a
gripping story about Army recruits training for Vietnam, shot
documentary-style on a small budget with a hand-held 16mm camera.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Ebert, writing in Canada's ``National Post,'' called
``Tigerland ``the festival's best film.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable features included Darren Aronofsky's ``Requiem for
a Dream,'' Wong Kar-Wai's ``In the Mood for Love'' and Julian
Schnabel's ``Before Night Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are slated to open before the end of the year for Academy
Award consideration. Some, such as ``The Dish,'' went to festival
in hopes of finding a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto attracts a galaxy of movie stars compared with other
film festivals because of both the large number of Hollywood films
shown and the city's relative proximity to New York City and Los
Angeles. Among those walking the red carpets this year were Gere,
Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Alec
Baldwin, Daryl Hannah, Laura Dern, Cuba Gooding Jr., Ed Harris,
Willem Dafoe, Sarah Jessica Parker and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the countless actors, directors, producers,
distributors, sales agents, exhibitors, journalists, agents and
publicists are thousands of film buffs _ many of whom plan their
vacations around the annual event. Toronto is a fan-friendly public
film festival, with two of each film's three screenings designated
for non-industry audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The public box office for the 25th Toronto International Film
Festival totaled $1.7 million (Canadian).
</P>
<P>
   Special silver-anniversary events included the commissioning of
10 short films, Preludes, from such Canadian filmmakers as David
Cronenberg, Atom Egoyan, Don McKellar and Patricia Rozema to
precede the nightly galas. Guy Madden's Fritz Lang-inspired
Prelude, ``The Heart of the World,'' was considered by many to be
among the festival's best films, despite being a 5-minute short.
</P>
<P>
   Another anniversary-related high point was the stirring
presentation of Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 masterwork, ``Alexander
Nevsky,'' with live orchestral accompaniment of Sergei Prokofiev's
``Alexander Nevsky Cantata'' by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and
the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir. After 10 days of frantically racing
between screening rooms and interview suites, the powerful
performance was good for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, was occasionally slipping away from the serious fare to
take in a few of the offbeat features from the ``Midnight Madness''
program. My favorite was ``Wild Zero,'' a hilarious schlock-fest
from Japan that plays like a cross between ``Rock 'n' Roll High
School'' and ``Night of the Living Dead,'' with the punk trio
Guitar Wolf battling flesh-eating zombies.
</P>
<P>
   Several themes emerged over the course of the festival. A number
of films peered behind the curtain to explore the underbelly of
fame, venturing into the worlds of fashion (''Stardom''), music
(''Almost Famous''), film (''State and Main,'' ``Shadow of the
Vampire''), politics (''The Contender''), dog breeding (''Best in
Show'') and chess (''The Luzhin Defense'').
</P>
<P>
   Female empowerment was also a recurring theme in such films as
``Girlfight,'' the Sundance prize-winner that follows a female
boxer from the Bronx; ``The Contender,'' with Joan Allen as the
embattled first female appointee for vice president of the United
States; and ``Crouching Tiger,'' ``Hidden Dragon,'' where three of
the four chief warriors are female.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sheer number of films shown, the law of averages
dictates that more than a few are bound to be stinkers. That
certainly was the case with ``Duets,'' Bruce Paltrow's dreadful
karaoke road comedy starring his daughter Gwyneth, Huey Lewis and
Andre Braugher, as well as with ``Beautiful,'' Sally Field's
directorial debut about a small-town pageant queen, played by
Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men of Honor'' _ the film biography of Carl Brashear, the
Navy's first black deep-sea diver, starring De Niro and Gooding Jr.
_ received mixed critical response, as did ``Stardom,'' ``Dr. T &AMP;
the Women'' and ``The Yards,'' a gritty crime drama with Mark
Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix and Charlize Theron.
</P>
<P>
   If the movies weren't to your liking, there was always the
colorful herd of moose.

KOSOVO COULD BE THE KEY TO A VICTORY FOR MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also YUGO-ELECTION) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ With its Serb population largely
departed, and an Albanian population refusing to take part in
Sunday's Yugoslav elections, Kosovo would seem unimportant in the
battle for votes. Yet, in one of the Balkans' many ironies, the one
part of Yugoslavia that the West controls may supply the swing that
brings victory for the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials here fear that Milosevic will claim hundreds
of thousands of votes cast in his favor by voters from Kosovo, as
he has done in previous elections. The U.N. administration, while
it is refusing to take part in organizing the elections, is
urgently putting together a plan to watch the voting so it can
dismiss any obvious fraudulent claims on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to deny the Serbs of Kosovo the right to vote in these
elections, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator of
Kosovo, has had to allow a highly suspect election process to
unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the Serbs in Kosovo, and all Kosovars, have the right to
take part in these elections, but it is a provocation and can be
manipulated,'' he said in an interview here. ``The elections have
no democratic standards according to European norms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without any attempt to inform Kouchner, pro-Belgrade officials
announced that they would organize the vote in Kosovo, throwing
international officials into a flap.
</P>
<P>
   It took Kouchner eight days to decide what to do. Albanian
leaders protested, refusing to tolerate an election in Kosovo run
by the Serbian authorities that they so detest. Serbian opposition
leaders also asked Kouchner to refuse to allow the election in
Kosovo, saying that it would provide Milosevic with enormous scope
for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is now hastily trying to scotch any
possibility of faking votes. Extra troops have been brought in to
supplement the peacekeeping force in case of violence after British
troops uncovered a Yugoslav army operation to disrupt elections.
And 150 election teams, as well as international administrators,
will be out to watch how many people turn out to vote, so at least
they can discount any inflated results.
</P>
<P>
   No Western organization will monitor the Yugoslav elections, and
observers in Kosovo will formally have nothing to do with them.
``As far as Kosovo is concerned, it is so obvious that the
elections are substandard that we cannot lend our legitimacy to
them,'' said Daan Everts, head of the Kosovo mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, OSCE election monitors, already in place
for Kosovo's own local elections in October, will be out on Sunday
to gauge the turnout. ``We will have a solid understanding of the
level of voting,'' said a senior State Department official visiting
the region.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is possibly half a million votes _ most of the margin
that some estimate Milosevic will need to secure victory in the
first round against opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica, who
leads in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no registration of Serbs living in Kosovo since
NATO peacekeepers moved in last year, but U.N. officials say there
are roughly 100,000 Serbs still here, 60,000 of them eligible to
vote. Most of them live in the northern part of the province and
the rest in scattered often isolated enclaves around the territory.
Milosevic still probably commands more support in Kosovo than
elsewhere, but any result claiming more than 50,000 votes for him
will be suspect, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees has meanwhile registered
180,000 displaced Kosovo Serbs now living in Serbia, although
Belgrade often uses the figure of 350,000, revealing another area
for potential vote rigging.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the Albanian vote that is really significant and could
be used to inflate results in Milosevic's favor. There are almost 1
million eligible Albanian voters registered in Kosovo in recent
months in preparation for Kosovo's elections. Virtually none of
them are expected to vote on Sunday because the Albanians have
boycotted Yugoslav ballots for 10 years, believing that to
participate is to recognize Belgrade's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Everts of OSCE said: ``Ordinary people do not want to join
anything that has to do with Serbia.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: THE NEW FACE IN THE YANKEES' DUGOUT  (Sports of The
Times) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whenever a television camera peeks into the Yankees'
dugout now, there's a different pitching coach next to Joe Torre.
While Mel Stottlemyre is on medical leave to receive stem-cell
treatments for bone-marrow cancer, Billy Connors is sitting in the
dugout next to the manager, staring out at whichever Yankee is on
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a smooth transition,'' Torre said. ``Everybody is
more concerned with Mel's welfare than with the changing of the
guard.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the pitchers know and respect Connors, who
earlier this season supervised the installation of new
psychological and strategic transmissions in Roger Clemens, Dwight
Gooden, Orlando Hernandez and David Cone when each had to be towed
into the Yankee garage in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very honest,'' Gooden said. ``He tells you what you don't
want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors is also the only one of the Yankees' 15 vice presidents
who wears a pinstriped uniform; he's listed on the Yankee masthead
as the vice president of player personnel in the baseball
operations department in Tampa, where he has spent the last five
years as a guru until he was summoned to be the Yankees' pitching
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, this is Mel's staff,'' Connors said.
``I'm just here to keep things going until he comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors is also helping to keep Stottlemyre going. He recently
donated blood to be used in Stottlemyre's treatments, as did the
bullpen coach Tony Cloninger, the trainer Steve Donohue and Brian
Cashman, the Yankees' general manager. But Stottlemyre, who watches
the Yankees on television, has kept in touch with Torre by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day,'' Connors said, ``Mel told Joe, `Denny Neagle
was trying to make the ball sink instead of just letting it go.'
Hey, that only helps Neagle and it only helps me.''
</P>
<P>
   But until Stottlemyre is healthy, Connors will be the new
58-year-old cherubic face in the dugout during the Yankees' quest
for a third straight World Series championship as well as a fourth
title in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is, Billy knows all our pitchers,'' Torre said.
``And we made sure Billy was here before Mel left, so it wasn't an
abrupt change.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors is special: the major leagues' only guru available
during the season to advise pitchers on what amounts to a
psychologist's couch away from the tension of the regular schedule.
During his Tampa seances, he already had a great year. He
resurrected Gooden, restored Clemens' aggressiveness, soothed
Hernandez's mind-set and prolonged Cone's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy talked me off the ledge,'' Cone recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After having been battered repeatedly by big-league hitters,
Cone wasn't any better pitching batting practice to minor-leaguers
in Tampa when a line drive whistled past his eyes. He stalked off
the mound, took a quick shower and drove to his nearby home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the low point of my year,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Connors knew the feeling. He had a career 0-2 record with the
Chicago Cubs and the Mets before developing into a pitching coach
with the Kansas City Royals, the Cubs, the Seattle Mariners and the
Yankees. He knew Cone was frustrated enough to quit right then and
there. Still in his uniform that day in Tampa, he hurried to Cone's
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``David had tears in his eyes,'' Connors remembered. ``He
thought he was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors persuaded Cone to have dinner that night with him and
George Steinbrenner, who reminded Cone of others who wanted to quit
but didn't and then succeeded, notably Len Dawson. Cut by the
Cleveland Browns, Dawson went on to be a Hall of Fame quarterback
with the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day,'' Connors recalled, ``David was ready to try
some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors had Cone close his eyes and pitch. The idea was for Cone
to try to visualize how he pitched when he was one of baseball's
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found out his hands should be farther away from his body,''
Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone soon returned to the Yankees and was pitching better until
he dislocated his left shoulder diving for a ball. Although he
returned quickly from that injury, it reduced the velocity of his
fastball. He remains a question mark for the postseason roster but
has postponed any thought of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy has a good way about him,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden agreed. After having been waived by both the Astros and
the Devil Rays earlier this year, he appeared to be through until
Connors convinced him that he was no longer a power pitcher, that
he had to develop better control, get ahead of the batters, pitch
in and out, spot his fastball, trust his breaking ball when behind
in the count, and develop a screwball changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was over that ego hump,'' Connors said. ``He knew the
Yankees were his last shot. He listened.''
</P>
<P>
   And now all the Yankees' pitchers are listening to their
pitching coach pro tem, with the accent on pro.

KILLINGS ESTIMATED AT 4,000, LESS THAN HALF OF ORIGINAL FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE _ War crimes investigators have found evidence that at
least 4,000 civilians were murdered in Kosovo by Serb forces last
year, less than half the original estimate, and they will end
digging next month despite their belief that there may be thousands
more bodies.
</P>
<P>
   While the final body count will be less than half the estimated
10,000 that war crimes investigators here expected to find, they
said they believe there are as many as several thousand bodies they
will never be able to account for.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Graham T. Blewitt, the deputy chief
prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, rejected suggestions by some critics that the Western
allies, principally the United States, had exaggerated the extent
of atrocities by Serb forces to justify NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know how many people were killed in Kosovo,''
said Blewitt, who is in charge of overseeing the massive forensic
examination of mass and individual graves in the Serbian province
of 2 million people. ``We have reliable information that bodies
were transported out of Kosovo into Serbia for incineration. How
many, we'll never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt said investigators will finish ``the forensic side'' of
their probe by the end of October. He said there are no plans to
resume digging next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt said investigators believe the Serbs learned lessons
from the war in Bosnia, where bodies yielded forensic evidence that
allowed prosecutors here to build cases against dozens of Bosnian
Serb military figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that they dug up bodies, incinerated bodies,
transported bodies so we couldn't find them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, many commentators have accused NATO officials
of having grossly exaggerated the numbers of ethnic Albanians
killed by Serb forces, and suggested the mass killings only took
place in response to the NATO bombing campaign in Serbia. Critics
have pointed to US Defense Secretary William S. Cohen's assertion,
in the middle of the war, that some 100,000 ethnic Albanian men and
boys from Kosovo were missing and may have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt said the argument that the Serbs only began killing
ethnic Albanians in large numbers after NATO began bombing is
specious and irrelevant to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a war crime to go out and purposely murder civilians,
period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt said the 100,000 figure of missing Kosovars was accurate
when given, but that the vast majority of that number had fled
Kosovo when Serb forces began a systematic campaign of ethnic
cleansing after the NATO bombing began. He said tens of thousands
of Kosovars had crossed over into Macedonia to stay with relatives
or friends, but that there was no reliable system to account for
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will issue a report in November with exact numbers, but I
anticipate that we will have identified between 4,000 and 5,000
bodies,'' said Blewitt. ``The discrepancy between the final figure
and the 10,000 figure that was initially used can be accounted for
by bodies being destroyed or transported into Serbia, and by the
fact that some people feared dead had managed to flee Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the discrepancy will be seized by critics of NATO who
claim the Western allies lied to justify their attack on Serbia's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Zurovac, a spokesman for the Yugoslav government, said he
did not believe even the deflated figures, which will be officially
announced next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lie,'' he said, calling the suggestion that Serb forces
dug up and moved bodies in Serbia ``a fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zurovac and other Serbs believe that the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the ethnic Albanian separatists who provoked trouble with Serb
forces, murdered many Kosovars and attributed the killings to Serbs
in a cynical campaign aimed at drawing NATO into the war.
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt said war crimes investigators are probing at least five
separate cases of suspected war crimes involving the KLA, both in
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt also said he and the chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte,
who is scheduled to arrive in Washington Sunday night for meetings
with officials at the White House and on Capitol Hill, estimate
that prosecutors will finish issuing indictments stemming from the
Balkan wars by the end of 2004. He said trials will continue for
some time after that.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, he said, his office will have returned indictments
against most groups of combatants in the wars that took place in
Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has been accused by Serbs and their sympathizers of
targeting only Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to judge us over the long term, and when we are done
with our work I'm confident that we will be seen to have targeted
not just Serbs, but war criminals from all the various groups in
the Balkans,'' said Blewitt.

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: MANAGERS COULD GET PINK SLIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Dierker managed Houston to division championships in each
of his first three seasons with the Astros. In this, his fourth
season, the Astros have played badly, and Dierker is said in
baseball circles to be in danger of losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Showalter managed the Arizona Diamondbacks to a division
championship in their second season, making them the most
successful baseball expansion team in history. The Diamondbacks,
however, have not only failed to repeat, but have also played too
poorly to make the playoffs as the wild-card team, and Showalter is
said to be in danger of losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates managed the Texas Rangers to division championships
three of the past four seasons. This season, however, the Rangers
are in last place, and rumors say Oates is in danger of losing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   As the regular season begins its final week, more than half a
dozen managers, Dierker and Showalter among them, are perilously
perched on the precipice of dismissal. Oates, however, is not
teetering there. Tom Hicks, the Rangers' owner, said recently that
Oates would continue as the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Alou, the venerable manager of the Montreal Expos, is
another whose status was rumored to be in question, but Jeffrey
Loria, the team's managing partner, said that was news to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never said that,'' Loria said. ``I've never said I want
to make a change. Felipe's the manager. He's under contract, an
enormous contract. I've never entertained any other ideas other
than saying we'll take a look at everything at the end of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Loria added, ``He's not in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Baker and Lou Piniella are not in trouble, either. In
fact, they are managers in the enviable position of being free
agents after the season. Their contracts expire, and they have not
signed extensions.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco wants Baker to remain, and he most likely will
stay. He has been wise, though, to see how far the Giants go in the
postseason before signing. The farther they go, the higher his
salary figures go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusty has made it clear he prefers to wait until the end of
the season to focus on his business issues,'' Jeff Moorad, Baker's
longtime adviser, said. ``We're acutely aware of his attraction
around the major leagues and I'm certain if he showed himself to be
available that we'd have a number of teams interested. I'm not sure
that's the intent. In fact, it's fair to say he's inclined to stay
in San Francisco as long as the terms of a deal were fair and
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The only negative aspect of continuing the relationship was
suggested by another club's executive. ``I've heard rumblings that
Dusty doesn't want to be with Barry Bonds,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella is not so certain to remain in Seattle, where he has
managed for eight years. He has not said what he prefers, but the
most popular speculation has him desiring to manage at home,
meaning Tampa Bay. The Devil Rays, however, are not the contending
team Piniella has become accustomed to managing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His focus is totally on winning the pennant and hopefully
getting to the World Series,'' said Alan Nero, Piniella's agent.
``We've all agreed not to think about it or talk about it now. Lou
has incredible loyalty to the Seattle ownership and fans. He would
like to hear what they have to say first and then decide what he's
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Pat Gillick sounded like a general manager who wanted
to retain his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're grading guys on the type of season they've had,''
Gillick said, ``Lou's had a great season, not only from the
standpoint of handling players but running the games. He's had an
all-star year. I've never seen him so much under control. He has
mellowed and matured.''
</P>
<P>
   In just about every instance where a manager's position is
precarious, the team owner or general manager has said the club
will evaluate or address everything at the end of the season. That
statement covers Dierker, Showalter, Gene Lamont of Pittsburgh,
Terry Francona of Philadelphia, Larry Rothschild of Tampa Bay and
Davey Johnson of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati general manager, offered a variation
on the theme when asked about Jack McKeon. ``Jack's our manager,
and I have no other comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball executives would consider it a major upset if McKeon,
Francona, Rothschild, Johnson or Lamont survived. In Lamont's case,
Kevin McClatchy, the owner, has reportedly already told him he will
not remain in the Pirates' job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll address Geno's situation at the end of the season, which
is not that far away,'' McClatchy said. ``Any discussions between
Gene and me are confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wade, general manager of the last-place Phillies, said the
club ``had high expectations coming off our offensive performance
last year,'' adding: ``Things have not developed the way we
expected. We're hugely disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Los Angeles is interesting because the apparent
desire of general manager Kevin Malone to change managers is
compounded by the possibility that Malone himself could be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation is being evaluated at this time,'' Malone said.
``There's been no decisions made. We're pleased with the way we've
performed the last week or two. We find ourselves in second,
playing the best baseball we have all year with a chance for the
wild card. Unfortunately, we waited until this late date. We
thought it would have happened sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Hunsicker of Houston sounded like a general manager who
wanted to keep his manager, but Dierker's future will be determined
by the owner, Drayton McLane Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes we can jump to conclusions before we know
what the real issues are,'' McLane said. ``We want to take
everything into consideration. We'll make a decision very quickly,
in the first week after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's position could be undermined by reports that some of
his players don't take him seriously and don't want to play for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not any different from any clubhouse,'' Hunsicker said
when asked about the reports. ``I think it's the nature of the
beast. These things surface when you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Said a general manager of another team, ``I've never had a
manager the players liked.'' Another general manager said he had
heard that two years ago the St. Louis players were ready to revolt
against their manager, Tony La Russa. ``Now they love him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Players do not apparently like Showalter in Arizona, even
though, like Dierker, he managed them to a first-place finish.
Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing partner, has said he
will wait until the end of the season before making a decision, but
the team's collapse the last five weeks can't help Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   Even the elder statesman among managers is not certain of his
status. Tom Kelly has managed the Minnesota Twins for 14 seasons,
winning the World Series in 1987 and '91, but does not know if he
will make it to 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't informed me if they want me to come back,'' said
Kelly, who is in the last year of his contract and wants to stay
with the Twins. ``Three years ago, they asked me to stay and take
on this undertaking. Now we're starting to see some light at the
end of the tunnel and I feel like I'd like to do this some more.
But we haven't heard anything. I'm hoping to hear something in the
next few days, because I have some coaches I need to take care of.
Whether we're staying or leaving, I'd like to get it resolved in
the next few days or a week. If they don't want us back, fine;
we'll get along. If they do, good; let's get going.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No In-Season Changes Yet
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unexpected development, the season will end without
any teams changing managers. It would be the first time since 1942
such a development occurred, and there were only 16 teams then.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a lack of candidates,'' Pat Gillick, the Seattle
general manager, said. ``Or nobody wants the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bowden of Cincinnati attributed the novelty to baseball
economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it has to do with the economic disparity we
have right now,'' he said. ``The expectations for each manager are
different from what they have been. Small-market teams can't have
the same expectations for those managers as you once did. Before,
most of the teams had a chance to win, and expectations were
greater for each manager. People are more realistic now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Hunsicker of Houston said clubs might be viewing the job
more rationally than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're realizing that firing managers doesn't change a
whole lot of the results,'' he said. ``It's amazing how managers
become extremely smart when they have talent and extremely stupid
when they don't have talent. It transcends everyone, from Jim
Leyland to Tony La Russa to Joe Torre. They've all taken turns
managing last-place teams and coming under fire and they're still
among the most respected people in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, suggested that some
clubs might not have acted because they could not come up with
suitable replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys don't want to take jobs on an interim basis,''
Melvin said. ``They want the job from Day 1 of spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that if one team had fired its manager
sometime this season, others would have followed. Often in the past
clubs wanted to make a change but did not want to be the first to
do it. When another team fired its manager, those other teams then
did likewise.

 &HT;    Many factors account for decrease in next year's bear population
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Bears died in record numbers this summer
and next year's generation of cubs is likely to be thin, said the
state's top bear researcher.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, though, the bear population likely will rebound from
the hard times of 2000, said Tom Beck, wildlife biologist for the
Colorado Division of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``If conditions are right, within a year or two, you'll be
caught up,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp spring freeze and the dry summer of 2000 forced bears to
expand their ranges for food. But what is a natural process for
bears amounted to an intrusion, as far as humans were concerned,
into the habitat in which homo sapiens is the top of the food
chain.
</P>
<P>
   When that happened, encounters between humans and bears vaulted
up as quick as a cub climbing a spruce tree.
</P>
<P>
   Bears invariably came out the losers in those encounters. They
ended up as road kill, they were blasted by landowners and wildlife
officers, they were shot with darts to tranquilize them and rushed
in metal tubes to new territory.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, a record 132 bears have been killed by law
enforcement and private citizens this year. That does not include
bears shot by hunters.
</P>
<P>
   The number and notoriety of human-bear encounters, however,
tends to obscure the fact that the bears are involved in a natural
process that poses little threat to the overall bear population,
Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   Bear distress is not unusual. In most years, eight out of 10, he
said, bears somewhere in the state suffer to some degree. People
tend to know nothing about that, though, because bears by nature
are secretive and prefer to avoid people.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, bears ``happen to be having a bad year where a lot of
people can see them, so it's a lot more apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many bears will die this winter but that doesn't mean
that man should intrude deeply in the process, even though the
harsh summer will strike most heavily on the young, Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs born last January and this year's yearlings are the most
vulnerable, he said, because they have been unable to put on enough
fat for the winter, to say nothing of getting enough food for
normal skeletal and muscular development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a significant die-off in the den,'' he said.
``They simply won't emerge from hibernation.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else will happen to reduce the number of bears that
emerge from hibernation next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilized embryos in pregnant sows won't implant in the uterus,
so no cubs will be born to those bears, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many of the young females that might otherwise be
expected to breed this spring and give birth in 2001 will be
reproductively stunted, delaying their estrous cycle by a year.
</P>
<P>
   The result of those factors could play out in the breeding
season of 2001, producing ``a big synchrony of cubs the next
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor contributing to the likely health of the overall
bear population is that all bears haven't suffered equally in the
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officers have found bears with as little as a half-inch
of fat this year, putting them at a severe disadvantage against the
winter chill, said Steve Yamashita, area wildlife manager in the
Grand Junction office of the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Still other bears have been found packing fat layers as thick as
two inches, an ample store for the winter, Yamashita said.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of thin bears seeking food is understandably
distressing, Beck said, but not necessarily a signal that the
entire population is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing for 1,000 square miles of bear habitat on the
Uncompahgre Plateau and figuring one square mile per bear, ``You
could have as many as 1,000 bears up there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have 20 or 30 or even 50 bears come down into town,
that still means you've got a lot of bears on the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck said he discourages the idea of humans providing food in
natural bear habitat for a couple of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, if people mean to give food to starving bears,
putting fruit and other feed on the mountain won't help the bruins
that already are roaming elsewhere for food. It could, however,
cause conflicts among the well-fed bears that discover the food, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, older bears with established territories aren't
necessarily in danger during a lean year such as this, he said,
because their fat stores carry over from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that you can assign a bear about one square mile of
habitat isn't the same as knowing how many bears there are in a
given region, Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   Big boars, he said, can range across some 250 miles and share
territory with many bears. They tend not to gather in herds, but
they also aren't necessarily hostile to their own kind.
</P>
<P>
   Bears, Beck said, ``are solitary but social animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears will share food sources, such as berry patches and
acorn-laden oak brush, but they won't feed in the same places at
the same time as other bears, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They share food sources ``by time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While humans finding a food source might hoard it, bears will
eat their fill, leaving plenty for others, and move on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``The best time to go exploring is on a full belly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well-traveled bears, though, are hard-to-count bears.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that the black bears that populate Colorado
change color as the summer passes.
</P>
<P>
   The dark-colored bear he spots one day might be the blonde bruin
he sees a month or so later, Beck said. Their fur tends to lighten
as the summer goes along, almost as though they were getting their
hair bleached. New fur on bears tends to come in dark, lending some
a mottled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The bears that have visited the Grand Valley have no intention
of remaining through the winter among human populations, Yamashita
said. They've already selected dens for their winter hibernation
and are on the move solely in a search for food.
</P>
<P>
   That search, though, has had dire consequences for several bears
and saddened wildlife officers used to dealing with bears and the
hard rules of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Sidener, district wildlife manager in the Division of
Wildlife, wrote in a report on a June incident where a landowner
had shot a bear.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows landowners to kill depredating bears and a bear
in a chicken coop certainly qualified. No one could know until
later, though, that the bear had no immediate interest in poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Scat discovered in the coop turned out to be ``100 percent
chicken feed,'' Sidener noted wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Sidener participated in the capture and relocation of a
250-pound bear on Road R, ``15 miles from suitable bear habitat,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   For a bear, it was, Sidener wrote, ``Not a good place to be and
no place to go.''

   SILT, Colo. _ The small rusty sign, propped against a wood fence
in the yard, tells you it's the Pauline S. Schneegas Western
Colorado Wildlife Rehabilitation and Education Center.
</P>
<P>
   But to the eight black bear cubs in pens on the other side of
the fence _ bellies full of apples, peaches and veggies _ it's the
Silt Supper Club.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially the bears' only chance of survival through the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them would have made it,'' said Nanci Limbach, the
woman who's been taking care of injured and starving wild animals
at her home for almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Limbach's property is also home to a bobcat, two golden eagles,
a dozen hawks, 11 fawns and an array of geese and ducks that soon
will be returned to their natural habitat. There are also two adult
mountain lions that can never be returned to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, the focus has been on the bears.
</P>
<P>
   More black bear cubs than ever before are fattening up at the
rehab center thanks to virtually nonexistent food sources for them
and their parents in the high country.
</P>
<P>
   One pen for the typical bear or two Limbach might get during a
normal summer quickly became insufficient. She built another pen
earlier in the summer and remodeled a temporary pen. And on
Thursday, a new pen was built to accommodate a bear population that
could grow even bigger before fall is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   All are orphan cubs who have either lost their mother to the
hands of hunters or have been abandoned by mothers trying to find
food to save their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some have wandered down into towns themselves looking for food.
</P>
<P>
   Adult bears live under the ``two strikes'' law that says that
after a bear is found in civilization and tagged, it must be killed
the next time it creates a problem for humans.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs, however, get three strikes, Limbach said, because they
aren't tagged the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys already have it in their heads to come down low
because that's what mom taught them,'' Limbach said. ``I've just
replaced their mother.''
</P>
<P>
   And like a mother, Limbach will push them out on their own very
soon.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived, the cubs were well below what they should
weigh at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cubs, who was rescued earlier this summer near Mack,
weighed only 37 pounds _ about 60 pounds underweight.
</P>
<P>
   But that's quickly changing. In Limbach's controlled habitat,
the animals get as much food as they can eat so they can build up
the fat needed to survive the winter hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   The bears eat a total of about 500 pounds of food per day and
are each gaining about 2 pounds of fat a day. When they're not
eating, they're sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks of seemingly perpetual eating, the cubs have
become little balls of fur and fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't play this time of year,'' Limbach said.
``Everything they eat is to build fat and they don't want to waste
any energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bears will continue to fatten up until late November, when
Limbach will induce hibernation at the shelter. In late February or
early March, Limbach and Colorado Division of Wildlife officials
will head to the hills to build dens for the bears. The bears will
then be driven in by snowmobiles and placed in their new dens.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when they come out of hibernation in March,'' Limbach
said, ``I'm hopefully just a nightmare for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Limbach is a savior for the DOW, said John Broderick, a district
wildlife manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a real asset to the DOW and yet we don't support her
(financially) in any way,'' Broderick said. ``She's an excellent
example of a rehabilitator.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, when the rehab center had all the bears it
could hold, officials still didn't hesitate to call and ask Limbach
if she had room for just one more, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bears at the rehab center have very little interaction with
humans, other than when Limbach or her husband, Paul, do the
feeding. The public isn't allowed to come and visit the bears like
they're at a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick said this makes it easier to release the animals into
the wild. When they need to be moved within the rehab center, say,
from pen to pen, they're drugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very wild,'' Broderick said. ``Those bears, in a
sense, are ready now to be released into the wild. They are not
tame in any manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Limbach said she is careful not to become too attached to the
bears while they're under her care. She enjoys taking care of the
animals and believes she's doing her part to get them ready for a
long and prosperous life in the Colorado backcountry.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes it's hard not to have feelings for them.
</P>
<P>
   An older bear who Limbach took care of earlier this year was
promptly shot by a hunter once it returned to the wild, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Limbach said, she's able to take something positive from
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad; it's depressing,'' she said. ``But maybe it had at
least one happy month (here) without too much stress.''

 &HT;    Two strikes and their out
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Only one bear captured so far this year
in Mesa County has had to be destroyed under the state's two-strike
policy.
</P>
<P>
   That bear was captured on Glade Park after it scavenged through
a kitchen, according to encounter reports filed with the Colorado
Division of Wildlife. When an officer confirmed that the bear was
tagged, he destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, bears have one chance to cross the line into
human habitat. When they do, they're tranquilized, taken to remote
bear habitat and freed.
</P>
<P>
   If they return to human habitat, they have to be destroyed, the
law says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as black-and-white as that, however.
</P>
<P>
   John Ellenberger, state big-game manager for the Colorado
Division of Wildlife in Grand Junction, said bears simply venturing
into town isn't necessarily something that requires immediate
action.
</P>
<P>
   When possible, wildlife officers try to make contacts with
humans as unpleasant as possible, using noisemakers, loud shouts,
even shooting them with non-lethal projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bear is just wandering through and doesn't cause
problems, we don't respond with a trap or tranquilizer gun,''
Ellenberger said. If the bears don't move along by themselves,
though, or if they look to humans for food _ eating cat or dog
food, overturning barbecue grills, pawing through garbage cans _
then the division steps in.
</P>
<P>
   Captured bears are tagged and tattooed before being transported
a long distance away _ 75 airline miles is the rule of thumb,
Ellenberger said.
</P>
<P>
   A study done in southeast Colorado showed that only about 25
percent of bears that were trapped and tagged had to be destroyed
for a second strike, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The division also uncovered incidents in which relocated bears
returned to their home areas but never ran afoul of humans until
they were taken by hunters years later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Beck, the division's top wildlife biologist, said the
two-strike policy works not so much because it changes bear
activity, but because it changes human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   People who are aware that leaving food accessible in bear
country are more likely to reconsider their actions if they know
the end result might be a first or second strike for a bear, Beck
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the policy on bear-people conflicts is teaching
people how to live with bears,'' Ellenberger said.

   The device, made of carbon fiber and kevlar, has a high-back
collar and straps that fit under a driver's shoulder belts. It also
has straps that attach to the back of the driver's helmet. In a
sudden impact, the straps limit the forward movement of the
driver's head.

DOUBLE IDENTITY FOR BUCS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ If you locked Keyshawn Johnson and Warren Sapp in
a room together with only one microphone, who would get the first
word and who would have the last one? When both are in the same
locker room, both as Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Johnson holds court on
one side, Sapp on the other. They often meet in the center,
offering playful jabs, pushing buttons, creating a fun ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   Put both on the same field _ Johnson as a receiver and the
team's offensive identity, Sapp as a tackle and the team's
defensive identity _ and, thus far, winning has ensued. Tampa Bay
is 3-0 and has outscored its opponents, 93-26.
</P>
<P>
   When the Buccaneers play the 3-0 Jets here Sunday at Raymond
James Stadium, Johnson and Sapp will be easy to find. Johnson is
the new Buccaneer who has a score to settle with his old team. Sapp
is the nucleus of a defense that can be ferocious and frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp understands Johnson's emotions entering this battle against
the team that traded him to Tampa Bay in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyshawn loves the game,'' Sapp said last week. ``I have no
doubt that he loved playing for the Jets and considered that team
his home. It's still fresh for him. All I know is if the Bucs
traded me, I'd torture them. And if I ever got to play against
them, I'd make them regret it. We want to win this game to be 4-0.
We don't want anyone coming in here and beating us in our own
stadium. Those are the reasons we as a team want to win this game.
But we'd like for Keyshawn to have his day, and if that happens,
it's a bonus. A nice bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Sapp. Two Pro Bowl players. Two loquacious,
outrageous, outspoken Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Two of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Kid Kept His Word
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Allen, a former Pro Bowl running back, was recently
remembering practices at the University of Southern California,
where he played in the late '70s and early '80s, and how this
little kid with a big mouth kept running around saying how great he
was and how great he would be. Allen said that Keyshawn Johnson
then was the same as Keyshawn Johnson today: so full of confidence
and prepared to say so.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is 28, said that he is in part a product of his
environment. He said he grew up in South Central Los Angeles ``in
poverty and with anything you could associate with poverty,
including drugs, crime and murder.'' There was a hustle on every
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd hear guys talking, challenging you all of the time,''
Johnson said. ``A guy would say, `I'm going to get me a Benz!' and
you'd look up and the next day and he'd be driving a new Mercedes.
Back there you talked, you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Johnson does in football. He talks. He does it.
The ``does it'' part in particular is why Tampa Bay traded for
Johnson and gave him a six-year, $52 million contract that included
a $13 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets certainly did not trade Johnson because he was not a
productive and elite football player (he had 305 receptions and 31
touchdown catches in four seasons). They traded him for two
first-round draft picks with one eye on the future and the other on
the present in an attempt to create a calmer, more controlled
climate for their new coach, Al Groh.
</P>
<P>
   All this week Johnson answered questions about Groh and the
Jets, about Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet. Johnson says Chrebet is
not a problem; the problem, Johnson says, is other people's attempt
to compare him to Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's like comparing Allen Iverson to Michael Jordan,''
Johnson said. ``I'm really good friends with Allen Iverson, but I
just don't think you can or should do that. When people try doing
that with us, I just look at him as the Rudy guy from that Notre
Dame movie, and it's no comparison. Hey, what's the big deal? The
Jets had a player, traded him, and now they are playing against
that player. I really don't know exactly what to expect or what I'm
going to do in this game. I could have a quiet game or I could get
like 400 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I want to be 4-0 when it's over. I know I play well in
big games. And I know the Jets are going to try to take me out.
They say they aren't going to scheme for me, but that's just
posturing. They think they know me because I played there for four
years, but really they only know me in the scheme of how they used
me. There are things I can do that they didn't ask or let me do on
the football field. Tampa Bay is going to let me do those things,
like go vertical more. They will see.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is asked why he simply does not keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan did it his way, Magic did it his way and I do it my
way,'' he said. ``I get along with teammates. I've never been in a
bar fight or embarrassed an organization with public conduct that
was illegal. I say what I've got to say, regardless; but when you
do it like people don't want you to do it, it's a problem. Plus I
speak well, I look good, I'm successful and I'm black and some
people just have problem with that combination. And people might
say, `There he goes with the race card,' but I'm not. That's just
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   A Rebirth Under Dungy
</P>
<P>
   Sapp has been a Buccaneer since 1995. After his first season, in
which Tampa Bay went 7-9, he wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Sam Wyche days here, he ran a three-ring circus,
and I have often told people that his franchise back then was like
a Third World country,'' Sapp said. ``The facilities were horrible
and the team was terrible on the field and off. There was jealousy
and envy in the locker room over me; they used to call me Super
Rookie, the guy that was going to take the team to the Super Bowl
all by himself, and they didn't say it in a complimentary fashion.
Nobody in here cared after a loss. I was miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Dungy arrived as coach before Sapp's second season.
Sapp, who is 27, said he had heard so much about Dungy that he
considered him ``the messiah, the chosen one.'' Dungy told Sapp he
needed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there would be a new stadium and that he was going to
take the shackles off me and let me go after the ball,'' Sapp said.
``He said he was going to build his defense around me and asked me
if I could handle that. I said, `Let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Dungy's words proved true.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers kept getting better and better and finished last
season one victory shy of the Super Bowl after winning the National
Football Conference Central Division at 11-5. Through this season's
first three weeks, only Tampa Bay players have been named the NFC
defensive players of the week: cornerback Ronde Barber, linebacker
Derrick Brooks and then Sapp last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp believed his weight rose and his play dropped two seasons
ago, when he had only seven sacks. He rededicated himself to
reaching top form, and last season (12.5 sacks) and this season
(5.5 sacks) he has. He talks about himself and Johnson
``autographing their performances'' against the Jets and beyond, a
favorite phrase of Tampa Bay's assistant head coach, Herman
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this game some 75 years after it started,'' Sapp
said. ``I've got a long list to climb. I want in the year 2020 for
someone to say, `Hey, that kid reminds me of Warren Sapp and how
dominating he was.' I want to leave the game in better shape than I
found it.''

   WILMINGTON, Del. _ When DuPont Co. said in early 1999 that it
was selling three of its buildings, about 10 percent of the city's
office space, the announcement shook the community to its
industrial foundations. But a vibrant economy has helped smooth the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million sale of the three headquarters buildings _ known
as the Nemours, Brandywine and Tatnall buildings _ to a development
partnership had some residents of this company town wondering
whether the mainstay citizen for almost a century was packing up.
</P>
<P>
   The sale capped a decade of real estate divestiture by E.I. du
Pont de Nemours &AMP; Co., the United States' largest chemical concern.
As the company strives to reinvent itself for the 21st century, in
part as a global life-sciences business, it does not consider real
estate investments to be the best use of corporate assets, said
William A. Sullivan, a former real estate manager at DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains in DuPont's real estate portfolio at its
headquarters complex is the DuPont Building, which was built in
stages beginning in 1906 and was one of the country's earliest
multipurpose buildings, with restaurants, theater, hotel, shops and
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense from a business point of view for DuPont not to
have such a large headquarters, but for the city it's sad,'' said
Carol E. Hoffecker, a historian and the author of ``Corporate
Capital: Wilmington in the Twentieth Century.'' ``It seems like
such a dramatic symbol of the company's changing relationship with
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But with over half of a $100 million redevelopment of the
buildings completed and DuPont leasing back a big part of the
Brandywine Building, city promoters see the divestiture as a
necessary regeneration. At a million square feet, City Center (AT)
Wilmington, as the project is called, is by far the largest
redevelopment of office space in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   With a New Economy name, City Center will add 100,000 square
feet of retail space, 890,000 square feet of Class A office space,
75 apartments and 674 parking spaces to the city. ``It's brought in
new blood, new capital, and DuPont stayed,'' said William C. Wyer,
managing director of Wilmington Renaissance Corp., an economic
development group made up of city officials and top business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   From a leasing standpoint, the timing could not be better.
Tenants have been having difficulty getting big blocks of space,
said Daniel R. Reeder, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis
in Wilmington. The city's overall downtown vacancy rate is 5
percent, but it drops to 4 percent for Class A space _ large newer
buildings with amenities and in good locations.
</P>
<P>
   Because plans call for a retail and residential mix, City Center
is expected to transform 11th Street.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, this main thoroughfare from Interstate 95 to the
downtown's Rodney Square has been without significant public spaces
other than the Hotel du Pont and the center lobby of the Nemours
Building. Office workers did not have to go outside, since the
buildings are connected by underground tunnels. This led architects
to criticize Wilmington for its lack of human scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big, cold stuff,'' said Charles M. Weymouth, owner of
Weymouth Architects and Planners in Wilmington. ``There's no
relief, no landscaping, just the repetitiveness of windows, one
floor to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding colorful awnings and flags, huge landscape planters and
lighting will make the area feel more hospitable, said Robert E.
Buccini, a partner in Wilmington's Buccini/Pollin Group, which
signed the deal with DuPont. Barrow Street Capital LLC, a private
New York real estate investment company, is providing the
financing.
</P>
<P>
   The 75 apartments in a section of the Nemours Building should
also go a long way toward making Wilmington a round-the-clock city,
Sullivan said.

<P>
   The 18-story Brandywine Building, built in 1972 on a triangular
plot, was the first to be renovated as offices. Kling Lindquist of
Philadelphia, the original designer of the D-shaped building, was
hired as project architect.
</P>
<P>
   City Center was given a boost at the start when DuPont agreed to
take 266,000 square feet for 10 years in the Brandywine Building,
which is still topped by DuPont's oval logo, in neon. Last month
the company moved 649 people into the renovated space. Several law
firms have signed leases on remaining space, including Young,
Conaway, Stargatt &AMP; Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   A steakhouse is expected to open this fall in space that was
formerly a bank branch. The steakhouse, to be called the Vault, is
operated by two restaurateurs who opened a Mediterranean restaurant
at Market Street Mall in Wilmington last year.
</P>
<P>
   It will have dining room seating for 115, a bar with space for
live entertainment and a mezzanine lounge with seating for 30.
There will also be tables for outdoor dining between the Brandywine
and Nemours buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the restaurant include Charles M. Cawley, head of
MBNA America Bank, a giant credit-card bank that moved its
headquarters to Wilmington in the early 1990s, as well as two other
top MBNA executives. The investment is a message not lost on a city
accustomed to being dominated by DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   While DuPont was selling off buildings in the 1990s and cutting
its work force, MBNA put up five buildings on the northeast side of
Rodney Square, and it now employs thousands there. ``I think it
certainly has demonstrated very powerfully the transformation
Wilmington has been undergoing from a DuPont to MBNA town,''
Hoffecker said.
</P>
<P>
   The third building that DuPont sold _ the Tatnall Building on
11th Street, across from the Brandywine Building _ was demolished
to make way for a parking garage. DuPont had used the
90,000-square-foot building as a mail center.
</P>
<P>
   Tunnels will be available to Nemours and Brandywine tenants,
while a sky bridge that connects Nemours Building to the DuPont
Building will be torn down for security reasons, Buccini said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the developers have turned their attention to perhaps the
toughest part of the project, the 14-story Nemours Building, built
in stages from 1935 to 1942. Earlier this month Buccini/Pollin
Group began gutting the 600,000-square-foot building.
</P>
<P>
   Juniper Financial Corp., a 4-month-old Internet
financial-services company founded by several former executives at
Bank One Corp., has already leased 65,000 square feet. The
traditional hallways lined with marble and individual office doors
will give way to open floors that characterize the information age.
</P>
<P>
   An apartment wing will be carved out of 124,000 square feet on
the corner facing 10th and Orange streets. It will have its own
entrance lobby separate from the office lobby. Up to half of the 75
apartments could be leased for corporate use, with DuPont agreeing
to lease eight apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The floor plans call for studios to two-bedroom units. Rents for
the apartments will be decided nearer the opening in 2001, but a
one-bedroom apartment is expected to cost about $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plan is to have the Hotel du Pont supply room
service, dry-cleaning pickup and other amenities for apartment
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel will also cater to office tenants. A small auditorium
in Nemours could be converted to a movie theater, Buccini said.
Negotiations are under way for a first-floor restaurant in Nemours.
</P>
<P>
   The developers decided not to rename the buildings, believing
their DuPont heritage was an important part of the city's history.
Indeed, three du Pont cousins _ Alfred I., Pierre S. and T. Coleman
_ single-handedly transformed the city from an aging industrial hub
to an office center when they made the decision in 1904 to build
the company headquarters in Wilmington rather than in New York or
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As the major shipbuilding and railroad-car manufacturing
industries waned, the du Pont cousins built a new business that
earned Wilmington the name Chemical Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilmington has been fortunate that when one of its Old Economy
businesses has been on the rocks, something new comes along,''
Hoffecker said.

 &HT;    Black investors losing wariness about stocks
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Black investors are getting less suspicious of the
stock market, says mutual fund executive Mellody Hobson.
</P>
<P>
   That's a major change, and one that should bring benefits to a
traditionally conservative group of investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals need to understand that over the long term, wealth
is created through the stock market,'' said Hobson, president of
Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most recent survey of households with $50,000-plus
income shows that increasing percentages of African-American
households own stocks or plan to start buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the study showed that blacks are more likely than
whites to save and invest for emergencies and college expenses or
to pass wealth along to their heirs. Whites are more likely to save
for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson talked during a recent interview about insights provided
by the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why have African-Americans held back from the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the key issues is knowledge. We have said, ``We have
not invested because we don't feel that we know enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is exposure. We don't typically grow up in homes
where investing is discussed. We don't know people who work in the
field. The major Wall Street firms don't hire many
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we tend to be very conservative. We're talking about
people who are making money for the very first time. They are very
risk-averse. They are therefore picking what they perceive as the
safest investments. Bonds, insurance products. There is a real bias
toward real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why real estate?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's because you can see it. It's tangible; you can get
income from it, or borrow against it, or leave it to your heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a mistrust of the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   A: No question about it. This has a lot to do with exposure,
with the lack of diversity on Wall Street. We have felt the stock
market is intangible. Many say the stock market is like gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But your surveys show more African-Americans are investing in
stocks. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: One reason is the continuing American fascination with the
stock market, which is certainly an offshoot of the market's strong
performance in the 1980s and '90s. The last 20 years have had the
strongest returns in the history of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I think the growing coverage of the stock market in the
press has made a difference. That has been driven by the increasing
incidence of 401(k) retirement plans. Before, the workplace would
take care of your retirement. Now you're making your own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do rising incomes make a difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some. We looked at families with incomes of $50,000 and
higher. When we cut the data at a very high income level, over
$100,000, we saw very similar issues. Income was not as big a
driver as education was.
</P>
<P>
   The media are making a big difference, but there are a few
things that still need to be done. One is that investing should be
taught in schools. It amazes me that we have courses in auto repair
but not investing.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing is that Wall Street needs to help educate those
who have not typically invested in the stock market. To the extent
we can increase minority participation, that helps them. Everyone
wins.
</P>
<P>
   Also, corporations have to be attuned to their own
communications and enrollment policies for their investment plans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can people get started in the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are terrific mutual funds out there. You don't have to
be an expert. You can find professional money managers who reflect
your own investment interests. Reading is another way to learn. Or
you can go to investment professionals, brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you find the best advisers?
</P>
<P>
   A: You ask people you know for the advisers they are comfortable
with. You want to find someone you trust and who will help educate
you along the way. Then you can check their references. That's very
important.

POETRY FESTIVAL INSPIRES THOUSANDS OF RHYME SCHEMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANHOPE, N.J. _ The attire ranged from athletic-coach casual to
the flowing-skirts-with-hiking-boots look, with an occasional beret
and silk scarf sighted. Grandmothers and pierced eyebrows were in
equal abundance. There were blind poets with guide dogs, slouching
young poets with infants asleep on their breasts, and everywhere,
under almost every tree, someone writing in a hard-bound notebook _
poets in their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   From as far away as Hawaii, thousands of people came to the
Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival, which began on Thursday and
runs through Sunday, to hear some of the nation's and world's
better-known poets.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, nicknamed Wordstock by its fans, was expected to
attract 15,000 people to Waterloo Village, a restored colonial
enclave in Sussex County complete with a canal, a gristmill, and a
temporary Borders bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, Yusef Komunyakaa, Mark Doty, Lucille
Clifton, Chinua Achebe and Stanley Kunitz, among others, were
scheduled to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been anywhere where there are so many happy people
in one place for so many days,'' said Betty Lies, a poet from
Princeton who works with the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, the
festival's sponsor. ``People are happy, relaxed, and high on
poetry. It's not a frantic high, it's kind of a mellow high.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a circus tent, where mourning doves destined to appear in
someone's volume of Personal Reflections in the near future flew
through two at a time, capacity crowds of about 2,400 gathered to
hear Stanley Kunitz, 95, the national poet laureate, and Gwendolyn
Brooks, who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, an every-other-year gathering since 1986, is known
for attracting poets who, like their work, are accessible. James
Haba, the festival director, has brought together writers from a
variety of disciplines and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to invite people who are really interested in a living
audience, who are not afraid to encounter that audience, and who
think there is some value to being in a room with people and giving
their words directly, at the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon discussion about teaching poetry, Billy Collins,
who has published six books, poked fun at the academy's infatuation
with obscure poems. ``It can't be good if it's clear,'' he said.
``I think we still have that masochism, in a way _ we need to see a
certain level of difficulty before we recognize it as literature.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As evidenced by the abundant yucks under the big top during his
reading, Collins draws people into his work by making them laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Heather McHugh, a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets,
displayed her trademark wordplay in her reading, sharing her
favorite anagrams (the letters of Dylan Thomas' name, for example,
can be rearranged into ``hot lady's man,'' ``Russian poetry'' can
be transformed into ``syrup into ears,'' and ``English poetry''
turns into ``nightly repose.'')
</P>
<P>
   After explaining her love for the counties of Pennsylvania, she
read a poem about a would-be seduction that ended, ``It was just
for Lackawanna that I didn't take him home,'' and she concluded
with a harrowing piece defining poetry as what could not be said by
the martyr who was burned alive in an iron mask that kept him from
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that writing poetry was something one owned up to
sheepishly _ an eccentric, somewhat suspect hobby, like a
predilection for collecting Mason jars. But after facing an
audience of 2,400 eager listeners, the poet Edward Hirsch, author
of ``How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry'' (Harcourt
Brace, 1999), felt a quicker pulse in the art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were something like this in every state, the state of
American poetry would be completely changed,'' he said. ``It's so
powerful. People come with so many questions about poetry. The
enthusiasm about it is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sander Zulauf, a poet who teaches at the County College of
Morris in Morris County and edits The Journal of New Jersey Poets,
the festival serves as a family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see each other so rarely, because we work alone,'' he said.
``I just love the extraordinary poets, their responsibility to
language and their responsibility to humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Wesol, an English major at Brown University who had
driven from her campus in Providence, R.I., is used to listening
carefully at poetry readings, but enjoyed this weekend's
opportunities for interactions with writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great to be at a place where poetry is celebrated
and emphasized,'' she said. ``You can be waiting in line for a
hamburger, talking about Lucille Clifton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Foundation, based in Morristown, has chosen poetry and
the teaching of it as priorities. The foundation invited high
school students and teachers to the festival free on Thursday, when
6,500 people attended. Friday was devoted to teachers at all
levels, with 3,000 people showing up, twice as many as in 1998.

<P>
   FARMINGVILLE, N.Y. _ When dusk comes, the streets empty and the
esquineros hurry to the homes they share with 15, 20 and sometimes
30 others to drink beer and eat supper.
</P>
<P>
   The esquineros _ the men of the corner _ used to walk home alone
from the corners where they gather each morning to be hired out for
yardwork or other day jobs. Now they walk in groups. At one house,
where the Guatemalans live, the door is punctured with bullet
holes; a white man recently drove by and unloaded a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The next block over, there is a white man who put his house up
for sale after 20 Mexicans moved in next door. As he pulled into
his driveway, he stared at his unwanted neighbors. He is a
tough-looking guy, and he did not turn his eyes away. One of the
Mexicans wore a secondhand shirt that read, ``We don't like you
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the culture divide of the suburbs has been more a
Cold War than a hot one, an uneasy peace with periodic clashes over
public issues like limits on the number of boarders allowed in a
house or a proposal in Suffolk County to sue the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to more stringently enforce immigration
laws.
</P>
<P>
   But when two Hispanic immigrants seeking work were lured to an
abandoned building here on Sunday and attacked by two white men
wielding a knife, a crowbar and a shovel, the assault was a
sobering reminder of the lives of the unwanted strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The divide plays out in towns like Brewster, Mount Kisco and
Yonkers, N.Y., and Freehold, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But the emotions are rawest in Farmingville, where it is
estimated that in the summertime, one in 15 residents is a migrant
worker. When October comes, a few men stay, but most follow their
money home.
</P>
<P>
   The violence Sunday shocked some whites and even prompted the
formation of a new community group by politicians and church
leaders looking for ways to ease the tensions. But if the violence
was a revelation to many whites, the hostility behind it was hardly
news to the brown men in the Goodwill T-shirts and muddy jeans who
come to the corner each morning looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANGER ON BOTH SIDES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dionicio Urbina walked quickly through the white neighborhoods.
He is 20 years old and was shocked when some white teenagers just a
few years younger than he hurled an ethnic slur and squealed with
cracking voices, ``Speak English,'' and ``What are you doing here,
Mexican?''
</P>
<P>
   In the safety of his worn-down house, Urbina lay on his bedroll
and listened to a light rain pelt his window _ a bad omen for work
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what it's like to be in a town where they hate
you,'' he said in nearly perfect English. ``The place is so weird
to me. The suburbs. I never knew that word. In other parts of the
country the Mexicans fight the Mexicans. Here, it's the white
people who don't want us. It's not the country and it's not the
city. It's strange, but, man, the money is here. I never dreamed
about $100 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of jobs in this tree-lined hamlet in that is
home to 15,000 residents and acres of blacktop and strip malls.
Mostly they are menial jobs like cleaning pools and landscaping,
and like a quarter of all jobs in the United States, they pay about
$8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Latinos have arrived in great numbers over the past four
years to take the jobs that locals are unwilling or unable to do.
Most are here illegally, and it is their illegal status that most
irritates local residents.
</P>
<P>
   The people taunt each other. Some Americans picket the Latinos
every Saturday as they stand on the corners waiting for work. The
esquineros have become schooled in the ways of America. They picket
back. And after the ambush of the two workers, more than 500 of the
illegal immigrants took to the streets demanding their civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning a large group of Latinos stands on a small mound
denuded of grass but choked with poison ivy. It is known as the
esquina or corner, and it is the best, most visible corner around.
Some men walk two hours in the morning to get here to be picked up
for some work. It is an hour if you run.
</P>
<P>
   Farther back from the mound are some trees where men go in the
sweltering mornings to relieve themselves or smoke a little pot.
Next to it is the 7-Eleven with a sign in front that says ``Welcome
to Farmingville.'' But the esquineros know they are not wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Before, they accepted their lot as unwanted outsiders. But the
beating of the two men has made the esquineros angry. ``Man, they
want you here in the mornings to do their animal work and then at
night they want you to disappear,'' said Carlos Antonio, 19. ``If
they want war, if they want Pancho Villa, then I can be Pancho
Villa.''
</P>
<P>
   The American dream for the esquineros is to find a way off this
corner. They tell the legend of the two brothers from Hidalgo who
found their way to Farmingville 20 years ago. The brothers worked
as stone masons and returned to Mexico with a fortune. Others
followed, and now the esquineros come from all corners of Mexico
and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Lalo Cervantes, 37, has come. He is from Mexico City. He has
gold in his teeth, and when he has no money in his pocket, he looks
for a little work.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Antonio has come too. And Gabriel Jimenez. Cervantes and
Antonio speak good English. Jimenez, 23, comes from the mountains.
He is a peasant and understands little English beyond ``push,''
``pull,'' ``lift,'' ``over there,'' ``how much?'' and ``do you buy
lunch?''
</P>
<P>
   The morning traffic must make a right turn out of the 7-Eleven.
And when the Americans make the turn, they look left and avoid
looking right at the esquineros.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, their cars are swarmed with workers. One American
woman looked with purpose and lowered her power window. ``I only
need one,'' she said. She had some yardwork. When a man jumped in,
the ribaldry began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big gringa in a big car,'' said Armando Perez, rubbing his
palms together. ``Thick and soft. That's your American girls. Their
husbands go to work and I think they are lonely just like us.''
</P>
<P>
   The esquineros would like a woman of any kind. There are few
Mexican women out here, and the only companionship for them arrives
in vans on Friday and Saturday evenings from Queens. The price is
$20.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; A DAY'S LABOR FOR $100
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A white man pulled up in a big white truck. He was new to the
corner and had never hired esquineros before. Jimenez, Antonio and
Cervantes piled in. The patron spoke loudly, as though the volume
of his voice would increase their understanding of English. ``Boy,
that's a zoo, huh? A free for all? You do that every day?''
</P>
<P>
   He took the men to a chic neighborhood in Port Jefferson. You
could smell the saltwater first, then you could see the boats.
Then, over a slight hill was the patron's dream house. It had a
pool, and it cost $25,000 just to clear the trees. Where the trees
used to be were 24,000 square feet of bald earth where the men were
to lay the sod. Lalo Cervantes, with his nice English, became the
crew chief. The boss' wife was very particular about her grass. But
Cervantes was assiduous. He calmed the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The day was hot. The boss kept saying it wasn't too hot.
Cervantes kept asking how much money he was to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take care of you,'' the boss kept answering. The workers
grew suspicious that they would not be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Most workers will return with $100 in their pockets after long,
dirty hours. A few will get nothing. They will get stiffed, and
when they return home, all they will carry is malice in their
hearts and a vague promise to get even with that gringo boss.
</P>
<P>
   This boss had nice cars and two grown sons with Adonis-like
bodies. They like to go to the gym, the woman kept saying. One son
drove a Mercedes, the other a Porsche, and they lifted no sod. One
neighbor drove around in his nice car, a convertible, with his toy
poodle sitting in his lap as if it were his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange,'' Antonio said in Spanish. ``These guys don't
know the value of what they've got. Big bodies and no work. This
must make the old man sad.''
</P>
<P>
   When the work was done, the boss handed two new $50 bills to
each man and said: ``You boys know anything about air-conditioning?
I fired my whole crew because they're lazy. You guys like to work
hard. I'll give you that.''
</P>
<P>
   He handed out his card and dropped the workers on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man,'' said Antonio, tapping the card with his nails.
``It's my dream to get off the corner. Here's my ticket.'' He never
did call the man.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIRTY MEN, ONE HOUSE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The men walked down Horseblock Road to the Brewery, a cantina
with gray walls that is one of the few places the cultures overlap:
the American war veterans, the Portuguese-American contractors and
the esquineros.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Alex Martinez held his head in his hands, his elbows
on the bar. He stared into his plate. He had problems with his
American girlfriend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just doesn't understand,'' he told any stranger willing to
listen. ``All the things. The car. She wants more. I tell her, `I
work for these things. Do you know the value of work?' I don't
think she does. We come from different places.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a ranch house off Horseblock Road. In the house are 9
bicycles, 13 toothbrushes, 30 men, a big bottle of bleach, a pot of
boiling chicken and five lingerie catalogs. The rain began to fall
again. Some men sat around the dirty kitchen drinking beer and
complaining about work.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, more rain fell. The work was scarce and feelings
were as damp as the ground. Across the street, white people
picketed, as they do every Saturday, with signs that read ``Go
Home'' and ``Stop the Crime.'' A man drove back and forth taking
photographs of the esquineros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing against immigrants. Immigrants built this
country,'' said the photographer, David Drew, 48, . ``But these
aren't immigrants. They're criminals taking advantage of a good
thing. It's like putting bread out for the birds and the rats eat
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans understood his English. ``This guy, he's not
stable,'' said Cesar Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The esquineros have learned to stick up for themselves.
Encouraged by men like Carlos Canales, an outreach worker for the
Work Place Project, the esquineros have staged demonstrations at
the County Legislature when it considered passing laws aimed at
them. They hold news conferences and picket the homes of
contractors who do not pay their employees.
</P>
<P>
   During one of these vigils, among taunts of ``You make me
sick,'' and ``My father came here legally,'' a group of Latino men
with varying shades of skin spoke with two white women, one old,
the other young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to me, please.'' the older woman said. ``I've got
nothing against you personally. But you are here illegally. There
are too many of you. We're inundated. You take the money home and
make no life here.''
</P>
<P>
   A brown man responded in clumsy English, ``But Spanish is the
second language of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And guess what the first is,'' the woman said. ``It's the
language we speak in this country.''

RESCUE ATTEMPT FOR THE EURO FALLS SHORT OF BANKERS' HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE &UR; ,  &LR; Czech Republic _ One day after the world's major
central banks announced an unusual rescue attempt for the euro,
Europe's struggling currency, the effort showed signs on Saturday
of being more modest and tentative than it first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   To the disappointment of many European bankers, American
officials refrained from speaking out strongly in support of a
stronger euro and raised doubts about their willingness to
intervene forcefully in currency markets by selling dollars or
buying euros.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting here on Saturday of central bankers and finance
ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations, the
president of the European Central Bank said the intervention, which
stunned money markets on Friday, was already over, at least for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the case even though the euro rose to only 88 cents
against the dollar and is still far below what European bankers
want to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no strategy to continue and continue,'' the Central
Bank president, Wim Duisenberg, said here on Saturday night.
``Intervention will take place when we deem it appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the central banks are trying to have as much impact
on the market with the signals they send to investors as with the
money they spend buying up euros.
</P>
<P>
   And by all accounts, European finance ministers and the European
Central Bank scored a surprising coup by persuading the U.S.
Treasury to cooperate in a rescue attempt at all.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, the Treasury Department had consistently given the
impression of its strong skepticism about attempts at buoying up
other currencies at the expense of the dollar, and they continue to
repeat their conviction that a strong dollar is good for the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials seemed more intent on lending the name of
the United States _ but not necessarily much American money _ to an
effort on behalf of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be bucks behind it,'' said Klaus Friedrich, chief
economist of Dresdner Bank AG in Germany, who was here for the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Though Friedrich was happy that European officials were able to
orchestrate an effort that included the United States, Japan,
Canada and Britain _ the most significant European Union member
country still outside the euro network _ he remained unconvinced by
the American commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market badly needs a statement from the Americans that the
euro is substantially undervalued and the dollar is substantially
overvalued,'' Friedrich said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not coming. In a communique issued by the Group of
Seven, the finance ministers merely repeated their ``shared
concern'' about the ``potential implications of recent movements in
the euro for the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, first signs indicate that the amount of money used to
intervene in the currency markets on Friday was very modest. The
European Central Bank gave no clue about the magnitude of its
campaign to buy euros or sell other currencies, but currency
experts and traders have estimated that the amount was about $6
billion or $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate may in fact be generous. Dow Jones Newswires,
quoting an anonymous official at the European Central Bank, said
the actual amount of the intervention was in the ``low single
digits,'' perhaps $2 billion or $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is not insignificant, but it is not enough to have a
long-term effect given the trillions of dollars that sweep through
the global financial system every week.
</P>
<P>
   Psychology and timing may ultimately be more important to the
future of the euro than the amounts of money used by the world's
central banks on its behalf.

 &HT;    EDS: Fix in 2nd graf changes Transportation to Traffic
 &HT;    Tire industry shielded from scrutiny
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ No federal agency tracks the number of deaths
related to tire problems, a fact that may change since officials
linked 101 deaths to faulty Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   But long before the recent calls for stronger regulation, the
industry was cloaking its mistakes in judges' orders designed to
protect ``trade secrets,'' attorneys going after tire companies
around the country say. And with few reporting rules, not even the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has many key
records.
</P>
<P>
   A Palm Beach County lawsuit, set for trial in October,
highlights the industry's ability to shield itself from scrutiny.
Attorneys suing Uniroyal Goodrich say the company's parent,
Michelin, has consistently destroyed documents and lied about their
existence, according to court records. And in at least one
occasion, a judge has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want anybody to see the records of the tires that
are failing. Nobody,'' said Jeff Liggio, a lawyer representing one
of the two women who died in a 13-person van crash eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Liggio, partner Jene Williams, and a para-legal have been
sifting through 79 banker's boxes and 103 rolls of microfilm full
of complaints about Uniroyal tires.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints, lodged between 1983 and 1989, may be unwarranted
or minor. A consumer may have run over a bed of glass and blamed
the company when she popped a tire. Perhaps someone else used the
tires so much they became bald, but still tried to weasel a free
pair of new tires from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the nature or validity of the complaints, consumers and
the government have never seen them. The records are confidential.
And if not for a bit of luck and a court order, Liggio and Williams
wouldn't have them in their office now.
</P>
<P>
   Liggio has been asking Uniroyal for the tire complaints since
1993, two years after a van leaving from a Fort Pierce church
meeting flipped on Interstate 95 near PGA Boulevard and left Mary
Eddings and Lisa Wright dead. The tread on the van's left rear tire
had separated, the victims' families contend. The 1988 tire,
labelled National Chaparral, was manufactured by Uniroyal Goodrich
in an Alabama plant, which has since been bought by Michelin.
</P>
<P>
   Eddings' and Wright's families sued Uniroyal, claiming the tire
was defective and caused the crash. Uniroyal argues a number of
other factors are responsible, including a plug used to make a
faulty tire repair. No one in the van was wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after filing suit, victims' attorneys requested the records
on tire complaints, called adjustment forms. The judge in the case
determined the request was legitimate because the families were
claiming Uniroyal had used a poor adhesive between the tire's
rubber and its steel belts. Complaints from other customers could
help the plaintiffs determine whether this was a manufacturing
problem or if consumers were improperly warned of potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Uniroyal attorneys said the company didn't keep those records,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't true. Another attorney had the exact records
Liggio and Williams were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   James Seifter, who was suing Uniroyal in Fulton County, Ga., had
spent weeks digging through company files in Akron, Ohio, and
eventually left the plant with boxes full of consumer complaints.
Seifter won a $42 million verdict in the Georgia case, which was
later overturned by the state supreme court. He has since settled,
with an agreement that he and his client would not disclose the
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Before the confidentiality agreement, word of Seifter's boxes
made its way through the small community of lawyers who sue tire
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Seifter couldn't hand the boxes to Liggio and Williams,
photocopy the records or even summarize them.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in product liability cases _ including Seifters _ give
companies broad protection from public scrutiny of many of their
records. State and federal laws protect the companies from having
to divulge trade secrets and that is often interpreted to include
the release of most company documents. When lawyers suing the
companies get such documents, it is usually under ``protective
orders,'' which strictly limit who can see the documents and
require that they be returned when the cases end.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin vigorously defends its right to protect company
secrets, claiming many of the documents requested could aid
competitors. Company spokesman Michael Fanning said complaint
statistics can be taken out of context and he also points out that
lawyers often file groundless complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, plaintiffs lawyers will go on fishing
expeditions,'' Fanning said.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA, which regulates tire safety, can request company
documents. But that organization relies mostly on complaints made
directly to its hotline, a spokeswoman said, meaning regulators see
documents only when they order an investigation or when a company
reports defects on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Bills moving through Congress this week, as a result of the
Firestone inquiry, would give the agency a larger budget along with
more power to collect data related to tire defects.
</P>
<P>
   Seifter asked an Atlanta judge to modify the protective order in
his case, which allowed Liggio and Williams to discuss the
documents. Georgia state Judge John Mather ruled Liggio and
Williams could have the documents as long as their Florida judge
agreed, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   In his Dec. 16 order, Mather wrote of ``grave concerns that the
defendant may be engaged in a pattern of misrepresentation with the
aid of this court's protective order.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Catherine Brunson said
the attorneys could use the boxes for their case.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Florida attorneys could get the boxes, Uniroyal
attorneys went back to Georgia and persuaded Mather to send the
boxes to Price Waterhouse, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   That rankled Brunson: ``Uniroyal has engaged in a pattern of
willfully violating this Court's Order and obstructing the
Plaintiff's ability to carry out this Court's Order of March 10,
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   She ordered the documents be turned over immediately and
reserved the right to penalize Uniroyal as the suit progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Liggio and Williams say other documents have been hidden,
including a manual used at the plant where the tire was made. A
judge will rule on that issue later.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning, the Michelin spokesman, said his company has provided
600,000 pages of documents to Liggio and Williams in the past six
months. And, he said, officials spent $200,000 to locate a single
roll of microfilm that had fallen out of its container, become
wedged between file folders and made its way to Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did locate it,'' Fanning said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin, Uniroyal's parent, has aggressively defended itself
before. Three years ago, after Michelin lost a $30 million verdict
to a Belle Glade truck driver, the company sent nine private
detectives to look at jurors' pasts and accused three of them of
lies or omissions during jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney in that case, Donald Fountain, wanted the same
boxes that are now in Liggio's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to trial on our case, their final word was these
documents are destroyed, they do not exist any longer. And that's
what the jury heard,'' Fountain said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth District Court of Appeals threw out the $30 million
verdict and ordered a new trial because the trial judge didn't let
Michelin strike one of the jurors whose daughter had a tire
blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Before the second trial, Fountain learned of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then all the sudden, we settled,'' Fountain said. ``Funny how
that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The terms of Fountain's March settlement are confidential, and a
Michelin spokesman said the settlement did not amount to an
admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a federal magistrate in Georgia fined Michelin $25,000
for abusing evidence requested in a tire failure lawsuit in which
three people died, according to papers filed in the Eddings case.
``Michelin offered nothing but verbiage and a stone wall in
response to plaintiffs' efforts to obtain information essential to
the prosecution of their case,'' the judge wrote in a stinging
seven-page order.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain was in Seattle this week, meeting with about a dozen
lawyers from around the country who sue tire companies to discuss
strategies and possible class actions against Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Firestone recall began, Fountain said he has received
about 150 calls to his office. About 65 callers had blown out
tires, but most of the people were not injured enough to justify an
expensive lawsuit, he said. Fountain has about a dozen tire-related
lawsuits against multiple companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has the exact same problem. It's just that poor
Firestone had the moons lined up against them,'' Fountain said
without a trace of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers say they're happy the industry will have to change
as a result of media and congressional pressure. They say NHTSA has
been lax in requesting documents.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope judges will protect fewer tire company documents
from scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the courts recognized how widespread the abuse
was,'' said Ocala lawyer Bruce Kaster.
</P>
<P>
   Kaster advertised in legal journals 13 years ago to find other
lawyers suing Uniroyal to show the company was misrepresenting the
number of pending tread-separation lawsuits it was defending,
according to a Wall Street Journal article.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's attorney general's office, in the midst of a Firestone
investigation launched in August, has also been unable to view key
documents. Its attorneys have been asking plaintiffs lawyers around
the state for records, only to learn court orders have sealed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in the dark and doesn't need to be in the dark,''
said Les Garringer, assistant deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Garringer said the office will be asking judges to open sealed
documents _ and limit viewing to the attorney general's
investigation if the information really merits protection as trade
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, lawyers may rely on Florida's ``Sunshine in
Litigation'' law, which forbids judges from sealing information
about public hazards. But business groups question the plaintiffs
lawyers' motives: ``They're basically lazy and they don't want to
do any work, so they want to just get all the file cabinets in
corporate headquarters,'' said Jon Shebel, president and CEO of
Associated Industries of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Shebel, whose group lobbies on behalf of business interests,
cites the example of the Coca-Cola formula as an essential trade
secret that plaintiffs' lawyers would undermine if they had the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the man who lost his wife in the 1992 van crash is
frustrated by Uniroyal's tactics. Sylvester Wright, who was driving
the van he borrowed from his pastor the night it crashed, doesn't
claim to know the law, but would like to see his case go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe in what you believe, put the cards on the table
and let justice take its course,'' he said.

 &HT;    Stock options spread wealth to all workers
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stock options _ once a get-rich perk of white-collar
executives and technology whizzes _ have gotten democratized.
</P>
<P>
   One out of five American workers now have the opportunity to buy
shares in the company he or she works for, hopefully at a bargain
price.
</P>
<P>
   That comes to more than 10 million employees, including grocery
clerks, secretaries and factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is a major benefit for people like Cara Hoffhien, a
21-year-old who started as a counter clerk at Starbucks four years
ago. ``I really am going to do something with this company,'' she
said. ``This investment makes me feel like I'm really part of it. I
don't want to be just a worker bee.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest share of stock options still goes to top corporate
officers. But a new survey from the National Center for Employee
Ownership indicates that about a third goes down the line, to
middle managers as well as salaried, sales and hourly workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of companies now grant options to all employees. Among
them are Starbucks, along with Aetna, DeVry Institute, First Union,
Kodak, Pfizer, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Whole Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Even part-time workers can qualify at Starbucks and some other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   A stock option gives a worker the right to buy a given number of
shares, at a fixed price, for a stated number of years.
</P>
<P>
   The buying price often is the value of the stock at the time the
option is granted. Employees hope the share price will go up,
giving them an opportunity to buy company stock at a bargain price.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, deciding what to do with options can be
challenging. To start with, options can be either incentive or
non-qualified, and the tax treatment of them is different.
</P>
<P>
   The trend to providing more employees with options is driven by
business necessities, including a tight labor market and fierce
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies don't want to compete by raising wages because of
global competition issues,'' said Corey Rosen, director of the
Oakland, Calif.-based NCEO. Instead, companies sweeten the pot by
offering an ownership stake to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the changing nature of work. ``Most business
organizations, particularly in technology, have adopted a flatter,
more participatory work environment,'' Rosen said. ``If they give
employees more decision-making power, they want them to have more
of an interest in the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax and accounting rules also encourage corporations to use
options, rather than base salary increases, to reward employees,
said consultant Laura Sejen of Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of stock options is not accounted for as an employee
expense, which makes earnings statements look better each quarter.
The impact of options expenses must be disclosed in a footnote,
however.
</P>
<P>
   For employees, the main attraction is the money to be made.
Hugely successful technology companies like Microsoft are famous
for rewards reaped from stock options.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Home Depot claims to have turned 2,000 employees _
secretaries and store managers included _ into stockholding
millionaires. That includes options recipients and employees who
bought stock at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey from Oppenheimer Funds found that 46 percent of
workers who receive options believe they will be able to retire as
much as five years earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   There are disadvantages. The value of the option is obviously
tied to the price of the stock. If employees concentrate too much
of their investments in their employers' shares, a down market
could have a significant impact.
</P>
<P>
   The young and hopeful, like Starbucks' Hoffhien, are not
discouraged. Option grants run 10 percent to 14 percent of base
salary, and Hoffhien buys more shares each payday through payroll
deduction. She now owns almost 200 shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really confident about where this company is going,''
she said. ``None of the fluctuations have scared me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plan? She's getting married next year. Two or three years
from now she'll sell her shares to help buy a house _ if the share
price is high enough.

 REAL ESTATE: AN UP CYCLE JUST KEEPS ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Office vacancies are approaching record lows and
rental rates reaching record highs in Manhattan. Despite the
demand, there is no speculative construction in the city, with the
few buildings that are being constructed substantially preleased
before a shovel goes into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Hudson River along the New Jersey waterfront,
buildings are being occupied as fast as they can be built as
securities firms are moving their back-office operations one stop
west of Manhattan on the PATH rail line. Even in Westchester
County, north of the city, which has tended to lag behind the rest
of the area in occupancy, growth by local companies is filling up
long-vacant space.
</P>
<P>
   The business of leasing to retailers in New York is booming,
with areas like 14th Street and Madison Avenue in the upper 20s
attracting new attention. The city's hotels are packed despite the
addition of new rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate business in the metropolitan area is in the
midst of a period of prosperity so extended that it has prompted
people with long memories to ask ``How long can this go on?''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus answer appears to be: for the next two or three
years at least, provided the national economy does not swoon. With
lenders still exerting firm discipline on developers, there is
little danger of overbuilding and even slowed growth is still
growth, which means more jobs and a need for space to put people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must tell you this all makes me very nervous, but I can't
see any clouds in the sky,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of
Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company. She said that
history demonstrates every upsurge in rental rates and property
prices has been followed by a downturn, but that in the current
market ``there is no new supply and demand is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by Insignia/ESG, the vacancy rate in
Manhattan is under 4 percent for the first time in memory, and the
average asking rental for all transactions of more than 10,000
square feet at midyear was $48.66, which the report describes as an
all-time high. (A year ago it was $38.43.)
</P>
<P>
   Internet-related companies, which did not exist a few years ago,
were the largest leasers of new space in the first half of this
year, accounting for 20 percent of the total, up from 3 percent a
year earlier. The city's traditional mainstay, the financial
industry, was nudged out of first place, accounting for 19.8
percent of space leased.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of this new industry and the consequent
diversification of the city's economy have some people suggesting
that the rules have changed and that the old boom-and-bust real
estate economy has been permanently changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York's real estate industry has had its share of busts and
booms over the past few decades, but the current real estate cycle
is unlike any other seen since the dawn of the industrial age,''
said a report prepared by Colliers ABR, a real estate services
company. ``The abundance of current economic and real estate data
suggests that not only does this recovery still have room to grow,
but that the real estate cycles as most people remember them may be
a thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But many seasoned executives said they were not ready to accept
a relentlessly rosy future. ``Something is going to happen _ it
always does,'' said Steven Swerdlow, executive managing director
for the eastern division of CB Richard Ellis, the brokerage and
services company. He said if the national economy were mismanaged,
interest rates could soar and the value of stocks decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have a hard landing rather than a soft one and a
plunge in the stock market,'' he said. ``New York is much more
sensitive to the stock market than other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark &AMP; Co. Real Estate, a
brokerage and management company, said New York is much more
sensitive to faraway events then it once was, because of the links
among financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be something that nobody predicted,'' he
said. ``Some event somewhere in the world will have an impact
here.'' He recalled that problems with foreign currencies and the
near-collapse of a large investment fund roiled capital markets in
the fall of 1998, including the one for commercial mortgage-backed
securities. This dried up financing for sales transactions and put
a temporary cap on the prices offered for properties.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some real estate executives argue that the stumble in
1998 helped to prolong the good times by squelching any possibility
of a new wave of speculative building. Such a wave of building in
the mid- and late 1980s prolonged the downturn of the early 1990s
by bringing large blocks of new office space to a market where
demand was dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have had lending for speculative building but for the
crunch of the fall of 1998 and early 1999,'' said Robert
Billingsley, an executive vice president of Colliers. ``That gave
pause to potentially irrational behavior and in hindsight was a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives added other notes of wariness. Anthony E.
Malkin, the president of W&AMP;M Properties, an investor and
development company, said: ``Whatever happens to change the market
will be unexpected. You have a situation where the average
apartment in Manhattan costs over $700,000. How is that
sustainable? There is inevitably going to be a shakeout.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce E. Mosler, the president for U.S. operations for Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield, the brokerage and services company, said he expected the
real estate cycle to endure, but with the peaks not as high and the
valleys not as low as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still adding jobs in the city, which means growth, even
if we will slow to about 75,000 new jobs this year from 89,000 in
1999,'' he said. He predicted that the remaining industrial
property on the far west side of Manhattan would be redeveloped and
the exodus to New Jersey would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Because developers still cannot get financing for speculative
building, he said, any such projects will be of modest size. ``You
have to tie up too much equity to do a 1 million square foot
building, so if there is any speculative building, it will be in
the 150,000 to 300,000 square foot range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although space will remain scarce, the recent run-up in rents
may not be sustainable, some executives say. ``The rise in rents
will have to level off because they are beginning to run into
people's ability to pay,'' said Swerdlow. He said small and
medium-size service organizations, like law firms, would be forced
to leave the city or to enter into unwanted mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Gosin agrees. ``We are getting to a point where some tenants
cannot afford the rent,'' he said. ``There are high-margin
businesses and low-margin business, and it is the low-margin
service companies that are being affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate executives, political officials and urban
planners fear that allowing economics to force certain types of
business out of the city could unbalance the economic mix and make
it difficult to attract new businesses. Some are trying to devise
incentive programs that would keep the companies pushed out of
Manhattan in the city by encouraging development in the boroughs
outside Manhattan.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate executives say that rents will continue to
increase in locations that are considered desirable and that the
tenants who are unable to pay will consider moving across the
Hudson or to other areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Tighe pointed to the recent decision by a publishing house, John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, to leave its longtime location on Third Avenue at
39th Street for a new building to be developed in Hoboken, N.J., by
SJP Properties. Wiley will move 800 people into 400,000 square feet
of the building, which is expected to be completed in early 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``That company was in Manhattan for 94 years, but Hoboken is
only one stop away on the PATH train,'' Tighe said. ``What is
happening is that the boundaries of the city are being redefined.
There was a time when downtown was dead; now downtown is wonderful.
There were other areas that were considered unacceptable; now the
island is seamless from 60th Street south.''
</P>
<P>
   This process of adding outlying areas to what tenants perceive
as the central business district continues with each up cycle, she
continued. ``It took several cycles,'' she said, ``to establish
Metrotech in Brooklyn and the Jersey coast,'' referring to the west
bank of the Hudson River. ``Maybe this is the cycle that makes Long
Island City acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Long Island City in Queens is closer to the east side
of Manhattan than the New Jersey riverfront is and has good
transportation links, its buildings are mostly former factories or
distribution centers and not as attractive as the new buildings
going up in Jersey City and Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the area has been designated by planners for
decades as the site of the fourth concentration of office space,
after midtown and downtown Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queens is probably next,'' said Ross Moskowitz, a partner in
the law firm of Stroock, Stroock &AMP; Lavan and a former official of
the city's Economic Development Corp. ``Queens West is ready for
bid, with 2 million square feet of commercial space with retail and
entertainment components,'' he said, referring to the waterfront
development jointly controlled by the city, state and Port
Authority. ``The project is ready to go, and I expect that we will
see active bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong rental market is being reflected in the price of
buildings being sold, said James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark.
He said that Class A buildings _ the newest, most modern buildings
_ were selling at over $400 a square foot in Manhattan, compared
with $300 a square foot just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Equity Office Properties, whose chairman is Sam
Zell, the Chicago-based real estate investor, paid more than $400 a
square foot for the building at 1301 Ave. of the Americas at 52nd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Zell was a bottom fisher in the early '90s,'' buying
distressed properties at low prices, Kuhn said. ``Now he has sent a
signal to the marketplace that rent levels in New York are
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some blockbuster deals are likely in the coming year, he said,
with Rockefeller Center, the World Trade Center, the Seagram
Building and other trophies on the block in one fashion or another.
He predicted that a New York area real estate investment trust
would eventually win the bidding for Rockefeller Center. ``That is
the best real estate in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following are descriptions of the state of the market in other
sectors:
</P>
<P>
   The Suburbs: a Riverfront Boom in New Jersey
</P>
<P>
   The western shore of the Hudson River facing Manhattan is in the
throes of development as Wall Street companies are building space
for their back office operations that support the money-making
front office activities that are still in Manhattan. And the
buildings are filling up as fast as they can be built or renovated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no space,'' said Seena Stein, president of Newmark's
New Jersey operations. ``The vacancy rate in Class A on the
waterfront is 0.2 percent, and rents are at a record high of $36.25
a square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein said anyone wanting space on the waterfront would have to
wait at least a year until a construction project is finished. She
said this delay has pushed some deals west to Newark, N.J., the
next stop on the PATH line.
</P>
<P>
   One big New York financial house that is changing the skyline in
Jersey City is the Goldman Sachs Group, which purchased land in
Colgate Center near the southern end of the city's waterfront
across the water from the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to build three structures totaling about 3
million square feet of space. Work is already under way on the
first building, which will have about 1.3 million square feet of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and Chase Bank are also expanding their support
operations in Jersey City, and each could eventually have thousands
of employees working across the Hudson from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Development spread north to Hoboken this year, when the Wiley
deal was signed in August. The publisher will occupy one of two SJP
Properties in what is being called the Waterfront Corporate Center.
The development is to include offices, retail space, a hotel and
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in New Jersey the office market is strong, but the
obstacles to development are preventing any hint of overbuilding,
said Donald Eisen, the director of the suburban operations of
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. In New Jersey, ``you have a market of about
150 million square feet of space and maybe one to two million
square feet going up,'' he said. ``That's minuscule.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped efforts to develop established cities like
Jersey City, Hoboken and Newark represented a trend that might halt
or slow the endless sprawl of development across the state. ``New
Jersey needs to push development where the infrastructure is _ and
that is in urban areas,'' he said. ``You just have to be
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said one good example of creative redevelopment was the
conversion of an old IT&AMP;T industrial site along Route 3 in Essex
County to a new shopping mall called Clifton Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester County, N.Y., which had appeared to be lagging
behind the rest of the metropolitan area in leasing activity, is
experiencing an upsurge as locally based companies began to expand.
Some real estate executives said the vacancy statistics in the
county had been distorted by the presence of former corporate
headquarters buildings that have been difficult to divide for new
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are buildings like the former Kraft headquarters that
add 500,000 square feet to the vacancy numbers, but don't reflect
what is actually happening in the market,'' said Kenneth M.
Krasnow, a regional managing director at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield.
``Westchester suffered a lot from corporate downsizing, but now
homegrown companies are beginning to take space. The company that
had 5,000 or 10,000 square feet of space three or four years ago
now needs 25,000 to 30,000 square feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey H. Newman, an executive vice president of W&AMP;M
Properties, which owns 1.5 million square feet of property in
Westchester County and Fairfield County in Connecticut, said,
``Companies like Sara Lee and Chock Full o' Nuts have been leaving
Manhattan and moving to Westchester.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his company had concentrated in buying existing
buildings and then renovating them to bring them up to Class A
standards. In White Plains, ``at 500 Mamaroneck we had to pull shag
carpeting off the walls,'' Malkin, the president of W&AMP;M Properties,
said.
</P>
<P>
   As vacancies have diminished, rental rates have risen, although
they are still low compared with Manhattan. ``Space that was
renting for $17 a square foot a year or so ago is now $26 to $30 a
square foot,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island, Krasnow said, is in the midst of a transition from
defense companies to a new high-tech economy. The buildings that
once housed companies making airplanes and other military goods are
being transformed into locations for software and
telecommunications organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Retail Retailers Try Areas Previously Shunned
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are balking at paying higher rents in fashionable
areas of Manhattan and instead are looking for stores in areas once
considered less desirable, brokers specializing in store leasing
said. According to a survey conducted by Garrick-Aug Associates,
the average asking rent at midyear was $77.50 a square foot, up
just 0.6 percent from $77 a square foot in the first six months of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rents are at all-time highs, and people don't want to look
stupid, especially the national chains,'' said Faith H. Consolo,
vice chairman of Garrick-Aug. ``So they are looking at new areas,
such as Madison Avenue north of Madison Square Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Consolo said this area was bolstered by the decision by Credit
Suisse First Boston to move into the building at 11 Madison Ave. at
25th Street, the influx of new restaurants and the renovation of
hotels. ``What happened to the Flatiron district is moving north,''
she said, referring to the area near the famous triangular building
at 23rd Street and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had retailers asking me to look at locations on 14th
Street,'' said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of Lansco
Corp., a retail broker. ``They want to be there because they think
it is new and fresh and young.''
</P>
<P>
   He said retailers are looking at places like 14th Street, which
was known in the past for its downscale stores, because the rents
in preferred locations have become prohibitive. ``You are talking
$600 a square foot on Madison Avenue and $500 to $600 a square foot
on Fifth Avenue, if you can find it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said retailers often had a difficult time negotiating with
landlords because there were multiple bidders for space.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Occupancy Jumps, Along With Prices
</P>
<P>
   Even though the millennium was a bit of a bust for hotel owners
and operators, with demand well below what some had hoped for,
occupancy rates in the city's hotels remained near historic highs
and revenues grew quickly as room rates rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen revenue growth of an average of 13 percent in the
first half of this year and 20 percent in some segments of the
market,'' said Sean Hennessey, director of the New York hospitality
and leisure practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The occupancy rate at midyear was 89.2 percent, up from 82.9
percent a year earlier. And analysts say the strong statistics do
not fully reflect the intensity of demand, because many hotels are
so full on some nights they have to turn away prospective guests.
``I had some clients come into town, and they had to stay in
Stamford because there was nothing available for them in the
city,'' Hennessey said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some 1,400 hotel rooms have recently been added to the
city's supply of approximately 70,000, the unceasing demand has
pushed up daily rates. The average daily rate at midyear was
$215.55, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, up from $200.23 a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of how far New York is ahead of the rest of the
country, the firm reported that the average daily rate nationally
is $84.51.

SLUMP ENDS AS YANKEES BLAST AWAY IN RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the six games without a victory, their longest
drought in three years, the Yankees had withered from postseason
favorites to doubting shadows of their former selves. Lunging at
the plate, the Yankees could not find a way to break through their
futility.
</P>
<P>
   But they emerged on Saturday from the fog of their own failure
with an electric 13-8 comeback victory over the Detroit Tigers
before 40,029 on a rainy afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had 18 hits and delivered four home runs, including
three-run drives by Derek Jeter in the sixth inning and David
Justice in the eighth, his second homer of the game and 40th of the
season, tying his career high.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez broke his 0-for-28 hitless streak in the third
inning, following back-to-back home runs with a single. Scott
Brosius, who had two hits in his previous 20 at-bats, had two
singles and scored two runs on Saturday. And Paul O'Neill, who had
four strikeouts Friday, singled in two runs in the fourth inning,
reaching the 100 runs batted in mark for the fourth straight
season.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Clemens struggled, giving up seven runs, six of them
in the fifth inning. Jeff Nelson allowed a single that led to
Detroit's eighth run in the seventh, but got the victory. Mariano
Rivera retired the side in the eighth inning and pitched the ninth
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson began the seventh by giving up a single to Juan
Encarnacion with the Yankees ahead, 9-7. The left-hander Mike
Stanton came in and gave up a broken-bat single to Bobby Higginson,
whose pop-up landed over Jeter's shoulder in short left field.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton struck out Billy McMillon, who had deflated the Yankees
with a grand slam in his previous at-bat. But with two men on,
Deivi Cruz hit a ball sharply to Jeter and it skimmed off the top
of his glove, allowing Encarnacion to score to shave the Yankees'
lead to 9-8. But that was as close as the Tigers would get.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees down by 7-5 in the sixth inning, Luis Sojo
singled off the reliever Willie Blair. Brosius followed with
another single and then Chuck Knoblauch singled to score Sojo.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter then hit a three-run home run to right field that put the
Yankees ahead, 9-7, and saved Roger Clemens from his second
straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who only 10 days ago was penciled in as the No. 1
starter in the division series, stumbled after he took a 5-1 lead
into the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But his difficulties began in the third inning when he gave up a
leadoff home run to Damion Easley. The next batter, Brad Ausmus,
lined a pitch back to Clemens, hitting him in the leg. Clemens
threw to first in time, but the trainer Gene Monahan came out to
look at the pitcher. He retired the next two batters to get out of
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Clemens plunked McMillon, the designated
hitter, on the foot with two outs, but got Cruz to ground back to
him.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth inning degenerated into a debacle reminiscent of Denny
Neagle's fifth-inning unraveling Friday night. Clemens gave up a
leadoff single to Hal Morris, then walked Easley. Ausmus doubled to
the wall in center field, scoring Morris. Again, Clemens struggled
with his control, trying to pitch inside on Jose Macias and hitting
him instead, and then walking Encarnacion, which brought in another
run, making it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens struck out Bobby Higginson and got Dean Palmer to pop-up
to shortstop. Mike Stanton was warming up in the bullpen, but Torre
kept Clemens in. McMillon, the designated hitter, battled Clemens
to a 2-2 count, then blistered the next pitch to the upper deck in
right field for a grand slam and Yankee Stadium fell into a stunned
silence as the Tigers took a 7-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth major league homer for McMillion, the Tigers'
minor league player of the year, who was called up July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had opened the scoring in the second inning when the
leadoff batter David Justice blasted his 39th home run of the
season, giving the Yankees their first lead in six games. Jorge
Posada followed, hitting his 27th home run to right field, his
first homer since the Yankees' last victory, on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the next batter and the emblem for that frustration,
broke out of his slump by singling to right. In the fourth inning,
the Yankees added to their lead with a rally.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez led off and flied out to deep right, Luis Sojo
reached base on a bloop single. Then Brosius laced a single to
left. Knoblauch fouled out, but Jeter cracked a single that scored
Sojo.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill then got his first hit in seven at-bats, singling in
Brosius and Jeter. That also knocked out Mlicki with the Yankees
holding a 5-1 lead. &QL;

skyrocketing number of cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Although the government is
starting to recognize the seriousness of the problem, few believe
it will be brought under control anytime soon. With an ever-more
mobile population, a dismal level of sex education for young people
who are becoming increasingly sexually active and a sex industry
that is almost institutionalized, government efforts to limit the
spread of STDs seem like a drop in the bucket. (Chao, Cox News

 &HT;    Child caught in middle of affluent parents court battle
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ask to see Case No. 95-7096, and
courthouse clerks roll their eyes and shake their heads. They don't
have to look it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohhh,'' they groan. ``Keitel. You want the whole thing?''
</P>
<P>
   That would be 10 boxes of files, 40 volumes and growing, a giant
hairball of a divorce and custody battle that demonstrates how one
case with the right ingredients _ money, legal savvy and an endless
supply of animosity _ can choke a court system.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, it escalated into a no-holds-barred brawl,
with the ex-husband _ Palm Beach lawyer and real estate investor
Frederick J. ``Rick'' Keitel III _ accusing Circuit Judge Mary Lupo
of negligence, incompetence, prejudice and unethical conduct, and
Lupo _ the latest of eight judges saddled with the case _ giving
him a verbal horsewhipping and threatening to ban him from the
courtroom unless he gets another lawyer to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court is obliged to try to protect Mr. Keitel from having
a 'fool for a client' by continued self-representation,'' Lupo
wrote in a scathing Sept. 8 order.
</P>
<P>
   ``(T)his judge is so prejudicial, angry and hateful towards
(Keitel) that he has no chance of getting a fair and impartial
hearing,'' Keitel fired back. Last week, he moved that Lupo take
herself off the case and transfer it out of Palm Beach County or he
would ask the 4th District Court of Appeal to remove her.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel v. Keitel has amassed more than 2,100 docket entries,
spawned at least 10 appeals, spun off a handful of other suits and
been through two hearing officers and eight Circuit Court judges _
six who recused themselves and one whom Keitel accused of bias
before he was even appointed to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel, 48, owns office buildings in Palm Beach and once put
together a deal to buy 27 Wendy's restaurants in South Florida. The
venture fell through in 1992, and the resulting legal tangle is
also still in court.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel and Diane de LaBegassiere, 44, both tall and attractive,
met at a party in Palm Beach and married in 1992. She had the
social pedigree: fourth generation oil royalty, descendant of the
founders of both Texaco and Exxon, French upbringing, net worth
more than $20 million. Possibly a lot more, since the financial
disclosures were filed before the stock market boom.
</P>
<P>
   Her ex-husband, who listed his own income at $500,000 a year,
grew up in a middle-class home in New Jersey where his father owned
a motel, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The two have been at war over their 5-year-old son, Sebastian,
since before he was born. Keitel left his wife when she was
pregnant, he said in court documents, because she continued to
smoke and drink during the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The court record is not flattering to either of the parents, who
have splattered each other with the sort of allegations that are
practically de rigueur in Palm Beach divorces: alcoholism,
psychotic behavior, marijuana and cocaine abuse, party sex,
three-way sex, same-sex sex, kidnapping _ even child abuse, though
no judge has believed it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychological reports and custody evaluations in the record say
that both parents, despite their ``selfish vendettas,'' appear to
love the child they use as a weapon against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Both are battling for sole custody of Sebastian, who lives with
his mother in New York and is enrolled in the French American
School in Larchmont. Keitel claims he spends $150,000 to $200,000 a
year in travel and living expenses to exercise his weekly
visitation, because De LaBegassiere moved to New York in violation
of court orders.
</P>
<P>
   The visitations have routinely turned into angry encounters
between the parents, according to the court record, leading to
allegations of kidnapping, assault and obstruction and involving
police on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Keitel case has consumed more time, paperwork, lawyers and
judges than even the most notorious disunions played out in Palm
Beach County Circuit Court. Roxanne and publishing heir Herbert
Pulitzer required only 835 docket filings to split the sheets in
1982, and Ruth and auto mogul Roger Dean's notably nasty 1992
breakup ended with No. 1,635.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel and De LeBegassiere both declined to comment on the
record for this story. But in court documents, each side blames the
other for the size and ferocity of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel contends he has to keep filing motions for contempt _
more than 30 are outstanding _ because his ex-wife continually
ignores orders to share Sebastian's medical and school records,
thwarts his visitation and tries to get it reduced, and that judges
won't do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   De LaBegassiere claims Keitel harasses her with multiple daily
telephone calls, interferes with Sebastian's schooling and medical
needs, is obsessed with tape-recording the child's conversations
and makes false statements about her, including that she is a
continuing alcohol abuser.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel has had eight lawyers, including his brother, represent
him off and on since the case began. He sued his original attorney,
Robert Shalhoub, alleging he was in cahoots with his ex-wife's
lawyers and a previous judge on the case. But he has been his own
client much of the time, and in that role has clashed with a long
line of judges over his legal maneuvers and courtroom behavior.
</P>
<P>
   De LaBegassiere has spent more than $1 million on legal fees and
costs, in the estimation of West Palm Beach attorney Joel Weissman,
who represents her along with his partner, Doreen Yaffa, and
Melinda Gamot. She also has hired lawyers in New York, plus several
therapists for Sebastian, including Dr. Paulina Kernberg, the
Cornell University psychiatrist retained by the federal government
to evaluate Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings and motions are laced with vitriolic exchanges between
the pugnacious Weissman and Keitel, who has accused his ex-wife's
lawyers repeatedly of lying, concealing records, conspiring to get
friendly judges assigned to the case and having hearings without
properly notifying him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it has reached that point,'' Weissman said. ``It has
degenerated to where he has to put the focus on somebody else, and
. . . I have never been one to sit idly by or not speak my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have filed grievances against each other with the
Florida Bar. Keitel's motion to remove Lupo says the bar complaint
against him contains 33 allegations, and that he has filed a
459-count complaint against Weissman, Gamot and Yaffa. A Bar
spokesman said the complaints are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel declined to say whether he has complained about any of
the judges, including Lupo, to the Judicial Qualifications
Commission. A JQC spokeswoman said she couldn't confirm or deny
complaints unless they result in formal charges, and no charges had
been filed as of last week.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has taken aim at various judges _ sometimes the same
one. Trial Judge Kathleen Kroll stepped down after De
LaBegassiere's lawyers complained that she was biased against the
heiress because of her wealth, though Keitel later complained that
the judge was biased against him.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Roger Colton, who ordered De LaBegassiere to move back to
Palm Beach County, also recused himself after a bias complaint that
Keitel alleged was orchestrated by her lawyers, but signed by her
because they didn't want their names on it.
</P>
<P>
   Keitel accused Kroll and Judge Stephen Rapp of ``criminal,
illegal and unethical behavior'' because of actions and inactions
of theirs that he felt were detrimental to him and asked the state
attorney and chief judge to investigate. Neither office pursued the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   He alleged his ex-wife's attorneys persuaded her to hire a
lawyer from Judge Thomas Barkdull's former law firm, to create a
conflict of interest so he could be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The last judge to throw in the towel was Gary Vonhof, who took
himself off the case last December after nearly two years. Vonhof
said in his recusal order that he had stayed on because he felt one
judge should hear the case for a reasonable length of time to
protect the interests of Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' the order said, ``because of the personalities of
the parties, the motions for contempt and petitions for
modification and the endless acrimonious hearings have not ended.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the last things Vonhof dealt with was Keitel's allegation
that his ex-wife was sexually abusing Sebastian by dressing him in
girls' clothing and allowing him to sleep in her bed, both of which
the mother denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was simply nothing presented to the court that even
remotely resembled proof of any sexual abuse,'' the judge said in
denying Keitel's request for custody.
</P>
<P>
   Vonhof directed the court clerk to reassign the case to some
other family division judge _ except for those who'd already
stepped down or been subpoenaed by Keitel as witnesses, like Judge
Timothy McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   So the case landed with Lupo, long noted for a sharp tongue and
short patience with litigants or lawyers she perceives as
unreasonable or wasting the court's time.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 31 order, Lupo lashed Keitel for ``persistent filing
of frivolous, immaterial, irrelevant, impertinent, scandalous and
repetitive motions and pleadings.'' She said he consistently
disrupted the court with ``endless rambling arguments, by his
outbursts, and by other activity which is clearly designed to
impede and obstruct the administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   That order has become an exhibit in the Bar investigation of him
and means Lupo will be a witness against him, Keitel said in his
removal motion. Five other judges _ Vonhof, Kroll, Rapp, Colton and
McCarthy _ have been interviewed by the Bar in conjunction with his
complaint against his ex-wife's lawyers, according to Keitel's
motion.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief scheduling hearing on Thursday, Lupo gave no
indication she intends to recuse herself. She told Weissman, Gamot
and Palm Beach attorney T. Westray Battle, who said he was making a
``limited appearance'' for Keitel and trying to find him a
permanent lawyer, that she will try in October to set the custody
issues for trial by March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court should not be micromanaging this family or any
other,'' Lupo said. ``But it's better than bloodletting on the
streets . . . and these matters are obviously important to little
Sebastian.''
</P>
<P>
   Lupo cited a previous hearing in which she had worked through a
calendar by weeks, days and hours to divide up the child's time
with each parent for the summer. The session had the guarded and
painstaking tone of hostage negotiations, with each side referring
to the ``pickup,'' the ``dropoff'' and the ``exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian's life, according to court reports, consists of
nannies, school, French and drama lessons, double sets of clothes
and toys and rooms, Dunkin' Donuts _ his favorite snack _ and
constantly being handed back and forth across the borders of the
alien worlds of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sebastian seems to be a droll, fairly articulate
five-year-old,'' says a report by Toby Pilsner, a New York lawyer
engaged to do home studies for a custody evaluation. But the little
boy is ``very angry,'' Pilsner wrote, and ``knows much too much
about the situation from both parents because they cannot control
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is evident that both parents manipulate this situation to
play out their own unresolved battles with each other,'' the report
says. ``Sebastian clearly loves both his parents, who are tearing
him apart as they wage their war against each other, with the
heaviest casualty being the damage done to their son.''

 &HT;    Flightserv relied upon an ancestor company for launch
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Todd Bottorff was brought in to help pull
Flightserv.com out of its dive in late May, he faced some
Internet-sized challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta company's stock had dropped 90 percent from its
52-week high, after ranking as Georgia's best-performing stock last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A New York money manager had canceled the second half of a $10
million investment. Few business travelers were using Flightserv's
Web site, www.flightserv.com., which offers individual seats on
private jet flights between Atlanta and New York. And the company
was running out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   So over the next several weeks, Flightserv's new president and
chief operating officer cut the staff and marketing budget. Its
sporadic flights waned to nothing. Bottorff also plunged into
retooling Flightserv's business model and rounding up new investors
and business partners.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems and countermeasures are by now familiar to
managers of once high-flying Internet companies. But unlike with
most Internet firms, Bottorff had an extra set of challenges to
deal with. The reason: Flightserv is at least the fourth
incarnation of a so-called public shell corporation that has passed
through bankruptcy court three times.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Internet companies that sold shares in the past few
years through initial public offerings, Flightserv hadn't recently
been scrutinized by an investment banking firm, or filed lengthy
registration statements with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, before selling shares.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Flightserv is one of a growing number of small
companies that gained instant access to a stock exchange by buying
a public shell, usually a defunct company with shares listed on a
stock exchange but little in the way of assets or operations.
</P>
<P>
   With shells, ``people do not go through the IPO process. That
means that the discipline has to come from the management and the
shareholders,'' says Bottorff.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's post Internet-boom market, he adds, ``I think
that any investor that is putting money in the Internet right now
has a high level of scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the collapse in Internet shares, Flightserv has
completed a private stock placement totaling $2.6 million. Two
stock-swap acquisitions added a start-up air charter service with a
$9 million contract to fly passengers to Cancun, Mexico, and a call
center service with annual sales of $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bottorff was named interim chief executive officer after
Flightserv's former CEO, C. Beverly Lance, resigned in August from
his executive and director positions. Lance, the son of former
Carter administration budget chief Bert Lance, couldn't be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv needed new management that is ``significantly more
experienced in areas that are directly related to the success of
the model,'' says Bottorff. With his wife, he co-founded
HeliosHealth.com, an Atlanta firm that wires doctors' offices to
provide online information to patients. His wife still runs the
company.
</P>
<P>
   With the changes that have been made, Flightserv now has a
``very compelling model'' in place, says Bottorff. ``This strategy
lowers the risk while keeping the upside'' of Flightserv's nascent
Internet flight booking service alive, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger changes are coming to Flightserv in about three weeks,
but Bottorff won't elaborate. ``The story's going to change
dramatically,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Change, it turns out, is one thing Flightserv's ancestor company
has gone though quite a bit of itself.
</P>
<P>
   The shell company's former lives include a Maryland drug testing
company, Keystone Medical Corp., that went bankrupt around 1988,
according to a former executive, Joel Holt. The company passed
through bankruptcy court in Tulsa, Okla., twice more in 1992 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
   A Tallahassee real estate developer bought the shell company
next. But after a failed attempt to take over a developer of an
Atlanta-area golf course community, the shell was once again sold
at the end of 1998 to Flightserv's founders.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, many investors' holdings were wiped out or reduced
to penny-stock levels before the next round of new owners took
over.
</P>
<P>
   Isser Elishis, whose New York firm pulled the plug on its
Flightserv stake, says this is the first and probably the last time
his company will invest in a company that used a public shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just chalk it up to Murphy's Law that what can go wrong will
go wrong,'' says Elishis, senior portfolio manager for Acqua
Wellington Asset Management. He says the company's $5 million
investment in Flightserv is currently worthless because its
unregistered Flightserv shares can't be sold on a stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the shares were registered, Acqua Wellington's stake
would currently be worth about $1 million at Friday's closing price
of $1.25 on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one just didn't work for us,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Sam Brown, a retired construction company
owner from Newnan, says he had likewise written off his Flightserv
investment of just under $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But he has now bought more shares, he says, since Bottorff
announced several recent changes in Flightserv's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic,'' he says. ``If they will go ahead
and execute now, I think they've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street to Main Street, Elishis, Brown and other
Flightserv investors have plenty of company in their experience
with shell companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, so-called reverse mergers combining a
shell company with a new owner made a big comeback as entrepreneurs
rushed to cash in on the Internet mania. The volume of announced
reverse mergers more than quadrupled in 1998 to $86.8 billion from
about $18.6 billion the previous year, according to Thompson
Financial Securities Data. Reverse mergers fell slightly in 1999,
to $62 billion, and are down to about $8 billion so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate reasons to use publicly traded shell
companies, including raising capital more cheaply and passing a
company on to employees or heirs, says Eric Stevenson, president of
Axiom Capital, a Phoenix consulting firm that advises clients on
reverse mergers. Ted Turner launched Turner Broadcasting System
that way, and shells were used by Occidental Petroleum and
Blockbuster Video, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But there are inherent risks. First, says Stevenson, there's the
risk of hidden liabilities that surfaces after the new owners
arrive. ``What you're really doing is taking over someone else's
failure. There's liabilities with that. Buyer beware,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he says, ``the people that sell shells these days are
into it to profit off your story. ... They're looking for something
that's exciting and easily explained.''
</P>
<P>
   And shell companies are ``the typical type of vehicle those
people have used,'' for a stock manipulation scheme known as a
``pump and dump,'' he says, often without the knowledge of the
entrepreneurs who bought the shell company. To drive up the stock's
price, unscrupulous stock promoters artificially pump up the
trading volume by selling shares back and forth. At the same time,
they hype the stock through a combination of press releases and
e-mails to Internet stock chat rooms. After they sell the stock to
investors at a big profit, the stock price plunges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that (shell companies are) bad things,'' says
Stevenson. ''It's more that they're used badly. They're a license
to print money, and there's a responsibility with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottorff says he's seen no signs that Flightserv's stock was
caught up in a pump-and-dump manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the skyrocket trajectory of Flightserv's stock during
the past year mirrored that of many similar companies caught up in
the feeding frenzy for Internet stocks, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you look at the charts of Internet companies
over the past six months, many of them look the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `A STORY STOCK'
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv evolved from the public shell bought by Arthur
``Buddy'' Weiss and C. Beverly Lance. When Weiss and Lance acquired
Proactive Technologies last year, its shares traded well below $1,
and daily volumes were usually in the thousands or tens of
thousands of shares.
</P>
<P>
   But daily trading volume began topping 100,000 shares within a
few months of the acquisition, and Proactive Technologies' stock
started slowly climbing.
</P>
<P>
   By October last year, after Proactive Technologies had announced
that it was in the Internet aviation services business, had changed
its name to ``flightserv.com'' and had hired the first of four
former Delta Air Line executives, daily volume swelled sometimes to
700,000 shares. The stock price approached $6.
</P>
<P>
   It would nearly double that price during the next two months. By
the end of 1999, Flightserv was the top-performing stock in
Georgia, up 3,450 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened is, in the Internet chat rooms, this
became a story stock,'' says Ben Branch, a University of
Massachusetts finance professor and former director of the shell
company. ``I never understood at that point what they were going to
do in aviation service.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hundreds of messages about Flightserv were being posted
on Silicon Investor, Raging Bull and other popular Internet stock
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stock will go up, it has risen 150% in the last month. .
. . When the web sight gets going, Flight Serve will fly!''
declared ``aaabond'' on Raging Bull's site on July 15 of last year,
when the stock traded at $2.75. The investor posted several more
bullish messages on the site until Oct. 12, when Flightserv's stock
closed at $7.44, before dropping from the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Silicon Investor, a handful of investors were selling
Flightserv's stock short, or selling borrowed shares in hopes of
profiting from a later price decline. They suspected that
Flightserv's stock, whose stock ticker symbol is FSW, was being
manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``FSW getting pumped again today by (another Web site),'' wrote
``Harpo'' in a Dec. 7 message to another trader. ``Could be in
shortable territory again. What do you think? The last quarterly
filing is, um, interesting to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv's stock peaked at $12 on March 9, the same day it
answered Branch's and other investors' questions by activating its
Web site and announcing it would sell seats on private jets to
business travelers between Atlanta and New York. The company, which
by then had a market value of $397 million but little revenue, said
it expected to have 100 routes by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume topped more than 1 million shares that day.
</P>
<P>
   But the party was drawing to a close for Flightserv's investors,
as it would for many other investors in Internet stocks. By the end
of April, Flightserv shares were back to $2.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coggin, a former Delta executive vice president who was
the first Delta alumnus Flightserv hired, has since left his job as
senior strategic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   He had recommended that the company use a combination of direct
mail, direct sales and advertising in The Wall Street Journal and
other national publications ``to reach out to the business
traveler.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never got around to implementing the marketing strategy
that we recommended,'' he says, but ``I don't understand why
(Flightserv) hasn't been more successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottorff says the other three former Delta executives have since
departed as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, the guys from Delta were frustrated by the
delays in implementing the company strategy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some uncertainty about what the company wanted to be
when it grew up. The company needed a very detailed, thoughtful
strategy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Acqua Wellington, concerned about its investment, was
balking at forking over its second $5 million installment.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Flightserv hit its downdraft last spring with many
other tech stocks, Branch, the former Proactive Technologies
director and shareholder, had already sold off his Flightserv
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me that if (Flightserv's business plan) was such
a great idea, it would have been done long ago,'' he says. Plus,
the company only had ``maybe $4 million in hard assets, maybe,'' he
adds, compared to a market value of almost $400 million at its
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said to me, get out of your stock, which I did. I just
didn't see that the value was there for the company,'' he says. ``I
made money. I was lucky.''

 &HT;    Shell company has taken different shapes
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before it became Flightserv.com, the shell company
that launched the Atlanta dot-com had at least two previous
reincarnations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had started as a Maryland drug-testing firm
in the 1980s, had already gone through bankruptcy twice by the time
Tulsa, Okla., entrepreneur Bill Davis bought the shell in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stock of the shell company, then called Keystone Medical,
doubled to $10 in a few months after Davis announced a new company
name and business direction.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he did a reverse merger of his start-up business
software firm into the defunct drug testing company's shell, once
again stripped of its liabilities and most of its assets in
bankruptcy court, as a way to quickly list his company on a stock
exchange. He wanted to raise capital at a time when initial public
offerings were getting a cold reception, he says. He renamed the
merged company Proactive Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock had dropped to about $1 by the time the shell
landed again in bankruptcy nine months later. The company' gyrating
stock price drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, says Davis. No formal action was taken in the case,
according to an SEC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got an education in shells,'' says Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In bankruptcy court, he accused three individuals, who had
retained a stake in his company after selling the shell, of fraud
and conflict of interest. They countersued. The parties eventually
settled and split the software and drug-testing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a Tallahassee real estate developer, Mark A. Conner,
bought Proactive Technologies' shell company out of bankruptcy
court in 1996. In the two years following the reverse merger, he
rapidly expanded his small real estate empire, reaching as far as
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Florida developer tried unsuccessfully to take over
Killearn Properties Inc., a publicly traded Georgia developer of a
golf course community in Henry County. Struggling under debt after
the failed attempt, Conner quickly sold off assets _ including
Proactive Technologies' public company status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about that time that Buddy Weiss and Beverly Lance came
on the scene,'' recalls Ben Branch, a University of Massachusetts
finance professor who served on Conner's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur ``Buddy'' Weiss and Lance combined a couple of Atlanta
shopping centers and a start-up company called Stratos Inns with
Proactive. Weiss and Lance became chairman and CEO, respectively,
of Proactive Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Branch, whose investment in Proactive Technologies was
underwater by hundreds of thousands of dollars by then, says he
gladly departed the board in February 1999, when he and another
director were replaced by Lance and a Nashville investment manager.
</P>
<P>
   Branch was also glad to see that his Proactive Technology
shares, once worth as little as a quarter a share, started taking
off within a few months. A little over a year later, the company's
shares would briefly reach $12 _ a 4,700 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners first sold Conner's surviving real estate units
back to the developer and cleaned up some unforeseen liabilities.
Weiss told the Tallahassee Democrat those surprises included a
$105,265 lien from the IRS for unpaid payroll taxes and $90,000 in
unpaid interest on a $2.1 million loan that Proactive Technologies
had defaulted on without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Weiss said the idea for the private jet
service was conceived after he and Lance acquired Proactive
Technologies as a real estate business.

 &HT;    Warner-led offense is a defense's nightmare
 &HT;    By Ken Sugiura
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To sleep, perchance to dream.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Brown only wishes. Not this week, not with Kurt Warner and
his passing chaos coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been sleeping,'' said Brown, coach of the Falcons'
defensive backs. ``I have not slept a wink, and neither has our
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Every fan is familiar now with Warner, the conductor of the
high-speed train that will come blowing through the Georgia Dome
this afternoon. Unwanted out of college, he kicked around the Arena
Football League and NFL Europe before an injury to another player
made him the Rams starting quarterback. Then he became just the
second player in league history to throw 40 touchdown passes in a
season, and he led St. Louis to perhaps the most improbable Super
Bowl season in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Rams offense looks even better. The Rams have
scored a league-high 119 points. Their NFL-record streak of most
games in a row with 30 or morepoints has run to nine. Running back
Marshall Faulk is on pace to surpass his NFL record for yards from
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, to be honest with you, if I've ever seen a
better offense than this one,'' Fox NFL analyst John Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   And Warner, who went from stocking shelves in a supermarket to
throwing touchdowns in the Super Bowl, is hot. He threw for 441
yards against Denver in the first game and has gone over 300 yards
in all three games. He leads or is close to the lead in every major
statistical category.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might have thought him a fluke last year. Not too
many think that way now. Those around him say he's more confident
and has a better grasp of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so on top of the stuff that, whatever you put in or
insert that week, he understands immediately what you're trying to
do,'' Rams coach Mike Martz said. ``Absolutely, he's better than he
was a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, the Falcons and every other team tried to
dissect the Rams attack and find a way to slow it down. No one has
succeeded yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are doing the same thing as last year _ spreading fast
wide receivers all over the field and creating mismatches. Except
they are doing it even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it to you this way,'' Brown said. ``When the Rams
are on offense, it looks like you let a bunch of greyhounds on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   With copious help from blazing wide receivers Isaac Bruce, Torry
Holt and Az-Zahir Hakim and running back Marshall Faulk, Warner is
on pace to take a swipe at many of the single-season passing
records. He is on track to break Dan Marino's record for yards
(record _ 5,084, pace _ 6,512), Warren Moon's mark for completions
(404, 442) and Ken Anderson's record for completion percentage
(70.55, 71.55). If he throws for 300 yards in the next three games
_ against the Falcons, the Chargers and then the Falcons again _ he
will tie Steve Young for most consecutive 300-yard games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams defense, ironically, gets more credit than it wants.
Last year, the defense was sixth in the league and held up the
offense's leads. In 11 of the Rams' 13 wins, they held at least a
10-point lead at halftime. As a result, the offense could cool down
after the half. Warner threw only 12 of his 41 touchdowns in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense has been so poor this season, next to last, that
the team has needed Warner's heroics all game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's a different thing this year, where they're
so desperate, they have to throw,'' said Hall of Fame quarterback
and ABC analyst Dan Fouts. ``Which is not a bad deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner and his pals are ready for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just kind of the standard that we've set,'' he said.
``We don't have any problem living up to that.''

BUSH AIMS DIRECTLY AT GORE ON CHARACTER AND ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ At the end of a campaign swing that was intended
to focus on issues, Gov. George W. Bush stepped up his personal
criticisms of Vice President Al Gore on Saturday, accusing him of
``misleading Americans'' through a ``pattern of embellishments and
sudden reversals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush assailed Gore in a speech he delivered by satellite to the
state committee of the Pennsylvania Republican Party. He cited a
series of incidents involving the Gore campaign last week that he
said provided telling insights into the vice president's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has unfortunately spent the week misleading
Americans,'' Bush said. ``His misrepresentations are serious
business _ not the legitimate debate of political disagreements.
They are a disturbing pattern of embellishments and sudden
reversals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took aim again at President Clinton's decision to
release oil from the nation's emergency reserves, portraying the
move as political opportunism. The reserve, Bush said, ``was
created for America's national security, not for the vice
president's political security.'' Gore had called for the reserve
to be tapped just a day before Clinton acted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seized on Gore's assertion at a news conference that he had
been involved in discussions about the strategic oil reserve in the
days since it was first established.
</P>
<P>
   ``He claimed he was involved in the very invention of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve,'' Bush said. ``The problem is the
reserve was first established in 1975, two years before Al Gore
even went to the United States Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Bush tied together a week's worth of examples to
ridicule Gore. He brought up matters as varied as Gore's attendance
at a Hollywood fund-raiser, at which the vice president muted his
previous criticism of the entertainment industry, to his quip to a
union group that ``Look for the Union Label'' had been one of his
childhood lullabies. The song was not written until years after
Gore's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made a similar mistake earlier in the campaign when he
named as one of his favorite childhood books one that had not been
written until he was a student at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded to Bush through his own campaign telephone call
to a union representing electrical workers. ``The other side said
they wanted to talk about the issues, but that didn't seem to last
very long,'' Gore said to the group, which was meeting in
Cleveland. ``With our whole future at stake this is no time for
personal attacks, which is why I'll never make any.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of Gore's, Douglas Hattaway, immediately pointed to the
ties that Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, have both had to
the oil industry. ``The Texas oil ticket is on the defensive
because they've been making excuses for the oil industry while Al
Gore is fighting to cut oil prices,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway stood by Gore's assertion that he had been involved in
discussions about the oil reserve since its first days. He said
that while it was authorized by law in 1975, the reserve was in its
early days of creation in 1977, when Gore was serving on a House
subcommittee on energy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has called for more domestic oil exploration, sought
on Saturday to turn the focus to the country's increased dependence
on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about big foreign oil. I'm worried that under the
vice president's policies America is more dependent on foreign oil,
and domestic production is at its lowest level in almost 50 years _
since 1954.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also responded sharply to an Associated Press
report that law enforcement officials were investigating whether it
had been a Bush official who mailed materials about Bush's debate
preparations to an associate of Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush' communications director, said that Bush's
campaign manager, Joseph Allbaugh, was calling the Federal Bureau
of Investigation to complain. ``If they have identified a suspect,
Gov. Bush would like to know,'' Hughes said.``It is completely
inappropriate and wrong for the Justice Department to play politics
by leaking information in the midst of a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was called in when a Gore adviser, Tom Downey, a former
member of Congress, alerted law enforcement officials that he had
been sent the package of materials anonymously. Downey, who had
been helping Gore in debate preparations, recused himself from
further sessions.

NOTEBOOK: A MESSAGE FROM THE NRA, BY WAY OF THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Va., Md., Pa., Mich.)  By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listeners to the Washington Redskins' radio broadcasts this
season on the flagship station WJFK-FM have heard a former Redskins
great, defensive lineman Dave Butz, speaking on behalf of the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are the members of the NRA?'' Butz asks in one of the
advertising spots. ``We come from all walks of life _ we're police
officers, engineers, members of the armed forces _ even ex-football
players like me. In fact, we're as diverse as America itself. But
we all share a belief in the right of responsible gun ownership.
That's why I'm proud to be a member of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Some National Football League owners, general managers and other
officials are angered that the NRA is advertising on three teams'
radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   That bothers the league officials because the NFL has had
serious public-relations disasters with the high-profile arrests of
some players, including Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panther,
who has been charged with first-degree murder for allegedly
masterminding the shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   According to its spokesman, the rifle association launched a
radio advertising campaign with three high-profile teams _ the
Redskins, the Detroit Lions and the Philadelphia Eagles _ to use
the popularity of professional football to help expand its
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA is about a lot of things, such as gun safety,
conservation and police firearm training,'' said Bill Powers, an
NRA spokesman. ``We want people to know that, and we think the NFL
can help us spread our message. The NFL and the NRA is a natural
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   With the league attempting to deal with a rash of player
violence off the field, league officials ask whether it is
appropriate for teams to associate themselves with the rifle
association.
</P>
<P>
   Though the league cannot prevent players from legally purchasing
firearms, many teams privately tell players that firearms are more
trouble than they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Six team officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because
they said they feared upsetting the rifle association, agreed it
was irresponsible to allow the NRA to associate itself with
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said the rifle association's radio campaign uses the
voices of former players like Bill Bergey, who played linebacker
for the Eagles from 1974 to 1980, and Lem Barney, a defensive back
with the Lions from 1967 to 1977. According to Powers, the Redskins
first approached the association about doing the advertisement, and
the association agreed. Then, he said, the NRA expanded the spots
to Philadelphia and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The radio stations pay rights fees to the individual teams so
they can broadcast the games. Then the station seeks advertisers to
offset those and other fees.
</P>
<P>
   So while the teams and the rifle association do not deal with
each other directly, the relationship between teams, advertisers
and the stations is symbiotic; there is more than enough of a link
to make some in the league extremely uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit games are broadcast on WXYT-AM with an audience of
600,000 to one million, according to Bill Keenist, the Lions' vice
president of communications, broadcasting and news media. Keenist
said the Lions did not allow the station to take advertisements
from casinos or exotic dance clubs.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Lions did not see a problem with allowing
advertisements from the rifle association and had not received any
complaints from fans, other teams or the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had no comment, and the Redskins did not return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The league cannot prevent its teams from having the NRA as a
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said his organization would most likely purchase radio
advertisements in other NFL cities and expand into other sports,
such as baseball and Nascar, under an umbrella called NRA Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that teams realize this association is terrible for
our sport, and back away,'' one National Football Conference team
general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER BOWL FOR NEW YORK?
</P>
<P>
   If a proposed indoor-outdoor domed arena in Manhattan is
completed, it could guarantee New York City its first Super Bowl,
according to several NFL team owners.
</P>
<P>
   There have been discussions among league officials, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and representatives of Gov. George Pataki about
having a Super Bowl in New York on a rotating basis, two owners
said. That means the title game could be in Manhattan several times
a decade, the owners believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little question that New York would get the Super
Bowl if this arena was built,'' said Art Modell, the Baltimore
Ravens' owner. ``I can't see any way there would not be enough
votes to get it. It would pretty much be a definite.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said last week that plans for a domed arena were moving
forward. The arena could be used by the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
and Olympic events, as well as for concerts and conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wood Johnson IV, the Jets' owner, has been a proponent of
his team's own stadium, since the Jets have always been temporary
tenants in Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that Johnson strongly supports the Manhattan
stadium project and would move the Jets' games there.
</P>
<P>
   Modell said he recently spoke to Johnson at a Ravens game, and
Johnson told him he would do everything possible to get the Jets
their own stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems pretty determined,'' Modell said.
</P>
<P>
   BAILEY AT WIDE RECEIVER
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Redskins to use defensive back Champ Bailey more as
a wide receiver in tonight's game against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are desperate for a deep threat because of the
absence of wide receiver Michael Westbrook, who is lost for the
year with a torn knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey could be their man. In his last season at Georgia, Bailey
played defensive back and wide receiver. He caught 47 passes for
744 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night against Dallas, Bailey was used on four
offensive plays, drawing a double team on one pass pattern and a
pass-interference penalty on another.  &QL;

 &HT;    Announcer is Braves' `professor' of telecasts
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Her name was Mrs. Balcolm. She taught social studies
at Charlotte Junior High in Rochester, N.Y., and her lesson plan
always included a career project. Her eighth-graders were to pick a
career that piqued their interest, research the profession and
write a report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put down, `baseball announcer,' '' Pete Van Wieren said. The
next morning that fall of 1957, Mrs. Balcolm summoned the
eighth-grader to class and said, ``That's very nice, but it's not
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Balcolm checked her handy list of professions and picked
one out for the young Van Wieren. ``Here,'' she said. ``Nobody has
picked optician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Mrs. Balcolm insisted. ``Take optician.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the young geek's eyeglasses. Who knows?
Nevertheless, Van Wieren did what he's always done. He dutifully
did his job. Learned all he could about the wonderful world of
opticians, then handed in his report. And just what did he learn?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only that I knew I didn't want to be an optician,'' Van Wieren
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Balcolm should see her young visionary now. Nearly five
decades later, he is celebrating his 25th season of broadcasting
Atlanta Braves baseball. The kid that Ernie Johnson helped hire,
then nicknamed ``The Professor,'' has become just that: one of the
most respected professionals in his profession, and as
knowledgeable a baseball historian as you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best play-by-play man in America,'' says Don Sutton, the
Hall of Fame pitcher and now Van Wieren's on-air partner. ``I watch
40 games a week. There are a lot of guys who can do a lot of
different things. But if you want to watch a ballgame, and be
entertained by a game, there's not a better guy in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy who wasn't a player, he has very good instincts for
what's about to happen, a very good feel for the game,'' said Joe
Simpson, the former outfielder-turned-Braves broadcaster. ``That
comes from loving the game and having a passion for something you
want to learn about as much as you can. And as good as he is in
decades later, he is celebrating his 25th season of broadcasting
Atlanta Braves baseball. The kid that Ernie Johnson helped hire,
then nicknamed ``The Professor,'' has become just that: one of the
most respected professionals in his profession, and as
knowledgeable a baseball historian as you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best play-by-play man in America,'' says Don Sutton, the
Hall of Fame pitcher and now Van Wieren's on-air partner. ``I watch
40 games a week. There are a lot of guys who can do a lot of
different things. But if you want to watch a ballgame, and be
entertained by a game, there's not a better guy in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy who wasn't a player, he has very good instincts for
what's about to happen, a very good feel for the game,'' said Joe
Simpson, the former outfielder-turned-Braves broadcaster. ``That
comes from loving the game and having a passion for something you
want to learn about as much as you can. And as good as he is in the
booth, as easy as he is to listen to, he's one of the nicest men
I've ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the s.o.b.,'' said Skip Caray, Van Wieren's
silver-anniversary broadcast partner. ``He's a hell of an
announcer. He should have been a network announcer full time. He
can do football, and has. Baseball, and has. Basketball, and has.
He has the perfect network style, and he's totally unflappable. If
a piece of equipment breaks down in the truck and you've got to
cover for that, he does it as well as anybody in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fan of the game, a baseball historian and very
knowledgeable about the game without overdoing it,'' pitcher Tom
Glavine said. ``He comes up with very interesting facts that are
pertinent to the game. It's not like he's getting this information
to show you he's smarter than you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, you hear announcers trying to be funny, or
trying to degrade players. Pete doesn't do any of that. He doesn't
get into criticizing players a lot, if at all. It's not his style.
But when he does, it means something.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant everything in May, when the Braves began a West Coast
trip in San Diego and the John Rocker Show first hit the road.
After Rocker had a Friday night confrontation with a photographer,
Van Wieren ripped the reliever on the air the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That coming from Pete, it means something,'' Glavine said.
``It was like, 'Hey, E.F. Hutton's talking. Let's listen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had to say something,'' Van Wieren said. ``It was a
very upsetting time on the club, and everybody was tiptoeing around
it. Maybe as a manager or player you couldn't say anything, but I
felt I could. I was disturbed we had the biggest story of the
baseball season so far _ the winning streak _ and you had to go to
page three in the paper to find out about it. The focus needed to
get back where it belonged: the performance on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where it's always been for Van Wieren. For him, the
playing's the thing. The preparation and professionalism, too.
There's no ``we'' in Pete. He never refers to the Braves as such,
even if he lives and dies with the club more than any of the other
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's out of respect for those in the audience who aren't a
fan of that club,'' Van Wieren said. ``You owe them that courtesy
and nonpartisanship. It's the fan's job to react and root, the
broadcaster's job to describe.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a job Van Wieren has done spectacularly well for more than
three decades, and with the care and philosophy he had since first
working Binghamton Triplets Eastern League games in upstate New
York in the late '60s. ``My philosophy's always been pretty much
the same,'' he said. ``I knew I wasn't coming in with a 20-year
career as a player. I didn't have a big name that people recognize.
So I always felt I had to do as accurate and honest a job as I
could do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Van Wieren called Triplets' games, he would stop by the
sports department at the Binghamton Evening Press on his way to the
ballpark to check ``Pete's peg.'' John Fox, the sports editor,
would leave box scores from the previous night's Eastern League
games. Van Wieren used them to update his personal stats on every
team and was prepared when each hit town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, there were only six teams in the league,'' he said.
Years later in Atlanta, long before there were personal computers,
Van Wieren kept a day book _ a daily statistical update _ on every
Braves player. ``I still feel what got me here was preparation and
being as thorough as I could,'' he said. ``And have fun with it. No
reason you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   No reason you couldn't be a broadcaster and not an optician.
Even if your father left your mother while you were still in the
womb. ``I never met my dad,'' Van Wieren said. ``Never knew what
happened to him 'til about five years ago. He died in 1974.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, his son had come a long way from Greece, the Rochester
suburb where he was raised in his maternal grandparents' house by
his mother, Ruth, grandparents Wilbur and Eunice Jardine, and an
extended family that loved baseball. An only child, Van Wieren had
three aunts and scads of cousins who all were crazy about the game.
</P>
<P>
   He saw his first Rochester Red Wings game by age 4 and by 8
never missed a game, either on radio, listening to Jack Buck call
games, or in the ballpark on weekends. Each summer, the entire
family took a road trip to see the Red Wings play in Toronto,
Montreal, Buffalo or Syracuse. There was an annual trip to
Cooperstown, to the Baseball Hall of Fame. And every day, all day
in Swansea Park, the kids played ball in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Pete loved baseball. Loved bowling, too, and would later host
the popular weekly king-of-the-hill ``Challenge Bowling'' TV show
each Sunday at noon in Binghamton. The extra $30 each week was well
worth it, even if it meant interviewing one champion who had no
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask him a question, and he'd give me an answer,'' Van
Wieren said. ``To this day, I have absolutely no idea what he
said.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped prepare Van Wieren for the wonders of live TV, though.
His passion for broadcasting never waned, though, not even when he
went to precisely the wrong upstate New York college for an
aspiring sportscaster. Instead of Syracuse, which spawned such
talents as Bob Costas and Marv Albert, Van Wieren went to Cornell.
There, he wrote sports for the campus Daily Sun and majored in
English and _ drumming.
</P>
<P>
   They called themselves The Hustlers, from the Paul Newman-Jackie
Gleason movie ``The Hustler.'' They were five fraternity brothers
from the Alpha Delta Phi house who played frat parties on weekends
and Wednesday gigs at the Closer Club in Ithaca. ``We all had
crewcuts and we all wore sunglasses,'' Van Wieren said. ``That was
our look.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, they opened for big acts passing through town, or even
accompanied them while students danced the ``Mashed Potatoes'' or
the ``Locomotion.'' Dion. Freddie Cannon. The guy who now provides
the soundtrack for Glavine and Greg Maddux once laid down the
backbeat for Chubby Checker, if not Bo Diddley. ``We opened for
him,'' Van Wieren said, ``but Bo brought his own band.''
</P>
<P>
   His future was in broadcasting, though, not percussion. At the
urging of a Braves scout named Harry Dorish, Van Wieren called a
Cornell baseball game one day when the play-by-play announcer was
late. Van Wieren felt comfortable, did well and got hooked.
</P>
<P>
   His first job after college was announcing high school football
in Warrenton, Va., home of the Fauquier Falcons. ``If you ever get
a job like that,'' he said, ``you'll learn how important
pronunciation is.''
</P>
<P>
   At WNBF in Binghamton in 1966, Van Wieren wondered why Triplets'
games weren't aired. Told that no one could sell air time, Van
Wieren did, with the help of the team's general manager, in
exchange for doing the play-by-play job himself. He began sending
out audition tapes, worked briefly in Toledo and got his first big
break in 1974 with the Class AAA Tidewater Tides in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   When Milo Hamilton was fired by the Braves after the 1975
season, Van Wieren applied for the job. Ernie Johnson and Wayne
Long, the Braves' vice president of marketing and broadcasting,
were very impressed with Van Wieren's tapes, even more with the
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to like his voice, and he was a very studious type
of guy,'' Johnson said. ``He had everything in order. Always
well-prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after Van Wieren was hired, the Braves were sold to Ted
Turner. That meant several years of outrageous ostrich races and
cow-chip-throwing contests involving announcers and owner. It also
meant more work for Van Wieren after Turner fired long-time
traveling secretary Donald Davidson and replaced him with the first
guy Turner saw walking down the hall _ Van Wieren.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, he doubled as a broadcaster and traveling
secretary, fretting over travel plans even while calling a game.
``The seventh or eighth inning, Pete would get paged and turn white
in the press box,'' Caray said. ``The bus was late, or the plane's
late, and he had to get up and leave: `Here's the windup and the
pitch, and here's Skip.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He had moments of even higher anxiety. Such as the West Coast
trip when Van Wieren forget to bring the $5,000 in meal money. He
also had to do the uneasy balancing act between being privy to
inside information about players and having to go on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times, I had to get players out of jail,'' he
said. ``And I couldn't say anything about it the next day. That was
hard to do.'' Finally, Van Wieren got the nerve to approach Turner
and ask out. ``And he said, `OK,' '' he recalled. ``I said, `Geez,
if I'd have known that, I'd have done it years ago.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If he would have known all that has ensued over the last
quarter-century, he never would have written that optician's report
years ago for Mrs. Balcolm. The 13-0 start in 1982, climaxed by
winning the NL West. The bad, bad years of the late '80s. The
wonder of worst to first in 1991, when the Braves boarded the team
charter from Pittsburgh to Minneapolis after winning the NLCS and
Van Wieren saw the National League championship trophy propped in a
first-row seat and told TBS producer Glenn Diamond, ``We're going
to the World Series!''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the world championship in '95, the heartbreak of
'96 and now another chance to put a World Series exclamation point
on a decade of unparalleled greatness. Through it all, Pete Van
Wieren, who turns 56 on Oct. 7, has been there. Has been himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not trying to be anybody else,'' he said. ``You can't copy
anybody else's style. That never works.''
</P>
<P>
   That's never been necessary.

meter final _ was the ultimate eye opener.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first chapter of ``Marion Jones Superwoman'' and it
brought the crowd of 110,000 to its feet cheering, screaming and
knowing very well it could be witnessing the coronation of one of
the great athletes to ever pass through the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is trying to do what no other woman has ever done. In a
marathon session that will tax the mind and the body, the
27-year-old American sprinter, long jumper _ and former NCAA
champion basketball player _ is trying to win five gold track and
field medals at a single Games. The great Jesse Owens and Carl
Lewis both managed four, but you'd have to go all the way back to
1924 to find Paavo Nurmi _ The Flying Fin _ who won five golds in
one Olympic track an field session.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was Jones' debut and after a fitful night of insomnia,
she proved that sleep may well be an over-rated commodity.
</P>
<P>
   She is not.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9 running machine _ a seemingly perfect specimen of
power, efficiency and grace _ turned the 100-meter final into Tiger
Woods winning the U.S. Open, Secretariat dominating the Belmont.
Enduring a chilly evening and a noticeable headwind, she still blew
away the field to win by almost three full strides. She finished in
10.75 seconds. Ekaterini Thanou of Greece was second at 11.12 and
Tanya Lawrence of Jamaica was third at 11.18.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' winning margin _ .37 seconds _ was the greatest in the
history of the women's Olympic 100 meters. Only one men's 100 final
has had a wider gap between gold and silver.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. teammate Maurice Greene would win the men's 100
meters in 9.87 seconds, it was obvious from the time Jones stepped
onto the track in her shiny silver shoes, she owned Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   As she was introduced to the crowd _ and the seven other women
in the race tensely waited the call to the starting blocks _ she
waved her arms to the adoring masses, flashed that megawatt smile
and then blew kisses to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Watching her on what had to be one of the most intense moments
of her life, you started to understand what makes her to special.
It's her grace under pressure. Later when someone asked her if _
like Carl Lewis once said _ it was a relief to get the first race
out of the way, she thought a moment and shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it like that at all, `` she said. ``I wouldn't
call it a relief. It's not a stressful time for me. It's a happy
time. I'm having a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 330-pound husband C.J. couldn't say the same. He stood near
the finish line and said he felt ``physically sick. I was so worked
up, all I did was scream and worry. I don't remember seeing much of
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what he missed:
</P>
<P>
   After giving herself a quick verbal pep talk and exhaling
mightily, Jones marched to the start and lowered herself into
position She wore small pearl earrings and a thin gold necklace
about her neck. After closing her eyes for a moment's meditation,
she awaited the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Enduring two false starts by other runners, she burst from the
blocks in a flush of muscle and adrenaline, her head down, her arms
quickly picking up their piston-like rhythm. Some 16 strides into
the mad dash, she finally looked up and eyed the ever-closing
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Olympic Games,'' she said. ``You don't save
anything. You don't leave a thing out there (on the track).''
</P>
<P>
   As she crossed the finish line, her arms flew open toward the
heavens, she let out a scream and then, in that endearing
little-girl manner, she gave a joyful hop. As she realized what had
happened, her hands were drawn to her heart, then her eyes which
began to leak tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of Olympic Games, seen how other runners cross
the line and start to cry,'' she said later, her eyes again
brimming with tears. ``I'd thought I'd be a cool cat and celebrate,
but then you cross the line and everything goes out the window. It
hits you that you now can be described as an Olympic champion. That
was really emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   When she spied her mother and brother along the rail, she ran
over to them and gave her mom a kiss. Someone handed her a Belize
flag in honor of her mom, who comes from the Central American
country. Soon Jones had an American flag too and she carried them
with her around the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, everything was just so overwhelming,'' she said.
``For 19 years I had been living and dreaming this and then it all
came down to one race. It turned out to be everything I'd dreamed
of...and so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   When the gold medal was finally draped around her neck, she held
it in her hand and studied it intensely as Thanou and Lawrence
joined her on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really wanted to inspect it,'' she said. ``I've seen
other athletes glance at it, but I really looked at it close. It
has no rough edges. It's very smooth. It was very glamorous
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded as if she had looked into that medal and seen her own
golden reflection.

 &HT;    A roo awakening

<P>
   SYDNEY _ Possibly it was an emu swing.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't tapping on the table, but I must have been shifting in
my chair. The waitress had come by to assure me. ``It will be ready
in one minute,'' she said. ``I didn't know where it was, so I had
to chase it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase it?
</P>
<P>
   Since the dish in question was a plate of kangaroo, I couldn't
help but smile. If I'd been quick enough, I might have said,
``Well, tell the kitchen to hop to it.'' Or: ``When I say roo it,
jump to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But no worries. This was turning into one of those magical
Sydney days. On a mission to check out the native flavors and
ingredients of Australia, I had traveled seven miles by ferry
across the harbor to get to this restaurant, a place called Red Gum
in the little town of Manly. And yet I was never bored. At the
ferry station, a chattery group of old Russian women resembled a
pile of hats and coats blown in by the wind from Moscow. And
because the Olympic regatta was under way, the boat had to dodge an
ensemble of dancing sails, making for a slow ride to Manly.
</P>
<P>
   I had eaten kangaroo once before, but this was superb _ rare,
tender and without a trace of the gaminess that some people find.
Sliced and piled high on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and
ensconced in a little puddle of quandong sauce (more on that in a
minute), it ranks among the best pieces of meat I've had in recent
memory. It was no roo awakening, but a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is like that. From lemon myrtle to quandong (the tart
peachlike fruit of the native sandalwood tree), from wattleseed to
emu, there's a palette of exotic flavors here that you won't find
anywhere else in the world. Paired with the region's wealth of
seafood, and the techniques and traditions of Sydney's Asian
population, it's a culinary arrival. Here, then, is quick survey of
foods that are unique to Australia:
</P>
<P>
   Lemon myrtle: An aromatic leaf from a luxurious rainforest tree,
it is suffused with the scent of lemon. It reminds me of Kaffir
lime leaves. You don't know whether to eat it, or polish your
furniture with it. Chef Raymond Kersh of Edna's Table uses lemon
myrtle to infuse olive oil, and puts it on the table with a basket
of bread, crushed black pepper, shards of salt and grindings of
akudjura (or bush tomato). I think they should put the fragrant
branches in the Olympians' bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   Akudjura (bush tomato): I only had it dried and crushed, as
above, but it was a wonderful combination of earth and smoke _ like
a very mild chili pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Emu: Would you believe emu carpaccio? Sliced thin like the
Italian classic, this klutzy big bird had been transformed into a
delicate-tasting nibble.
</P>
<P>
   The chef at Red Gum had barely seared it on the edges, then
plated the garnet ribbons in starfish pattern. The emu had a
faintly wild taste, like venison only very subtle, but the bulgur
wheat and tomato salad on the side washed it clean.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney rock oysters: They are small, with beautiful clawlike
shells. Served raw, need nothing more than a squeeze of lemon. Then
they become astringent, slightly zincy and sing out best with a
glass of crisp white wine. They are also being prepared all over
town in the Chinese style, steamed with ginger and long thin
strands of scallion. I could eat a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Quandong: This makes a beautiful ruby sauce and works well in
desserts. Kersh and his sister Jennice have opened a temporary
restaurant at the Olympics' Main Press Centre, where I tried a wild
lime tart topped with the fruit, which looks like bleached apricots
and has a slightly bittersweet taste. I liked the pungent little
limes even better.
</P>
<P>
   Crocodile: I'm still trying to find out the true flavor, but
served tempura style and rolled in a nori wrapper by the Edna's
Table folks, it was quite good. Nothing like the chewy, jerky
texture you'd expect.
</P>
<P>
   Vegemite: Made by Kraft since 1926, this weird vegetable spread
is Australia's answer to peanut butter. One wag wrote in the Sydney
Morning Herald the other day that the salty, foul-smelling black
stuff was originally made from brewery waste. He also advised that
you apply the thinnest possible layer to toast with lots of butter.
I tried it, sans butter, as I wrote this piece. Concentrated yeast
extract? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Vegemite nights. Give me days of wine and roos'es.

CARL ROWAN, WRITER AND CRUSADER, DIES AT 75 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Carl T. Rowan, the crusading journalist,
best-selling author and defender of affirmative action, died on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was 75 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan, who had been hospitalized for various illnesses in recent
weeks, died in the intensive care unit of Washington Hospital
Center, said LeRoy Tillman, a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Aug. 11, 1925, in Ravenscroft, Tenn., a dying
coal-mining town in the heart of Jim Crow country, Rowan grew up
poor during the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``Breaking Barriers,'' he wrote of living
with ``no electricity, no running water, no toothbrushes'' and ``no
telephone, no radio and no regular inflow of money.''
</P>
<P>
   He scrubbed porches in a tuberculosis hospital to earn money to
attend Tennessee State College in Nashville. There, he passed a
national competition and went on to become one of the first 15
African-Americans to be commissioned officers in the U.S. Navy
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, he said, changed his life because he was able to
use the GI Bill of Rights to get a college degree in mathematics
from Oberlin College in Ohio and a master's degree in journalism
from the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   His first job in journalism was as a copy editor at the
Minneapolis Tribune, and as a young reporter, he covered the civil
rights battles in the South, including the Supreme Court's decision
requiring school desegregation. At the time, he wrote in his
autobiography, ``no more than five blacks could claim to be general
assignment reporters, and few were writing anything serious about
the American social, political or economic scene.''
</P>
<P>
   His passionate reporting on race relations made him one of the
most highly visible and vocal black men in America and prompted
President John F. Kennedy to appoint him deputy assistant secretary
of state with the assignment to help integrate the State
Department. He was also a delegate to the United Nations during the
Cuban missile crisis, ambassador to Finland in the Kennedy
administration and director of the U.S. Information Agency in the
Johnson administration, which in 1964 made him the highest-ranked
black in American government.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan returned to journalism in Washington in 1965, making race
a prominent theme of his columns and television commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I see myself simply as a newspaperman and
commentator,'' Rowan once told an interviewer. ``I inform people
and expose them to a point of view they wouldn't get. I work
against the racial mind-set of most of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked to describe himself as ``an independent
non-Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after he learned about a local high school where black
students were embarrassed to stand as their names were called in an
honor roll ceremony, he created a scholarship program called
Project Excellence to encourage blacks to finish high school and go
on to college. Over the years, the program disbursed millions of
dollars in scholarships and teamed up with the Freedom Forum to
award additional ``instant scholarships'' worth millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Among his eight books are biographies of Jackie Robinson (``Wait
Till Next Year'') and Thurgood Marshall (``Dream Makers, Dream
Breakers'') and ``The Coming Race War in America,'' a book that was
praised when it was published in 1996 for its predictions about the
disastrous state of race relations in America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Rowan, in his columns a firm advocate of strict handgun
control, found himself in the center of a gun controversy when he
fired a shot using an unregistered pistol to wound a teen-age
intruder in his backyard. He was arrested and tried, but argued
that he had the right to use whatever means necessary to protect
himself and his family. The jury deadlocked and the judge declared
a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, his columns denouncing financial malfeasance on
the part of Benjamin Chavis, then national chairman of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, contributed to
Chavis' resignation and a change in leadership at the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan's column, published three times a week, was nationally
syndicated by King Features and appeared in about 60 newspapers.
The winner of many major journalism awards, he retired in 1996 from
the Washington public affairs program ``Inside Washington'' after
29 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Vivien; two sons, Carl Jr., a
lawyer, and Jeffrey, a clinical psychologist, both of Washington; a
daughter, Barbara Rowan Jones of Clifton, Va., a former journalist;
and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview with The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Rowan
said, ``Racism is still very much a factor in America.'' It ``is
part of the American culture,'' he added. ``And there are still
millions of Americans who believe blacks are inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the newspaper which of his accomplishments made him
most proud, Rowan replied, ``Well, the thing I am most proud of is
that if I walk down the street and meet somebody who is poor,
black, Hispanic, they say, `You never sold out.'''

LAZIO FINDS HIS DEFINING ISSUE AND POUNDS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep &UR; . &LR;  Rick Lazio made no mention of campaign finance
reform in his speech accepting the nomination as the Republican
Senate candidate on May 30. In eight years in Congress, he was
never closely identified with the issue, although he did vote on
House bills advocating it. And he barely mentioned the subject
until August, after two months of aggressive and fruitful
fund-raising showed him catching up to his rival.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few weeks, he began talking like a crusader
about rooting out soft money, which political parties and interest
groups use to allow candidates to skirt legal limits on political
fund-raising. It is, Lazio said, ``the kind of money that has
distorted the political process, the kind of money that has kept
young people from having more confidence in the political system,
the kind of money that is unregulated, unlimited and creates a
great deal of cynicism for the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks before Election Day, Lazio's advisers believe they
have finally found the issue that gives their candidate a
recognizable public profile.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers, and some outside strategists, say Lazio's embrace
of campaign finance reform has given him a way to stand toe-to-toe
with his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to put her on the
defensive and show, despite his obscurity as a little-known Long
Island congressman, he can play in big league politics. There is
also a practical side; Lazio is outraising her in strictly
regulated hard-money contributions and so stands to benefit
financially from such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But he also gains from no agreement, said Zenia Mucha, the
senior adviser to Gov. George Pataki, a patron of Lazio's
candidacy. Merely raising the issue plays into Lazio's line of
attack that Clinton, any Clinton, cannot be trusted. Lazio's
advisers say polling, their own and by independent organizations,
shows that a key weakness for Clinton is her trustworthiness, not
only stemming from association with White House scandals but also
from the belief she is in this race more out of self-interest than
out of concern about New York.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also true Lazio has made his boldest strokes on the
issue at times he or his campaign came under scrutiny. His one and
only appearance with Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has
championed campaign finance reform, came Aug. 4, a few days after
Lazio's brief appearance at the Republican National Convention fed
a round of ``Where's Rick?'' articles.
</P>
<P>
   He initiated his soft-money pact at a news conference at Planet
Hollywood in Manhattan 10 days later _ the day Clinton appeared at
the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, where Hollywood
fund-raisers were held on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   And he brandished the pact again a month later at the
candidates' first debate, on Sept. 13 in Buffalo, with his actions
seen as a pivotal opportunity to make a stamp on voters' minds
after Republican murmurs about a lethargic campaign had grown
worrisome. From that point on, Lazio has pushed the issue
relentlessly, frequently raising it to deflect questions about
whether he was too aggressive in dealing with Clinton during the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that whatever the motive, Lazio has
finally demonstrated an ability to stand up to Clinton, to cast off
questions over whether he belongs in the same arena as the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is showing he is as big as she is,'' said Rick Wilson, a
Republican consultant who advised Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on his
aborted Senate bid. ``He is showing he can take on a national issue
and be a national player. He has not been able to score on her with
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   But few see Lazio as morphing into McCain, who reserved judgment
on how this issue might affect Lazio's standing. ``I can't make the
argument if this helps or hurts his political campaign, although I
am a supporter of his,'' McCain said Friday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people from McCain's staff joined Lazio's campaign,
most notably Michael Murphy, Lazio's senior strategist. He has
copied some elements from McCain, employing a campaign bus with the
name ``Mainstream Express'' (as opposed to McCain's ``Straight Talk
Express'').
</P>
<P>
   Whether the theatrics of confrontation will help sway voters, or
whether the issue itself is a touchstone issue for voters, is
debatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is for cleaner campaigns. And so it is kind of a
no-lose issue for Lazio,'' said James E. Campbell, a professor of
political science at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
``It's going to be an extremely close election, so anything that
puts a dent in Clinton's public image is helpful to Lazio.''

SUSPECT IN TERROR PLOT FINDS REALITY A BIT LIKE TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a member of the FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force
for more than 15 years, Detective Thomas Corrigan of the New York
City Police has interviewed many suspects in terrorism
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But as he questioned an Algerian man arrested in Brooklyn last
Dec. 30, the detective was struck by how differently that interview
was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean he was friendly, wanted to be cooperative,'' the
detective said in Federal District Court in Manhattan last week.
``I found him actually kind of streetwise, almost loosey-goosey.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Abdel Ghani Meskini, 32, has been charged with
assisting a suspected terrorist plot timed around the New Year's
celebrations that authorities said was interrupted with the arrest
Dec. 14 of another man, Ahmed Ressam, as he crossed the border into
Washington in a car the police said contained explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan and several FBI agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation kept Meskini talking for almost 11 hours after taking
him into custody, records show, and by the detective's account, the
conversation was good-humored, even with Meskini in leg irons and
handcuffed to a railing.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Detective Corrigan recalled, Meskini said that he
liked to watch ``NYPD Blue,'' and was familiar with its star
character, Andy Sipowicz, a tough-talking detective known for his
willingness to rough up suspects who will not talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he felt that we were treating him fairly decently as
opposed to some of the characters on that show,'' Corrigan
testified in court. Meskini told him something like, ``This isn't
like NYPD Blue,'' Corrigan said. ``I just remember that I took a
lot of ribbing for being Sipowicz.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Meskini, who also testified about his interrogation, he
made clear that he wanted to talk because he felt wrongly accused.
``I said, `I have nothing to do with terrorism. The only thing I do
is I'm a thief. I do credit card scams. That's all.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was putting it mildly. By his own account, Meskini was an
inveterate liar and fraud. When he lived in Boston in the
mid-1990s, he became so successful at defrauding banks that he
decided to leave the country and go to Canada so that he would not
be caught.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the border, he said, he lied to the
immigration officials there, saying he wanted political asylum.
Once in Canada, he said, he turned around and sneaked back into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   When he was arrested in Brooklyn last December, false forms of
identification were found in his apartment. He said these were used
to defraud credit card companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you are generally a dishonest person, right?'' the judge,
John F. Keenan, asked him at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Meskini replied.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, who came to the United States from Algeria in 1995, had
a good command of the English language, as well as American slang,
Corrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, who has pleaded not guilty, confirmed this in his own
testimony. He said one of his interrogators warned that he had
better assist in the investigation or he would face a long prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that I'm the `big fish' and I better, you know,
cooperate or I'm going to go for 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agent told him that he would no longer have to worry
about ``rent or the problem of Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like a line from ``NYPD Blue.''

BUSH ASSAILS GORE FOR `MISLEADING' VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ George W. Bush Saturday ended a week focused
mainly on public policy with a rebuke of Vice President Al Gore,
saying, ``My opponent has unfortunately spent the week misleading
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking via satellite to Republicans in Pennsylvania, Bush
said: ``His misrepresentations are serious business, not the
legitimate debate of political disagreements. They are a disturbing
pattern of embellishments and sudden reversals.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest example, Bush said, was from Friday, when Gore said,
``I've been part of the discussions on the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve since the days when it was first established.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat made the comment as he answered questions about his
call to release oil from the stockpile to reduce fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that the reserve was created in 1975, two years
before Gore entered Congress. Last winter, the vice president said
that tapping the reserve would be bad policy, since oil producers
could counteract any release by reducing production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was created for cases of war or a sudden disruption of
America's energy supply,'' Bush said. ``That's why it's called the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, not the Strategic Political Reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, he told a crowd gathered in a sweltering
Orlando airplane hangar that Gore had made the shift ``to bail him
out 45 days before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said Gore had changed explanations after saying his
mother-in-law's prescription arthritis medication costs nearly
three times as much as his dog's. That assertion was challenged in
a Globe story last week.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, Gore also hummed a union jingle, saying he
recalled it from his childhood. But the tune was not written until
he was 27. In addition, he raised $4.5 million at a Hollywood
fund-raiser days after criticizing the industry for violent movies
and games aimed at teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush brought up the oil-reserve issue, he adapted Ronald
Reagan's line: ``Just yesterday, there he went again.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokeswoman, Kym Spell, accused Bush of going back on his
own words.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply can't take George Bush's word for it,'' Spell said.
``When he promises to talk about the real issues, Mr. Bush just
can't help himself. He makes personal attacks and misleading
statements to distort the real differences on the issues,'' Spell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman said Bush had been mistaken in his criticism.
While Congress authorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975,
she said, its functional details were not settled until after 1977,
when Gore served on the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power
Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to solidify the location. They had to get the sources
for it,'' Spell said. ``The only thing that happened in '75 was
Congress said, `Yeah, this is a good idea.' Perhaps Mr. Bush needs
a lesson the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said the shift from policy to
personality was justified given Gore's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the last eight years, the American people want to be
able to look to the White House and trust their president to tell
them the truth, and I think the events of this week have seriously
cast doubt on the vice president's statements, the things he is
willing to say in public while he is running for president,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's criticism of Gore threatened to overshadow a weeklong
focus by the Republican's ``Real Plans for Real People,'' as well
as the burgeoning policy debate about how to deal with high
gasoline and home heating-oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   He made his comments amid an aggressive campaign swing through
Florida, which his camp sees as a must-win state.
</P>
<P>
   The governor held an airport rally in Sarasota on Friday
morning, made a speech at a seniors' center in Tampa, and finished
with rallies at the Tampa airport and Coconut Grove Convention
Center outside Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Coconut Grove rally was one of Bush's most boisterous events
all year. Thousands of cheering people were pumped up by the music
of Ricky Martin and a array of lights and confetti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vamos a ganar,'' the Texas governor said repeatedly: ``We are
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been expected to win the state and its 25 electoral
votes, partly because his brother Jeb is governor. However, three
recent polls have found the race to be a tie, with Gore pulling a
slightly higher percentage in two of them.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, Jeb Bush attributed the closeness to
``swing voters'' who were bouncing between the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But the state GOP chairman, Al Cardenas, said Friday that the
campaign had suffered because it was lackadaisical. He said Bush's
support had ``gone south'' for three weeks, but was rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Moreno, a political science professor at Florida
International University, said Gore's choice of Joseph I. Lieberman
as his running mate helped him among the Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   He said the vice president also ``drew first blood'' by
proposing a plan to provide prescription drugs to senior citizens
before Bush, and benefited from anger in the black commununity over
Jeb Bush's efforts to end affirmative action in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that at the end of the day, Bush will win Florida,''
Moreno said. ``But every hour he spends in Florida and every dime
he spends in Florida is less of each he has to spend where this
election will be decided _ the industrial Midwest.''

BUSH CAMP PRESSES FBI ON PACKAGE SENT TO GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The campaign of George W. Bush called on the FBI
Saturday to clarify the status of an investigation into the
mysterious mailing of some Bush debate-preparation material to the
camp of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a ``federal law enforcement official,'' the Associated
Press said Saturday that ``early evidence appears to point to a
person in the Bush campaign.'' Later in the day, the service
revised its story to say the person was affiliated with ``the Bush
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said FBI field agents in
Austin, Texas, had told the campaign Friday night that ``it would
be premature to draw any conclusion about who provided videotape
and debate information to the Al Gore campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Allbaugh, the campaign's manager, called FBI Director Louis
Freeh seeking the explanation. The two did not immediately speak.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the identity of the sender is only conjecture.
There is speculation that the material may have been mailed by a
Gore ``mole'' within the Bush campaign, a person with whom both
campaigns could deny affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   There is also competing speculation that the Gore campaign
obtained the material itself, or that the Bush campaign sent it out
in an attempt to entrap the Gore camp into a political dirty trick.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing frustration with the accounts, Hughes told reporters
covering Bush's swing in Florida: ``It is completely inappropriate
and wrong for the Justice Department to play politics by leaking
information in the midst of a presidential campaign. The only
people interested in helping Al Gore prepare for a debate are
people who support Al Gore, not people who support Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said she was ``confident it was not anybody who was
authorized to have access to these materials.'' That group, she
said, included Allbaugh and herself, as well as the campaign
chairman, Don Evans, the policy chief, Josh Bolten, media adviser
Mark McKinnon, and chief strategist Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, a package arrived at the office of former US
representative Thomas Downey of New York, who had been helping Gore
prepare for his debates with Bush. The package had a postmark from
Austin, where the Bush campaign is based. Downey did not recognize
the sender's name.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said Downey had told associates that he had
seen Bush on the tape in what appeared to be a mock debate with
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who is Gore's stand-in during
Bush's debate preparations. The package also contained documents.
</P>
<P>
   Downey turned the materials over to the FBI, which began an
inquiry to see, among other things, whether there was evidence that
federal law had been violated. Downey also dropped out of Gore's
debate preparations.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokeswoman, Kym Spell, declined to comment on the
investigation and criticized Hughes for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not talking about this. We immediately turned over
the tape to the FBI and lawyers from both sides are involved,''
Spell said. ``It would be inappropriate to comment, especially for
Karen Hughes to do so, although it's not a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Material from the Associated Press was used in this report.

   Two of the four biggest broadcast networks said Saturday that
they would not carry the first presidential debate between Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. NBC will broadcast
a first-round baseball playoff game instead of the Oct. 3 debate;
Fox has decided to show entertainment programming that night,
network executives said. Fox's corporate partner, the Fox News
Channel, will carry the debate. Television contracts with Major
League Baseball require networks to broadcast games despite debate
conflicts, NBC News spokeswoman Barbara Levin said. This was
brought up with the presidential commission organizing the debates,
she said, adding: ``We have no choice.'' The debates are expected
to run on ABC, CBS, public broadcasting stations and the three
cable news networks _ CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC. Fox also is
scheduled to run baseball during the Oct. 5 vice presidential
debate and the second Bush-Gore challenge on Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   POLL FINDS GORE AHEAD OF BUSH IN BATTLEGROUNDS STATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore appears to have a clear lead over George W. Bush among
voters in the key battleground states of Illinois, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania largely due to Gore's favor among women voters, a
Chicago Tribune Poll out today shows. Gore is seen as more
personable and thoughtful than Bush and respondents favor his
policies, according to the survey, which also polled Michigan and
Ohio voters. The poll found Gore is most popular among suburban
women _ a crucial block of voters. Married women who do not work
outside the home seem to favor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup national tracking poll released Saturday
found 48 percent of voters favor Gore, 45 percent are for Bush _
within the poll's 4 percentage point margin of error. A Newsweek
poll out Saturday also showed the race within the margins, at 47
percent for Gore to 45 percent for Bush. Gore had been up 10 points
in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup tracking poll earlier in the week and
was up by 8 points in the last Newsweek poll, both among likely
voters.
</P>
<P>
   GAY GROUPS TO STEP UP CAMPAIGNS
</P>
<P>
   Several activists for gay and lesbian groups said that their
organizations plan to step up political efforts over the next seven
weeks to influence voting in November. ``Gay, lesbian and bisexual
voters make up 5 percent of the national electorate,'' said
Elizabeth Toledo of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ``We
have the power to swing close elections, specifically closely
contested congressional and state elections and even the race for
the White House.'' Groups plan to use grass-roots campaigns in
every state to register gay and lesbian voters and help get them to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON BRINGS IN BUCKS FOR DNC
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton drew out high spending donors in California on
Saturday who paid $10,000 each to attend a Democratic fund-raiser
in Silicon Valley. The president helped raise $400,000 at the
Democratic National Committee luncheon, one of eight events
scheduled over three days in California and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   NADER DRAWS RECORD CROWD
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader drew a record
crowd of 12,000 people in Minneapolis, Minn., on Friday, who paid
$7 each to hear him denounce the major party candidates. ``This is
the largest gathering of paying citizens of the entire year,''
Nader told the raucous, whistling crowd. Nader's running mate,
Winona LaDuke _ who lives on the White Earth Reservation in
northern Minnesota _ spoke about generational justice and the
environment
</P>
<P>
   BUSH SR. HOLDS TONGUE NO MORE
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, who had vowed to keep a civil
tongue while his son campaigns, verged as close as he has ever been
to endorsing the House vote to impeach Clinton. At a fund-raising
luncheon in Miami on Friday for Rep. Bill McCollum, who is running
for the Senate, Bush seemed to support McCollum's vote to impeach
by saying: ``I'm not in the issue business any more . . . But I'm
in the character business. And I know a man of character when I see
one. I saw him take a lot of heat a few months ago in the House,
held his head up high, and did what he felt was right. And whether
you agree or not _ and I 100 percent agree _ I think people
respect'' his decision. The father of George W. Bush added that if
his son is elected president ``we will restore the respect, honor
and decency that the White House deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   BAYLOR WANTS TO HOST PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY
</P>
<P>
   Baylor University says it is the place to host a presidential
library for Bush _ assuming he wins in November. Baylor President
Robert Sloan Jr. told the Waco Tribune-Herald on Friday that
consultants are helping to look into landing a library to house the
mementos of a Bush presidency. ``You have to take a few risks in
life to be on the cutting edge,'' Sloan told the Tribune-Herald.
Baylor regents have not yet approved a library project, but Sloan
said they seem willing. If Bush loses, the university also would be
interested in hosting a gubernatorial library for Bush.

 &HT;    U.S. depth dominates fastest meet
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The 2000 Olympic swimming competition ended Saturday
the same way it began a week earlier: exceeding all expectations
with inspired performances by national heroes and sudden stars.
</P>
<P>
   And in the final analysis, Gary Hall Jr. was right and Mark
Spitz was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The meet was the fastest in history, with 15 world records and
38 Olympic records. The United States continued its domination,
winning 33 medals, including 14 gold. However, the rest of the
world isn't treading water _ 17 other countries won medals, with
seven earning golds.
</P>
<P>
   As Hall predicted, the U.S. smashed Australia like guitars. The
Aussies, who had hoped to knock the Yanks off their pedestal, won
18 total medals, their best result since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're faced with a worthy opponent, it really forces you
to get your act together and step up,'' said Hall, who won two gold
and has been nothing but complimentary of the Aussies since his
good-natured jibe. ``We were able to use that threat of being
dethroned as the best swimming nation as motivation to reach a
level that otherwise we might not have reached.''
</P>
<P>
   The legendary Spitz provided some motivation himself. He said
that the U.S. women wouldn't win any gold medals, then saw them win
seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mark should have known better,'' said Jenny Thompson,
who won a record eighth career gold medal _ all in relays _
Saturday as the U.S. women's 400-meter medley relay demolished the
world record. ``We had a lot of heart and swam with tremendous
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Spitz can still point to his own meet in Munich in
1972 as the greatest ever, since 30 world records were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney medal haul was the fourth-highest in American
history. The U.S. won 52 medals in 1968 and 43 in 1972, but in
those days the team had three entrants in each event, compared to
two today. The U.S. also won 33 medals in the boycott-marred 1984
Olympics which had 29 events, three fewer than in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy medal winners were four-time Olympian Dara Torres, 33,
who after a seven-year layoff won two gold and three bronze for a
career total of nine; Thompson, who won three golds and a bronze
for a career total of 10; backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg, who won
three golds; Hall, who won two golds, a silver and a bronze, for a
career total of eight; and Brooke Bennett, Megan Quann and Anthony
Ervin, who won two golds apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The most astonishing winner was Misty Hyman of the U.S., who
upset Australia's Susie O'Neill in the 200-meter butterfly by going
more than three seconds faster than she ever had before.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta four years ago, the U.S. won 26 medals (13 gold), and
only four world records fell, all in men's events.
</P>
<P>
   From the first day here, when five world records were set in
four events, the fast pool contributed to some of the exceptional
swims. The competitors were also carried on a wave of support from
the Australian crowd, which treats swimming the way Americans treat
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 17,500 was packed into the upper reaches of the
aquatics center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the times (it was) scary, other times pretty
awesome,'' said O'Neill, the most adored swimmer in Australia. ``It
gave me goose bumps every time I went out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The final day of the meet had predictable moments, as well as
some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands won her third gold medal of
the Games in the 50-meter freestyle. She and teammate Pieter van
den Hoogenband single-handedly won five gold medals, tying
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Flying Dutchman and Dutchwoman also set or equalled six
world records.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all going bananas back in the Netherlands,'' said de
Bruijn. ``They're even letting children out of school to watch the
Olympics. It's getting crazy over there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, both have had to fend off queries about the use of
performance-enhancing drugs, which they vehemently deny. ``I want
to enjoy every moment of this and no one is going to take that away
from me,'' de Bruijn said. ``I'm in the history books. The sky is
the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, an Australian won the 1,500-meter freestyle, but it
was Grant Hackett, not Kieren Perkins. Chris Thompson of the U.S.
won the bronze. For the first time in history, four swimmers went
under 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's medley relay then became the first to go under
four minutes, obliterating the old world record of 4:01.67 with a
time of 3:58.50. B.J. Bedford, Quann, Thompson and Torres each had
the fastest split for their stroke in the race, while Quann's
1:06.29 breaststroke leg was the fastest ever, as was Thompson's
57.25 butterfly split.
</P>
<P>
   The men's medley relay also broke the world record to close out
the meet.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Moses became the first man under one minute in the
breaststroke at 59.24 while Ian Crocker's butterfly split (52.10)
was the fastest by an American. Krayzelburg and Hall swam the other
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins admired the U.S. team's tremendous depth. ``Invariably
every time there's a race,'' he said, ``if you blokes don't win,
there's sombody picking up second or third. If we're really going
to challenge for that No. 1 spot, we need to be able to pick up the
minor placings.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who now will retire again, cried on both the medal stand
and during the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' she said, ``I'm just bummed that it's over.''

 &HT;    Jones, Greene golden in 100
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ At the end, they were right where they started out to
be. When they crossed the finish line on ``Super Saturday,'' Marion
Jones and Maurice Greene validated themselves as Olympic 100-meter
champions, the fastest sprinters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jones needed a leg up on her quest for five gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the world record-holder, needed just one last thing to
put his sprint dominance in a class with Carl Lewis _ an Olympic
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to cry,'' said Greene, after the medal ceremony.
``It's overwhelming. I put a lot of pressure on myself to come out
and put on a great Olympic show.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, on a muggy Atlanta night, Greene cried as he
sat watching the 100-meter final. Half a world away, the
26-year-old from Kansas City shed a few tears of joy after becoming
the first American to win the Olympic sprint since Lewis at the
1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Greene put his stamp on the Games, impressively running 9.87
seconds into a slight wind for his 35th sub-10-second race _ the
most in history. Now, he'll duck away from the NBC cameras until
the closing 400-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Ms. Jones, whose TV time is only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``One down, four to go,'' said C.J. Hunter, her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But for a night, Jones basked in her glory.
</P>
<P>
   Almost playfully, she broke into a skip one stride from the
finish line, and kept at it until landing in the arms of her
mother, Marion Toler. The former North Carolina point guard circled
the track with the American and Belize flags _ her mother's
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   One moment she flashed her trademark gap-tooth smile. The next,
she was sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of the Olympic Games, and seen people cross
the (finish) line,'' Jones said. ``I'm thinking, `I'm going to
cross that line and be a cool cat.' All of a sudden it hits you.
It's real emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marion Jones Show began with her racing down the middle of
the track, the Olympic cauldron over her left shoulder, destroying
an Olympic final field like few women ever before. The outcome was
history by 50 meters. Her only challenge, avoiding the pesky moths
that fill the evening air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't win it,'' said silver medalist Ekaterini
Thanou of Greece. ``I was only running for second.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta silver medalist Merlene Ottey came home fourth. Former
University of Georgia star Debbie Ferguson, running for the
Bahamas, made the final _ but finished a distant eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in, this was the surest thing in Jones' ambitious quest.
Her victory was the 35th consecutive dating to 1997. Her 10.75
clocking proved the fastest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But if it was a cinch, Jones wasn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very difficult night sleeping,'' she said. ``I slept
very little. C.J. would say, `Close your eyes, close your eyes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I am, I'm just not sleeping.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she dreamed of her 100-meter final.
</P>
<P>
   But as Jones tells it, she already was dreaming Olympic glory as
a child growing up in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1984 brought the Games to Los Angeles, and Jones,
her brother, mother and step-father made the short drive into the
city for a pre-Olympic parade. She clicked on the TV every day to
watch the Games. On a chalkboard in her bedroom, she remembers
scribbling her newfound ambition: gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is (16) years of believing and dreaming,'' Jones said.
``This is an incredible experience. It's everything I dreamed of
and more.''
</P>
<P>
   On the podium, Jones inspected her medal, describing it as
having ``no rough edges, very glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene was in awe of the medal, too. But equally so the
quest Jones finds herself in the midst of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish her the best, cause I wouldn't try it,'' offered the
world's fastest man.

 &HT;    Anticipated duel turns one-sided
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The man wore a Cuba baseball shirt and a strained
expression, like he either had an upset stomach or was about to
cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' he said to the man holding his ticket.
``What's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   The man had entered the most anticipated baseball game of the
Olympics, but left to find a cousin. Upon his attempt to return, he
was told there were no re-entries allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I've got to go back in,'' the man said. Three people
manning the entrance huddled with the distraught man, explaining
the policy over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand,'' he said. ``I have to go back in. This
is Cuba playing the United States. I have to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   This went on for about two minutes before, finally, he was told
by a woman who had come over: ``OK, sir, you can go back in. But,
please, don't come back out until the game is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieved, the man charged into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they want to keep me out. I bought a ticket,''
Juan Valdez said. ``This is the game no one wants to miss. America
invented baseball, but we play the game better in Cuba. You see.
You see.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Homebush Stadium, the atmosphere was a mixture of
major-league baseball and WWF. Kids donning big-league hats chasing
foul balls; kids with faces painted eating french fries smothered
in sour cream. Quality play on the field; rock 'n' roll music
between innings. The wave; sound effects after foul balls.
</P>
<P>
   A weird mix, but it worked.
</P>
<P>
   If only the game had matched the anticipation. Cuba scored four
runs in the first and was never threatened the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cu-ba, Cu-ba'' went the chant, and it was a familiar refrain
by the time the 6-1 mauling was complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't in the game after the first inning,'' U.S. manager
Tommy Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insisted there was no contention between the teams,
but that was hard to believe. There was a feel of antagonism from
the start, and it carried throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our part, there is no antagonism,'' Cuba manager Servio
Borges said. ``It's a sport. We just go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   By the top of the fourth inning, the animosity between the teams
reared its head. Ernie Young, the former major-league player, was
hit by a pitch from Jose Ibar, who was throwing a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   The catcher, Ariel Pestano hurried between the batter and
pitcher, and Young pushed him out of the way. Words were exchanged
and both benches immediately emptied.
</P>
<P>
   It did not escalate into a brawl, but sentiments were laid out
for all to see. Immediately, the large Cuba contingent started
waving its country's flag. Then there were the chants in Spanish
that, it's safe to say, were not promoting harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy (Ibar) had pinpoint control and I get to be the
beneficiary of a 94-mile-an-hour fastball in my shoulder,'' Young
said. ``I was upset because I knew he hit me on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. fans were no less enthusiastic. They expressed their
displeasure with boos. And throughout the game, even if it was an
anticlimactic finish, the U.S. red, white and blue flags waved in
the pleasant night air.
</P>
<P>
   When Miguel Caldes was called safe after running over first
baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, it was reason for fans on both sides to
get loud. But not as loud as the song ``We Will Rock You'' that
blared through the sound system; the fans rocked along with the
beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else can you get this,'' said John Ziomek, a high school
football coach from Fairlawn, N.J. Ziomek wore jeans, no shirt,
with ``USA'' painted on his chest, with a U.S. flag around his neck
like a cape.
</P>
<P>
   He looked up at a group of Cuba fans and yelled to them in
Spanish. Security came over, thinking Ziomek had said something
nasty. ``All I said was, `Listen to me. We've spotted you five
runs, but the United States is still going to win.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to seven baseball games, but this is the one I
really looked forward to. I came here having little expectations
from the U.S. But these guys have done us proud, beating
professional players from the other countries. As far as this game
against Cuba goes, it's a blast win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an atmosphere. Regardless of the outcome, how great is it
to have people from all around the world in the same place,
enjoying baseball and getting along? There are not many places in
the world where that can happen.''

   ATLANTA _ Although there will be a Michael Johnson sighting in
the men's 400 meters in track and field, the main attraction on
tonight's telecast will be the men's and women's individual event
finals in gymnastics. About the only sure thing is that the height
of the vault will be accurate. The Americans have had a rough time
in Sydney, but Elise Ray on the balance beam, Morgan Hamm on floor
exercise and Blaine Wilson on the vault will each get one more shot
at coming home with a medal. NBC is also showing the men's and
women's eights final in rowing, where the U.S. men's eight has won
the last three world championships, but hasn't claimed Olympic gold
since 1964. During the afternoon segment, Mia Hamm and Brandi
Chastain will lead the U.S. against Brazil in what should be an
entertaining match in women's soccer. The women's marathon is also
on the slate. MSNBC (TV 33) is offering the U.S. women in
basketball and volleyball against Poland and Brazil, respectively,
along with manager Tommy Lasorda leading his U.S. team against
Australia in baseball. Tennis is scheduled for CNBC, which usually
means air time for one or both of the Williams sisters, Venus and
Serena.

 U.S. VOWS TO BATTLE RISE IN OIL PRICES, VOICES CONCERN ON EURO'S
WEAKNESS  (SUBS to add new info on communique; expands by about 300
words) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The top financial officials of the
United States, fresh from an unprecedented synchronized plunge into
world oil and currency markets, joined other rich nations on
Saturday in vowing to fight what they described as double jeopardy
for the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique issued after Group of 7 financial leaders met
here, ministers said they would monitor currency markets to see if
they needed to follow Friday's coordinated central bank action to
shore up the euro, Europe's battered common currency, with further
interventions. But they used stronger language on oil prices,
saying it was ``crucial for the world economy'' that oil-producing
nations take steps to reduce prices, which have tripled since early
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil prices are the largest dark cloud in the blue sky of the
global economy,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said after
the G-7 meetings, speaking of a recent run-up in the price of crude
oil to a 10-year high of more than $30 a barrel. ``Prices need to
return to a more historical range.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision on Friday to tap the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help dampen oil prices won praise in
the G-7 communique. Other G-7 nations are also considering
releasing oil from their reserves, and ministers discussed ways of
breaking oil distribution bottlenecks and ways of putting
diplomatic pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, officials said in describing the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts to correct currency and oil prices cast the United
States, which often argues that such markets should take care of
themselves, as an aggressive interventionist, evoking expressions
of surprise from other G-7 ministers. Several said Friday's
concerted buying of euros and selling of dollars, yen and other
currencies had gone smoothly, though some traders expressed doubts
that the American, British, European, Canadian and Japanese central
banks would continue to do whatever it takes to push the euro up
against the dollar if sentiment turns negative again. ``It was
surprising how well the action went,'' Germany's finance minister,
Hans Eichel, said. ``Especially before the U.S. election, it was
surprising the U.S. even participated.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-level talks on how best to corral market prices
underscored how officials had come to view the euro's weakness and
oil's strength as major inflationary threats that pose an immediate
and largely unanticipated danger to global growth, which according
to recent forecasts was keeping the fastest annual pace in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Broad political considerations also played a role. The
relentless decline of the euro challenged the concept of European
integration generally, especially as Denmark prepares to vote on
Thursday on whether to join the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, Europe faces a paradox: Its drive to expand both
the geographical and political reach of the European Union depends
in good measure on the euro, the showpiece of the region's economic
common interest. But currency traders increasingly lost faith in
the euro, European Central Bank officials argued to their G-7
counterparts, because they saw insufficient political weight behind
the currency, which was introduced 21 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   American officials largely accepted those arguments when
discussing whether to join the European Central Bank in defending
the currency in the open market, a decision that Summers and Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, recently made. It
was the first such intervention the United States has undertaken
since it helped Japan raise the value of the yen in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long lent its support to European
integration because it is seen as a way of ensuring stability in a
region where America has fought two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to rescue the euro was closely intertwined with the
Clinton administration's decision to tap the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. Several European nations, including Britain and France,
have had sustained protests by truck drivers and others hurt by oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at the pump, already far higher in Europe than the United
States because of heavy taxes, have risen even more sharply here
than across the Atlantic because oil is bought and sold in dollars,
which have been rising in value against the euro almost in tandem
with the oil price spike. American officials were counting on an
uptick in European growth rates to extend the American-led economic
expansion of recent years, something that seems less likely if
Europe is hit by an inflationary shock.
</P>
<P>
   There was also growing trans-Atlantic concern that the weakness
of the European currency and the inflationary impact of high-priced
oil gave Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, his best opportunity
since the Persian Gulf war to wreak havoc on his Western
adversaries. With oil supplies already short, the Western world
depends on Iraq continuing crude production, something he could cut
off at any time.
</P>
<P>
   G-7 ministers in effect dismissed a French proposal to organize
a summit meeting between the Western powers and OPEC. But they
agreed to pursue bilateral contacts with OPEC counterparts,
including a coming French session with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said he hoped that the United States decision to provide
30 million barrels of oil from its reserves would persuade traders
to stop snapping up forward contracts for oil in anticipation of
severe winter shortages, a key factor behind the rising price.
</P>
<P>
   In comments the currency markets will have to decipher this
coming week, Summers also stressed that there was ``no
contradiction'' between his decision to sell dollars to buy euros
and his oft-repeated view that a strong dollar is vital to American
interests. His insistence that America has not changed its currency
policy suggests that Summers does not foresee the euro's rising
sharply against the dollar _ and, further, that any continued
United States intervention in currency markets would be limited
unless the euro resumes its plunge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the G-7 ministers met in private sessions,
President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic invited about 100
people representing charity and pressure groups concerned about
globalization to debate the heads of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund at Prague Castle. The officials and
protesters have gathered here for the annual meetings of the
Washington-based lending agencies, which will continue for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour session, followed by a walk through the
gardens of the sprawling Prague Castle, many environmental and
social activists peppered the World Bank president, James D.
Wolfensohn, and the International Monetary Fund managing director,
Horst Koehler, with an extensive list of demands.
</P>
<P>
   Several called for the complete abolition of the two
Washington-based lending agencies, which were founded just after
World War II to finance the reconstruction of Europe and stabilize
world currencies. They have recently been under heavy pressure to
improve the economic performance of poor and middle-income nations
that receive most of their loans.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, where protest organizers have vowed to stage
major demonstrations beginning on Sunday, the biggest march
Saturday was by some 500 anarchists, many dressed in black with
black masks.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd briefly blocked a highway. There was also a skirmish
between anarchists and neo-Nazi skinheads, who were staging a rival
demonstration near Prague's main railway station. At least one
person was injured before the police arrived.

MICHIGAN STATE BEATS NOTRE DAME, 27-21 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ He had been sacked six times, fumbled the
ball once and threw an interception inside his own 5-yard line.
What's a freshman to do? Well, with a little less than two minutes
left in the game, Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker got the
kind of luck that usually blesses the Fighting Irish.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth-and-10 on his own 32-yard line, Smoker stood strong in
the pocket and rifled a pass between the hash marks at midfield and
into the arms of a streaking Herb Haygood. Haygood, a junior wide
receiver, never broke stride as he galloped through the Notre Dame
secondary and into the end zone for a 68-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Smoker's 12th completion in 24 tries but it was the
one the 74,714 at Spartan Stadium will remember as the one that
beat the Fighting Irish, 27-21, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The loss extended two dubious streaks by the No. 16 Irish (2-2).
They have not won a road game since November 1998 (over Navy) and
now have lost four consecutive games to the Spartans. The last time
a team beat Notre dame four consecutive times was Miami in 1983,
'84, '85 and '87.
</P>
<P>
   When Smoker arced a 10-yard swing pass to fullback Travis Wilson
in the end zone in the final minutes of the third quarter, the
Spartans had a 20-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Gary Godsey, the 6-foot-7-inch former tight end who
led the Irish to a 21-20 upset of Purdue last week, had problems
Saturday. When Godsey was intercepted by Cedrick Henry early in the
third quarter, Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie made a change. Godsey's
turnover led to a 36-yard field goal by David Schaefer and a 13-7
Michigan State lead. From that moment on, Davie turned the offense
over to the freshman Matt LoVecchio who, at 6-4 and fleeter of
foot, returned the Irish to option football.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, LoVecchio, the
former Bergen Catholic star, crossed everybody up, however, when he
launched a 42-yard pass to Javin Hunter for a first down at the
Michigan State 2-yard line. Two plays later, Julius Jones punched
in the end zone to pull Notre Dame to 20-14.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 23 Spartans (3-0), too, had quarterback woes. Junior
starter Ryan Van Dyke hasn't played since injuring the thumb on his
throwing arm in the season opener against Marshall. He warmed up
before the game Saturday, but was not fully recovered and. For the
second week in a row the Spartans had to play Smoker, who was 10 of
24 for 157 yards last week in a 13-10 victory over Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Smoker had looked like the better of the backups until two
costly fourth-quarter mistakes. On third-and-7 on his own 28,
Smoker was in the shotgun when Irish linebacker Tyreo Harrison
burst through and knocked the ball loose. By the time defensive
tackle Darrell Campbell smothered the ball the Irish were on the
Michigan State 12-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Three runs moved the ball to the Michigan State 3-yard line and,
facing fourth-and-1, Davie decided to go for it. This time,
LoVecchio kept on the option, but Michigan State tackle Josh Shaw
stopped him short of the first down.
</P>
<P>
   Smoker and the Spartans weren't so fortunate moments later. On
third-and-15 at his own 11-yard line, Smoker hurried a screen pass
that was intended for tailback Little John Flowers. The Irish's
Anthony Weaver intercepted and was caught by Flowers on the
2-yard-line. Jones carried it in on the next play, giving the Irish
a 21-20 lead with 7:59 to play.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, both teams came out running and, as Michigan
State's 10-7 halftime lead reflected, the Spartans were able to
gobble up the most ground _ especially the sophomore T.J. Duckett,
a powerful 6-2, 252-pound tailback whom the Irish were unable to
tackle. He gained 107 yards in the half and on the Spartans'
touchdown drive carried the ball 6 times for 47 yards and rolled
over three members of the Irish secondary on a 6-yard touchdown
run. Over all, he ran for 141 yards and one touchdown on 26
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Smoker, however, settled down enough to complete passes to
Hagood and wide receiver Marcus Waters and move the Spartans into
Irish territory. When the drive stalled junior David Schaefer, who
had missed a 50-yard field goal earlier in the quarter, gave the
Spartans a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, meanwhile, leaned on the sophomore tailback Jones who
rushed for 93 first-half yards. Jones finished with 126 yards and
two touchdowns on 26 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey was 4 of 8 for 20 yards in the first half and threw the
first touchdown of his Notre Dame career _ a six yard swing pass to
reserve fullback Jason Murray early in the first half. But it was
Jones who set up the touchdown when he popped inside the right
tackle and then angled outside and 56 yards up the sideline down to
the Spartans 4-yard-line. &QL;

FUJIMORI'S FUTURE LINKED TO AIDE MONTESINOS' FATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ If President Alberto Fujimori's rapid reversal of
fortune were made into a Hollywood thriller, it might be called
``Gone in 60 Seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how long it took for a grainy videotape, which shows
Fujimori's most trusted aide apparently bribing a congressman, to
shock and disgust Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the minute-long video was broadcast on national
television, Fujimori, Latin America's longest-serving elected
leader, suddenly announced last weekend that he would call early
elections and leave office.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the Fujimori government has been accused
of far more serious misdeeds, ranging from electoral fraud and
human rights abuses to selling weapons to Colombian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the videotape showing Vladimiro Montesinos, the
president's shadowy spy chief, handing an envelope stuffed with
cash to an opposition legislator captured the public's imagination
and quickly came to symbolize all that has gone sour in Peru under
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peruvians can see for themselves,'' said Alberto Borea, a
lawyer and a political activist in Lima. ``Other accusations (of
wrongdoing) did not have the same impact as these images.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's bombshell announcement Sept. 16 of new elections
threw the nation into disarray. As Peruvians contemplated the vote,
Montesinos remained holed up at army headquarters in Lima after
refusing Fujimori's order to resign from the government.
</P>
<P>
   What does seem clear, analysts say, is that the Fujimori era is
at last coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Montesinos, Fujimori has very little power,'' said
Joanna Drzewieniecki, an independent political analyst and human
rights consultant in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, the de facto head of the state intelligence agency,
has played a behind-the-scenes role at critical junctures during
Fujimori's rule, exercising wide control over the military, the
judiciary and electoral institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos is thought to have served as a CIA informant and has
won praise from U.S. officials for his role in Peru's fight against
drug traffickers. At the same time, he has been accused, though
never convicted, of graft, spying on government opponents and
receiving payoffs from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here think Montesinos finally went too far and took
part in an arms-smuggling ring that sent thousands of Russian
assault rifles purchased in Jordan to Marxist guerrillas in
neighboring Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling ring involved Montesinos as well as retired
Peruvian military officers, the local media reported, adding that
the intelligence service protected the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government, which recently approved a $1.3 billion aid
package for the war against drugs in the Andean region, was enraged
and pressured Fujimori to dump Montesinos, observers said. Most of
the U.S. assistance is earmarked to help the Colombian government
battle Marxist guerrillas who earn millions of dollars annually in
the narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending arms to the Colombian guerrillas was too much. It
caused profound anger in the United States and Colombia,'' said
Fernando Rospigliosi, who writes about military affairs for the
Lima news magazine Caretas. ``Montesinos didn't calculate the
effects this could have. This was fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori often shrugs off criticism, but his room to maneuver
has greatly diminished. Following last May's fraud-tainted
elections, Fujimori has faced growing domestic opposition and
stepped-up international pressure to restore full democracy to
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he may have felt compelled to respond to the arms
scandal, Borea said.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is a matter of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts think Fujimori used the compromising videotape of
Montesinos as an excuse to fire him Sept. 16. Montesinos apparently
responded by rallying the support of the military high command,
which threatened to launch a coup against Fujimori, according to
Francisco Loayza, a respected Peruvian military analyst who has
written a book about Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montesinos had decided that this was the only way to paralyze
the country and win enough time to negotiate his own exit,'' Loayza
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori backed down, Loayza said, and the coup was called
off.
</P>
<P>
   That same night, Fujimori broadcast a message to the nation
calling for new elections and saying that he would not be a
candidate. He also announced that he was dismantling the
intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that Fujimori, Montesinos and military commanders
might be negotiating some way for the spy chief and the nation's
top generals to avoid prosecution. Some analysts believe Montesinos
eventually will be allowed to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the easiest solution. But he has too much
baggage, with all of the accusations against him,'' Rospigliosi
said. ``What country would take him?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Panama rejected a request Saturday to give him asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have made the investigation and prosecution
of Montesinos a key demand in ongoing negotiations with the
Fujimori government over next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a great opportunity for the reconciliation
among Peruvians, a great opportunity to make democratic reforms,''
said Cesar Gaviria, secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, the regional body sponsoring the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the Fujimori government has often run roughshod over
the nation's democractic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1990, Fujimori closed the congress and the
courts two years later in a so-called ``self-coup.'' His government
was hailed, however, for taming hyperinflation and for largely
defeating the fanatical Shining Path terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was easily re-elected in 1995. He devoted much of his
second term to dubious legal maneuvers that allowed him to run for
a third term.
</P>
<P>
   International observers say that widespread irregularities and a
government dirty-tricks campaign against opposition candidates
marred last spring's elections. In the May 28 presidential runoff,
Fujimori won an unprecedented third consecutive five-year term. His
opponent, Alejandro Toledo, claimed the process was rigged and
pulled out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, rival politicians claim the current administration
cannot be trusted to run a clean election.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the opposition is badly divided. Toledo, who wants to run
for the presidency again, held a campaign rally last week. But some
critics of Fujimori said the opposition's first task should be to
pressure the government to run a fair election and to prosecute
Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition was furious with Toledo,'' Drzewieniecki said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, Fujimori rejected calls that he
step down immediately and allow a transition government to organize
next year's balloting. He insisted that he would campaign for his
party and even hinted that he would run for president again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen in 2006? I am going to offer a surprise,''
Fujimori said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have closely followed Fujimori's career predict that
he will attempt to paint himself as a victim of Montesinos'
maneuvers, then attempt to stage-manage next year's balloting and
later launch a political comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he is trying to survive, to arrange for a soft
landing, and then return in 2006,'' said Carlos Ivan Degregori, a
political scientist at the Institute of Peruvian Studies.
</P>
<P>
   But others contend that, without Montesinos, Fujimori's
political career is all but finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a huge defeat'' for Fujimori, Rospigliosi said.
``He knows he can never come back.''

 &HT;    U.S. soars on day of shockers
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Compared with the shocking results taking place at the
same time Saturday night, the penalty-kick victory by the U.S.
men's soccer team over Japan couldn't be called an upset.
</P>
<P>
   But for an American team enjoying its first trip to the Olympic
quarterfinals, its come-from-behind 2-2 thriller (5-4 on penalties)
over a determined Japanese squad in Adelaide was the stuff of their
wildest imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the U.S. fell behind and twice it equalized, the second
time in drawing a penalty kick in the final minute of regulation.
After 30 minutes of scoreless extra time, a fortuitous misfire off
the post by Japan's star player, Hidetoshi Nakata, propelled the
Americans into a Tuesday semifinal match in Sydney against Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Mountain's Josh Wolff scored the first goal of the game
for the U.S. and set up the dramatic spot kick in the 90th minute,
when he was taken down in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Spain got an 86th-minute goal from Gabri to send Italy, the
pre-Olympic gold-medal favorite, crashing out of the tournament.
Brazil, which has never won Olympic gold, is out, too. Modeste
Mbami lashed a wicked shot in the 113th minute as Cameroon took a
2-1 extra-time victory. Nigeria, which won the 1996 gold medal in
Athens, was thrashed 4-1 by Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, also making its best showing in the Olympics, had the
better run of play until late in the second half, when the U.S.
used its three substitutions to inject pace and some fresh legs.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff's goal, on a rebound from 16 yards out, knotted the match
at 1-1 in the 68th minute. But four minutes later, Japan retook the
lead when Naohiro Takahara smashed a point-blank shot at U.S.
goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who parried it away.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't stop the rebound, and the Americans were playing
on their heels again. In the 89th minute, Friedel unleashed a long
free kick just outside his box and ahead to Wolff, who drew a beat
five feet away from Japanese keeper Seigo Narazaki. Wolff and
defender Tomoyuki Sakai got tangled up, and Peter Vagenas easily
made the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   In the penalty-kick round, all five Americans scored. In the
fourth round, Nakata, a Japanese sporting icon who plays for AS
Roma in Italy, hooked his right-footed shot off the left post.
Friedel, badly beaten, pumped his fists while sitting on the
ground. Then the U.S. bench engaged in a group pile-on near the
sideline after Sasha Victorine put home the winning spot kick.

 &HT;    Drive for 5
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ This was a moment as full of portent as a second,
separate lighting of the Olympic flame.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing her first Olympic finish line as alone as any soloist,
Marion Jones freed the most radiant smile yet loosed on these
Games. That smile _ toothy and total _ is her second greatest gift.
It beamed the beginning of 2000's second Olympics, the one she'll
call her own.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Games of the first Mariad begin.
</P>
<P>
   Her emotions would swerve much more than her feet. From the
smile that preceded her across the 100-meter finish, to the tears
that quickly followed her right turn toward the stands. Both were
in reaction to finally getting her audacious pentathlon under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 19 years of believing and dreaming about the gold
medal,'' Jones said. ``Then it comes down to one moment, one race.
That's a lot of pressure. What a huge relief. It's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so much else about her quest, the finish to the 100 meters
was carefully planned. ``I vowed I was going to play it cool,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the best parts of life, though, her reaction could not be
scripted. ``Once I crossed the line, all that went out the
window,'' she said, explaining the brief salty flood.
</P>
<P>
   But remember that smile, for it was the signal that Jones can
handle the weight of the next week and have enough energy left to
fleetingly enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of 7-year-old kids do things like write, ``I want to be
Olympic champion'' on a blackboard, and Marion Jones said she was
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   But only one in millions can live up to such childish notions.
Only the rarest sort can come to that single apex of time, stare
down an empty stretch of track at the end of which a life's purpose
is fulfilled or crushed, and not be overwhelmed. To those we build
cavernous stadiums and dedicate them with worshipful roars.
</P>
<P>
   Jones described a sleepless night on the eve of becoming,
officially, the world's fastest femme. And yet she had them from,
``Take your mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones jumped on the field from the start, and glided
increasingly beyond their reach. They were just not the Marion
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Her time of 10.75 was not a record, but with silver-medal winner
Ekaterini Thanou of Greece .37 of a second behind, Jones' margin of
victory was the second-widest in the history of the women's Olympic
100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   This was a victory that excluded no one. While Jones and mother
Marion Toler have had their Jones and mother Marion Toler have had
their differences, the two warmly embraced at the other end of the
100. Along with the U.S. flag, Jones included a small flag of
Belize on her victory lap _ a tribute to mom's native land.
</P>
<P>
   At the medal ceremony, Jones savored the texture of the first of
her collection. This one deserved a long, loving inspection. ``I
wondered for the longest time what (an Olympic medal) would be
like,'' she said. ``There are no rough edges, it's very smooth and
glamorous. It's beautiful.'' The medal could return the same
compliment to its owner.
</P>
<P>
   But only the ``easy'' part of Jones' five-step plan toward
becoming Olympic lore is done. The 200 meters may not be a much
more competitive race, but it is longer. The long jump is not her
specialty. And considering the loss of Inger Miller, America's
second best sprinter, to injury and the awful showing of America's
400-meter runners (none advanced past preliminary rounds), the
strength of the 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams are questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish her the best, but I wouldn't try it,'' men's 100-meter
silver medalist Ato Boldon said. ``I hope her body holds up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't I just enjoy this for a couple of minutes?'' Jones
wondered after gold No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not much more than that. She set the rules with her
own ambition. And the truth is, we are hooked. We need another fix
of that smile as soon as possible.

 &HT;    The costs of infertility
 &HT;    By Jenna Hunt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Tina and Gary Nix wanted another baby, but
after two unsuccessful years they turned to fertility treatments.
The Goldsboro couple enlisted the help of Dr. Lynn Borchert, a
Greenville fertility specialist, who spent months testing the
couple to rule out fixable difficulties before recommending an oral
fertility drug.
</P>
<P>
   It took about 14 months using the drug for the couple to
successfully become pregnant with their son, who is now 3 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted another child _ we didn't want our oldest to
grow up alone,'' Tina Nix, 34, said. ``We were really blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the clinic each month or talking with women who
couldn't conceive made Tina feel guilty because she already had a
child, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One out of six couples experience infertility problems in the
United States, and more couples are turning to medicine to become
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixes' success story is not the rule when it comes to
fertility treatments. Most attempts fail to lead to pregnancy, and
a few result in twins, triplets, quadruplets or more babies.
Multiple births _ including the
</P>
<P>
   recent sextuplet birth in Greenville, septuplets in Iowa and
octuplets in Italy _ can often be prevented by careful monitoring
before conception, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy woman without fertility problems has about a 25
percent chance of getting pregnant each month. A couple is
considered infertile if they can't become pregnant in a 12-month
period, doctors said. The chances of getting pregnant with
fertility treatments range from 10 to 40 percent, doctors said.
ECU's fertility center averages about 80 patients a year with a
live-birth rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last five to 10 years there has been an increase in
using fertility treatments,'' said Dr. Cal Hayslip, director of
East Carolina University's Assisted Reproductive Technology
Laboratory Center and director of the Brody School of Medicine's
Reproductive Endrocrinology and Infertility Division. Desperation
to have one baby can often lead to fertilization treatments that
produce multiple births, what some doctors refer to as tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think personally, as a fertility specialist, if treatments
produce five or six babies, I consider that to be a failure,''
Borchert said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nix family knew they didn't want to have more than twins at
the very most, but felt confident with Borchert's experience that
they wouldn't face a multiple birth. Borchert has never had more
than twin births in his 30 years of practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All most couples want is one healthy baby when they seek
fertility treatments, Gary Nix said. But the waiting game can be
agony, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Month after month you're still not pregnant and . . . you
start to question everything,'' he said. ``People take getting
pregnant naturally for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiple births occur because couples proceed with fertilization
attempts after drugs produce two or more viable eggs. Couples could
choose to abstain or use birth control when tests reveal several
viable eggs exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five- and six-birth kids have put a bad wrap on fertility
treatments,'' said Nix, 35. ``I don't care if you're Superman _ you
can't take care of five kids. There is no one on earth who would
want to have five kids at one
</P>
<P>
   time.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiple births can place physical and emotional burdens on the
mother and children, in addition to taxing family and community
resources, Borchert said.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Nix said she can relate to the desperation of having
children at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted another baby so bad that at times, if it was a chance
to have twins or triplets, I would have said, 'Go for it,' `` she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Borchert's care the Nixes were advised to be cautious and
patient. Each month, the couple visited the medical practice to see
how many follicles _ or unfertilized eggs _ had developed on Tina's
ovaries. Numerous eggs could develop into multiple fetuses if
fertilized, her doctor said. He said he never recommends a couple
try to get pregnant with three or more mature follicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wouldn't have been a chance at multiple births _ if I
had four, six or eight follicles we wouldn't have even tried to get
pregnant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical professionals and families are willing to take the
risks of having large multiple births. In some cases, couples opt
for injection fertility treatments, which are stronger than oral
drugs like the Nixes used.
</P>
<P>
   For them, a successful fertilization may result in a choice
between multiple births or selective reduction of fetuses after
conception, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six years, Hayslip has had two couples become
pregnant with quadruplets. Both decided to have selective fetal
reduction and each delivered healthy twins. He said he understands
this decision involves moral, ethical and religious choices for
couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe before women take fertility drugs they should be
counseled on fetal reduction,'' he said. ``On average, a woman will
have a better chance of having healthy babies if she reduces to
twins.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayslip is the only doctor in eastern North Carolina and one of
about 500 certified reproductive endrocrinologists in the country
providing in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have much more control over multiple births with in vitro
fertilization _ most of the time only two or three embryos are
placed back inside the uterus,'' Hayslip said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts agreed the million-dollar price tags attached to
having large multiple births can often place a weighty financial
strain on communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society has to bear responsibilities for the care of these
babies,'' Hayslip said. ``But does society have a right to limit
choices that an individual can make as far as fertility
treatment?''
</P>
<P>
   In England and some other European countries, it is illegal to
place more than three fertilized embryos back inside a woman's
uterus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple births can easily occur with more embryos, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It can cost millions to care for tiny infants in their first
year of life depending on complications and hospitalizations, said
Hayslip. The cost of fertility can also be a determining factor for
couples trying to conceive since the average cost for each in vitro
fertilization cycle is at least $7,000. Most couples try at least
twice, with some repeating the process three or four times without
success, Hayslip said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs and injections are less expensive but still costly. ``It's
definitely not cheap _ it's very expensive,'' Gary Nix said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that they spent more than $3,000, but he said you
can't put a price on the birth of a child.

 &HT;    Keeping up the neighborhood
 &HT;    By T. Scott Batchelor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The city of Greenville is on the verge of
enforcing a high-grass ordinance for homes whose owners were driven
away from their property by Hurricane Floyd flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson, neighborhood services coordinator, sent a letter
to displaced property owners in the federal buyout program asking
them to cut their grass and secure abandoned structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become quite apparent that the time is fast approaching
that we must begin enforcement actions in these flooded areas,''
Johnson wrote in the letter dated Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are requesting that you secure (board up) your
</P>
<P>
   structure and keep the grass on your lot cut,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please keep in mind that you are currently the owner of the
flooded property and are responsible for its condition,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also called for the removal of abandoned vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the residents who have moved back into their
previously flooded homes have complained about nearby lots growing
wild, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems they should have some strategy to do something,''
Johnson said of the absentee property owners. ``They can't just let
it stay out there without making a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance prohibits owners from letting grass get more than
1 foot high. Houses that aren't occupied have to be locked and the
windows boarded up, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said tall grass and overgrown vegetation can harbor rats and
other pests. The ordinance is currently not being enforced for the
properties in the buyout program, Johnson said. Officials will
decide at a later date when to
</P>
<P>
   hold property owners responsible.
</P>
<P>
   He wants property owners ``to understand that there are people
living in close proximity to these lots,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Li and Bob Bunger received the letter right around the time they
accepted a cash offer for their flooded Warren Street home, which
is flanked by vacant dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we had listened to (city officials) and gone out there
with plywood and paid for someone to mow the lawn, it would just
have been one house between two that would have been done,'' Li
Bunger said.
</P>
<P>
   And, her husband added, ``What's the point of doing landscaping
or even boarding it up when it's just waiting for the bulldozer?''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Parks moved back into a new mobile home in the midst of
overgrown lots and abandoned homes on Mill Street, and she doesn't
like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to hurry up and get that right,'' Parks said of the
property owners. ``When are they ever going to do anything about
it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't no telling what's up there in all that grass,''
she said, pointing to tall vegetation bordering her lot. ``I'm
scared of snakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention rats and other vermin, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely going to be coming up out of that when it
gets cold,'' she said.

ONLY REAL RACE LEFT IS IN NL EAST
</HEADLINE>

By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While Arizona and the Dodgers consider their
playoff hopes alive because they haven't been mathematically
eliminated, it'll take something more extraordinary than another
Mets collapse in September to give the Dodgers and Diamondbacks a
real chance.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the only playoff drama remains in the National League
East, where the Mets and the Braves have a few meaningful games to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the schedule-makers got it right as the Mets and Braves
conclude the season with three games at Shea Stadium, and the East
Division title should be decided then. The Braves entered Saturday
with a 3-game lead over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a division is to be decided it should be decided within the
division,'' Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``This gives
whoever plays the best the best opportunity to win. ... It can
create a little better rivalry, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamenting Lieberthal: Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal may be
injured, but it hasn't kept the Westlake High product from talking
about the direction of the Phillies, who average a last-place
finish once every 4.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have a new stadium and I can't see the
Phillies spending a whole lot of money,'' Lieberthal said. ``We
have to have a miracle season to compete with the Braves and Mets.
... Look at the Mets' and Braves' payroll, and look at ours. How
can we beat the Braves and Mets? We don't have a closer. We don't
have a No. 1 starter. Look up the middle. There are concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how many question marks we have and how many the
Braves and Mets have. I'm sure they have some question marks, but
we have a lot more. And the only way to fill them is by spending
money. And even by spending, it's hard to get players to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is playing here, at this stadium. You might
not have said that a few years ago. But now, everyone has a nice,
new stadium, or at least a nice revised one, like St. Louis. You
see the difference in fan attendance, the turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't get a new stadium for five years, put some money
into this one - just for the fans. If I was a fan, the only reason
I'd come to a game is to see a few of the Phillies players I liked.
They aren't coming here for the food and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   King(man) of losing: Former A's pitcher Brian Kingman flew to
Philadelphia to watch Phillies lefty Omar Daal attempt to lose his
20th game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Daal didn't figure in the decision in Thursday's win against
the Mets, which is fine with Kingman. He'd prefer not to be knocked
into anonymity if Daal were lose 20 games. Kingman was the last to
do it, dropping 20 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if we had scored more runs, I might have went 14-13,''
said Kingman, CEO of a financial services group. ``But then, who
would be talking to me? I'm proud of losing 20. Cy Young did it
three times. Steve Carlton did it. I'm proud to be associated with
those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing 20 is actually quite an accomplishment, sad as that
sounds. When you factor in that you could be taken out of the
rotation or sent to the minors, someone has to think you're a good
pitcher to give you the opportunity to lose 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey joins group: Reds center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. became
the fourth player to hit at least 40 homers seven times, joining
Babe Ruth (11), Henry Aaron (eight) and Harmon Killebrew (eight).
Griffey also topped the 40-homer mark for the fifth straight
season, joining Ruth (seven), Ralph Kiner (five) and Duke Snider
(five) as the only players to accomplish that.

KARROS: DODGERS' WOES NOT FOR LACK OF CARING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eric Karros is used to discussing what's wrong
with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of being on the team longer than any of his Dodgers
teammates and seeing the team underachieve each year since enduring
a Los Angeles-record 99 losses in his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   The problems vary from year to year and Karros can identify more
than he'd care to list, noting that, ``It's a combination of
things, not anything specific.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to figure out what went wrong has been frequent again
this year as the Dodgers failed to win the division title for which
they were expected to contend. However, contrary to popular belief,
Karros says a lack of desire is not one of those problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not winning, you're gonna look lethargic and like
you don't care,'' Karros said. ``But that's so far from the truth.
No matter what our record is, we're out there trying as hard as we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim of what's right with the team is supported by a surge
that saw the Dodgers climb back into the National League wild-card
race last week by gaining three and a half games from Sunday
through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not perfect, but we're moving in the right direction,''
manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we spend all offseason, all spring training
for,'' Karros said. ``We aren't doing this from February to October
- pretty much year-round - just for the hell of it. It's because we
have pride and we enjoy the game. Our heart's in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything I have a hard time understanding, it's for
the fans to feel upset like we don't care. That's just so far from
the truth, it's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros backed up his words by arriving hours before a recent
afternoon game in which there was no batting practice and therefore
no requirement to be there so early. He'd rather show how much he
cares that way instead of using outbursts after disappointing
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go throw my helmet and bang the bat against the cooler or
something, does that mean I care more?'' Karros said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From February until October, the No. 1 priority is this team,
this organization - not family, not anything else. So what is it?
Do you want somebody to just go out and throw their helmet and do
their thing? Well, that's another thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros' patience has been tested through the years. The Dodgers
have qualified for the playoffs twice since his first full season
in 1992, but the 32-year-old first baseman from UCLA has yet to
experience a playoff win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were leading the National League West in 1994, but a
strike ended season. They won the division the next year and made
the playoffs as the wild-card team in 1996, but both times were
quickly eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high expectations and one of the highest payrolls in
baseball, the Dodgers finished third in the division the past two
seasons, last year 23 games out of first.
</P>
<P>
   This year's inconsistent play that has been blamed on everything
from instability in the lower portion of the pitching rotation to
team-chemistry problems dropped the Dodgers out of the division
race long ago, leaving Karros and his teammates with a familiar
feeling.
</P>

   ``The fans think they're upset and they're mad,'' Karros said.
``This is our livelihood, this is what we do. You think somebody on
the street is more discouraged than any person here? We're
frustrated. ...The perception from the outside looking is never
completely accurate.''

JETS GIRD FOR A BATTLE AGAINST THE BUCS' DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was facetiously suggested at some point during the
cacophonous past week that the real fun would be if Keyshawn
Johnson played defense, too, so that he could spend Sunday trying
to jam Wayne Chrebet all the way into the grass of Raymond James
Stadium in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   As if Tampa Bay's defense was not scary enough. The dirty little
secret of Sunday's game between the undefeated Jets and Buccaneers
is that while Johnson may present a huge challenge to audio
technicians everywhere, he is not, by far, the greatest threat to
the Jets' chances of going 4-0. Johnson may have provided the
oratorical background dissonance, but it is the Tampa Bay defense,
which Jets Coach Al Groh compared last week to Pittsburgh's Steel
Curtain of the 1970s, that will surely decide this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been tough to score against Tampa Bay,'' Groh said.
``There has been only one true offensive touchdown scored against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That came in the game against New England. Two other touchdowns
scored against the Bucs this season came on a punt return by New
England and a desperation pass by Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers' defense will swarm to the ball today with all of
the ferocity of the microphones encircling Johnson. Though ranked
third in the league, it is the most feared unit in the game. The
Bucs have the defending defensive player of the year in lineman
Warren Sapp, who has a league-leading five-and-a-half sacks, and
they have cornered the market on the league's defensive player of
the week award, winning it all three weeks this season.
</P>
<P>
   The unit has 18 sacks in three games, putting it on pace for 96
this season; that would obliterate the record of 72, set by the
1984 Chicago Bears. And the defense has allowed the Bucs' offense,
considered the weak link of the team, to outscore opponents by
93-26, the second-fewest points allowed in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay defense says that if the offense scores just 17
points a game, it can do the rest. Seventeen points is 11 fewer
than the 1985 Bears gave their vaunted defense to work with. It is
8 fewer than the Steel Curtain got in the 1970s, as the Steelers
won four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Jets center Kevin Mawae said Tampa Bay had the best defense in
the league. Groh went further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team certainly has the look of a Super Bowl team,'' Groh
said. ``The team looks in style similar to the Pittsburgh teams
when they were on their championship runs. The cornerstone of the
team is defense built on speed and explosiveness and disruption.
You see some of the same type of players, whether it was Jack Ham
playing outside linebacker and now it's Derrick Brooks. Whether it
was Mean Joe Greene disrupting things in the middle and now it's
Warren Sapp. Whether it was the hard-hitting guys in the secondary,
be it Mel Blount and now it's John Lynch and Ronde Barber as the
blitzer.''
</P>
<P>
   This all comes at a time when the Jets' offense continues to
start and stall like a balky car. Fourteen of the Jets' points
against Buffalo _ the best defense the Jets have faced this season
_ were a result of a desperation pass at the end of the first half
and a kickoff return by Kevin Williams. And quarterback Vinny
Testaverde admitted recently that he was having trouble reading
some defenses, particularly corner and safety blitz packages that
are being disguised in ways different from what he was used to
seeing in 1998. That could play right into the Bucs' plans: Barber,
a cornerback, has three and a half sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets discovered the formula for facing a great defense when
they played Buffalo, which finished last season ranked No.1. The
secret: do not fall far behind and establish the run. That means
blocking Sapp, who has exceptional mobility for someone so large.
</P>
<P>
   Jets running back Curtis Martin, the league's second-leading
rusher, carved out 84 yards against the Bills' defense, which had
been giving up just 46.5 rushing yards a game. Martin said he would
prefer to run right at Sapp, rather than around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's better or not,'' Martin said. ``He can
disrupt the entire offense. They run around and they all get to the
ball. You need just one guy making the tackle. There's always two,
three, four, five, six guys on one tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tampa Bay gets a quick lead, it will force the Jets to start
throwing the ball more and relying on Martin less. That would give
the Bucs the freedom to rush the passer continually. Ask the Lions'
Charlie Batch what that was like. The Bucs led Detroit by 11 points
in the second half, so he was forced to throw on all but two
second-half plays. The result: he was sacked six times in the
second half. The Jets have given up only two sacks so far this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a line that's going to back down from anyone,'' Jets
guard Randy Thomas said. ``We work too hard to go out there and
make guys look real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's defense looks just fine on its own.

SYSTEM ERRORS IN MINORS LIMIT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The conclusion to fire Los Angeles Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson seems foregone, though anything is possible
considering the way the Dodgers have operated since ownership was
transferred from the O'Malleys to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Despite management's complaints about Johnson's managerial
style, one thing keeps popping into mind:
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the current front office took over, it has
preached the importance of the minor-league system. From general
manager Kevin Malone down, it has said a team can't win a
championship unless it has a healthy feeder system.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Dodgers' system is a step above sickly, yet Johnson
was supposed to win this season. Because the Dodgers haven't won,
Johnson could be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Something doesn't seem right.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's another example of Johnson feeling the brunt of
a payroll that borders on being out of control. Just because the
Dodgers spent $98 million this season doesn't mean it was spent
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   If, indeed, a team can't win with a poor minor-league system -
and the Yankees, Braves and Cardinals have proven it - why, then,
were the Dodgers expected to win?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing sums up this morass more than last year's outfield woes,
which would have been amplified had the team been involved in a
tight playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   With rosters expanded to 40 players in September, the Dodgers'
starting outfield has consisted of journeyman infielder Chris
Donnels, catcher Paul LoDuca and even pinch-hitter/infielder Dave
Hansen. Injuries to Devon White, Gary Sheffield and Bruce Aven made
it necessary, but the alignment also shows the Dodgers' limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, an organization so thin that when Eric
Gagne faltered in the back of the pitching rotation, the only
answer was Carlos Perez. Gagne was rushed into a starting spot
despite having no Triple-A experience. The only other choice at the
minor-league level was right-hander Mike Judd.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of viable options is much of the reason Perez lasted the
season with the Dodgers. The club also re-acquired right-hander
Ismael Valdes because it had no candidate as a fifth starter, let
alone a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   When third baseman Adrian Beltre was injured in June, veteran
shortstop Kevin Elster was the answer because no one existed in the
minor- league system to replace him. Not even in a platoon role.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with the way Todd Hollandsworth and White were playing
in center field and producing in the leadoff spot, the Dodgers
traded for Tom Goodwin. He's under contract for the next two
seasons, but it's not as though he's taking a job from a younger
player.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers thought they had a center fielder in their
minor-league system, they wouldn't have signed White to a
three-year deal after the 1998 season and they wouldn't have
acquired Goodwin for this and the next two seasons. Again, a
shortcoming in the system.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers boast about a 100-game turnaround and five
postseason appearances among its minor-league affiliates. That's
wonderful, especially at the lower levels where the new regime's
draft picks are learning the game as professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But those wins, those playoff berths, meant nothing when it came
to helping the major-league club this season. Albuquerque did it
with a bundle of veteran minor-leaguers and fringe major-leaguers
who will never help the Dodgers. Double-A San Antonio missed the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   When rosters were expanded Sept. 1, the Dodgers called up two
players from Albuquerque. A week later they added three more
players, but only Gagne has seen action from that group.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Johnson could communicate better with his players. Perhaps
jockeying for that big inning most of the time isn't the way to go.
But those are subjective views.
</P>
<P>
   What stinks in this whole mess is how management has maintained
its belief that in order to win, there must be a flourishing
minor-league system. That's not the case with the Dodgers, and, not
only do they know it, they talk about it.
</P>

WILL MARINERS FOOT A-ROD'S PRICE TAG?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez will be the
market's hottest free agent this offseason, perhaps commanding as
much as $200 million in a long-term deal. But he refuses to
speculate about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have me written in as the next Dodgers shortstop, as
the next Mets shortstop,'' Rodriguez told Seattle beat writers last
week. ``They can say what they want, they can write what they want.
What I'll tell you now is that I still consider Seattle No.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I really was dead set against returning, I would have done
what Griff (Ken Griffey Jr.) did and just come out and say it. But
I don't feel that way. If Pat (Gillick, GM) and Howard (Lincoln,
CEO) do what they should, there's a good chance that I will stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, what Rodriguez thinks Gillick and Lincoln ``should''
do is not only offer enough money, but also convince Rodriguez they
will do what it takes to be an annual contender. Here's the
contradiction: If the Mariners commit $200 million to Rodriguez,
how much money will be left to spend on other quality players?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in an environment year-in and year-out like my
buddy Derek (Jeter of the Yankees),'' Rodriguez said. ``It's not
that he knows he's going to the World Series every year. But he
knows his team is going to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Long dreams: Oakland A's rookie center fielder Terrence Long
wants to be in the playoffs. But he also has another goal: to win
the AL rookie of the year award, and the balance for him is to not
try to do too much while impressing the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I try not to think about it, but it's hard not to,''
Long said Friday. ``Getting to the playoffs is the thing I want,
but yes, it would be great to win the award.''
</P>
<P>
   Long is putting on an impressive campaign. He scored a run in
the first inning, giving him 98 to break Mark McGwire's team rookie
record.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was in the minors for the A's first 19 games,
Long could finish at .300 with 100 runs, 20 homers and 80 RBIs. He
is hitting .298 in 129 games and leads all rookies in average,
runs, hits, doubles, total bases, extra-base hits and multiple-hit
games.
</P>
<P>
   Long also is hitting .370 with runners in scoring position and
.558 with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Record quest: The Angels' Darin Erstad went into Saturday's game
with 97 RBI, one short of the all-time single-season record by a
leadoff hitter. Boston's Nomar Garciaparra had 98 RBI for the Red
Sox from the leadoff spot in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad also is nearing one of the greatest single-season hit
totals. Going into Saturday's game, he had 227 hits in 153 games, a
pace for 240. No one has reached 240 in a season since Wade Boggs
did it in 1985 for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   And if Erstad can reach 241, he would be the first to get that
many since 1930, when Bill Terry (254), Chuck Klein (250) and Babe
Herman (241) all did. Only 11 players in history have reached 241.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, Rickey: Seattle's Rickey Henderson entered
Saturday's game five walks short of Babe Ruth's all-time record of
2,062. Henderson, though, would have already broken the record if
not for a recent change to Ruth's record.
</P>
<P>
   After research by Elias Sports Bureau and long-time sports
writer/baseball historian Jerome Holtzman, the commissioner's
office added six walks to Ruth's total last year, upping it from
2,056.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Even though they don't know who their opponent will
be, the White Sox already have announced their starting pitcher for
the first game of the Division Series - Mike Sirotka. ... With
Derrick Turnbow starting Saturday's game, the Angels have used 15
different starters this season. ... Kansas City's Mike Sweeney has
set a club record with 139 RBI. &QL;

OBIT ASKS FOR BUSH VOTES IN LIEU OF FLOWERS
</HEADLINE>
 BUSH-TEX  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MELODY McDONALD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an unconventional request, but in keeping with their
father's outspoken character.
</P>
<P>
   When James E. Fete Sr. of Canton, Ohio, died of natural causes
Sept. 19 at age 71, his adult sons and daughter ran an obituary in
the ``Canton Repository.'' The obit listed the retired telephone
repairman's accomplishments: Korean War service and 39 years with
Ohio Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing out of the ordinary, until the last line:
</P>
<P>
   ``In lieu of flowers, Vote Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Fete (pronounced FATE), once a staunch Democrat, became a
diehard Republican 40 years ago. He never let the readers of the
``Repository's'' letters-to-the-editor column forget his strong
political views.
</P>
<P>
   Fete was ``anti-Gore and really anti-Clinton,'' said his eldest
son, James E. Fete Jr., explaining his father's support of Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   So when Fete's survivors composed his obituary, the political
appeal was a natural choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of bouquet of flowers, he would rather have a vote for
Bush,'' the son said Saturday, speaking by telephone from Canton.
``He would have also liked to have got the last word _ and he
did.''

<P>
   Aides to Gov. George W. Bush responded sharply Saturday to an
Associated Press report that law enforcement officials were
investigating whether someone in Bush's camp had leaked materials
about his debate preparations to an associate of Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director, said that
Bush's campaign manager, Joseph Allbaugh, was calling the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to complain. ``If they have identified a
suspect, Governor Bush would like to know,'' Hughes said. ``It is
completely inappropriate and wrong for the Justice Department to
play politics by leaking information in the midst of a presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press on
Friday that someone had been tentatively identified as a source of
the debate materials.
</P>
<P>
   The official would not say who it was, but said that early
evidence pointed to someone in the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was called in when a Gore adviser, Tom Downey, a former
member of Congress, alerted law enforcement officials on Sept. 13
that he had been sent the package of materials.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, who had been helping Gore in debate preparations,
recused himself from further debate-preparation sessions with Gore.

CANDIDATES BACK `SOFT MONEY' BAN IN NEW YORK RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio reached a
tentative agreement on Saturday to forgo the use of soft money for
advertising in the New York Senate race, but the deal included
several conditions and provisions that could derail it and came
just a day after talks on another proposal collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agreement _ it appears,'' Lazio said at his
headquarters Saturday night. ``I said that yesterday, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement Saturday night after Lazio's acceptance
of Clinton's proposal, her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said: ``Nine
months ago, Hillary Clinton called for the elimination of soft
money issue advertising and independent expenditures from this
race. We hope that today we have finally achieved her goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an offer made by Clinton during a campaign appearance in
Manhattan, both sides would place a ban on television and radio
advertisements paid for by political parties with so-called soft
money _ largely unregulated contributions that enable candidates to
circumvent legal limits on fund-raising. Clinton and Lazio would
also appeal to independent groups supporting them to refrain from
broadcasting ads on their behalf, leaving the campaign committees
as the only advertisers in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simple,'' Clinton said. ``We will keep soft-money issue
ads off the air if they keep theirs off the air. Just the two
campaign committees should be on the air advertising their
campaigns. If any supporters of either candidate should violate
this, the other side could respond proportionately.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she had secured the commitments of the various
Democratic Party organizations that would be affected by the
prohibition, as well as the Working Families Party and Liberal
Party, which have also endorsed her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lazio needed to do the same among Republicans and
Conservatives by Monday, a deadline Lazio said he could and would
meet.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would not take effect until Wednesday, Clinton said,
because the state Democratic Party has already bought television
ads on her behalf that run through Wednesday. Lazio's campaign
initially objected to the Wednesday deadline, saying the state ads
must be withdrawn by Monday, but Lazio backed off that demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the ads that she is airing right now should come
down by Monday; I think that would show good faith,'' the
congressman said Saturday night. ``But what is important here is
that it appears we have an agreement in principle to ban soft money
from both campaigns and keep all outside groups out. But it is
important, in the words of former President Ronald Reagan, that we
must trust and verify.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign said it liked Saturday's offer better than
Clinton's previous proposals because it dropped the requirements
that Lazio stop advertisements by groups that support him.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton suggested that Lazio should get written
assurances from those groups, but insisted she did not need to do
the same from groups that support her. She said Saturday that she
still believed there was a difference between groups that back her
candidacy and those that support his, but added that it was more
important to focus on the political parties' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Berger, a prominent Democratic election lawyer in New York
City, said enforcing the deal could prove to be its downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always maintained that she does not have the power
to stop independent groups from advertising on her behalf, and it
is unclear whether they will heed her call to stay out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plus is that it is a first step that may limit soft money
expenditures; it may in fact work,'' Berger said. ``The downside
is, if the advocacy groups simply don't go along with it, it may
break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the ban may also have come too late to have a big
effect on the race. ``It is very late. It is sort of like trying to
turn the Queen Mary around.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft money, which is raised by party committees for
get-out-the-vote and other party-building activities, is separate
from the so-called hard money raised directly by political
campaigns. Hard money is subject to federal limits _ $1,000 per
person _ while soft money can be collected in unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has relied heavily on soft-money contributions to pay
for advertisements on her behalf; Lazio has not raised soft money
for his Senate campaign, in part because he has been able to
collect large sums of hard money from people across the country
opposed to Mrs. Clinton and her husband.

NORTHRIDGE TACKLES PROBLEMS OF TURNOVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ True to his word, Cal State Northridge football
coach Jeff Kearin is taking measures to prevent turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, the Matadors were given the green light to
tackle to the ground in practice - something they usually don't do
to avoid injuries. However, a change was in order since CSUN is
averaging four turnovers a game.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of players - including running back Bruce Molock and
defensive back Steve Paysinger - sustained crushing hits and had to
be walked off the field by trainers. Both are OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly picked up the intensity,'' Kearin said.
``We've had more live periods where we're working on our execution
in a live situation and testing our toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times we're not sure (about our toughness) and at times
we're the toughest team I've seen. We need the consistency over
time. We have to perform at that toughness and level of execution
over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors had the luxury of withstanding hard hits since they
had a bye Saturday. But the week off also meant CSUN had to deal
with its disappointing 49-26 loss to Northern Arizona a little
longer. The Matadors (1-2, 0-1) aren't out of contention for the
Big Sky Conference title but they must figure out a way to get back
on track - and fast.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN and NAU were tied 21-21 at halftime, but three second-half
turnovers and miscues by the Matadors defense led to the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think where NAU beat us is heart and toughness,'' senior
receiver Gil Rodriguez said. ``They outplayed us in the second half
and outhit us. We can't play two quarters. We have to play four
full quarters - four full quarters of hitting and four full
quarters of holding on to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting rush: The CSUN coaching staff blanketed the area from
San Diego to Fresno on Friday and Saturday in an effort to attract
its recruiting class for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Northridge, it's as important for us to see as to be
seen,'' Kearin said. ``A lot of these kids don't want to think in
terms of I-AA football now. The vast majority of these kids that
sign believe they're I-A scholarship guys. We'll be gathering as
much information as we can as far as our needs and scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Wide receiver Drew Amerson is ahead of schedule
with rehabilitation on his bruised knee - an injury he suffered
Sept. 9. Amerson started riding the exercise bike on Wednesday.
There's a chance Amerson could play in Saturday's home game against
Idaho State but the Oct. 5 game at Weber State is a more likely
return date. ... Linebacker Ben Lorier (ankle), Jamaal Perry
(ankle) and D.J. Hackett (knee) are expected to be OK for Idaho
State.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin board material: Rodriguez and offensive lineman Keith
Kincaid plastered players' lockers with the Weekly Buzz, which runs
in The Daily Sundial - CSUN's student newspaper. Four students were
asked what they thought about the CSUN football team and the
responses were not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``(We) put it in their lockers to get the guys fired up,''
Rodriguez said. ``This is not high school football - it's college
football. It kind of motivated me. I don't want to lose anymore.

DISUSE DOOMING PAY PHONES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once a fixture on many corners, the pay phone has
become as rare as a rotary dial.
</P>
<P>
   Competition from wireless phones and long-distance calling cards
has driven down the number of public telephones by more than
300,000 since 1998, from 2.4 million to 2.1 million nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And while the average pay phone produced a little more than $200
a month two years ago, revenues today have dwindled to $150 a month
or less.
</P>
<P>
   Even Martin Mattes, counsel to the California Payphone
Association, said he doesn't use pay phones as much now as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use a cell phone. You might be paying more money for that
call, but it's worth it for the convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, there are 101,985,390 worldwide wireless subscribers -
a number that will skyrocket to 1 billion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones might pose the largest threat to their coin-operated
counterpart, but other factors also chip away at the pay phone's
time left on the streets, including service carriers failing to pay
the required amount to the pay phone providers, Mattes said. Plus,
he added, when the cost of maintaining the phone surpasses the
amount of money it is making, there's no point keeping it
connected.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone is sounding the death knell for pay phones.
``There's always going to be a need for a pay phone,'' said Vince
Sandusky, president of the American Public Communications Council,
a national association of independent pay phone providers that
keeps track of how the pay phone is faring in a fast-growing world
of wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be a market for 2 million of them, but I don't see
this as the demise of the pay phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting across the street from a public telephone, Julia Blythe
pulled her cell phone from her purse, checked her messages and
lined up evening plans without ever getting up from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old became a wireless user six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just too lazy to go and look for one,'' she said of pay
phones. ``And this is so convenient. I mean, it's right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bummer?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless phones, and their attractive packages offering
``buckets of minutes'' for nominal rates, have helped reduce pay
phone revenues, said Steve Getzug, spokesman for Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications, the parent company of Pacific Bell, isn't
worried, though, he said. Officials believe pay and wireless phones
complement each other and that there's room for both in the market.
Besides, not everyone has a wireless phone, he said, noting there
are places where pay phones are preferred - airports, shopping
malls, schools and the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 35 cents, a pay phone is still a bargain in some people's
books. You can talk until your voice runs dry on a local call, and
that's a pretty good deal,'' Getzug said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Public Communications Council, 95
percent of homes in the United States have telephone service.
Roughly 25 percent of the rural poor do not, Sandusky said. For
them, the only way to call friends, to dial 911, to make a doctor's
appointment or call for a job interview is to use the pay phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demographics suggest they'll put a phone in their home before
they'll buy a wireless,'' Sandusky said. ``There are a bunch of
people who still don't have wireless and probably never will. The
pay phone still has legs.''
</P>
<P>
   The two main lines of revenue for a pay phone are the coin box
and the compensation the provider receives from the carrier. An
example of compensation is when a caller uses 1-800 COLLECT or
1-800-CALL ATT, Mattes said, explaining that the latter is called
``dial-around compensation'' guaranteed by the Telecommunications
Act passed by Congress in 1996 and regulated by the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers must pay 24 cents to pay phone providers for
dial-around calls, but the providers do not always receive that
money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, two-thirds of a pay phone's revenue stems from coins
and one-third is generated from noncoin means. But pay phones at
airports and convention centers, where callers zip a credit card
through more technologically advanced systems, see higher profits
than phones stationed outside a convenience store or a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   And, Mattes added, the providers must pay fees to the owners of
the land where the phone is located.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated revenue a phone needs to produce to be profitable
is $200 to $300 a month. Installing a phone costs at least $500,
and that's with a simple enclosure. Add $1,000 in other fees, plus
$100 in labor, and the phone must net at least $200 a month just to
show a profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping coins into a pay phone, Delbert Gleason wanted to call
his son and ask what he wanted for dinner. He doesn't have a cell
phone and said he uses public phones about six times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Not for much longer, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a cell phone. I go to the desert a lot. There's no
pay phones out there,'' he said.
</P>

NOW, GREENE'S RESUME' IS GOLDEN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Move over, Charlie Paddock and Jesse Owens.
Make room, Jim Hines, Carl Lewis and Donovan Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the new member of your exclusive fraternity. His name is
Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Greene secured the final character reference on his Sprint
Immortals resume' Saturday, winning the gold medal in the 100-meter
dash at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic gold puts Greene past the screening committee. Beyond
all nitpicking or second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   No more calls, please, we have a winner.
</P>
<P>
   World-record holder, world champion, Olympic champion. Those are
bonafides that brook no discussion about Greene's place in sprint
history. He is running with fast company, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to set a world record or win a world championship
to make the club. Though it helps. You must, however, be an Olympic
champion, thereby gaining the appellation ``world's fastest
human,'' to gain admission.
</P>
<P>
   Greene turned heads when he began dominating the world sprint
scene in 1997. Then he set the world record. Twice. And doubled in
the 100 and 200 at the 1999 world championships, and anchored the
gold medal-winning sprint-relay team.
</P>
<P>
   But there were observers, such as Michael Johnson and Bailey -
and even Greene himself - who suggested he couldn't be considered
for the varsity until he went into the greatest arena of them all,
the Olympics, and left with gold around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Greene survived a mediocre start and powered past the opposition
to win the 100 gold in 9.87 seconds, the second-fastest winning
time in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of race Maurice ran tonight, we got destroyed,''
silver- medalist Ato Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was stuck in the pack when he shifted into what sprinters
call the ``drive phase'' and pulled away from Boldon (9.99) and
Obadele Thompson (10.04). And the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's .12-second margin of victory was the widest in the
Olympics 100 final since Lewis won by .20 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Greene reacted with emotion and humility. He clapped his hands
on his shaved head after he crossed the line, in a sort of ``I did
what?'' expression. He crouched and appeared to pray just past the
finish line. He hugged Boldon. He threw his shoes in the stands. He
took a lap of the stadium draped in an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   On the victory stand, he was a bundle of nerves. ``Actually, I
was trying not to cry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just overwhelmed with excitement,'' he said. ``Ato was
behind me saying, 'Don't cry, don't cry. Not yet.' It felt great
being up there on the medal stand hearing the United States
national anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, his post-race activities, a sort of catalog of ``sensitive
male'' behavior, stand in stark contrast to the popular image of
Maurice Greene. The image he seems to cultivate in the run-up to
big events.
</P>
<P>
   Trash-talker. Cock-of-the-walker. Chest-beating, self-promoting
tough guy. Characteristics that sometimes don't endear him to
competitors. Or casual observers.
</P>
<P>
   Greene carries that image right into the starting blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the moments before a race, he jumps, he dances. He rolls his
shoulders. He bobs his head and claps his hands. He sticks out his
tongue and talks to himself and grimaces.
</P>
<P>
   He looks rather like a football player preparing himself to make
a bone-jarring hit on the opening kickoff. Or a welterweight about
to climb into the ring with the world championship at stake.
</P>
<P>
   His prerace antics are more about the way he reacts to pressure.
``When I get nervous, my tongue comes out of my mouth, and I start
biting my lips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about trying to look fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Could have fooled us.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking, however, what Greene has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the world is watching,'' teammate Jon Drummond said,
``he's impossible to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   They know it on the European tour. They know it at the world
championships. And now they know it at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, Maurice. Welcome to the club. Say hello to
Charlie and Jesse for us.
</P>

DEWALT WINS THE PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston College junior wide receiver Dedrick Dewalt really loves
playing against the military academies. Two weeks ago at Army, he
had three catches for 122 yards and two touchowns.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in the Eagles' 48-7 victory against visiting Navy, the
5-foot-9-inch Dewalt (who says he feels like ``I'm 6-3 and that the
ball's mine'') collected six catches for 111 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm older now than I was a year ago, and I know what to expect
for the games,'' said Dewalt. ``I know how to approach games. I
know how to prepare for them, with my confidence helping me from
last year, and it's been a steady building.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewalt, who had 38 catches last season, has 11 receptions for
261 yards and a 23.7-yards-per-catch average. Dewalt, who clocks
the 40 in 4.4, is the veteran the Eagles are looking for to spark
the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   He has been patiently working with quarterback Tim Hasselbeck to
build a solid passing combination. ``We worked real hard during the
summer, during the offseason, ever since I've been here,'' said
Dewalt. ``Having man-to-man against me surprised me (and gave) me a
lot of room on the flank. And then along the sidelines, we gave
each other the eye, to let him know that I will probably be right
there on the pass, with Navy giving me the outside, but I was
always able to be inside the coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   His first TD came on a 30-yard pass with 1:08 remaining in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a post-route move, moving to the middle; the guy came
back underneath me,'' Dewalt said. ``And then on my second
touchdown catch for 37 yards, I just put on the move to make the
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Dewalt thought he had a 40-yard catch but
it was ruled incomplete. ``The ref said I caught it and the other
game official said it fell incomplete,'' said Dewalt, who did well
on a punt return, too (37 yards). ``It's something I've been
working hard on all of last week. I was kept back there, and I
improved with my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewalt likes what Boston College has done the last two games,
with the 55-17 victory at Army and Saturday's triumph after a 34-14
setback at West Virginia to open the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last two games got our confidence going again, reaching
back,'' he said. ``We've taken the last two games to heart.''

OWNER OF THIS MESS MUST ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Harrington (it's been so long since I've talked to you,
I feel a little awkward calling you John):
</P>
<P>
   I know you've had a rough summer, spending long hours on winning
support for your field of dreams. Personally, and I mean this
sincerely, I hope you succeed in your venture.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Harrington, I think you need to put the fund-raising on
hold for a little while. Maybe you've been too busy to notice, sir,
but your ball club has gone to hell the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Missing the playoffs is the least of your worries. Your general
manager, Dan Duquette, has sold out your manager, Jimy Williams,
one of the most honorable and respected men in the game, in order
to pander to your center fielder, Carl Everett, a guy who doesn't
even care that his own teammates have little respect for him.
</P>
<P>
   It may just be urban legend, sir, but one of your fans swears
that he was sitting in the bleachers Friday night and saw one of
your relief pitchers clapping when Everett struck out as a pinch
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's true or not,'' another player said
Saturday, ``but you know what? There probably are some other guys
in here who would have liked to have clapped, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Strictly from a business perspective, I don't think that's the
best way for you to drum up $650 million for your new playpen,
sacrificing Williams on the altar of Everett, who somehow has
become more important around here, at least to your general
manager, than Nomar Garciaparra and Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   You may not know this, but Nomar has been playing hurt for
weeks. And Pedro's legacy may forever be coming out of the bullpen
in Cleveland last October with a bad shoulder and pitching no-hit
ball for six innings. You won the American League Division Series
that night.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's legacy? Well, he's going to have a hard time living
down what he did Thursday, showing up an hour before a
make-or-break doubleheader with the Indians, erupting in anger when
he saw his name in the lineup, announcing that he couldn't play,
cursing your manager to anyone within earshot, then nearly coming
to blows with Darren Lewis, who dared to question Everett's
commitment to the team to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette would have you believe it's a tardiness issue, sir. But
that's just the beginning of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about winning,'' one of your players said Saturday.
``This guy shows up an hour before one of our most important games
of the season and says he can't play. He didn't come in for
treatment, he didn't even try to see if he could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find stars around the game who show up late, but I
have never, ever seen that, a guy who showed his teammates he
didn't even care.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, as class a guy as you'll ever find in this or any other
clubhouse, won't say exactly what it was he told Everett, but I can
you assure you, that was the essential message. Everett's response?
Lewis was disrespecting him.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't surprise Williams that Lewis said something to
Everett. ``Darren Lewis is a winner,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   What does that make Everett? I don't know. All I know is that
for all his wonderful talent, which far eclipses the gifts Lewis
has, your team is staying home this October. Lewis played on two
teams that went to the postseason for you.
</P>
<P>
   And now Williams isn't taking it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was general manager, I certainly would back the
manager,'' Williams said Saturday after making a phone call to
Duquette's office and leaving a message that he was going to say
his piece. ``Now if you can't back the manager, then you probably
need to get rid of him. That's what you need to do, and get
somebody you can back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You separate a team with one player, and it's basically going
against the thoughts of the manager and the focus of the team in
trying to win. It becomes very difficult. So, with the statements
that have been made, I feel like I'm kind of backed into a
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, you may disagree, but to me that sounds like definitive
evidence that there's a problem between your manager and your GM.
Duquette would have you think that the media made it all up. That's
something Duquette and Everett have in common. The minute they're
held accountable for their actions, they blame it all on the media.
</P>
<P>
   You remember that sports management consultant you hired back in
1996 to meet with Duquette and your manager at the time, Kevin
Kennedy, in an effort to iron out their problems? I hope you saved
his phone number, because the problems between Duquette and
Williams make the Kennedy-Duke spat look like batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   I might be wrong, but when the consultant delivered his report
to you four years ago, he told you your GM was a big part of the
problem. But you backed your GM when he fired Kennedy, just as you
backed him when Roger Clemens and Mo Vaughn left.
</P>
<P>
   Remember what Duquette said back then? Let me jog your memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This catering to stars doesn't work. We're trying to change.
The formula for winning isn't one star and the rest of the Red Sox.
Boston has always catered to the stars, always. And that's not the
best way for success. We're trying to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said that in 1997. I don't know, sir, but it seems to
me he was either lying then, or is a hypocrite now.
</P>
<P>
   Let me remind you of another statement that came from your
organization. When Tomo Ohka and Sunny Kim, your two gifted Asian
pitchers, came to blows this summer in Pawtucket, they were both
suspended. Your organization issued a high-minded press release
that stated the Sox have ``zero tolerance for conduct that includes
hostility between co-workers on or off the field. The organization
makes every effort to foster a workplace where each individual
treats each other with dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet on a night when Everett curses your manager and nearly comes
to blows with a teammate, Duquette stands in front of the media and
says no disciplinary action will be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Harrington, your players are weary of talking about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem, obviously,'' catcher Scott Hatteberg said.
``It's not a big thing, but yes, the last incident, yeah there are
things that need to be worked out. Whether or not they can be, I
don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a guy like Darren Lewis, who I respect as much as
anybody I've ever met in the game, upset, there's something that is
wrong. Whether it's reparable, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between Williams and Duquette creates its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that there's so many hands in the pot here,''
Hatteberg said. ``You don't know who is making calls or doing what.
Guys need to play on the field, but they also need to get along.
There are too many of us who are working too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn was as good as anybody on the field and I didn't
think he was that bad around here, but that seemed to be the reason
they got rid of him. I understand being a superstar like (Everett)
is, Pedro is, Nomar is, we know there will be extra demands on
their time. But there are rules that are in place, not only for us
but for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where it has gotten in the clubhouse with Everett: ``We
look at it as there are 24 of us,'' one player said, ``and if he
wants to play, great.''
</P>
<P>
   I assure you, Mr. Harrington, Williams isn't going to quit. He's
no fool. He understands that Duquette would like nothing better
than for him to quit, regardless of what he might say. How can you
any longer attach any credibility to what Duquette says, when he
still went on TV Saturday and said there were no problems between
Williams and himself?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how much respect Duquette has for Williams. According to
the manager Saturday, Duquette had not discussed the Everett matter
with him, two days after it happened. That is shameful.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette claims that Everett will cease to be a problem once he
learns to report on time. He doesn't even realize how ridiculous
that sounds, coming at the end of the season. If Everett hasn't
figured that out by now, what makes anyone think he's going to
figure it out later?
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Everett stood in front of his locker and said he owes
no one an apology. Not his manager, not his teammates, surely not
the reporters he has cursed, nor the umpire he bumped. Everett has
to apologize to no man. He sits in the back of the plane on team
flights and talks about how the whole world disrespects him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to him, you're talking to a guy who thinks he's
always right,'' one teammate said, ``when the reality is he is
almost never right.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is going to make Duquette fire him. And as much as
people might gripe about some of the moves Williams makes in the
dugout, they know him to be a man of unassailable integrity. And
Duquette now knows he will be barbecued if he fires Williams.
</P>
<P>
   When Duquette was defending Everett Thursday night, one of the
things he mentioned was that ``the fans like him.'' But fans still
believe in some of the old-fashioned values, too, like having some
respect for your boss and your teammates. It was no accident Friday
night that when Everett pinch hit, the fans booed him.
</P>
<P>
   Would they have cheered if he had hit a home run instead of
striking out? Sure. But will they ever feel about him the way they
do about Nomar or Pedro or even Mo? Not a chance. And it won't be
because of anything the media reports. Everett prides himself on
being his own man. Well, his own actions, unfiltered by the media,
will speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Harrington, I know we have had our differences. I admit
there have been times you may have been justified in feeling that I
have been unfair to you.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm suggesting that you need to intercede now, sir, and try
to salvage some dignity out of this sorry mess, because I was born
a New Englander, and for good or for bad, I _ like you _ was raised
to care about the Olde Towne Team.
</P>
<P>
   I hope to see you at the ballpark, sir. In case you've been too
busy to notice, Sunday is the last time this season the Sox will
play at Fenway Park, the place that brings you to tears when you
talk about someday having to tear it down. This place can't be
spared a wrecking ball. But maybe it's not too late to save your
team.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely, &QL; 
Gordon Edes

EAGLES' AIR ATTACK TOO MUCH FOR NAVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Boston College shellacked Army. Saturday, the
Eagles bombarded Navy. Is there any chance of getting Air Force on
the schedule?
</P>
<P>
   With a tough Big East game looming Saturday against a
well-rested Virginia Tech team that enjoyed an open date Saturday,
BC improved its record to 2-1 after scoring its second consecutive
victory in three weeks against a service academy opponent. After
blasting Army, 55-17, two weeks ago at Michie Stadium, the Eagles
came back from a week off to execute a 48-7 aerial bombardment of
Navy in Saturday's home opener before an Alumni Stadium crowd of
42,681.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're in the big leagues next week and we have to
improve a lot,'' BC coach Tom O'Brien said about the fifth-ranked
Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   Senior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck completed 20 of 28 passes for
a career-high 355 yards Saturday, connecting with junior Dedrick
Dewalt on six passes for 111 yards, including touchdown plays of 30
and 37 yards that helped the Eagles build a 24-7 lead in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Senior running back Cedric Washington recorded his second
consecutive 100-yard effort and the seventh of his career, carrying
24 times for 107 yards, including a 5-yard TD run. William Green
added 58 yards on 12 carries, scoring on runs of 1 and 3 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Eagles sandwiched 14-point quarters in the first and
fourth around 10-point eruptions in the second and third to run 80
offensive plays for a season-high 625 yards total offense. It was
BC's biggest offensive output since a 610-yard effort in a 32-31
home loss to Navy two years ago. In its games with Army and Navy,
BC has put up a gaudy aggregate of 158 plays, 1,212 yards total
offense, 103 points.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Hasselbeck intoned, that should be kept in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two teams we beat don't have any wins between them, so
that kind of brings you down to reality a little bit,'' said
Hasselbeck, who has connected on 47 of 73 passes for 730 yards and
six touchdowns this season. ``You have to understand that, but at
the same time, you can walk away with some confidence and some
experience, and guys are getting a feel of what it's like to make
plays out there, and that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the offense was buoyed by its production of late, the
young and inexperienced Eagles defense only seemed to become more
challenged with the loss of starting linebackers Scott Bradley and
Ryan Burch to knee injuries, forcing redshirt freshman J.D. Schmidt
to step in as the only middle linebacker left on the BC sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably going to lose Bradley and Burch a couple of
weeks,'' said O'Brien. ``Both of them have to have MRIs.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were tough already as junior linebacker Andy Romanowsky,
Burch's backup, suffered an ankle sprain in Thursday's practice and
was not available and senior cornerback D.J. Sutton was also out
after falling ill earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing threes now,'' O'Brien said. ``Someone was
yelling at me to put the subs in and they were in. They were
starting.''
</P>
<P>
   And O'Brien was pleased with the way his defense responded. The
Eagles held Navy to 223 yards total offense, forced three fumbles
(with Lenny Walls and Frank Misurelli each making a recovery), and
completely dominated the Midshipmen in the third quarter by
allowing six plays for 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles took 6 minutes 6 seconds to build a 17-0 lead on
Green's 1-yard run, Dewalt's brilliant 30-yard grab (despite
defensive interference by Navy cornerback Marcus Jackson), and Mike
Sutphin's 39-yard field goal, before Navy scored its only TD of the
game on a 12-yard run by Rashad Jamal with 6:28 left in the half.
Dewalt's second TD rallied the Eagles to a 24-7 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Sutphin added a 24-yard field goal, and Washington followed with
a 5-yard TD run in the third before the Eagles closed out the
scoring with Green's 3-yard TD and Brian St. Pierre's 6-yard TD
pass to Josh Cervi with 8:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed of (Navy's spread option offense) caught us
off-guard, which it was going to do after not playing for two
weeks,'' said O'Brien. ``Once we caught up to it, we did a better
job.''
</P>
<P>
   But the survivors of BC's injury-riddled defense will have to do
a much better job if they expect to contain Michael Vick, the
mercurial quarterback of Virginia Tech's explosive offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of challenges coming up,'' said senior free
safety RaMon Johnson. ``But we've got a lot of young talent on this
team and hopefully we'll play as hard as we did today.'' If not
harder.

POWER IS POINTING TO THE WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here at the Globe, we jokingly refer to ourselves as the junior
varsity in the presence of our esteemed colleagues from the mother
ship, The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the majority of teams in the NBA also should feel now
that Patrick Ewing has gone to Seattle to make a tough division and
conference even more powerful. That tilt you may have just felt was
the top-heavy West getting stronger and the JV East getting, well,
more JV.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the NBA might consider adopting the Italian League
format, adding the Spurs and Heat to the Pacific Division, throwing
out the Warriors and Clippers, and letting everyone else battle for
scraps. You'd have seven teams in A1 and everyone else in A2. That
includes Indiana and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Put yourself in the shoes of Golden State general manager Garry
St. Jean. He can look at the Eastern Conference and figure his
team, if healthy, would be a viable playoff contender. He can look
at his team in the Western Conference and book nonrefundable
airfare to the Cape for the weekend of April 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're going to be better,'' said St. Jean, going out on
a limb after last year's glittering 19-63 submission. But he's
right. They will be better. It just won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our division,'' St. Jean continued, ``is as good as any
division in, what, the last 15 years? And our conference is as deep
as I can ever remember. Night in and night out, there are going to
be great games. The power is in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been the case in the post-Jordan era, and it sure
doesn't look like anything has changed. The two best teams in the
league last year, the Lakers and Portland, both improved. The 1999
NBA champion, San Antonio, improved. The Sonics have improved with
the addition of Ewing. The Suns feel they are better after last
week's megatrade simply because they replaced a slug (Luc Longley)
with a stiff (Chris Dudley).
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected more of Luc, and we didn't have very high
expectations,'' said Suns boss Jerry Colangelo in a real show of
support for his ex-center. ``But I think we're a better team now
than we were before the deal. Dudley, warts and all, still gives
you toughness, rebounding, and shot-blocking capabilities. And I
like what Seattle did. I like a team that's willing to take risks.
But that's what you have to do out here. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   We haven't even gotten to Utah, Sacramento, or Houston, the
latter of which can throw Steve Francis and Maurice Taylor at you
and still will have a hard time making the playoffs. Dallas could
win a division title in the Central and still not crack the top
eight in the West. Minnesota? Its team slogan should be ``the
writing's on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, you have the JV East, in which the Celtics will be
pressed to crack the not-so-great eight.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, last year's JV entrant in the Finals, is not as strong
and may be further weakened if Rik Smits hangs 'em up. Did the
Knicks bring a laugh track to accompany the remarks that they were
going to war with their new roster, featuring Longley and Glen
Rice? Philadelphia may be better simply because it did nothing (a
strange feat given Larry Brown's historically itchy trigger finger)
and Orlando is better, but by how much?
</P>
<P>
   Miami is, right now, in a class by itself, although it remains
to be seen whether Brian Grant can survive Pat Riley's boot camp.
Grant has never averaged 32 minutes a game; Riles wants him to play
35.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he may only need to go 20. After all, he'll be
playing most of his games against the junior varsity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Packing his bags?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pack never wanted to be included in the four-way trade
last month that landed him and the disabled Hot Rod Williams in
Boston. There was considerable discussion during negotiations about
Pack's situation, including, but not limited to, his apparent
tendency to be tardy for practice with the Nets. There's also his
contract situation: He'll be a free agent, and even if he delivers
a boffo season, he has come to a team that won't re-sign him.
That's why there's still talk of sending Pack to Denver. Dan Issel,
the Nuggets coach/GM, remains one of the few people in the league
who still think Pack can play. In addition, Pack would have a
better chance of playing in Denver as Nick Van Exel's backup and,
by extension, of re-signing there . . . The NBA actually approved
Joe Smith's one-year contract with the Timberwolves, but did so
knowing that the deal will get voided in arbitration. The league
did the same thing with Dudley's wink-wink deal with Portland a few
years back, but lost that one in arbitration. That won't happen
this time. Smith, meanwhile, is said to be all but signed, sealed,
and delivered to Dallas once the arbitration decision makes him a
free agent . . . As the Celtics had hoped, Kris Clack decided to
play this season in Italy. The Celtics retain his rights. Clack
played well during the summer but still faced long odds to make the
team . . . The comeback story of Bobby Hurley, which looked
promising, probably won't happen at all. Hurley was scheduled to
play for the Celtics' summer league entry in July with an eye
toward getting into someone's veterans camp. But Hurley wasn't fit
enough to play and he still isn't. His agent, Mike Higgins, reports
that his client will now consider retirement and try to catch on in
the coaching business . . . I thought last year's first-round NBA
playoff schedule was ridiculous (and it was) and then I saw the
grueling Major League Soccer postseason schedule. The Revolution
and Fire needed eight days to play three games . . . It has become
fashionable to point out David Falk's tough summer (which was even
tougher until the Rice/Ewing deal went down). Cited as one example
is Taylor's settling for the mid-level exception ($2.25 million) in
Houston when the Rockets had a valid trade exception of $4.5
million. ``I wanted to use the exception and I told David that we
could do a sign-and-trade with Elgin (Baylor, the Clippers' general
manager),'' said Carroll Dawson, the Rockets' executive vice
president of basketball operations. ``David said he didn't want it.
He said he'd prefer to roll the dice and see what happens next
summer when we have some cap room. A lot of people were after
(Taylor). I think we were lucky to get him.'' Houston still has its
trade exception, which expires Oct. 3. Dawson said the Rockets will
not use it unless they can obtain a ``building block'' for the
future. (The exception has to be used in a trade.) ``Also, we've
got to get under the cap to retain the guys we have now,'' he said,
referring to Taylor and Shandon Anderson, both of whom will be
looking for big paydays after coming to Houston for short money
(NBA currency). There's also the matter of Hakeem Olajuwon, who is
in the final year of his contract. ``Dream is looking forward to
the season,'' Dawson said. ``He just has to find a way to whip the
asthma he had last year. That really slowed him down last year.'' .
. . You have to wonder why the Hawks are so hesitant to deal
Dikembe Mutombo to the Knicks (unless, of course, they don't want
to help a conference foe). Or, let's put it another way. Why would
Mutombo want to stay? The Hawks have blown it up and are starting
over. They are going to be bad this year with or without Mutombo,
and have already said they are pointing to next summer when they
plan to have cap room to pursue free agents. But that cap room
disappears in a hurry with Mutombo's weighty contract on the books,
unless he is quickly re-signed before the Hawks pursue any free
agents. Until he is re-signed, his cap hold for the 2001-02 season
will be an astronomical $21.6 million. That's more than half of the
projected $42.7 million cap. Throw in Alan Henderson, Lorenzen
Wright, and some of the young kids and there goes the cap room.
However, if Mutombo were traded, the Hawks' cap room would reemerge
in that the salaries of the players coming aboard likely would be
much less than his cap hold.

<P>
   Greece is slippery
</P>
<P>
   What did the NBA know and when did they know it? That's what
lawyers for the Greek team AEK asked at last Thursday's arbitration
proceeding in London pertaining to the future of center Iakovos
``Jake'' Tsakalidis. Is he 23 or 21? The NBA says it doesn't
matter, even though, in its own arbitration brief, it lists
Tsakalidis as 23, which, under NBA rules, would have made him
ineligible for last June's draft. (Phoenix took him in the first
round.) The reason it doesn't matter is that Tsakalidis, the NBA,
and the Players Association all met before the draft and agreed he
was 21 and thus eligible. OK. But AEK has what sure looks like a
league memo from six weeks before the draft, which dealt with an
anonymous letter questioning Tsakalidis's age and background. A
copy was sent to then-operations chief Rod Thorn, who forwarded it
to the legal department. Also cut in for a copy of the anonymous
letter (which was addressed to New York Post columnist Peter
Vecsey) was union head Billy Hunter. The league's arbitration
brief, meanwhile, had all the ingredients of a LeCarre novel,
mentioning that Tsakalidis was plucked out of Soviet Georgia by a
greedy Greek agent, supplied with false passports and other bogus
data, and then, magically, became a Greek citizen. He then was told
to sign a contract he had not read, nor could read, because it was
in Greek and he couldn't speak or understand the language. But he
was listed as a Greek national on the AEK roster. The NBA contends
that the contract Tsakalidis has with AEK is invalid because the
center didn't know what he was signing and that it violated FIBA
regulations regarding the number of ``foreigners'' (non-Greeks in
this case) allowed on one team. Thursday's arbitration lasted about
10 hours and both sides have until Tuesday to submit further
information. A decision is due Friday, but the Suns remain hopeful
something can be worked out before then. Colangelo said the Suns
have tried to be accommodating, offering exhibitions and clinics in
Greece (where Scott Skiles coached) as well as the league-allowed
maximum of $350,000 to settle the issue. He said AEK has been
obstinate. ``Their requests were ludicrous,'' Colangelo said,
preferring not to elaborate. ``There were things they wanted that
we could not do. Hopefully, we can get it settled. We think Jake is
a terrific prospect.''

NO BURNING REASON TO ADD GOLF TO GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, we don't need to add golf to the Olympics. This bad idea has
been talked about for years, and talk was rekindled this past week
when David Fay, executive director of the US Golf Association,
threw his support behind the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, people have looked at the notion of Olympic
golf and said, `Why should we do it?' '' Fay said after attending a
meeting of the World Amateur Golf Council. ``That frustrates me. I
ask, `Why shouldn't we do it?' I haven't come up with one reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this is a guy whose extravagantly rich organization
saw fit to restructure the US Public Links Championship so that
less money was available for travel, meaning fewer players _ many
of whom are at the heart of this game _ got to play. Yet he's
willing to get involved with a group that spends lavishly on
pampered athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But that is straying somewhat from the point, which is Fay's
search for a reason. He wants one; let's give him three.
</P>
<P>
   1. Patriotism in soft spikes? Golf already stuffs a ton of it
into cups of all shapes, sizes, and names. Ryder Cup, Presidents
Cup, Solheim Cup, Walker Cup, Curtis Cup, Palmer Cup, PGA Cup,
World Cup, Dunhill Cup, Junior Ryder Cup _ here a cup, there a cup,
everyhere a cup, cup. Then there's the World Junior and the recent
World Team Amateur, which offered a glimpse of the drama Olympic
golf would deliver: Team Slovakia took 1,052 strokes over 16 rounds
to finish last among 59 teams, a mere 211 shots behind the winners,
the Americans. Radoslav Sip and Peter Wieger posted Slovakia's best
score _ 85s. You want to rush right out, wave the flag, and sing
``God Bless America'' when you slap around Slovakia, Estonia,
Croatia, Latvia, Greece, Luxembourg, Costa Rica et al on the golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who's going to play? The touring pros? Sure, they'll line up
to skip the British Open for a chance to beat up on some Tunisian,
10 and 8. (This year is an aberration; the Summer Olympics are
normally in the dead of summer, right when players are gearing up
for the British and the PGA.) The BUY.com stars? The minitour guys?
Club pros? Does anyone feel a pulse of excitement? What about
amateurs? OK, go with them and what happens when the US loses?
Typical of us, there'd be a huge outcry to fix this catastrophe and
before you know it, we'd steal away childhoods _ just as they do in
gymnastics and figure skating _ all in the name of winning.
</P>
<P>
   3. Golf is, at its very core, a sport of honor and integrity,
and there isn't an ounce of honor or integrity left in the
Olympics. Bribes, scandals, drugs, and a sort of media extortion
(cover our trials if you want credentials) are the norm. Do you
want to associate with people like that?
</P>
<P>
   Golf leaders in recent years have tackled issues that are far
more crucial to the sport than whether or not to march alongside
some synchronized swimmer. Why are people leaving the game at such
a high rate? How do you get kids into the game? Where do they play?
Why isn't equipment more affordable?
</P>
<P>
   Golf in the Olympics? Not ahead of ballroom dancing. And when
ballroom dancing gets in, golf takes a back seat to dominoes, kite
flying, and bungee jumping.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Solheim time
</P>
<P>
   The Solheim Cup approaches. While it's not the Ryder Cup, it's
intense stuff for the women, and the US team will be finalized this
weekend. The top eight _ Juli Inkster, Meg Mallon, Rosie Jones,
Dottie Pepper, Sherri Steinhauer, Pat Hurst, Kelly Robbins, and
Michele Redman _ are locks, leaving Nancy Scranton (ninth) and
Becky Iverson (10th) looking over their shoulders at Cristie Kerr
(11th), Kelli Kuehne (12th), Beth Daniel (13th), and Betsy King
(14th). After the final round of the Safeway LPGA Golf Championship
Sunday, Pat Bradley will name her two captain's picks for the Oct.
6-8 competition in Scotland . . . It's early, of course, but Nick
Faldo's publicized vow to challenge for an automatic berth on next
year's Ryder Cup team is off to a strong start. After two events
he's in fifth place, though he's not playing in this week's
Belgacom Open . . . Ron Philo Jr. of the Country Club of Vermont
fell two shots shy of making it through the first stage at European
Tour Qualifying School . . . You want a week of highs and lows?
Consider Roger Wessels of South Africa. Last week he opened with a
63 at the Trophee Lancome, then missed the cut with an 81. This
week he shot 70 to start the Belgacom Open, then followed it up
with a 64.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Summertime blues
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame Laura Torrisi for wanting school to start.
Things just didn't go well for the 1999 WGAM Player of the Year,
now a senior at Campbell College in North Carolina. ``It just
didn't seem like a great summer, tournamentwise,'' said the
21-year-old lefthander from Lunenberg, who plays out of Sterling.
She hurt her wrist early in the summer, missed some competition,
then seemed to be getting into the swing of things when she was
sidelined again, this time with a cyst. ``I had just started
swinging pretty well, so it was frustrating. I worked with my pro
(Jacques Panet-Raymond of Stow Acres) on my connection _ I tend to
clear my hips a little before my hands _ and was just getting it
when I had to stop playing.'' Feeling better, Torrisi was tied for
eighth in Campbell's first tournament of the year, shooting
72-79_151 to help her squad finish second. Torrisi will graduate
with a degree in sports management, then tackle a heavy golf
schedule next summer. If things go well, LPGA Tour Qualifying
School would be in her plans in the fall of 2001, ``but if my game
is not where I think it should be,'' Torrisi said, she would hold
off on a pro attempt for another year . . . On the men's collegiate
front, the University of Rhode Island was seventh out of 12 teams
at an event hosted by the University of Minnesota. ``We got some
kids some experience and I got a chance to see how we stack up
against national competition,'' said Tom Drennan, coach of New
England's perennial golf power. Newcomers Tom Giles (74-75-75) of
Stow, a transfer from Liberty, and David Spitz of Norwell
(80-75-74), a freshman, finished T-11 and T-24, respectively, and
gave Drennan plenty of reasons for optimism. Michael Carbone of
Brewster, a sophomore who played regularly last year, did not make
the trip, but he figures prominently in Drennan's plans this year .
. . In Wake Forest's first tournament of the year, sophomore Brent
Wanner of Chatham shot 74-71-75 to finish in the middle of the pack
as the Deacons were tied for seventh in the 14-team field . . . Joe
Cunningham, a sophomore from Manchester, is playing for the
University of Richmond, which won the Navy Fall Classic recently.
Cunningham shot 74-78. Rollins College, with Rob Oppenheim of
Andover contributing a 2-over 73 on the second day, finished third.

</P>
<P>
   Crowd control
</P>
<P>
   Fall golf? There's plenty of it, starting with Monday's 47th
annual Boston Globe Tournament of Club Champions at Brae Burn CC in
West Newton. When it began in 1954 and for most of the ensuing
years, the process was simple _ secure a venue, make tee times, and
honor the lowest scorer. Ah, but times have changed, and like most
competitive events on the calendar, the T of CC has become heavily
oversubscribed. Paring the field has become a nightmare (some 200
entries for 129 spots this year), what with so many players walking
around with handicaps that look like temperature readings for a
cold winter's night, and while we struggle with solutions, that
still leaves dozens of guys who aren't happy as they sit outside
looking in. The MGA, WGAM, and just about every quality local event
_ from the Cronin Memorial to the Hornblower to the Norfolk County
Classic _ have faced the same problem at one time or another: too
few spots for too many players. Enemies are easily made, but
golfers being golfers, they rarely blame themselves even though
many of them are a tad out of line with their handicaps. At the
heart of any golf competition is the USGA index, and that can be an
accurate reflection only when a golfer uses the handicap system the
way it was meant to work _ which is to hand in all scores, even if
they are high tournament numbers. Gentlemen, let's curb the egos
and reintroduce humility and honor to the game _ even if it means a
handicap going up . . . Also on tap Monday is Round 1 of the Cape
Cod Senior Open at Cape Cod CC. The second and final round will be
Tuesday at Hyannis GC, and the field includes defending champ Bob
Green, the head pro at Tedesco CC; Paul Parajeckas of Woburn CC;
Tom Cavicchi of Wollaston GC; longtime force Paul Barkhouse; the
legendary Bob Crowley of Pine Brook; Tom Sullivan of Wyantenuck,
who lost in a playoff last year; four-time NEPGA Wogan Award winner
Jeff Bailey; and two-time State Open champ Charlie Volpone . . .
After four qualifiers, a field of 120 was finalized for the State
Mid-Am Championship, which will be held Wednesday and Thursday at
Sterling CC. On those same days, the New England PGA Individual
Match Play Championship will take place at Prouts GC in
Scarborough, Maine. The 16 competitors qualified via the recent New
England Open . . . Finally, at Wollaston GC in Milton, members are
putting together plans for an Oct. 28-29 tournament that will be a
challenge to their emotions yet a tribute to their spirit. The Carl
E. Leone Trophy Competition will honor the longtime club member who
was tragically killed last January in a motorcycle accident. Notice
about tournaments of this nature come across the desk all the time,
each one a wonderful cause, none more important than the other, but
this one hit home. Leone was a high school classmate of mine (North
Quincy, 1974). His sport was football, mine was baseball, but here
we were 25 years later crossing paths because our passion had
turned to golf. They say you meet the greatest people in golf and
in the case of Leone, that is a correct assessment, even if it more
accurately was a reintroduction.

GOOD RACE BUT THE WRONG ROUND
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Everything about Jon Drummond's race was
perfect. Everything except his timing.
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals of the Olympic 100 meters Saturday, the
32-year-old Los Angeles resident clocked 10.10 seconds to finish
between training partners Maurice Greene (10.06) and Ato Boldon
(10.13).
</P>
<P>
   If it had been the finals, it would have been a clean sweep of
the medals for the UCLA-based HSI team. The way Drummond bolted out
of the blocks and beamed at the finish, it boded well for the
would-be Broom Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the semifinal that Jon Drummond had, I thought he had a
very good chance,'' Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
   To win, he meant.
</P>
<P>
   Only Drummond's legs remained noncommittal. In the 90 minutes
between the semifinal heat and the finals, they lost their
resilience. The best Drummond could drum up in the finals was a
10.09 that felt a whole lot harder than his semifinal effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could do it all again, I'd run like I did in the
semifinals. But I can't so I've just got to get over it,'' said
Drummond, who wound up fifth, behind Greene (9.87), Boldon (9.99),
Obadele Thompson of Barbados (10.04) and Great Britain's Dwain
Chambers (10.08).
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the race, Drummond's body language spoke of
his disappointment at missing out on a medal by .05-seconds. He
slowed to a walk with his head drooping and stopped a few feet from
where Greene and Boldon were locked in a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond stood frozen for a few seconds. At length he dropped to
his knees and then to the track where he lay staring vacantly at
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Jon just kind of standing there,'' Boldon said, ``I
went up and hugged him and said, 'You know what? You showed me the
way, I showed Maurice the way and you are an inspiration to us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Drummond could be a hurdler for all the obstacles he has
overcome on the road here. He was born with spina bifida and over
the past few years has been sidelined with everything from leg
cramps to viral meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand scheme of things, he guessed, a fifth-place finish
wasn't worth singing the blues over (although Drummond could do it
beautifully; he has sung with the gospel group Kirk Kranklin and
the Family).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't look at what happened to me and be sad,'' said the
two-time Olympian, who didn't make it out of the semifinals in the
100 in Atlanta in 1996. ``Jon Drummond was in an Olympic final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy. I'm healthy. God gets the glory because I gave it
all I had. I gave Maurice the best race I could give him. Jon
Drummond put his best foot forward. I can walk away with my head
held high.''

RAHAL SHIFTING GEARS TO FORMULA ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest development this past week at Indianapolis
Motor Speedway wasn't the much-anticipated arrival of Formula One
stars Michael Schumacher, Mika Hakkinen, and David Coulthard for
Sunday's inaugural US Grand Prix at the fabled Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it seemed to be the news that Bobby Rahal, who for
several months has held the dual role of car owner and interim
chief executive officer of Championship Auto Racing Teams, had
agreed to a three-year deal to become CEO and team principal of the
Jaguar Racing Formula One team.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal, 47, will continue to fields cars for CART drivers Max
Papis and Kenny Brack, leaving the day-to-day operation of Team
Rahal to general manager Scott Roembke, who took over supervision
when Rahal was tabbed this year to succeed Andrew Craig as CART's
CEO on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I always said it was interim,'' said Rahal when asked
what his departure to Formula One would mean to CART's future. ``I
don't think I ever conveyed in any way, shape, or form to anyone
that it was anything but that. I also said at times that no man is
more important than the sport. And to say that by my changing from
not being the CEO that somehow everything is going to come to a
grinding halt I think is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is an executive search going on right now.
The level of interest in the position is extremely high. I think
probably better than at any time in the past. I view my position in
the last several months as nothing more than getting the company
ready for a permanent CEO, and that's happening. So I think that,
as I said, I'd take a very different look than some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying this is a great thing. There are
some naysayers out there, but I believe that ultimately in the long
term CART is going to be stronger for it and I think certainly Team
Rahal, Bobby Rahal is going to be stronger for it. If I do my job,
Jaguar Formula One will be stronger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Indy 500 winner, who won three championships and 24
races as a driver on the CART circuit, will take on the new
challenge of heading up Jaguar Racing's Formula One enterprise,
which will field cars for drivers Eddie Irvine and rookie Luciano
Burti next season. The switch from CART to F1 represents something
of a dream realized for Rahal, who competed in Formula 3 and
Formula 2 early in his racing career and aspired to drive on the F1
circuit but managed to compete in only two Grand Prix races in 1978
(US and Canada) for Wolf Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I certainly loved living in Europe and racing over there
many, many moons ago,'' said Rahal, who will move his family to
England to be closer to Jaguar's racing headquarters. ``There's no
question that, as a boy growing up, I aspired to Formula One. I did
make it briefly, but at least I made it. But there's no question
that coming back now, maybe in some respects vicariously I'm
achieving that goal that I had or that dream I had 30-35 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Rahal intend to bring to the table, especially
after being away for so long from the political backbiting and
heated competition of the F1 circuit?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, first off, I'm sure some people might say, well, what
do I know about Formula One? And obviously I think that that really
misses the point to a large degree,'' he said. ``I think this is a
company whose main task is to enter motor racing events and to win
them and to represent in this case Jaguar cars in the manner in
which Jaguar would wish to be represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm creating the race setup. We've got engineers
to do that. But my task is to take the organization, work with the
various components within the organization to assist in turning it
into a winning team because I can't do it myself. This has to be a
team effort. So my job is to create that team with the help of the
many people that are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I have no illusion about the immensity of this
task. Irrespective of whether I had Formula One experience in the
last several years or not, this is a huge task; and yet I'm moving
there, I'll be living in England, and I'm there because I'm ready
to take on that challenge. Eddie has certainly proven that he's
capable of winning races. My job is to help him do so in the
future.''

   Giving it a spin

   Heinz Harald-Frentzen, driver for the F1 Jordan team, was the
first to tour the recently completed 2.6-mile, 13-turn circuit at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Frentzen did so in a rental car back
in June when he stopped for a visit while on his way to Montreal
for the Canadian Grand Prix, the only other North American stop on
the F1 circuit. ``The only circuit that comes close to resembling
this is Hockeheim,'' Frentzen said, referring to the site of the
German Grand Prix. ``But this track is more complex, and finding
the correct aerodynamic setup will be a huge challenge for all the
F1 teams.'' Drivers will find the Brickyard's circuit to be
particularly challenging because of the second and first turns and
the high-speed front straightaway, where speeds are expected to
reach as high as 220 miles per hour, making it one of the fastest
F1 races. ``That could make it a little more difficult to get
totally comfortable,'' said Schumacher. ``Usually, at a new track,
you get into a sort of rhythm within a couple of laps and then you
just develop the setup and adapt it until the final moment of
qualifying and the race. That is what I expect here.'' . . . Mario
Andretti's victory in the 1977 US Grand Prix was recently voted
``MasterCard Priceless Moment of the US Grand Prix'' in a poll of
40 US F1 historians and journalists. Driving Colin Chapman's Lotus
78, Andretti outdueled Niki Lauda and Jody Sheckter to win the 1977
US Grand Prix at Long Beach, thus becoming the first _ and, so far,
only _ American driver to win a US Grand Prix event.

<P>
   Stewart's territory
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart will try to make it a clean sweep when he goes for
his second NASCAR Winston Cup victory of the season at Dover, Del.,
in Sunday's MBNA.com 400. In just three career starts at Dover
Downs International Speedway, Stewart has recorded a fourth, a
second, and a victory in June's MBNA Platinum 400. ``It's
definitely important for us,'' said Stewart, who is seventh in the
driver standings with 3,447 points, 484 behind Joe Gibbs teammate
Bobby Labonte. ``We need to take every one of the tracks where we
feel we're strong, and we need to be able to capitalize on those
days and gain as many points as possible.'' . . . After putting one
controversy behind them in last weekend's Dura Lube/Kmart 300 at
New Hampshire International Speedway, where carburetor-restrictor
plates were implemented, NASCAR officials braced for another
firestorm after considering rule changes for the Winston 500 at
Talladega next month. Among the changes: a rear spoiler alteration
for the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which would be reduced in width from
57 to 55 inches, while Ford and Pontiac would be required to run a
57-inch spoiler width. The changes were considered a means of
reducing speeds aerodynamically at the last restrictor-plate race
of the season. ``What they're proposing is not a good deal,'' said
car owner Robert Yates, who fields Ford Tauruses for Ricky Rudd and
Dale Jarrett. ``We all want the best of both worlds _ to have high
downforce cars on the smaller tracks and low drag cars on the plate
tracks. Chevy's got a high downforce car. But that gives them more
drag on the plate tracks and that's the choice they made. It looks
like they've learned to make it work by how they ran in April (at
Talladega, where Chevys finished 1-2-3-4). I don't like to get in
this line of bitching, but I'm in the bitching line. I'm not happy
to be on that side of the fence.''

LIFE OUTSIDE RINK OK WITH MCCLEARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He spent his short time in the NHL as a natural-born instigator,
a constant pain in the neck for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Off the ice, he was gleeful, ever the kid in the proverbial
candy store. For wiry former Bruins forward Trent McCleary, the
glass was always half-full. He was a positive presence everywhere
he went.
</P>
<P>
   Then came that terrifying afternoon last Jan. 29 when McCleary,
playing for the Montreal Canadiens, was struck in the throat while
blocking a shot by Flyers defenseman Chris Therien. His face turned
an ominous shade of blue because his larynx was fractured and he
couldn't breathe. Looking back, he figures he was two minutes away
from death.
</P>
<P>
   Because of some lucky factors _ having team doctors on hand in
the Molson Centre and Montreal General Hospital nearby, the medical
team already on duty because it was an afternoon game _ McCleary's
life was saved.
</P>
<P>
   After a valiant attempt at a comeback, McCleary announced his
retirement Wednesday at the age of 28. He tried to play in last
Sunday's exhibition game against the Bruins but had trouble
breathing because of a 10-15 percent reduction in the size of his
airway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two minutes, two more minutes, that's all,'' said McCleary.
``They told me later that they checked my blood gases when I
arrived at the hospital. Two more minutes, they told me, and I was
a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the heroic work of doctors David Mulder and Vincent
Lacroix that made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that went through my mind was: `I'm in
trouble. This isn't the way I'm supposed to feel.' It hurt,'' said
McCleary. ``I remember getting to my knees, and now I'm not
breathing right. I thought: `Why can't I breathe? Oh my God, why
can't I breathe? Why?' My mouth guard is out, my chinstrap's off,
but all I'm thinking is: `I can't breathe. I'm choking. Why? Why?'
''
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt as if he were breathing through a straw, and he
panicked. He said he could taste his own blood and was fearful of
choking to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the doctors were there, they're always there,'' he
said. ``I knew where they were sitting. I was out of air and I
wanted the doctors to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, McCleary was transported to the hospital.
Lacroix estimated it was 12 minutes from the time McCleary was
struck to the time he was wheeled into surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He made a remarkable recovery and spent seven months getting
back into shape. But his airway was just too narrow, as a result of
the incident, to permit him to play NHL hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 15 seconds of skating, I was looking for the bench,
looking for a place to get off the ice,'' he said. ``I was
wheezing. After 20 seconds, I couldn't catch anybody. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   So pro hockey is over for Trent McCleary. But it isn't the end
by any means. McCleary, who had to fight so hard to make it to the
NHL and fight even harder to stay there, knows it's only the
beginning. He's counting his blessings, not bitter as some would be
about what's been taken away. He is newly married and has another
chance at a healthy, happy life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Finding their place
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Blues left wing Tyson Nash has continued his effective
role as team agitator. Judging by the first couple of weeks of
camp, it appears Jay Henderson could play a similar role in Boston,
which is sorely needed. Nash has proven to be a big asset for the
Blues in helping get opponents off their games. ``He found a way to
put himself in the NHL,'' said Blues general manager Larry Pleau.
``He figured out his role. A lot of guys don't figure that out.
They try to do too much or they think they can do more. Nash is a
perfect example of a guy who'd rather make $800,000 than $70,000 in
the minors. He said, `This is what I'm going to do to stay here.'
He got a nice contract because he deserved it.'' . . . Sincere
apologies to Bruins defenseman Darren Van Impe for neglecting to
include him in a recent story on the club's blue line corps. As
amazingly quiet as Van Impe is, I'm sure I'll be hearing about it
all season, which is fair enough . . . The retooled Islanders are
expecting even better things from former Bruins right wing Mariusz
Czerkawski, who had a career-high 35 goals and 70 points last
season. Coach Butch Goring said of the 28-year-old Czerkawski,
``I'd obviously like to see him score no less than 35 and see if he
can't get to the 40 range. I think he's finally starting to
understand what his game is about. He's been criticized in the past
for being basically a one-way hockey player. But I think he's
finally understanding that he can score goals and still be a
complete hockey player.'' . . . Look for Rangers winger Theo Fleury
to begin the season on a line with Mark Messier and Adam Graves.
Fleury, who was booed unmercifully in New York last year because of
a disappointing season, is expecting this one to be completely
different. ``I've got a chance to make it right this year and
that's what I want to do,'' said Fleury. His experience in Gotham,
much removed from his native Calgary, ran the gamut of emotions.
``It was hilarious,'' said Fleury. ``First you get mad. Then you
try harder and that doesn't work. Then, you nonchalant it, trying
to ease off and hope things come naturally. Then, you go see a
shrink and talk to him and he gives you some support and even that
didn't work. It was just one of those years.'' . . . Early in
training camp, feisty Capitals defenseman Brendan Witt said he was
strongly weighing retirement at 25 despite having his best year as
a pro in 1999-2000. Seems Witt was upset by an arbitrator's
decision to give him no raise this year on his $1 million salary.
He will get a $75,000 raise for 2001-02. ``I just expressed how I
felt at the time and I needed to get that off my chest,'' said
Witt. ``It's nice to say I get to come to the hockey rink for work
instead of working somewhere 9 to 5. I appreciate that.'' Chances
are Witt also appreciates there's no other job, 9-5 or otherwise,
where he could pocket $1 million.

   Blackhawks center Josef Marha, who was left unprotected in the
June expansion draft but was passed over by both Minnesota and
Columbus, came into training camp with a renewed commitment. The
24-year-old lost 13 pounds and is down to 192, the lightest he's
been in his career. ``I feel quicker,'' said Marha. ``We'll see if
these changes make a difference. I hope so.'' Marha suffered a
setback when he injured his thigh, but he isn't expected to be
sidelined long . . . As much as that team is looking for
improvement from Marha, they need a huge year from 25-year-old
goalie Jocelyn Thibault. Thibault was pulled from three games early
in the season last fall, including opening night, and said his
psyche was a mess. ``That first month was awful,'' he said. ``I've
never been through a slump like that in my life. I lost my
confidence for a couple of weeks. And as a goalie, you need
confidence.'' Thibault is scheduled to become a restricted free
agent next summer. ``This is an important year for Jocelyn,'' said
Mike Smith, manager of hockey operations . . . Look for Sabres
center Doug Gilmour to rebound strongly after a disappointing end
to last season. Gilmour, who was traded to the Sabres from the
Blackhawks March 10, suffered mightily at the end of the regular
season and through the playoffs because of a stomach virus.
Gilmour, who is not exactly beefy to begin with, lost 10 pounds and
had zero energy in five playoff games against Philadelphia. ``Four
or five days afterward, I was fine,'' said Gilmour. ``I started
putting the weight back on, and my stomach felt good. In hindsight,
maybe if I would have taken four or five days off right away, (the
virus) could have left me. I'm more excited than I have been in a
long time to get back here and start the season.'' . . . Amid much
ballyhoo last Monday, Senators center Alexei Yashin played his
first game at the Corel Centre since April 23, 1999. Yashin, who
sat out all of last season in a contract dispute, was booed every
time he touched the puck, but he also had a good amount of
supporters who seemed to forgive him for refusing to honor the
final year of his contract. ``I can't control what people think and
I tried to concentrate on playing the game,'' said Yashin, who had
two goals in the game against Calgary. ``I'm just going to keep
doing the best I can.'' . . . Incoming Coyotes co-owner Wayne
Gretzky is getting a much better reception from Team Canada than he
is from the outgoing Phoenix owner, Richard Burke. Burke banned the
Great One from the team's locker room as well as workouts at the
Scottsdale practice rink because the sale of the club hasn't been
completed. GM Bobby Smith supported the move. Startlingly, Burke
felt Gretzky, his partner Steve Ellman, and incoming executive vice
president Cliff Fletcher were disruptive and hungry for photo
opportunities. Meanwhile, Team Canada is hoping Gretzky will accept
its GM job for the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City . . . Our
prayers and sincere condolences go to the family and friends of
Quincy Police officer Larry Kelly, who died last week at 61.
Kelly's son, Larry Jr., is director of media relations for the
Dallas Stars, and it was he who made arrangements to bring the
Stanley Cup to Quincy after the Stars won it in '99, largely so his
father would have a chance to enjoy it . . . 11 days to opening
night.

THIS QB NOT ABOUT TO TAKE A HIKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Unless you've come to the conclusion that Bob Kraft is
an idiot who never learns from his mistakes _ which there is ample
evidence is not the case _ please forget this idea that Drew
Bledsoe will be traded to Seattle or somehow be allowed to walk
away from New England when his contract expires in two years.
</P>
<P>
   If you recall, and I'm sure Kraft does, the Patriots let that
happen with running back Curtis Martin three years ago, and they
haven't found a replacement yet and they're not going to soon.
Knowing that quarterbacks of NFL caliber are even harder to find
than running backs of Martin's caliber, Kraft has the common sense
not to repeat his folly of a few years back, when he listened to
his football men and continued not to pay Martin anywhere near his
market value until the team's back was against the wall. When that
happened, Martin walked after the Jets delivered a poison pill to
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has a history of not renegotiating contracts that have two
years to run, which is a wise course in the NFL. The exception he
made in Bledsoe's case came with a gun to his head because his
young quarterback was in position to void the final years of his
deal and become a free agent. Other than that, he has pretty much
waited until a player was entering his last year before working out
a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Any salary cap relief Bledsoe would supply now by an extension
would be worthless until next February, so why not wait until this
season is over and see how things stand? In fact, the way it's
going, wait and see whether Bledsoe can still stand.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that's the case, Kraft still holds the cards, including
the franchise tag if he has to play it. He is not about to let
anyone persuade him that the Patriots are better off without
Bledsoe unless someone can show him they have a better quarterback
already under contract; that situation did not exist among his
running backs when he let Martin leave.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is they don't have such a quarterback and they
won't unless they play so badly this season that they can draft
Michael Vick with the No. 1 pick. If they do that, though, it
probably means Bledsoe has finished this season in traction, which
would reduce his allure considerably anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Barring such an unfortunate circumstance, forget about the
MetroWest Daily News's unnamed sources close to Patriots management
saying Bledsoe is on his way to Seattle or anywhere else or that
Kraft has lost faith in him. There's a better chance that St.
Louis's Trent Green ends up in Seattle, and if Kraft has lost faith
in Bledsoe, he should listen to people like Miami Dolphin defenders
Trace Armstrong and Jason Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impressed me with his toughness,'' said Armstrong, who
will be pursuing Bledsoe Sunday in passing situations. ``He's taken
a lot of hits and he's still not afraid to stand in the pocket.
He's not looking to slide out. I see little to fault him about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff you used to hear about his character or not caring,
I don't know where it comes from. If you see him this year, he's
doing all he can for that team. He' standing in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Taylor, who will try to use his speed rushes to get by
Bruce Armstrong and into Bledsoe's mind as well as his body, ``The
guy has gotten hit a ton and taken some sacks to avoid
interceptions. Anyone who says he isn't tough must be watching a
different game than I've watched. He's a tough kid with a great
arm. He deserves a lot of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue out of the way, let us consider one other in the
matter of rumors about Bledsoe. Just what is a source ``close to''
Patriots management? A driver? The cleaning lady? A secretary? Bill
Belichick's wife? Give me someone in Patriot management threatening
to dump Bledsoe or quoting the boss as saying he's tired of him and
I'll bet you this: He won't be even close to being in Patriot
management the next day.
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea of gathering a host of draft picks for Bledsoe,
don't think Kraft doesn't now understand the difficulty of the
drafting process. He got six high picks for Bill Parcells and
Martin, including two No. 1s, and not a one of those players is a
regular starter, while half are flipping hamburgers in Houston or
slinging chili in Chicago at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   So get used to seeing Bledsoe in a Patriot uniform unless the
worst of all possibilities happens: He decides he wants out to
preserve both his health and his chance of getting back to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, you can bet on this: You won't hear it from any
sources close to Patriot management.
</P>

   Scary stats
</P>
<P>
   Here's the sad sack Patriot stat of the week. Since opening last
season 6-2, the Patriots have gone 2-9. The only team with a worse
record is the 49ers, at 1-10. The Patriots also haven't scored more
than 20 points since last Halloween . . . Keyshawn Johnson
continues to show both his immaturity and his pettiness by bashing
former teammate Wayne Chrebet. He also seems to be showing that he
can't count. In the days leading up to Sunday afternoon's showdown
between Chrebet's Jets and Johnson's Buccaneers, Johnson claimed
Dedric Ward was New York's best receiver while Chrebet was just the
media's pet. This is the same Chrebet of whom Belichick said, ``We
doubled the guy the whole game and he still beat us.'' Johnson went
on to say, ``You're comparing a flashlight to a star. Flashlights
only last so long. A star is in the sky forever.'' Well, at least
until it goes into nova or disappears in Tampa's ball-control
offense. For the record, Johnson has 14 catches for 180 yards and a
touchdown this season, while Chrebet has 13 for 154 and two scores.
Unlike Johnson, Chrebet did not even make an appearance in the
locker room all week during the time the media had access, making
sure to avoid the controversy as best he could. The same was not
true of Jets center Kevin Mawae, who said this of Johnson: ``I just
think if you're going to be a professional athlete, act like a
professional athlete and just go about your business. Wayne
continues to make plays and he continues to get dogged. I don't
know if it's a sense of jealousy or insecurity. We're 3-0 and he's
not here. Go tell that to Keyshawn.'' Many theorize that is what is
really eating at Johnson. His absence has not led to the Jets'
collapse but rather to their best start (albeit a bit lucky) in
decades . . . That hot start has come despite the fact that
quarterback Vinny Testaverde is not yet fully recovered from the
Achilles' injury of a year ago. Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said as
much in a shocking bit of candor by NFL coaching standards when he
said, ``Vinny is not playing as sharp as he did in 1998 before he
got hurt. He was just deadly that year, throwing 65 percent
completions.'' Dungy went on to counter that by adding that
Testaverde continues to avoid sacks and has made big plays late in
games when the Jets needed them most. Statistics back up the
dropoff in Testaverde's play. In 1998, he led New York to
touchdowns 28.3 percent of the time. This year it's 19.4. And he
completed 61.5 percent of his throws that season. This year it's
48.7 percent. Still, in the stat that counts most, he's 15-2 as a
regular-season starter in New York . . . Up in Buffalo, linebacker
Sam Cowart continues to be a marvel. Buffalo coaches credited him
with 23 tackles against the Jets last week, giving him 53 in three
games. If he continues that pace, he'll shatter the club record of
206 set by Chris Spielman. He'll probably end up needing shoulder
surgery, too, if he has to make that many stops.

   All is not settled with the Bills, though. Quarterback Rob
Johnson is the team's leading rusher, with 109 yards on 16
scrambles, and that is not what head coach Wade Phillips is looking
for. That's why Phillips decided to bench running back Antowain
Smith Sunday and replace him with Jonathan Linton, who has yet to
carry the ball this season as he is coming off a rib injury. Smith
has not returned to the form of his rookie year, 1998, when he
rushed for 1,124 yards. Injuries plagued him last year and thus far
this season he has 72 yards on 34 carries . . . You may not believe
this, but the Dolphins respect the Patriots' anemic offense. Head
coach Dave Wannstedt insisted that New England was one play away
from being 3-0. I guess he meant one play a game . . . While Smith
struggles in Buffalo, old reliable Thurman Thomas is continuing to
show he has plenty left in Miami. Exiled to the beach (which isn't
that bad a fate when you've spent more than a decade in Buffalo),
Thomas is now a third-down specialist and an effective one. Last
week he had three carries for 25 yards and three catches for 31
more; all six were third-down plays he converted to first downs.
But in Miami's loss to Minnesota, the Vikings blitzed nearly every
time Thomas was in the backfield, forcing him to stay in on pass
protection. He ended up with one catch for 2 yards and the Dolphins
were 3 of 13 on third down. Look for the Patriots to try a similar
tactic . . . Thomas needs 149 yards to pass Franco Harris for
eighth on the all-time NFL rushing list and 341 to pass the great
Jim Brown's 12,312 yards, which is now sixth. Thomas, with 11,972
yards, is capable of gaining those yards but he has only six
carries for 34 yards this season . . . The Colts gave the Jaguars
something to think about Sunday when they ran the no-huddle offense
on nine of their 11 offensive series last week. The key to that set
is Marcus Pollard, who is so versatile he can play fullback, tight
end, or slot receiver, thus allowing the Colts to run their offense
without substitutions . . . Don't want to say old friend Tom
Coughlin is a little intense, but he was angry at the Jaguars fans
who did not show up for last Sunday's game with Cincinnati. There
were 45,653 on hand but there were another 20,000 missing, which
led Coughlin to remark, ``I can't for the life of me understand
where the others were.'' Probably boarding up their homes, since
there was a hurricane hitting at game time . . . They're trying to
raise $250,000 to fund the building of a statue of Johnny Unitas in
front of PSINet Stadium in Baltimore. The statue is going to be 19
feet tall, which is no coincidence. Unitas wore number 19 to glory
in Baltimore . . . Apparently, sign language is not allowed in the
NFL. After Cleveland punter Chris Gardocki was cheap shotted by
Pittsburgh's Joey Porter and knocked flat, he got up and gave
Porter half a peace sign to show his unhappiness. The NFL fined
Gardocki $5,000. Porter wasn't assessed a nickel, which shows where
the NFL is at. It cares less about free speech than the rule book.
A lot less, as a matter of fact . . . Here's Tennessee offensive
coordinator Mike Heimerdinger's opinion of how tough the Bills'
defense is to beat: ``Anybody that wins against the Bills will have
to win ugly.''

   Steelers quarterback Kent Graham found a new use for super glue.
He used it to hold his injured right thumb together in practice.
The trainers punctured two holes in Graham's nail to release blood
that was beneath it and causing him pain. Then they covered the
holes with super glue and Graham was able to finish the practice
and throw without problems. This is not considered holistic
medicine but it worked . . . Latest evidence that end zone
celebrations should be banned: The Browns lost starting left guard
Jim Pyne for the year when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament
in his right knee while jumping up to celebrate a touchdown pass to
tight end Mark Campbell. Pyne later claimed he'd injured the knee
earlier. Sure he did . . . The Bengals hosted a six-hour hearing
with an arbitrator a week ago at their team offices over their
insistence that players sign a loyalty clause pledging not to
overly criticize the team's coaches or management or face a loss of
bonus money. The clause is being challenged by the players' union,
which brought in agents Marvin Demoff, Jim Steiner, and Terry Bolar
to testify on their behalf. Each has had veteran players who had
problems with the Bengals' front office. Six of the team's seven
draft picks signed the loyalty pledge this spring. The only one to
refuse was first-round choice Peter Warrick. Now there's a surprise
. . . For a guy who's not talking, Bryan Cox moves his lips a lot.
Not only did the Jets linebacker break his self-imposed silence to
speak to both ABC and ESPN before the Monday night game with the
Patriots, he sat down a week later to explain his silence to the
print media in New York. ``I don't want my kids going to school and
getting teased about something their father said,'' the often
outspoken Cox claimed. ``It was a time for me to shut up. My go-to
days (for quotes) are over.'' . . . Cox apparently would love
Cleveland defensive back Corey Fuller. After the Browns crushed the
Bengals in Cincinnati's new stadium, Fuller threatened young safety
Earl Little with a fine if he answered a reporter's question about
his interception. Little declined to comment, but three days later,
Fuller was running off at the mouth about how little respect the
Browns got for beating the lowly Bengals. Who asked him? . . . The
Chiefs' defense has an interesting streak going. It has knocked the
last two starting quarterbacks it faced out of the game. First it
was Tennessee's Steve McNair, who is still suffering with a bruised
sternum, and then it was Moses Moreno, who is out of the lineup
Sunday for San Diego. Kansas City has 10 sacks in the last two
games . . . Moreno will be replaced by affable Ryan Leaf, who spent
the week acting weird, as usual. He kept claiming he didn't care
whether he played or not, but he'd do whatever the Chargers asked.
That's what happens when you bench a guy two games into the season
and then have to go back to him a week later even though he's 3-8
as a starter and has thrown two touchdown passes while turning the
ball over 26 times. Leaf's ascension didn't seem to set well with
linebacker Junior Seau, whose disgust with Leaf is well documented.
``A guy got hurt, and you know he's the next in line,'' said Seau.
``You don't have to love each other, you've got to respect each
other. And right now, we've got to respect the next guy in line.''
Somebody should tell Junior the next guy he has to respect has a
name.

   Limping Terrell Davis was reduced to playing on the Broncos'
scout team last week, wearing number 49 to play the role of Chiefs
fullback Tony Richardson. Davis won't start Sunday, so Mike
Anderson has a chance to become the first rookie back to gain 100
yards rushing in each of his first three games. Anderson leads the
NFL with 318 yards. He turned 27 this week, making him the oldest
rookie in the league . . . The fallout from the fall of Broncos
linebacker Bill Romanowski continued when the doctor who gave him
illegal prescriptions for the drug Phentermine was forced to close
his practice because Medicare and Medicaid cut off payments to his
practice. Dr. Randall L. Snook pleaded guilty to unlawful
dispensing of a controlled substance, but Romanowski is fighting
the charges of illegally acquiring the drug . . . The Rams defense
continues to struggle, and it spilled over last week when unhappy
All-Pro defensive end Kevin Carter did not show for Wednesday's
practice after the birth of his first child Tuesday morning. The
Rams claim Carter got carried away with the moment and was too
exhausted to show up but admit he never called to ask for the day
off. This comes only weeks after negotiations on a contract
extension collapsed when he turned down a $49 million deal that
included a $12.5 million signing bonus. Carter has been unhappy
ever since, and now he has another reason to be. His 83-game streak
as a starter will be snapped Sunday because head coach Mike Martz
said he will put Sean Moran in Carter's place and not just for a
series or two. Carter has only one sack, but he's not the only one
struggling. A year ago, St. Louis's defense was sixth in the NFL.
At the moment, it's 30th, trailing only feeble San Francisco. The
Rams are giving up 387.7 yards a game and 31.3 points; they even
allowed the Niners to hit them with eight plays of 15 yards or
longer. What is saving them is that their offense is playing as if
it's still 1999, averaging 506 yards and 39.7 points a game.
Unbelievably, Marshall Faulk is ahead of his pace of a year ago
with 530 total yards. He averaged 112.7 total yards a game in 1999
and is at 176.7 a game this year, a pace that would net him 2,827
and break the record he set a year ago of 2,429 . . . If you want
to bet a hunch, go to Vegas and bet the Rams, Bucs, Vikings, and
Giants to win the Super Bowl. All are 3-0, as are the Jets. In the
last five years, 22 of the 28 teams that started 3-0 made the
playoffs and every year the Super Bowl winner was a team that had
started 3-0. Since the only four 3-0 teams in the NFC are the
above, go with that, and it's not betting, it's science.

REVOLUTION UNDERWENT EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The theme of recent Revolution seasons has been to avoid the
mistakes of the past. The team did so this season, finally shedding
its losing reputation and actually reaching the MLS playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution's 6-0 loss at Chicago Saturday night was a
bit of a reality check, it should not dim the accomplishments of
the season: New England's first .500 record and first playoff
victory, over the Fire in Game 2 of the first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, coach Fernando Clavijo and director of soccer Sunil
Gulati must plan for the future. Past regimes have overhauled the
team and, usually, produced a similar but no more effective version
of the previous group.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo and Gulati will not likely make sweeping changes, but
the ones they do effect will involve high-profile performers.
</P>
<P>
   They will likely concentrate on making the important moves where
they count _ through the center of the field. The goalkeeping
position is set with Juergen Sommer and Jeff Causey. Mauricio
Wright will require an experienced accomplice in central defense.
Joe Franchino proved he can fill the defensive midfield role. But
the Revolution will bring in a midfield choreographer to replace
Mauricio Ramos, who seldom played in the final six weeks of the
season. And another striker will be added to join leading scorer
Wolde Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo proved to be adept at optimizing New England's talent.
The Revolution won 14 games without ever dominating an opponent;
only thrice did they win by more than one goal.
</P>
<P>
   And the six-goal defeat in the final game indicated they had
been overachieving. The Revolution prevented such blowouts during
the season, but they collapsed against the Fire, a team that
matched their intensity but far surpassed them in offensive
firepower and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a bad night,'' midfielder Leonel Alvarez said.
``To fall behind, 3-0, after 20 minutes, even if you have a big
heart and the willingness to fight, it is very tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six goals is a lot to give up. But we were not playing 100
percent and, unfortunately, this is tough for the young players to
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, at the same time, we had a lot of good results this
season and the young players got a lot of experience. A game like
this is not any one player's fault. You just have to accept it and
go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, though, favors the MetroStars over the Fire in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a more solid team, with more variety,'' Alvarez
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fire and MetroStars used different formulas to reach
this stage. The Fire retained their style of play and key players
since starting as an expansion team in 1998. The MetroStars
revamped and went from last place to the Eastern Division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams that have had success have all had continuity,''
Alvarez said. ``You can't change 50 percent of your players every
year. You have to build on your team and allow the young players
who are gaining confidence to keep improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to have the opportunity to return. It's important
to keep this group together, to learn from our mistakes. I'd like
to stay, to correct a few details that need correcting, to provide
continuity.''

GLENN HOPES PATRIOTS CAN CATCH A BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He was looking at the schedule recently, shaking his
head as he pointed at each opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa Bay, New York, Minnesota, Miami . . . look at this
schedule,'' said Terry Glenn. ``We have a schedule like we just won
the Super Bowl by 30 points.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know something? That's no excuse. You play them and
you have to win them. If we don't get it together soon . . . I
can't believe we're 0-3. I've never seen 0-3 in all my life and I
never want to see 0-4.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots go down that path Sunday against the Dolphins,
there won't be much reason to look at the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is one player taking it upon himself to forge a new
beginning for the New England offense. He knows he and Drew Bledsoe
are targeted by opponents as the players who must be shut down. He
knows that can't happen. One thing he knows for sure: The bad start
isn't Bledsoe's fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tip my cap to him,'' said Glenn. ``I have so much
respect for that man. Look at the hits he's taken and he gets up
and he never flinches. He never complains. This year he's even
scrambling around better than ever. He made himself improve in that
area. Now we have to repay him. We have to make some plays for him.
I get sick and tired of hearing all the crap that comes his way.
We're all responsible. He gets much too much blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn hopes the frustration goes away Sunday. He knows it's
another week when the opponent will put seven men in the box and
come at the Patriots' offensive line like there's no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, someway the Patriots need to break the pattern of
Bledsoe being pressured and Glenn being blanketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get it together as an offense,'' said Glenn.
``We're trying, we really are. This team works as hard as any team
I've ever been with. Our offensive coordinator (Charlie Weis) is
trying everything out there to spread the offense and use multiple
formations. But we haven't executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Drew. We've had problems as receivers, the
offensive line has had problems. I think we've run the ball well.
Kevin (Faulk) has been very impressive. He's very talented. Maybe
if we keep running it'll open up the passing. Something's got to
give.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe what they need is a long bomb to Glenn. He caught a
39-yard touchdown pass in the opener against Tampa Bay on what he
called a ``courageous throw'' by Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hit just as he threw it,'' said Glenn, ``but we got it
down the field and we made the play. It's going to take more like
that. We'll take our shots down the field. I think you always have
to keep the defense honest. Miami wants you to throw those
rinky-dink passes of 2 or 3 yards. Our hope is that we can spring
loose and make big yardage, but they're waiting for us. It's hard
to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Glenn said, there's a lot of attention paid to him,
but what he's saying is that in time he hopes his offensive
teammates can make plays around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about respect sometimes,'' said Glenn. ``When we go into
a town, you hear, `If they can stop Bledsoe, if they can stop Glenn
. . .' It used to be, `If they can stop Ben Coates, Shawn
Jefferson, Curtis Martin . . .'
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talented players. Troy (Brown) is an excellent
receiver. Tony (Simmons) is so fast. Shockmain (Davis) is really
going to be a good one. Eric (Bjornson) runs good routes and can
catch the ball. Sometimes it's hard to get that respect unless
you've had the big years to earn it. Ben had it because he was one
of the greatest to ever play the game. Same with Shawn. Teams knew
he could beat them deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenses, Glenn said, ``have been blitzing us hard. They're all
doing it to us. We have to find a way to make a play off a blitz.
We've done it a couple of times, but we have to do it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn says there is concern on the team about when it'll all
come together but ``as long as there isn't doubt. We're a better
team than what we've showed so far.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching film of the first three games, Glenn felt he did
everything he could to get open. Bledsoe often has eaten the ball
or had to get rid of it short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a big play,'' said Glenn. ``We have to have
that. We have to get teams to respect that capability.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he knows it can't be one player alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a collective thing,'' said Glenn. ``We have to
have everyone working together. Maybe our offensive line can begin
to jell. Maybe Drew can buy an extra second. Maybe we can sustain
long drives with our running game.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's sure of is that they can't fall behind the way they
did against the Vikings and expect to come back against that
caliber of team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get down like that,'' said Glenn. ``Minnesota had a
great defense. Miami has a great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In last year's matchups with Miami, Glenn was shut out in the
first game and caught three passes in the second. He credits the
Dolphins' front seven more than the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put so much pressure on us and then they press us at the
line,'' he said. ``It's not so much that I get double-covered _
although they run that at you from time to time _ it's just that
they pressure Drew so much it's hard for him to get rid of the
ball. If I can get one-on-one with someone with a little time to
make a move, that would make a huge difference for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Something, someone has to make a difference. It may have to be
Bledsoe-to-Glenn after all.

   DAVIE, Fla. _ Zach Thomas was standing by his locker, speaking
of the Patriots, describing a threatening offense that might be
unfamiliar to New England fans up North.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots throw so many gadgets at you, trying to keep you
off-balance with screens and reverses,'' said the Dolphins inside
linebacker, whose team faces the winless Patriots Sunday in Miami.
``They're doing a lot of different things this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Except score points, came one thought. But that thought was
immediately pushed out of mind by another. My gosh, this linebacker
is so small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a defense that hopefully won't get rattled,'' Thomas
went on. ``The Patriots are going to have a couple of big plays.
(Drew Bledsoe) has a strong arm and can go deep at any time. We
just can't give up the big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was describing a New England offense that once might have
been, but clearly isn't, came another thought. But that thought,
too, was quickly pushed sideways by another: This linebacker is a
throwback to a past era. A ``fiercely small'' linebacker or,
perhaps, a ``small, fierce'' linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas kept going through the midweek ritual in NFL locker rooms
across America, the ritual of puffing up the next opponent. But the
eyes were paying more attention than the ears, the eyes focusing on
Thomas's size (an officially generous 5 feet 11 inches and 235
pounds) and marveling at what that small-by-NFL-standards body can
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, as usual, had the right words after a
Jets-Dolphins game last year when the teams were walking off the
field. Parcells, then the Jets coach, went up to Thomas and said,
``I love to watch you play.''
</P>
<P>
   So would any true football fan. Miami has one of the better
defenses in the league, and while no one player can star without a
complete defensive unit around him, Thomas time and again makes
plays that raise eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is swooping back in coverage, like a defensive back,
and picking off a pass (``I feel I can cover any tight end or
running back in the league'') or making jarring tackles on running
backs foolish enough to run over the middle, Thomas seems to be
near the ball so often. It is the rare, rare inside linebacker who
can both cover passes and punish running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots are going to be dangerous,'' Thomas kept on in
that Texas twang of his. ``We've got to start fast against them.
Hopefully we'll jump on 'em quick. They're coming to our place, so
we definitely have got to get this win.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas will do his all to get it. Just as he did last Sunday
night, when he was flying everywhere, leading the Dolphins with 13
tackles in their 19-6 win over Baltimore, and helping hold Ravens
tight ends Shannon Sharpe and Ben Coates to only seven catches.
That might seem like a lot, but on a night that brought a driving
monsoon, Baltimore quarterback Tony Banks's only real passing
options were short tosses to his tight ends or backs.
</P>
<P>
   Pure football fans should focus on Sunday's battle between New
England center Damien Woody and Thomas, as a gauge to see how much
progress Woody has made in his second year and how devastating
Thomas can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be on me a lot,'' said Thomas, ``and he's a
great center.''
</P>
<P>
   An unusual pedigree
</P>
<P>
   Thomas often has won such battles since he came out of Texas
Tech five years ago, so unheralded that Miami used its fifth-round
pick merely hoping that Thomas might be a decent special teams
player someday.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work and a demanding family _ ``family values'' in the
political lexicon of the day _ explain so much of Thomas's success.
So much so that the second shock after the eyes catch the small
size of Thomas is the news that Thomas is the son of a millionaire
oilman from Texas. Sons of millionaires are seldom found in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas's father, Steve, felt he should pass on more than
money to his son. When the younger Thomas wanted a car, he had to
work to purchase a beat-up 1975 Chevy. The younger Thomas once
explained his father's thinking by saying, ``He made me work
because that's the way he had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thomas seems the prototypical football player out of
Texas. Ask him what he fires up on a typical barbecue and he
replies, ``Steaks . . . burgers . . . basically everything. Hot
dogs . . . and beer, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas's mother, Bobbi, would send him newspaper clippings when
he was at Texas Tech, ones that said Thomas had ``pedestrian''
speed, that he was so small he couldn't see over the line of
scrimmage or that offensive linemen could push him around at will.
Thomas would read the words and take his usual approach _ prove all
of them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Another home experience factors into his huge success. When he
was 3 years old, Thomas was playing near the North Fork of the Red
River when a pickup truck ran over him. Then the panicked driver
backed up and ran over him again.
</P>
<P>
   Tire tracks were on the T-shirt of the unconscious boy, who
suffered a broken arm and permanently damaged hearing. His parents,
according to various accounts over the years, thought they had lost
him.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas survived, and clearly has shown he wants to make the
most of his life. He acknowledges that he does not have Lawrence
Taylor's prototype linebacker body but is sensitive to the
implication that his size precludes athletic prowess. Indeed, he
has said he would have made it to the Pro Bowl before last season
if the voters were not prejudiced by the ``overachiever'' label
that has been pasted on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Reapplying himself
</P>
<P>
   Above all, though, hard work and preparation are the key to
Thomas's success. He spent hours and hours this past week, extra
hours, studying tape of the Patriots, knowing that New England's
offensive coordinator, Charlie Weis, with Parcells's help, often
baffled Miami when Weis was the Jets' offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely scheme teams,'' said Thomas. ``That was the
same with the Jets; they get you out of position and keep you off
balance and they don't go by what their tendencies are. They want
to get your mind rattled on defense, throw a bunch of gadgets at
you to get you confused. Then, at the start of the second half and
stuff, they go back to their normal tendencies and then the next
thing you know, you can't even play that right because you're so
rattled.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is worried about what the Patriots will throw at him and
his mates ``because it has bothered me in the past and I hope it
won't bother me Sunday,'' he said. ``But it definitely is a problem
when I'm thinking something and they throw some other things at
you, such as new plays. I mean, I can understand new plays, but
when they break their consistencies and things like that, that
rattles you a little bit. And you start doubting yourself on your
reads. And when you start to read slower, you can't make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas's answer to subterfuge is work and more work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay at least 2 1/2-3 hours after practice every day to
watch tape,'' said Thomas. ``I'm usually out of here late. What I
do when I look at the tape is I'm looking at the linemen to see if
they're giving away things by their bodies, and looking at the
formations and the tendencies (of the entire offense). If you can
just get one little thing that can help you from studying the
linemen, it's definitely a help. Even if I have to spend a lot of
hours after practice.''
</P>
<P>
   To Thomas, such work is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the mental edge over people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas's hard work is not limited to just watching tapes
during the season. Stories are legion around the Dolphins of former
coach Jimmy Johnson telling Thomas to get out of the team facility
and go home and ``take a break.'' And there was the time Miami
coaches called up Thomas's agent to see if he could convince Thomas
to take a break and go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, nah, nah . . . (Johnson) never threw me out of here,''
replied Thomas when asked about the tales. The truth, said a
Dolphins official with a laugh, ``is that Zach threw Jimmy out of
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, the truth came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy told me to take a break . . . they told me in the
offseason to get out of here,'' he said. ``I was doing physical
stuff, lifting and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   When was this?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhh . . . it was probably February,'' said Thomas. ``Early
February.''
</P>
<P>
   When the team had not been asked to work out until March. But
Zach Thomas, the season just over, still was looking for that edge.
</P>
<P>
   As always.
</P>
<P>
   With more hard work.

WILLIAMS REBUKES GM FOR LACK OF BACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stung by Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette backing a star,
Carl Everett, to his detriment, manager Jimy Williams Saturday all
but challenged Duquette to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the 1999 American League Manager of the Year, made the
extraordinary move three days after Duquette apparently undermined
his authority by refusing to discipline Everett for arriving late
to the park, becoming embroiled in an altercation with Darren
Lewis, and profanely berating Williams in front of players and
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was general manager, I certainly would back the
manager,'' Williams told reporters before Saturday's game against
the Orioles at Fenway. ``If you can't back the manager, then you
probably need to get rid of him. That's what you need to do, and
get somebody you can back.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is under contract to manage the Sox next year for about
$1 million. Asked if he planned to honor the deal, he declined to
give a definitive answer, saying only, ``I have a contract next
year for more money than I've ever made in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter suggested Williams might value his
``self-respect and dignity more than money,'' he said emphatically,
``You're right. But I'm not saying I'm leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would he say he is staying. And with his rebuke of Duquette
Saturday, Williams left that issue squarely in the lap of the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said he would not resign before the season ends
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never do that,'' he said. ``That's wrong. You finish
what you start. I've tried to preach that to my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, explaining his decision not to discipline Everett, has
said the slugger's contributions on the field weighed more heavily
than his actions off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bottom line is how you perform on the field,''
Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a highly productive player for the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   The GM said in his pregame show on WEEI Saturday, ``When you
have a dysfunctional family, you don't throw out any members.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said Friday he looks forward to working with Williams
next year. He was not available Saturday for an interview on the
subject. Team spokesman Kevin Shea told reporters, ``We're not
going to get into a tennis match.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, meanwhile, said he has done nothing to warrant being
disciplined by the Sox. And he reiterated his belief, first uttered
after he was suspended for 10 games for bumping umpire Ron Kulpa,
that he has been inaccurately portrayed by the media.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said reporters have chosen to wrongly attack him
because the team's other two stars _ Pedro Martinez and Nomar
Garciaparra _ are sacred cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've done wrong and hurt someone, I apologize in their
face,'' Everett said. ``And if I don't feel like I've done anything
wrong, I'm not going to say anything to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's home run leader believes publicly cursing Williams,
among other things, was not wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one to apologize to,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Duquette told him he would not suspend Everett or
trade him. And no other disciplinary action has been taken against
the slugger, contributing to the perception that Everett is immune
from the manager's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to support each other through thick and thin,''
Williams said. ``You can't single out any individual and make the
others a separate entity. You have to be one. One unit.''
</P>
<P>
   By Duquette publicly backing Everett over him, Williams said,
``I feel like I'm backed into a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he spoke out ``because of self-pride and the principles
I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he left a phone message for Duquette to tell him
he was publicly responding to the general manager's statements. He
said he made the call ``so he is not surprised, like I was
surprised (by Duquette's remarks.)''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Duquette has yet to explain to him why he backed
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who commands intense loyalty from most of his players,
suggested Duquette's special treatment of Everett has hurt the
team's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you separate a team with one player,'' he said, ``it's
basically going against the thoughts of the manager and the focus
of the team in trying to win. It becomes very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Sox players said they were troubled both by Duquette's
refusal to back Williams and the apparent double standard in the
general manager's treatment of Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (Williams) says, we agree with because he is as loyal a
manager as they come,'' said reliever Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe added: ``When you're a team, No. 1 and No. 25 should be
treated the same. That's the way I believe it should be. When you
see that some type of conduct is going to be OK that we've been
told all along is not OK, you know, hopefully it doesn't lead to
anything, but it easily could because now the groundwork has been
set.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe and Williams both said the Everett situation has affected
the team, if not seriously distracted it. The Sox have yet to be
mathematically eliminated from the race for the playoffs, though
their chances are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to knock anybody,'' Williams said. ``I have
nothing against Carl Everett. I want him to be the best player he
can be. But with these games remaining, our clubhouse should be
better than what it is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, asked whether the episode has become a distraction to
his teammates, said, ``You'd have to ask them whether it's a
distraction or not. I'm going to play regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. Since Everett started the commotion by arriving late
last Wednesday and announcing he would not play because of an
injured left quadriceps, Williams has used Everett only sparingly,
as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   And Everett, who is earning $5 million this year, spent all of
Saturday's game on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The benching may not please Duquette. But Williams did not
appear concerned. Asked if there was any way to repair his
relationship with the general manager, he said, ``You'd have to ask
him.''

U.S. PULLED UNDER BY LATE AUSSIE GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ If you think the Australians broke Lisa
Hernandez's heart the other day with that two-out, two-run homer
that shattered a 25-strikeout performance, you should have seen
what their women's water polo team did Saturday night to their
United States counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those implausible plays in which the participants
involved will remember for a lifetime - and so will those who
witnessed it in person - the Aussie ladies pulled a rabbit out of
their caps with 1.3 seconds remaining to score a 4-3 win that will
forever be tainted to some people on the American side.
</P>
<P>
   At least Lisa Hernandez and her softball team survived the
nightmare loss to Australia and have qualified for the medal round
and still have a chance at a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   But when Yvette Higgins fired in her unlikely game-winning goal
for the Australians, the U.S. water polo team's golden dreams
suddenly became quite silvery.
</P>
<P>
   And a dramatic goal by Brenda Villa with a mere :13 remaining -
that had tied matters at 3-3 and that seemed destined to send the
game into overtime - had become quite irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But should Higgins' goal have been disallowed?
</P>
<P>
   In a sport with all sorts of esoteric rules only water polo
purists can figure out, a player who's fouled within seven meters
of the goal must pass the ball before taking a shot when play is
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Americans thought Julie Swail, who had just been
waved to the sidelines in those final 1.3 seconds for roughing up
Higgins, had committed her foul within the seven meter range.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody came out to defend Higgins, who had a clear shot and
fired the ball as soon as she received it from a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and saw the referee pointing, and I thought he was
pointing for Higgins to get back,'' Swail said. ``Obviously, he
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Villa, the Bell Gardens whiz who scored two goals, said it
wasn't even a legal shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even set up to play defense on Higgins,'' Villa
said. ``She'd have never got that shot off if we thought she could
shoot it. That's what hurts the most. You don't mind losing. But
you hate losing in this manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gianni Lonzi, the chairman of the Technical Water Polo
Committee, viewed the play at poolside and said through spokesman
Russell McKinnon it was legal and the referees made the proper
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lonzi said Higgins took the shot from around nine meters,
which would make it quite legal,'' McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins' shot was rifled past goalkeeper Bernice Orwig in the
left corner and inspired a raucous reaction from the Australian
partisans at the Sydney International Aquatic Centre.
</P>
<P>
   American coach Guy Baker stomped around the sidelines
momentarily after the game, and seemed to level a few choice words
at one of the referees.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker had calmed down later and took a diplomatic pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little confusion at the end, but the referee said
it was good and so that's what you have to accept,'' he said. ``The
focus now should be on the game itself, which was a great one.
Those final 13 seconds were absolutely incredible. You have to give
Australia a lot of credit for being able to score in the final
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest winner in this game was women's water
polo. Anyone who watched this game would have to come away
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was evenly contested throughout the entire 28 minutes,
as the Americans jumped to a 1-0 edge on Villa's first goal, went
ahead 2-1 on a score from Ericka Lorenz, fell behind 3-2 with 1:50
remaining, and then caught the Aussies on Villa's late goal.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Americans made two fatal mistakes during those
final seconds, as Swail probably shouldn't have fouled Higgins with
so little time left and the U.S. players definitely shouldn't have
allowed Higgins to take such an open shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of let down defensively at the end,'' assistant
coach Ken Lindgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these overachieving U.S. women can be proud, having
advanced to the championship game when few observers around here
thought they'd even make it to the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   All of them - Villa, Orwig, Lorenz, Swail, Coralie Simmons,
Heather Moody, Robin Beauregard, Kathy Sheehy, Courtney Johnson,
Ellen Estes and, of course, Maureen O'Toole - played admirably
Saturday night and throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was such a great game that it was a shame that one of the
teams had to lose,'' said O'Toole, the 39-year-old water polo icon
playing in her final game. ``It's just too bad we were on the side
that lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian players clapped loudly for O'Toole after she
spoke about her future plans during the postmatch press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked the Aussies why they would salute a rival player
in such a manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because she's a legend,'' Higgins said. And she should know.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins became a legend herself - at least in this
athletic-crazed country - with her stunning heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Bronze medal: Russia overcame a very slow start to defeat the
Netherlands 4-3 and take the first Olympic bronze medal in women's
water polo. The Russians had only one goal in the first half and
trailed 3-2 midway through the final period. But Sofia Konoukh
flashed open left of the Dutch goal and tied it up with 2:19 left.
Ioulia Petrova followed a minute later with the game-winner,
slammed past Netherlands keeper Karla Plugge.

IF ONLY THE WORLD COULD FOLLOW OLYMPICS' EXAMPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA _ The weather has been matchless, the Aussies
have been warm and cooperative and the Games themselves have gone
on without any major incident.
</P>
<P>
   If these trends continue, XXVII Olympiad could go down as the
greatest ever staged.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it might already rate such an exalted status because
of the incredible feel-good atmosphere that has pervaded the Games
in this city that has been overflowing with a United Nations
contingent of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   If only the world could exist as smoothly as Sydney has the past
eight days, we'd have everlasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   Those zealots who insist that culturally diverse people can't
live alongside one another without conflict should see what's been
unfolding in these parts. Their petty perceptions would be
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   I agree with a growing sentiment being voiced among the
international press---the IOC should anchor the Games here
permanently instead of rotating them every four years to logistical
nightmares like Atlanta and to sweltering summer saunas like
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies have done everything right. Their athletic venues
are modern and roomy. Their vast transportation system of trains
and buses is terrific. Their support system---the 40,000
volunteers---is unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
   I missed a bus to the Ryde Aquatic Centre the other night, and
was in a panic.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the kindly volunteers at the Press Village gate, a
Mr. Mark Wheeler, offered to give me a ride me over in his
car---and even repeated the favor a couple days later!
</P>
<P>
   Stories of such kindness by the locals abound.
</P>
<P>
   And Sydney itself, with its galaxy of beaches, coves, inlets and
islands, is a picturesque paradise aesthetically pleasing to one's
senses. . .
</P>
<P>
   -- The good burghers around here treat swimming with greater
attention than the Americans do football, baseball and basketball,
or the British do soccer.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think a day has gone by without reading something about
Dawn Fraser, and Saturday's 1,500 meter duel between a couple of
Aussies, Grant Hackett and Kieren Perkins, turned out to be the
most watched sporting event in Australian history.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, more than 8.5 million people were glued to their TV
sets for a race I'd watch only under threat of imprisonment. . .
</P>
<P>
   -- There isn't anyone savoring these Olympics more than Tom
Lasorda, reveling almost obscenely in all the adulation. Leave it
to ol' Tommy to start an international incident with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, my one-time friend should go back on that Slim-Fast diet.
He's put on many unflattering pounds, not good for someone with a
history of heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   But he has done a terrific job with his collection of minor
league players, and it won't surprise me if Lasorda adds a silver
medal to his trophy case. . .
</P>
<P>
   -- France's reclusive 400-meter star Marie-Jose Perec has
received more publicity in the local papers for lamming it back to
Paris than she would have had she remained and competed tonight
against national hero Cathy Freeman. . .
</P>
<P>
   -- Freeman figures to emerge victorious, but she's fortunate
that Marion Jones didn't decide to go for six gold medals and add
the 400 to her busy schedule. I don't think anyone alive can beat
Wonder Woman up to 400 meters. . .
</P>
<P>
   -- I spoke to Misty May this morning, and she spent Saturday
afternoon visiting the local zoo with her family and friends after
she and her partner, Holly McPeak, had been eliminated by the
Brazilians in beach volleyball earlier in the day at Bondi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those days,'' said May, who returns to
America on Tuesday and will participate in the Queen of the Beach
tournament in Las Vegas on Oct. 5-8.
</P>

   She and other extraordinary Long Beach State alums like Daniele
Scott and Tara Cross-Battle will play against Brian Gimmillaro's
49ers on Oct. 3 at the Pyramid. . .

<P>
   -- I think the United States women's water polo team would be
celebrating a gold medal triumph today instead of mourning that
final-second, 4-3 loss Saturday night to the Australians had they
seen to it that their best shooter, Brenda Villa, taken more than
four shots during the 28-minute match.
</P>
<P>
   Villa drilled two of them for goals, including a clutch one with
13 seconds left that deadlocked the game, and she might have had a
couple of more goals had she been set up for more shots. But what
do I know about women's water polo?
</P>
<P>
   The team's coach, Guy Baker, did a remarkable job building the
Americans into one of the world's most formidable outfits . . .
</P>
<P>
   -- If I never hear ``Oi! Oi! Oi!'' again, it will be far too
soon. I swear I hear that more from the Aussi fans than even
``Waltzing Matilda,'' a song I actually enjoy listening to. . .

<P>
   -- Ticket scalpers have invaded this city from all over the
world---with the greatest contingent from Great Britain---but the
biggest ticket scalpers apparently are the Olympic committee
members from the United States, Switzerland, Spain, Russia and
Venezuela, who allegedly have sold thousands of leftover tickets to
the brokers. . .

<P>
   -- American swimming diva Amy Van Dyken hasn't hid her disdain
for Holland's three-gold medal winner Inge de Bruijn, hinting
Bruijn has enhanced her performances with drug usage. Yet, Amy's
maid of honor at her upcoming wedding to Denver Bronco punter Tom
Rouen is Julie Romanowski, Bill Romanowski's wife who recently has
been indicted for possession of illegal drugs. . .

Savon to easily beat America's Michael Bennett in their showdown
Tuesday. . .
</P>
<P>
   -- The Australian press is about as provincial as it can get.
One of the headlines today in the Sunday Telegraph's sports section
was, ``Toughest Test For Our Brave Women,'' in reference to women's
marathon. The local writers use words like ``we'' and ``ours'' a
lot when talking about the Australian athletes. . .
</P>
<P>
   -- I never knew I'd know so much about one-time rock and roll
groupie Paula Yates, the former Boomtown Rats lead singer Sir Bob
Geldof, the late INXS frontman Michael Hutchence and Tiger Lilly,
the daughter of Hutchence and Yates, found dead in a London
apartment early last week. The coverage of this saga here has
almost equaled that of the Olympics. . .

immigrated to Australia during the final four decades of the 20th

MARATHON: A FIRST RUNNING GOLD FOR JAPANESE WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ With a keen sense of her place in running
history and a legendary appetite for food and success, Naoko
Takahashi won the first gold medal ever for a Japanese woman in
track and field Sunday by setting an Olympic record in the
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Her compact stride suited perfectly to the difficult, undulating
course, Takahashi built a lead of 28 seconds with less than a mile
and a half remaining in the 26.2-mile race. Then she had to fend
off a furious kick in the final quarter-mile in Olympic Stadium
from Lidia Simon of Romania to win in 2 hours 23 minutes 14
seconds. Simon took the silver medal in 2:23:22, and Joyce
Chepchumba of Kenya won the bronze in 2:24.45.
</P>
<P>
   All three medalists finished below the previous Olympic record
of 2:24:52, set by Joan Benoit Samuelson in 1984. Had this been a
cooler, less humid day and had the course been flatter, Takahashi
might have challenged the world record of 2:20:43, held by Tegla
Loroupe of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way she did it, going at 19K, just blowing the field away,
I think it has to be one of the greatest performances ever,'' said
Chris Wardlaw, the head coach of the Australian track team. ``A
2:23 in these conditions. This course is very, very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The race began in temperatures of 57 degrees, with 91 percent
humidity, and the weather steadily grew hotter. These were perfect
conditions for Takahashi, who has been brilliant in steamy weather.
Her arms swinging lightly at her side, she drew away from Simon at
about 21{ miles as the course roller-coastered from uphill to
downhill. Feeling confident, Takahashi tossed away the sunglasses
she had been wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to speed the pace, and slow the pace, to shake
her,'' Takahashi said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunched over, her wet hair plastered to her head, bothered by
menstrual cramps, Simon appeared to be in trouble. However,
Takahashi's legs began to grow heavy, and just before she entered
the stadium, she looked over her shoulder to see Simon gaining on
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to put my legs forward,'' Takahashi said.
</P>
<P>
   Revived, Simon began to sprint after Takahashi as nearly 100,000
people in the stadium realized that the outcome was still in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd find the force to overtake her, but it was not
meant to be,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Not until 30 meters from the finish did Takahashi finally feel
confident that she would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the hardest of the five marathons that I have done,''
said the 28-year-old Takahashi, who is 5-feet-4-inches tall and
weighs 104 pounds. She became the first marathoner to win a gold
medal for Japan. Sohn Kee-chung's marathon victory at the 1936
Berlin Games was credited to Japan. Sohn was actually Korean,
however, and his country was occupied by Japan at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't swallow what I've done,'' Takahashi said.
</P>
<P>
   Chepchumba's medal was the first won by a Kenyan woman in the
marathon. Loroupe had been the favorite, but she grew sick and
vomited before the race. By 6.2 miles, she was already 30 seconds
off the pace. She kept running and finished 13th in 2:29:45.
</P>
<P>
   Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, the defending Olympic champion,
struggled in the heat and finished ninth in 2:27:38. Christine
Clark of Anchorage, Alaska, the lone American entry, set a personal
best of 2:31:35 and crossed the line in 19th place.
</P>
<P>
   At 15{ miles, Takahashi broke the lead pack that had once
contained 20 runners down to three _ herself, her teammate Ari
Ichihashi and Simon _ and she was clearly intent on winning. At the
1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Takahashi ran one of the most stunning
marathons of all time. In temperatures that reached 82 degrees,
with 90 percent humidity, she won in 2:21.47, the sixth-fastest
time in history and the fastest in a women's only race.
</P>
<P>
   She visited Olympic Stadium here in August and said: ``I must
win the gold medal in the Olympics and set the best time in the
world to etch my name in history. I want to leave proof that I
existed in this era.''
</P>
<P>
   Since May, she had trained at high altitude in Boulder, Colo.,
and Sunday she was still breathing lightly at 22 miles. ``I was
able to enjoy the fruits of that practice,'' Takahashi said.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, she said she planned to enjoy her other passion
_ eating.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Japanese track magazine, Takahashi can consume 40
pieces of sushi, or a four-pound steak, at one meal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she would celebrate her victory, Takahashi said, ``I
want to eat some nice food.''

PENN STATE IS DEMORALIZED BY OHIO STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By   JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio, Sept. 23 _ Penn State's early-season slump
descended into something worse on Saturday: an appalling defeat
that established the start of the 2000 schedule as the worst in Joe
Paterno's 35 years as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   After losing by 45-6 to Ohio State in the wet gloom of Ohio
Stadium in their Big Ten conference opener, the Nittany Lions are
1-4. Unless they sweep their final seven games and qualify for the
Rose Bowl as conference champions _ an unlikely event _ the Lions
will probably need to win six of seven to qualify for a trip to
even a second-tier bowl game. That, too, does not seem promising
after what transpired on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But things were encouraging for the Buckeyes, who are 1-0 in the
conference and 4-0 over all. They scored touchdowns in a variety of
ways, including a fumble recovery, a double deflection on a pass
play and short-yardage runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive time the Buckeyes have defeated
the Lions in this stadium. Penn State has now lost seven of its
last eight regular-season games. The Nittany Lions have not started
1-4 since 1964, two years before Paterno replaced Rip Engle as head
coach. Penn State plays host to Purdue on Saturday. No Penn State
team has started 1-5 since 1931, and the Lions have not had a
losing record since they went 5-6 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno began the season with 317 victories. He still needs five
in his final seven of the regular schedule to tie Bear Bryant's
record of 323, the most ever for a head coach in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State held Penn State to 93 yards rushing and 120 yards
passing, and forced three turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the Buckeyes retired the No. 31 of the late Vic
Janowicz, their 1950 Heisman trophy winner. It is only the second
number retired in the long history of a school where football has
been played since 1890. The other is the 45 of Archie Griffin, who
won the Heisman twice.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, nasty weather raged through the early minutes, and
the play-calling of John Cooper helped the Buckeyes storm to a 17-0
lead at halftime. They scored on their first possession with Jamar
Martin getting the touchdown on a carry from the 1-yard line to
complete a 92-yard drive that mixed running and passing plays. They
scored again on their second possession when Darnell Sanders caught
a pass in the end zone after it was deflected twice, once by each
team. It ended a 50-yard drive with the scoring play of 18 yards on
a pass by Buckeye quarterback Steve Bellisari, who was 10-of-17 for
203 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After Dan Stultz kicked a 31-yard field goal to put the Buckeyes
up by 17-0, Ohio State had a chance to increase its lead when a
fumble by Tony Stewart of the Nittany Lions gave Ohio State the
ball at Penn State's 32-yard line. But Bellisari tried to pass into
thick coverage and the ball was intercepted by Penn State's James
Boyd with 1 minute 2 seconds remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   At intermission, Penn State quarterback Rashard Casey had 6
completions in 14 attempts. His leading rusher, Eric McCoo, had
only 19 yards. For the Buckeyes, Bellisari had 139 passing yards
and tailback Derek Combs had 49 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, which had been shut out by Pitt the week before, got
on the scoreboard with 9:56 remaining in the third quarter on a
2-yard run by McCoo, who swept to the right to complete a 33-yard
drive that began with a short Ohio State punt. But the Lions missed
the extra point and the score was 17-6.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's Combs scored on the next possession, a 1-yard run,
to give the Buckeyes a 24-6 lead. His run ended a methodical drive
of 73 yards in 11 plays. The highlight was a gain of 26 yards on a
pass by Bellisari to Chad Cacchio, who ran 20 yards after catching
the ball 6 yards past the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   After Casey's long pass was intercepted by Nate Clements, the
Buckeyes drove again. This time the touchdown was scored by Jerry
Westbrooks on one of those plays that seem to sum up a game.
</P>
<P>
   Running wide to the left, Westbrooks was hit by cornerback Bryan
Scott at about the 5-yard line. But Westbrooks kept pushing
forward, dragging the tackler with him until he crossed the goal
line at the corner flag. When Matt Senneca replaced Casey for the
next Lions possession, he fumbled when trying to pass and the ball
was recovered by nose guard Mike Collins, who ran it into the end
zone to make the score 38-6 for the Buckeyes at the end of the
third quarter. Ohio State scored another touchdown in the fourth
quarter for the final margin. &QL;

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

MEMPHIS BEATS ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Four straight losses at the end of last
college football season cost Bob Sutton his coaching job at Army.
Sutton's firing also marked the end of the run-oriented wishbone
offense that Army had used for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new head coach, Todd Berry, has instituted a
wide-open passing offense, the result has not changed. Army lost,
26-16, to Memphis in a Conference USA game before a crowd of 38,375
at Michie Stadium. With the loss, the Black Knights matched their
season-ending streak of four in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With Memphis leading in the fourth quarter, 20-14, quarterback
Curtis Zervic's pass into the end zone was picked off in the left
corner by defensive back Idrees Bashir, who ran the ball back 105
yards for a touchdown with 3 minutes 49 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was it the longest pass interception run back in the
76-year history of Michie Stadium, but it also sealed Memphis'
third victory in four games.
</P>
<P>
   That put a damper on an otherwise superb performance by Zervic,
a third-string quarterback who a year ago was the manager of the
Army men's lacrosse team after quitting the football team after his
freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   Zervic entered Saturday's game after quarterback Joe Gerena
injured his right shoulder. The team's first-string quarterback,
Chad Jenkins, has been sidelined since injuring an ankle against
Boston College two weeks ago. Zervic completed 28 passes for 246
yards to tie a record set by Leamon Hall in 1976. He had four
completions on Army's ill-fated drive. Army was on the Memphis
14-yard line when Bashir ended the Black Knights' hopes with his
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had Bryan Bowdish open when I threw the pass, but
the safety made a great play,'' said Zervic, who also threw two
other interceptions while connecting on 28 of 38 passes. ``Maybe I
should have thrown the ball a bit shorter than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   That drive was just one of Army's many missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis led at halftime, 14-7, because the Black Knights did not
score on two goal-line situations.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis tailback Sugar Sanders opened the scoring by sprinting
62 yards for a touchdown on the Tigers' first possession. Army, on
its third possession, drove from its 19-yard line to the Tigers' 2.
But the Black Knights came away empty when Brendan Mullen's 24-yard
field-goal attempt sailed wide to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Army then squandered another scoring opportunity when, on the
ensuing Memphis possession, Randy Mitchell blocked the punt by Ben
Graves and Anthony Miller recovered the ball at the Tigers' 30.
</P>
<P>
   With Zervic connecting on four straight passes, the Black
Knights advanced to the Memphis 1. Zervic was stopped for no gain
on a quarterback sneak on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   Army finally tied the score, 7-7, when the 5-foot-7-inch Omari
Thompson, who is used as a wide receiver, running back and
kick-return specialist, took a punt at the Army 28-yard line and
raced 72 yards down the left sideline just under six minutes into
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Memphis soon regained the lead. Aided by a 15-yard
roughing-the-passer penalty, Memphis followed with a 15-play,
78-yard drive that consumed almost seven minutes and ended with a
1-yard touchdown run by fullback Darche Epting with 3:03 left in
the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made too many mistakes today, and didn't play up to our
capabilities,'' Berry said of Army, which duplicated a feat of the
1973 team. That group lost its first four games and dropped all 10
games it played that season. The eight-game losing streak is the
longest that Army has endured since the 1975 team lost its final
nine games after winning its first two.

WALK KEEPS SOX IN THE RUNNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By BOB HOHLER 
c.2000 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was conflict in the management ranks; the star slugger was
in the doghouse; and the Red Sox harbored only the most slender
hope of surviving into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But the Comeback Kids of Yawkey Way did it again Saturday night,
engineering a dramatic come-from-behind victory over the Orioles,
8-7, in the bottom of the 10th inning at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sox trailing, 7-6, entering the bottom of the 10th,
Nomar Garciaparra made a brilliant slide into home on Troy
O'Leary's double to tie the score. And after Baltimore reliever
Ryan Kohlmeier intentionally walked the bases loaded, Trot Nixon
came up with two outs and worked Kohlmeier to a 3-2 count before
drawing a walk to force in O'Leary with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no quit in this team,'' Nixon said. ``A lot of teams
may look at us as having a few problems here and there. But we just
battle back.''
</P>
<P>
   A few problems, indeed. Starting with a rift between general
manager Dan Duquette and manager Jimy Williams, who was irked that
Duquette failed to discipline Everett for showing up late for
practice and publicly using expletives to deride him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Everett's apparent good standing with Duquette, the
slugger was nowhere to be seen as Williams sent out three pinch
hitters in crucial situations late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manager's decision'' was all Williams would say about passing
over Everett. But he did say Everett was available to hit if he
chose to call on him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Everett, who did not go out onto the field to
congratulate his teammates after the victory, was actually on the
bench in the late innings, Williams said, ``I don't go around and
check off who is there and who's not there. All I know is I want to
be there so I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Sox used 20 players other than Everett in the
overtime game. But the formula worked.
</P>
<P>
   And though the stakes were not great _ the magic number for the
Sox to be officially eliminated from postseason contention is 3
with seven games to play _ the spirit was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the chance we've got,'' said Dante Bichette, who
singled in the third inning and scored on Garciaparra's two-run
homer. ``We have to hope for a miracle, a real big miracle. But
we're going to play to win until the season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles had gone ahead in the top of the 10th after Chris
Richard singled to right off Sox reliever Rheal Cormier to open the
inning. Richard moved to second on Melvin Mora's ground out and
took third on Brook Fordyce's ground out off reliever Hector
Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
   And after Brady Anderson drew an intentional walk, Carrasco gave
up a single to Luis Matos that put Baltimore ahead, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasco, who posted his first win with the Sox as the pitcher
of record in the bottom of the 10th, was the team's seventh pitcher
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not back where we want to be with these
pitchers,'' Williams said. ``But maybe we'll get there by the end
of next week'' when the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a major test for Rolando Arrojo, who failed
miserably last Thursday when he was pounded by the Indians for
seven runs in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo bounced back admirably, giving up two runs on five hits
in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox led, 6-2, when Arrojo left the game. But the Orioles
scored two runs off reliever Hipolito Pichardo in the sixth on a
walk, a double by Chris Richard, and Mora's single.
</P>
<P>
   Worse for the Sox, the Orioles tied the score in the seventh on
two unearned runs. With two outs and Jeff Fassero pitching in
relief of Pichardo, Eugene Kingsale drew a walk and took second on
Jerry Hairston's single.
</P>
<P>
   On came Rod Beck to relieve Fassero. And he induced a grounder
by Delino DeShields to Garciaparra. But the shortstop booted it,
allowing Kingsale to score. Cal Ripken then singled in Hairston to
tie it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox came through in the 10th, although they nearly were
foiled when left fielder DeShields, summoned with the bases loaded
to serve as a fifth infielder, made a lunging grab near second base
to rob Jason Varitek of a game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done that before,'' Garciaparra said of the
five-infielder defense. ``I was like, oh, are they taking one out
of Jimy's book?''
</P>
<P>
   No problem, thanks to Nixon's eventual walk. And Williams
appreciated that his players persevered amid adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special game, coming back like that,'' he said. ``It
was a credit to all of them.''

LOWE SAYS TEAM NEEDS A LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The temper and tardiness of center fielder Carl Everett, the
inaction of general manager Dan Duquette, and the disappointment of
manager Jimy Williams promise to remain hot topics in the Red Sox
clubhouse for the remainder of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game against the Orioles, reliever Derek Lowe
spoke at length about the possible long-term effects of recent
incidents, the lack of vocal leadership in the clubhouse, and the
loyalty Williams inspires in players.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said all the talk about Everett's behavior has distracted
the team. The reliever noted that, unlike the past two seasons when
the team won more than 90 games each time, they were ``maybe not on
the same page.'' After learning that Williams had
uncharacteristically spoken out about a lack of backing from the
front office in the wake of Everett's tardiness, Lowe sympathized
with his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be tough if you want to do one thing but you don't
have the power to do it,'' said Lowe. ``I just hope he comes back
and everything settles down. It could lead to a lot of bad
incidents, meaning if one person can do it, why can't all of us?
That's the kind of message you don't want to send. We have a bunch
of classy guys and I don't think anything's going to happen, but on
the flip side, if one guy can do it, why can't we all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we're told as long as we can produce on the field, we can
do anything we want. That makes it tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a team, No. 1 and No. 25 should be treated the
same. That's the way I believe it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Nomar Garciaparra, who declined to speak about Everett but
praised Williams for his leadership, ``I have the utmost respect
for (Williams). He takes the brunt of everything. He's always
positive. We play a lot of games, a lot of things happen out there
and a lot of stuff goes on, a lot of question marks. People want to
point fingers. I've never seen him do that. If there's any
finger-pointing, it goes right back to him. That takes a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that Everett was unapologetic, Lowe was not surprised.
He reasoned that if a general manager condones a player's actions,
the player would not see any need to apologize or clarify possible
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the clubhouse may be filled with ``classy guys,'' it
lacks a strong, vocal leader, someone who could prevail upon a
problematic teammate. Mo Vaughn, Mike Stanley, and to some extent
Jeff Frye assumed such leadership roles in the recent past. But
during Duquette's tenure, Vaughn (lost to free agency), Stanley
(released), and Frye (traded) have unhappily left the Hub.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if a teammate should have dealt with the Everett
situation before it festered, Lowe said, ``Yeah, but you can't
force that upon anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the one great thing about Mo Vaughn. If he was
here, things may have been different because this guy was what you
want to call a true leader. There's not many guys out there, as you
can see. People figured, `Aw, Mo will leave, someone else will take
over.' There was talk of certain guys doing it, but it's not in
some people's nature to be a vocal leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot guys that are leaders on the field, Nomar,
Pedro. There's more guys than that, but we don't have a vocal
leader. Mo was fantastic at that. This guy, if you did something
wrong, he let you know it. It didn't matter who you were. Even if
he saw something starting, he stopped it right before it got to be
anything big. Maybe, if he was here, it wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has one hard and fast rule: Be on time. If a player is
going to be late, the manager expects a phone call and an
explanation. If the only rule set by Williams apparently doesn't
matter, what type of behavior will follow, wondered Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just hope that it won't snowball to where there's no rules
at all,'' he said. ``Bottom line, we all get paid to play the game
of baseball and produce on the field, but there's a lot more that
comes with that. If you were to ask me, I would rather have a bunch
of guys that get the best out of their ability day in and day out,
that abide by the rules and respect everybody, than tremendous
players who kind of do their own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With the season winding down, Lowe hopes the team can regroup
and get back on the same page. By the time spring training starts,
he would like to see the recent events well behind the Red Sox.

EVERETT CALLS HIMSELF A TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unapologetic Carl Everett broke his two-day silence Saturday
in the Red Sox clubhouse. Dressing while most of his teammates were
on the field for batting practice, Everett blamed the media for the
recent problems, alleging the press has continually misrepresented
him and made him a target.
</P>
<P>
   Everett called reports that he and Darren Lewis argued about
showing respect ``incorrect.'' He said he had done nothing to
``disrespect'' his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis was asked about Thursday's heated exchange with
Everett, he said, ``I have no comment on that. You can pretty much
read between the lines on what was said.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett said that, rather than set reporters straight on the
recent events, he would let them ``soak in your own lies.'' He
spoke calmly and at times used disjointed biblical diction to make
his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can accept truth and negativity,'' said Everett. ``But when
it's a lie and negative, there's a different thinking. So, those
whom have lied on me cannot say anything else to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan reaction, he said, ``actually doesn't bother me. That's what
they want _ those reporters want those fans to be negative to me.
That's their only goal in life because they're miserable already.
The fans don't report the negativity. It doesn't bother me. You
look at what I do on the field. No reporter can take that away,
just can't do it. The fans react to the ignorance of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett said media scrutiny and negative fallout are the price
of performing well. And because he possesses exceptional athletic
talent, he has become tolerant of the attention that follows him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talked about all my life,'' said Everett, who has 34
home runs, 108 RBIs, and a .302 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't stopped me. I don't have any shield. It's just
when you disrespect me, I'm done with you. I can deal with true
negative. It don't surprise me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I made $100,000 you guys wouldn't be standing here in front
of me. It's that simple. Every team has their target. On this team,
no matter what happens, you're going to look at Pedro (Martinez),
Nomar (Garciaparra), and myself. Maybe Dante (Bichette) now that
he's here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to mess with Nomar? He owns this town. Who's going
to mess with Pedro? He owns this town. You've got to find someone.
I'm the new guy and basically I speak my mind. I'm not afraid to
say what's on my mind, so there's a target right there.''

RICHARDSON IS BACK WITH RELISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All those hung up by logic, take a hike. All those restricted by
normal laws of physical possibilities, bound by traditional human
limitations, make for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about any mortal realm of endeavor, but of Dr. Dot
Richardson, the mystifying one-woman bundle of energy who remains
the envy of every electric company on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, Richardson is going again, throttle fully opened,
the only way she goes anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   She will be 39 during these Olympic Games, but age gave up
trying to slow her years ago. So she is back, back with her
defending gold-medal-winning U.S. softball team, back trying to
recapture that magic of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There is absolutely no logical reason for her to be back in the
Olympic Games, to have sweated under the hot sun just north of the
Mexican border at the U.S. training camp in Chula Vista. To have
pushed herself through drills, exhorting her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson already had it all. She has been named the country's
top softball player seven times. She is the woman who ripped the
game-winning home run in the gold-medal game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   She's written books, made instructional videos, become a
national speaker, set up foundations, picked up a dozen sponsors,
appeared on numerous national television shows - all while becoming
an orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone who has accomplished everything in their sport,
is financially secure, has a promising medical career waiting ...
still be out there?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, it's very simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it, I ``love it,'' Richardson said. ``And as long that
love is still there, I'll continue to be on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe all of us are given incredible talents, and these
talents that are a gift meant to be expressed and shared with
others. I feel that very strongly in my passion for softball and my
passion for medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The real truth is, though, Richardson seems to feel strongly
about anything she does or discusses. Her quotes should
automatically be equipped with exclamation marks. Everything is all
out, full commitment, pedal slammed to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson recently completed a sports-medicine fellowship at
the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic in Los Angeles. When Dr. Frank
Jobe, the internationally renowned orthopedic surgeon, was asked to
speak at a local high school, he quickly witnessed the zeal with
which Richardson attacks all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up a talk about injuries and how to prevent them, the
things a high schooler ought to know,'' Jobe said. ``Then at the
last moment I thought, 'You know, I really ought to take Dot with
me and just let them see an Olympic star. I thought that might be
worth a minute or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have not even gone. As we walked down the aisle from
the back to the front, the students all stood up and gave her
high-fives. We got on the platform and I gave my little talk. They
were tolerating me so they could get to her. And she just revved
them up something special. Gave them a really heart-warming talk
about the possibilities in life, what you can do if you have
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe said they stayed another hour after the assembly ended, as
students from the depressed neighborhood crushed toward Richardson,
wanting their picture taken with her, looking at her gold medal,
and asking, ``Do you really think I could be a doctor, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has big plans for her medical career, but then those
are the only kinds of plans she has for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Her immediate goal is to help lead the U.S. back to the Olympic
medal platform.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Richardson in Atlanta seems fresh - the doctor who
helped the American softball team become the unexpected darlings of
the Olympics, in the sports' Olympic debut, in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that I think about from 1996 - and it feels
like it just happened yesterday - is the roar of the crowd, a
standing-room-only packed stadium of over 10,000 people,'' she
said.'' A roar with a sense like they realized they had lived in a
moment of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that we had won a gold medal, it was like we had
made a mark in history. I'm getting chills just thinking about it.
The inspiration in knowing that everyone who experienced it,
everyone who watched, everyone following us, would never be the
same because we were inspired by living in that moment. It's so
hard to really describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson immediately returned to medical school and national
celebrity. Maybe the U.S. team figured she was through with
softball, or it was just time for everyone to move on. Richardson
wasn't invited to be on the team for the next 2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling of rejection was there,'' she said. ``The feeling
they wanted me to retire. That loneliness and disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even her own team might have underestimated her resolve. And
Richardson figures it might have been noticed the U.S. lost to
archrival Australia three times while she was out. After she
returned, the U.S. was 5-0 against Australia going into the
Olympics at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   So she is back, if at a different position. Richardson has been
moved from shortstop to second base, which seems less a recognition
of the years than of the impact of Crystl Bustos.
</P>
<P>
   Bustos, the former Canyon Country high school standout who
joined the U.S. team only last year, bats cleanup and is considered
the most powerful hitter on the team. Bustos and Richardson room
together on the road.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Ralph Raymond said Richardson - who still bats
leadoff at age 38 - made the switch smoothly and again is like a
coach on the field, still going when most had countered her out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really relishes the thought of participating on the
softball field,'' Raymond said. ``She's like a 10-year-old kid who
just got her first ice cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just does a tremendous job. She's like a catalyst. The way
she goes, it seems the club just goes the same way and it spurs
them on. In that respect, she still maintains a lot of the things
that she did 10, 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, however, acknowledges Richardson ``may have slowed down
a little,'' but makes up for it with her great baserunning sense.
That her bat is no longer one of the most feared in the game but is
still close.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a big kid a heart,'' he said. ``Just enjoys the
competition. If at any time I would see her slowing down to the
point where she couldn't do the job, I would definitely have to sit
her down. But thus far, she has done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom McCarthy, her longtime agent, said Richardson's confidence
is unshaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to be interesting is to see how she responds in
big competition,'' McCarthy said. ``There are a lot of players who
do well on the tour but who have never done anything in a major
competition. She still believes she's going to produce and help the
team win. There are just certain players who respond to big-time
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Those high school students of Jobe's knew Richardson was all
about setting goals to achieve dreams. And with her, there is
always another goal to chase down. Like a second gold medal at age
39.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has no fears of a letdown after '96 and calls this
Olympics a competitive athlete's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are going to meet our No. 1 competitor - Australia - in
their backyard,'' she said. ``For any athlete to not want to be
there - oh, never, never, never.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why this is so exciting, because they want it so badly.
Everyone wants to knock you off, and that's the way it's always
been and that's the way you want it to be. To win a gold medal
again, is like part two of living the dream.''

UCLA MISSED MANY CHANCES ON FIRST DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ There was no deceptive advertising on the part of
the Oregon defense. The Ducks, just as UCLA expected - and just as
Fresno State and Michigan had done - loaded eight or nine men near
the line of scrimmage and dared Ryan McCann to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on first down, when the Bruins might have best taken
advantage of Oregon's defense, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA passed the ball on first down just eight times in 23
chances until it was down 12 points with three minutes to play.
Foster carried the ball 15 times on first down and netted just 28
yards. Overall, he rushed 19 times for 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Such a trend was in stark contrast to the Bruins' play selection
on their first 20 first downs in the second half against Michigan.
UCLA split the plays evenly between the run and pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I called it much different than against
Michigan,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``I may have been
more conservative (with the inexperienced McCann), but there comes
a point where you get the ball kicked back at you. If you're too
conservative, you'll face second-and-10 all day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's gotta be the shoes: UCLA had trouble with footing in the
first half. McCann slipped as he dropped back to pass and Foster
lost his feet on an 18-yard run that might have gone for 41 more
and a touchdown. Several players switched shoes at halftime and
didn't seem to have any noticeable problems.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Freddie: Receiver Freddie Mitchell caught six passes
for 158 yards and one touchdown and might have had another if an
official had seen his left foot come down in the end zone. But
Mitchell also had a ball deflect off his hands and into the arms of
Oregon cornerback Rashad Bauman, whom he battled most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell and Bauman could be seen jawing at each other most of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Said Mitchell: ``He's the easiest cornerback I've played against
all this year. And I felt that he was so easy to beat but he talks
too much. It's so disrespectful for him to talk so much.''
</P>
<P>
   From Bauman: ``I had fun watching Freddie Mitchell talking on
ESPN (Saturday morning) about how this was going to be a big
breakout game for him. It was funny. We went out there and pretty
much ruined his plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's bomb: Drew Bennett, the quarterback-turned-receiver,
faked an option on third-and-2 and threw a 54-yard touchdown pass
to Mitchell. Bennett became the fifth UCLA player to complete a
pass this season and third to throw a touchdown, joining McCann and
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Knight shirt: Nike chairman Phil Knight, who withdrew his $30
million pledge to help expand Autzen Stadium this year because of
the school's affiliation with a worker's rights organization, was
the object of pleas from Oregon students on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them wore T-shirts that read, ``Phil, Phone Home,
1-800-Be A Duck.''
</P>
<P>
   The back of the shirt read: ``Just Do It!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE FEELING OF WHAT HAPPENS: Body and Emotion in the Making of
Consciousness &LR;  By Antonio Damasio. (Harvest/Harcourt, $15.) A
neurologist, drawing on the experiences of patients over many
years, explains the difference between intelligence and
consciousness, and the central role of emotion in forming
consciousness. His account, chosen by the editors of The New York
Times Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, is ``a
must-read book ... on one of the greatest unsolved mysteries,''
William H. Calvin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A GESTURE LIFE &LR;  By Chang-rae Lee. (Riverhead, $13.) Franklin
Hata, this novel's elderly Korean-born narrator, looks back on his
life from his comfortable perch in a leafy New York suburb, finding
clues to his true identity in his service in the Japanese army
during World War II. The result is ``a beautiful, solitary,
remarkably tender book that reveals the shadows that fall
constantly from the past,'' Andrew O'Hagan wrote last year in The
New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRUST: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York
Times &LR;  By Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones. (Back Bay/Little,
Brown, $18.95.) The authors conducted some 550 interviews and
extensive archival research to tell the monumental story of Adolph
S. Ochs, who bought The Times in 1896, and those family members who
stewarded the paper through the years. Last year the reviewer Ron
Chernow called this a ``lively, lavishly detailed epic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAINSONG &LR;  By Kent Haruf. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) In
unadorned prose that echoes its characters' unadorned lives, this
novel records a season of changes great and small in an isolated
town on the high plains of Colorado. The result is an intimate tale
that is ``so foursquare, so delicate and lovely, that it has the
power to exalt the reader,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DARK WIND: A Survivor's Tale of Love and Loss &LR;  By Gordon
Chaplin. (Plume, $14.) The author tells of his long voyage aboard a
36-foot motor cruiser with the woman he loved, and of the bad luck
and missteps that led to her death during a typhoon in the Marshall
Islands. ``Chaplin writes vivid prose, with snappy dialogue,''
Anthony Bailey wrote in 1999, and his ``account of their
catastrophe is tense and moving.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEIGHBORS &LR;  By Thomas Berger. (Zoland, $13.) In this satirical
1980 novel, a mild-mannered suburbanite finds his civility tested
when he gets sucked into the vortex of his new neighbors, who have
a penchant for strange games and inflicting pain and humiliation.
```Neighbors' is a wonderfully funny and mysterious book,'' Thomas
R. Edwards wrote. ``Berger is one of our most intelligent, witty
and independent-minded writers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SLEEPING WITH EXTRA-TERRESTRIALS: The Rise of Irrationalism and
Perils of Piety &LR;  By Wendy Kaminer. (Vintage, $13.) In a sweeping
critique of the blind irrationality running through what she sees
as today's evangelical culture, the author takes on everything from
alien abduction to New Age spiritualism. Even if her analysis is
hit or miss, Kaminer is ``a sharp, outspoken thinker,'' Caroline
Knapp wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOLSTICE &LR;  By Joyce Carol Oates. (Ontario Review, $14.95.) This
dark novel explores the obsessive (and destructive) romance between
two determinedly heterosexual women: a timid young teacher trying
to escape her disastrous marriage and an artist who has just lost
her husband. ``The voyage is not for the faint of heart,'' Rebecca
Pepper Sinkler wrote in 1985. ``Oates, never squeamish about
looking into the dark places of the soul, has aimed a powerful beam
into that shadowy chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRIMO LEVI: Tragedy of an Optimist &LR;  By Myriam Anissimov.
(Overlook, $18.95.) According to this well-researched biography,
this Italian writer and Auschwitz survivor had a lifelong faith in
clarity of thinking and an enduring reverence for language.
``Anissimov's book ... provides a serious, lively, at times
fervently told story that is always sympathetic to Levi's shy
personality and restrained tone,'' Victor Brombert said last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSIAN BRIDES &LR;  By Dorit Rabinyan. (George Braziller, $15.95.)
Set in turn-of-the-century Persia, this novel tells of a
15-year-old girl, who yearns for the return of her unborn child's
father, and her 11-year-old cousin, desperate to get married
herself despite the grim lot of women in their society. ``Rabinyan
grounds her themes of sexual politics in scenes mingling exotic
beauty and gritty horror,'' Michael Lowenthal wrote in 1998.

CANDIDATES BACK `SOFT MONEY' BAN IN NEW YORK RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(REPEATING for all needing)  By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio reached a
tentative agreement on Saturday to forgo the use of soft money for
advertising in the New York Senate race, but the deal included
several conditions and provisions that could derail it and came
just a day after talks on another proposal collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agreement _ it appears,'' Lazio said at his
headquarters Saturday night. ``I said that yesterday, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement Saturday night after Lazio's acceptance
of Clinton's proposal, her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said: ``Nine
months ago, Hillary Clinton called for the elimination of soft
money issue advertising and independent expenditures from this
race. We hope that today we have finally achieved her goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an offer made by Clinton during a campaign appearance in
Manhattan, both sides would place a ban on television and radio
advertisements paid for by political parties with so-called soft
money _ largely unregulated contributions that enable candidates to
circumvent legal limits on fund-raising. Clinton and Lazio would
also appeal to independent groups supporting them to refrain from
broadcasting ads on their behalf, leaving the campaign committees
as the only advertisers in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simple,'' Clinton said. ``We will keep soft-money issue
ads off the air if they keep theirs off the air. Just the two
campaign committees should be on the air advertising their
campaigns. If any supporters of either candidate should violate
this, the other side could respond proportionately.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she had secured the commitments of the various
Democratic Party organizations that would be affected by the
prohibition, as well as the Working Families Party and Liberal
Party, which have also endorsed her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lazio needed to do the same among Republicans and
Conservatives by Monday, a deadline Lazio said he could and would
meet.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would not take effect until Wednesday, Clinton said,
because the state Democratic Party has already bought television
ads on her behalf that run through Wednesday. Lazio's campaign
initially objected to the Wednesday deadline, saying the state ads
must be withdrawn by Monday, but Lazio backed off that demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the ads that she is airing right now should come
down by Monday; I think that would show good faith,'' the
congressman said Saturday night. ``But what is important here is
that it appears we have an agreement in principle to ban soft money
from both campaigns and keep all outside groups out. But it is
important, in the words of former President Ronald Reagan, that we
must trust and verify.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign said it liked Saturday's offer better than
Clinton's previous proposals because it dropped the requirements
that Lazio stop advertisements by groups that support him.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton suggested that Lazio should get written
assurances from those groups, but insisted she did not need to do
the same from groups that support her. She said Saturday that she
still believed there was a difference between groups that back her
candidacy and those that support his, but added that it was more
important to focus on the political parties' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Berger, a prominent Democratic election lawyer in New York
City, said enforcing the deal could prove to be its downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always maintained that she does not have the power
to stop independent groups from advertising on her behalf, and it
is unclear whether they will heed her call to stay out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plus is that it is a first step that may limit soft money
expenditures; it may in fact work,'' Berger said. ``The downside
is, if the advocacy groups simply don't go along with it, it may
break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the ban may also have come too late to have a big
effect on the race. ``It is very late. It is sort of like trying to
turn the Queen Mary around.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft money, which is raised by party committees for
get-out-the-vote and other party-building activities, is separate
from the so-called hard money raised directly by political
campaigns. Hard money is subject to federal limits _ $1,000 per
person _ while soft money can be collected in unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has relied heavily on soft-money contributions to pay
for advertisements on her behalf; Lazio has not raised soft money
for his Senate campaign, in part because he has been able to
collect large sums of hard money from people across the country
opposed to Mrs. Clinton and her husband.

KINGS CAN AVOID A HUGE MISTAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Philip Anschutz must have forgotten those
empty yellow seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the final year of the Forum, they glowed like neon at the
television cameras. You didn't need to check the standings to see
how the Kings were doing. Those empty seats said it all.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz, the Kings' billionaire owner, must have forgotten
there used to be a guy in this town named Chase Carey, who puffed
out his chest and traded Mike Piazza because that's what Fox people
do when they don't get what they want. The Dodgers haven't been
heard from since.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz now is faced with the same situation, overpaying his
best player Rob Blake or trading him. He should let history be his
guide.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz was smart to outfit the new Staples Center in deep
purple, which is much less revealing. He was smart last year to
upgrade his team with Ziggy Palffy and a new contract for
undervalued Matty Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Now he needs to be smart again. The Kings made some great
strides last year, recording 94 points and reaching the playoffs
for just the second time in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   This season is all about keeping the momentum. Everyone has been
to the Staples Center now. It's no longer a novelty. Winning is the
only thing that matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are a fixture here, drawing three million this year
in the face of abject failure. The Kings don't have that luxury.
Sharing the winter with the Lakers means they can disappear without
a trace.
</P>
<P>
   The club says it has an obligation to the NHL to keep salaries
down and keep small market clubs like Calgary, Edmonton and even
Montreal alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have a bigger obligation to their fans, who have
waited so long to root for a consistent winner.
</P>
<P>
   The team can do both, but it has to act quickly before the
momentum is gone.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor is offering $7.5 million a year for
three seasons and is technically right in not going a penny more.
And if you want to get even more technical, how much is your
cornerstone worth on a team that hasn't won a playoff game in seven
years?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty if the team doesn't want to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Players live a fragile existence. Not too many people have to
play out their failure in front of 18,000 fans. By not coming to
terms with Blake, the Kings already have given their players their
out clause for this season.
</P>
<P>
   The players disagree, saying they won't be distracted even
though their top center, Jozef Stumpel, is holding out and best
player, Blake, has resigned his captaincy.
</P>
<P>
   Those will not be rallying cries when the weather gets cold and
playoff races get hot.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza repeatedly has said he regrets the hard line he took with
the Dodgers. Like Blake, he thought it was part of the
negotiations. Although he signed with the New York Mets for seven
years and $91 million, Piazza would not have agreed to less than
$100 million with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Former club owner Peter O'Malley never cultivated a good
relationship with Piazza. He always thought players were Dodgers
first, individuals second. He didn't realize the times had changed.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it appeared Blake had a great relationship with
the Kings. He and his wife, Brandy, have lived in Manhattan Beach
year round and could shame Jerry Lewis with all their charity work.
Blake pushed for Andy Murray to be hired as coach last year and the
results were terrific except for their blowout in the playoffs. If
that wasn't enough, Blake's agent, Ron Salcer, used to represent
Taylor when he was a player. This deal should have been done over a
couple of beers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Kings have drawn a line in the ice. Anschutz, known
as a ``bottom-line guy,'' is trying to build stability in an
organization that has known years of financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Standing firm on Blake is not the way. Even if the Kings record
another 94 points this year and win a playoff round, they are not
going to the Stanley Cup finals. Next season will be their big push
and it will cost big money to get a center like Alexei Yashin or a
goaltender like Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   The payroll will rise, even if the NHL does not have the TV
contract to grow as fast as baseball. But without the Kings signing
their best player, why would those players come to a place so
uncommitted unless they were thrown obscene amounts of money? The
Dodgers gave Kevin Brown almost $40 million more than the next
highest bidder - plus a Lear Jet.
</P>
<P>
   Blake hasn't helped. The NHL Players Association wants him to
hang tough so others can enjoy the trickle-down salary bumps. Blake
really hasn't given the Kings a dollar amount, but somewhere
between Detroit's Nicklas Lidsrom and the New York Rangers' Brian
Leetch is $8 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Blake actually is doing the club a favor asking for only three
years. A player in his prime - with a history of knee injuries -
wanting a contract that short is absurd. Blake thinks the market
will be that much higher in three years. He should remember how it
felt to get out of bed at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Payroll flexibility are the two most important words to a
franchise these days. Fans hoping for a quick Dodgers turnaround
should remember the club is beholden to Brown and Shawn Green five
more years, four more for Eric Karros and three for Gary Sheffield.
Pitchers Darren Dreifort and Chan Ho Park also are in position to
command long term deals at $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz should look at all that and remember Piazza. And the
yellow seats.
