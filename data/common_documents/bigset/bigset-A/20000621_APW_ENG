<HEADLINE> Sharon Stone, Husband Adopt Son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Actress Sharon Stone and husband Phil
Bronstein have adopted a baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, named Roan Joseph Bronstein, was born May 22 in Texas,
Cindi Berger, a spokeswoman for the couple, said Tuesday. The
couple picked up their son there when he was a week old, Berger
said. It was a private adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, 42, and the 47-year-old Bronstein, executive editor for
the San Francisco Examiner newspaper, are ''simply elated,'' Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are both taking care of him and having the time of their
lives together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the issue of Us Weekly on newsstands Friday,
Stone describes the boy as her ''wonderful, precious little
Buddha'' who sleeps peacefully most of the time, and says he's
''the apple of his daddy's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Roan is Celtic for seal, a magical animal in that mythology, the
magazine said. The child's middle name is a tribute to Stone's
father.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who in 1998 denied rumors that she was pregnant, has had
several miscarriages, the magazine said. Through a lawyer, she and
Bronstein found a teen mother in Texas who was willing to allow her
child to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was born several weeks early, weighing 5 pounds, 6
ounces. The first night the couple brought him home, Stone says,
''We sat up and watched him breathe.''

Microsoft Case Sent to Supreme Court
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge sided with the government Tuesday and sent
Microsoft's appeal of an order breaking it up directly to the Supreme Court,
saying a quick resolution of the landmark legal battle was of ''general public
importance.'' But U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also gave
Microsoft a victory, delaying the implementation of all sanctions he imposed
against the software giant pending an appeal.

Execution Issue Looms for Bush

<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Controversy over his state's death penalty stalked
Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday as he tried to court California voters with
a promise to better prepare students for high-tech careers. After rolling out
his education proposals at a local college, Bush refused to take a reporter's
question about the case of Gary Graham, a Texas convict scheduled for lethal
injection Thursday. And Bush, who had been expected to hold a news conference,
avoided giving reporters another opportunity to raise the subject.

Senate Passes Hate-Crimes Measure
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a furious last-minute lobbying blitz by the Clinton
administration, the Senate voted 57 to 42 Tuesday to approve legislation that
would make it easier for federal prosecutors to try hate crimes. Vice President
Al Gore interrupted presidential campaigning in Kentucky to fly to Washington to
be ready to cast a deciding vote should there be a tie in the
Republican-controlled chamber. He presided over the Senate, but his vote wasn't
needed. Thirteen Republicans defied their leaders to vote ''yes'' on the
measure.

U.S. Recoups Undeserved Disaster Aid

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Years after coming to the rescue of victims from

a half-billion dollars back from states and local communities, federal records

Secretary William Cohen could recommend proceeding with deployment of the
controversial system by 2005 even if the July test is a failure. Jacques

FAA Sets New Airport Safety Rules

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is proposing add about

required to operate an airport that serves planes with more than 30 seats. Some
660 airports hold such certificates. Under the proposal to be announced
Wednesday, the FAA plans to extend its authority to airports with scheduled

Court police from enforcing the regulation. An attorney for the Supreme Court

<HEADLINE> Democrat Wins in Pa. Election  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLD FORGE, Pa. (AP) -- The Democratic candidate claimed victory
in a hotly contested state legislative election late Tuesday night,
giving hope to his party's efforts to regain control of the state
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans alleged voter fraud and called for an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the legislative body is critical, because the
candidates who win November's state House election will decide how
to redraw the state's congressional boundaries next year.
Currently, the Republicans hold a 101-99 edge in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Republican Gov. Tom Ridge had come to
town to try to boost their parties fortunes in the race between
Democrat Jim Wansacz and Republican Tom Parry.
</P>
<P>
   In the unusual special election to decide who replaces convicted
former state Rep. Frank A. Serafini until January, Wansacz held a
lead over Parry with 97 percent of the votes counted late Tuesday.
Wansacz had 8,569 votes, or 52.9 percent, to Parry's 7,619 votes,
or 47.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With hands raised in the air, Wansacz declared his victory a
triumph for the entire party.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a loud and clear statement that the people of this
state are ready for Democratic issues'' Wansacz said. ''They are
ready for Social Security reform, they are ready for health care.
</P>
<P>
   But House Majority Leader John Perzel, a Philadelphia
Republican, refused to concede the race. He said many of the voting
machines were set up incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   ''In short,'' Perzel said, ''Republicans were pulling the lever,
but their votes were not being counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the very least, this is a case of monumental incompetence.
At the worst, this is a case of criminal conspiracy,'' Perzel said.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic Party spokesman responded by conceding there were
problems in one precinct, but said that even if all of the
allegedly uncounted votes were for the Republican, the outcome
would have been the same.
</P>
<P>
   The election is required by state law, even though the winner
will have to run again in November. Conceivably, Tuesday's winner
could be ousted just five months from now.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Violence Blamed On Hoodlums  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An outbreak of violence after the Los Angeles
Lakers' championship victory had city officials on the defensive
Tuesday, with storekeepers questioning the ability of the police to
deal with any unrest at the Democratic National Convention this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Two police cars were set on fire Monday night, two TV news vans
were damaged or destroyed, and nearly two dozen auto and garbage
fires were reported. Looters invaded a computer store, glass
storefronts were shattered and at least 74 vehicles at seven car
dealerships were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd outside the
Staples Center, where the Democratic convention will be held.
Eleven people were arrested, and four police officers suffered
minor injuries during the rock- and bottle-throwing melee.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers spokesman John Black announced Tuesday evening that the
Lakers organization and center Shaquille O'Neal each will buy a new
police car for the department. Costs were not available from police
officials after hours.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan gave assurances Tuesday that the streets
will be safe when the Democrats come to town Aug. 14-17, and blamed
the outburst on ''a few hundred hoodlums'' out of 30,000 people in
and around the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are not fans. They are losers who only know how to trash
our city,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said: ''We need to
learn the lessons of last night also so that we will have an
outstanding and safe Democratic National Convention in August.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence erupted among an estimated 10,000 people who had
watched the Lakers defeat the Indiana Pacers 116-111 on a jumbo
screen outside Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before, business operators had met with police and
convention organizers to discuss security and traffic preparations
for the convention. They were also assured they had nothing to fear
from Lakers euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where were the police?'' asked Stephen E. Auth, president of
Kaiser Bros. Oldsmobile, which was damaged by the rampaging crowd.
''I'm disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Rice, manager of Prestige Products auto accessories, where
windows where shattered, said: ''My concern is the lack of
forethought by police.''
</P>
<P>
   Payman Moradian, owner of Alarms Depot, said his store was
looted of at least $5,000 in merchandise. He said police should
have been more aggressive. ''If they would have started with
stronger force and higher presence, the crowd wouldn't have gotten
out of hand,'' Moradian said.
</P>
<P>
   County supervisors on Tuesday offered a $5,000 reward for
conviction of those who incited violence, saying Patriotic Hall was
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''What began as a tremendous victory on the basketball court
became a black eye for Los Angeles County as the result of
senseless, irresponsible behavior,'' said supervisor Mike
Antonovich, who made the motion for the reward.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have been preparing for more than a year for the
convention, which is expected to draw about 30,000 demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night was essentially a spontaneous event. The DNC will
be a very disciplined, well-planned, business-type event,'' the
mayor said. ''The controlled areas around the Staples Center will
be much larger than last night, and anybody that wants to get into
the controlled areas will have to have credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan asked for a full report on police tactics used during
the disturbance, but praised the department for its restraint.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the melee, Police Chief Bernard Parks said, 600
police officers were on hand. He called it a measured response.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think from looking at the size of the crowd and looking at
the emotion of the crowd, we certainly feel as though the end
result was the best that we could do in those circumstances,'' the
chief said.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance, coming after the Lakers' first NBA championship
in 12 years, had many people shaking their heads. TV images of
looting and burning in the nation's second-largest city were shown
worldwide, the camera view again sullying the reputation of Los
Angeles eight years after the Rodney King riots.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Rudy Svorinich sternly told Parks he was
concerned about what the nation and world had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm finding it a little hard to swallow this morning and a
little incredulous that ... mayhem for approximately three hours on
the streets of Los Angeles after the Laker victory can be declared
a victory in crowd control,'' Svorinich said.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Center president Tim Leiweke dismissed the suggestion
that showing the game to the crowd on the giant outdoor TV was a
bad idea, and he said the troublemakers were not simply
intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids came down here for a reason,'' he said. ''They were
going to cause havoc.''

<HEADLINE> Largest State Dinner at White House  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drum rolls and trumpet fanfare greeted King
Mohammed VI of Morocco to the White House on Tuesday. The
36-year-old bachelor king ended the day at the largest state dinner
of the Clinton administration listening to the pulsating rhythms of
Earth, Wind and Fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''He likes race car driving. He's a skier. He enjoys Earth, Wind
and Fire,'' White House social secretary Capricia Marshall said
about the king's desire to hear the band that plays a mixture of
blues, rock, jazz and soul.
</P>
<P>
   In an effusive toast to the young king, the president announced
the formation of a scholarship fund in the memory of Mohammed's
father, King Hassan II, that would allow Moroccan students to study
in United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have shown the courage and vision to elevate Morocco as a
model of openness, prosperity and inclusion,'' Clinton told the
king in a toast before the 425 invited guests gathered under a tent
on the White House draped with yards and yards of champagne-colored
fabric and bouquets of peach and pink roses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Friends of peace and tolerance are needed now perhaps more
than ever as we approach the moment of truth in the Middle East
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed then praised the president for leading the way in the
Middle East peace process and said he was ''following with great
interest'' American initiatives in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''On these issues I am willing to add my energy and capacity to
yours in the hope of achieving the noble objectives of liberty,
justice, peace and prosperity for all nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed, a Muslim, drank water at the toast and Clinton wine.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years ago, the leader of the northern African nation
made his first visit to the White House as crown prince. He came
with his father who ruled Morocco for 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton away on the
campaign trail in New York, Chelsea Clinton joined her father in
welcoming the king and his sister, Princess Lalla Meryem, on the
South Lawn. The first lady was back in time for dinner and greeted
guests with the president in a receiving line that lasted more than
one hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton wore a traditional Moroccan takchita, one of five
the king had given her earlier in the day to choose from for the
occasion. The gold and white brocade floor-length gown the first
lady picked was almost identical to the one worn by the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Former Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal made the guest list.
Others included: Rachel and Sharon Robinson, the widow and daughter
of baseball great Jackie Robinson; Washington Redskins owner Daniel
Snyder; actor Ted Danson; former United Press International
reporter Helen Thomas; sex therapist and talk show host Dr. Ruth
Westheimer; singer and dancer Paula Abdul; actresses Carol Alt and
Teri Garr; Alma Brown, the widow of former Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown and William Kennedy Smith, nephew of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the larger donors to the first lady's Senate campaign
were on hand as well, such as investor William Hambrecht of San
Francisco and Slimfast owner S. Daniel Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   They listened to Earth Wind and Fire belt out hits like ''Boogie
Wonderland'' and ''Let's Groove Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, the first course featured chilled gazpacho made with
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lucked into about 100 pounds of really spectacular golden
tomatoes from our market source in California,'' said Walter Scheib
III, chef of the executive residence. ''The guy told us they were
going to be great and sure enough, they came in beautifully -- it's
a tremendous, wonderful sweet garden-y flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   It ended with an orange sherbet dessert called ''A Moroccan
Oasis.'' The sherbet was scooped from a circular band of white
chocolate painted to resemble a building with Moroccan
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ''The door is supposed to represent the door of the king's
palace of Morocco,'' said Roland Messnier, White House pastry chef.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there was lemon garlic crusted lamb, warm goat
cheese tarts and seared salmon, coated with three different kinds
of peppercorns -- black, red and an African peppercorn that has a
licorice flavor.

<HEADLINE> Poor Schools Said Still Suffering  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In West Philadelphia, John Barry Elementary
School is falling apart: leaky roofs, faulty heating, cramped
classrooms. Twenty minutes away in the Pennsylvania suburbs, Radnor
Township is building a $30 million elementary school, designed for
small class sizes and new computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite apparent prosperity -- a record $307.5 billion for the
nation's schools to spend says the Census Bureau -- the two systems
remain in different worlds. Radnor spends about $13,000 per
student; Philadelphia spends about $6,000 because state laws still
require districts to raise nearly half their funds from taxing
local wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Property taxes are not the way to do it,'' said Elmore Hunter,
whose 7-year-old son Carlos will be heading to third-grade at
Barry. ''When you have a lot of abandoned houses and vacant lots,
where are you supposed to get the funding?''
</P>
<P>
   Overall gains from school spending, advocates warn, will be lost
if states don't level the playing field between rich and poor
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't create a fair funding system, we are going to hurt
today and we are going to hurt tomorrow,'' said Rep. Chaka Fattah,
a Philadelphia Democrat who wants changes. ''We have to take these
states to task on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The money allocated to schools nationwide has increased 30
percent from 1991-92 to 1996-97, according to the latest
school-finance figures from the Census Bureau, released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spending was $307.5 billion in the 1996-97 year, up from $236.3
billion in 1991-92 according to the bureau's analysis of local,
state and federal records. The average spent per-student nationwide
was $5,873, up from $5,001 spent in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the school-funding pie is essentially divided the same way
it was nearly a decade ago. The federal government's share is about
7 percent; the states contribute 49 percent. And the rest comes
from local tax coffers. Funding critics say poorer districts will
never have a chance to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Disparities extend to the state level, Census figures show. The
top spenders per-pupil -- New Jersey, New York, Alaska, Connecticut
-- also draw some of the highest state tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Districts have sought remedies in federal and state courts. New
York, Philadelphia and Kansas systems have filed federal lawsuits
over school funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio State Supreme Court in May gave the state a year to fix
a system that forces schools to rely on local taxes. Ohio, which
spent $5,897 per pupil in 1996-97, will contribute $10 billion
toward fixing every schoolhouse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that must be solved,'' said Scott Milburn,
spokesman for Gov. Robert Taft. ''If you have the money and you
have the will power, you can get things going.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Duvall, spokesman for the Council of Great City Schools, a
group of urban educators, says underlying formulas must be fixed:
''When you talk about setting higher standards across the board for
everyone, the field is not level.''

<HEADLINE> State trip sends New York parks employees to Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A group of New York state parks employees
watched Tiger Woods' best round of the U.S. Open in person last
week during a state-funded ''research trip'' to Pebble Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The trip sent four parks employees to the U.S. Open from June
10-16 to learn from the behind-the-scenes action of the tournament,
which will be held at the famed black course at Bethpage State Park
on Long Island in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''The role of the trip really was a 'here's what you can expect
and here's what you should be planning now' situation,'' said
Randall Sawyer, a spokesman for the New York State Office of Parks,
Recreation and Historic Preservation. ''They learned about the
logistical aspects of running such a huge undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer said he did not know much the trip cost.
</P>
<P>
   The 2002 tournament will be the first held at a state park in
the 102-year history of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Backstrom, vice president of the conservative anti-tax
group Change New York, criticized the state-funded field trip as a
waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   ''A taxpayer funded trip to Pebble Beach should be taken for
what it is - an inappropriate junket,'' Backstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open ''has been done for years and people know how to
run them,'' Backstrom added. ''Four employees from parks and
recreation on the sunny beaches of Pebble Beach simply isn't
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The four employees stayed at the Embassy Suites in Seaside,
Calif., which charged between $189 and $375 per night last week,
depending when reservations were made. The group left Friday
morning and missed the Friday, Saturday and Sunday rounds of the
tournament won by Woods in record fashion.
</P>
<P>
   At least two representatives from the state's golf advisory
committee - a 15-member group founded by State Parks Commissioner
Bernadette Castro in 1996 - paid to attend the tournament over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for state Sens. Dean Skelos, R-Nassau, and Michael
Nozzolio, R-Seneca, confirmed their attendance at the tournament
and said the senators paid the full cost of the trip themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''No taxpayer or campaign funds were used at all,'' said
Nozzolio spokesman Justin McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither office would say whether other committee members or
legislators joined the senators in California.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said Nozzolio was there to meet with the president of
the U.S. Golf Association - the sponsors of the Open championship -
and to observe the shuttle system, volunteer operations, lodging
facilities and other logistical elements of the tournament. He said
Nozzolio did this ''as a volunteer,'' because it was ''more
observation than hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer said the 2002 Bethpage tournament will have a ''huge
economic impact on the state and we need to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA has spent $2.7 million on the Bethpage Black Course
already, rebuilding the tees, fairways and greens and installing an
irrigation system, according to Sawyer. It will also pay a minimum
of $280,000 as a fee for using the course for practice rounds and
the championship, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has not disclosed how much it invested in the
renovations at the course and other costs associated with hosting a
U.S. Open. The Bethpage course is in Farmingdale.

<HEADLINE> Storms cast doubt on apple harvest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - They surveyed their battered orchards and
used terms like devastated, worst ever, and hopeless to describe
the damage from severe storms.
</P>
<P>
   Apple growers in the Hudson Valley say they'll need financial
help from the federal government to weather what they say will
surely be a dismal year for production.
</P>
<P>
   The region's apple industry, one of the largest in the nation,
was already complaining about financial obstacles when hailstorms
May 18 and June 2 damaged an estimated two million bushels of
apples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was devastating,'' said Rod Dressel Jr., manager of packing
and storage for Dressel Farms in New Paltz. ''The Hudson Valley
apple crop has been hit pretty hard from north to south.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple growing is the fourth most valuable crop in the state,
generating $138 million in 1999. Dairy is still king at $1.8
billion in 1999 while hay is valued at $300 million and greenhouse
and nursery products at $264 million.
</P>
<P>
   New York trails only Washington in apple production.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki has requested federal disaster recognition
for 30 New York counties. Economic loss estimates for the
mid-Hudson alone run as high as $10 million. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture will make the decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Agriculture Commissioner Nathan Rudgers toured apple
orchards to view the damage himself and heard from growers, some of
whom said their survival is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, area apples have been rendered unmarketable
except as juice, hardly a profitable fallback, the growers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to get a handle on the fruit in the Hudson Valley,''
said Rudgers. ''A nick or peck on it now, that's going to grow.
This is a fresh market region and it makes them unmarketable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Crist, who hosted the state commissioner on his ravaged
Milton farm Monday, said the storm damage was the worst he's ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big blow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we saw was just terrible, devastating,'' said James S.
Allen, president of the New York Apple Association, a professional
interest group.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no hope of getting any economic return,'' added George
Lamont, president of the New York State Horticultural Society.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Coy, 67, is the third generation to raise apples on the
170-acre farm in Modena, selling his produce at fresh fruit markets
here and abroad. Losing the apples, he said, is like losing a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those things that happens to us. There's nothing
we can do,'' said Coy. ''You're giving up your crop of apples. It's
your livelihood. The hail really did a number on us.''

<HEADLINE> At least 50 people injured in Brooklyn subway derailment  </HEADLINE>
By DIEGO IBARGUEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - At least 60 people were injured - three
seriously - when a subway train derailed Tuesday night in Brooklyn,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the injuries were considered to be life-threatening,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People got shook up pretty badly,'' Giuliani told WNBC at the
scene. ''Heads were injured and they bounced back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Three cars of a southbound ''B'' train derailed at Dekalb and
Flatbush Avenues just before 10 p.m. after it was pulling out from
the station, police said. The wheels of the third car skipped,
causing it to derail, said Richard J. Sheirer, the director of the
city's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   All service in Brooklyn on the N, R, B, D and Q trains was
suspended, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority said. Service was expected to resume by Wednesday's
morning commute.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were just riding along and all of a sudden, the brake went
on and we all fell to the floor,'' said Ursula Janses, 61, of
Brooklyn, standing at the corner and clutching a wad of wet paper
towels to a welt on the crown of her head.
</P>
<P>
   She said the impact was hard enough to tear down an overhead
handrail, which struck her head.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Charles, on her way home after work, said the derailment
felt like someone had pulled the emergency break, and it sent
passengers falling to the floor and skidding toward the fronts of
their train cars.
</P>
<P>
   She said the conductor spoke over the loudspeaker, telling
passengers he had been injured, and to wait where they were for
paramedics to arrive. Those on the train remained calm, even though
the lights went out and the car doors had opened, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just waited,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel filled the street above the station in
downtown Brooklyn, and rescuers carried some passengers in
stretchers and helped others to safety. Police officers shut down
surrounding streets, only allowing a constant flow of ambulances to
come or leave the scene.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 ambulances responded, and authorities had at least
one city bus to take those with minor injuries to area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a full-court press to make sure we had adequate
resources,'' Sheirer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flatbush station stop lets passengers out at Junior's, a
well-known restaurant, and Long Island University's Brooklyn
campus.

<HEADLINE> Loan Abuses Threaten Revitalization  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It sounded like a great opportunity to Ms. H.,
an 81-year-old widow: by refinancing her $118,000 mortgage she
could pay off other debts, lower her monthly payments, cover her
real estate taxes and get a cheaper interest rate to boot.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the mortgage broker told her to persuade her to take
a new loan for $129,000, Ms. H. recounted recently at a public
hearing in Baltimore. None of the promised benefits came through,
and her monthly payments and interest rate actually increased. The
broker made $3,850 from the transaction, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, citing growing abuses by some mortgage lenders,
is proposing that companies making high-cost loans be required to
give borrowers more accurate data on costs and terms.
</P>
<P>
   A report on so-called predatory lending released Tuesday by the
departments of Treasury and Housing and Urban Development also
recommends legislation to ban practices such as loan ''flipping''
and to restrict prepayment penalties. In flipping, lenders
constantly refinance mortgage loans to generate fees for brokers,
with little benefit to the borrower.
</P>
<P>
   The report warned that predatory lending, in which companies
seek low-income, minority or elderly borrowers and charge them what
are considered unfairly high interest rates and fees, threatens to
roll back recent gains in revitalizing neighborhoods and expanding
home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the Senate Banking Committee's
senior Democrat, noted that the government's new recommendations
include key elements of legislation that he and other Democrats
proposed in April to curb predatory lending. Their bill, which
would limit the total amount of points, fees and prepayment
penalties to 3 percent of a loan, has attracted little Republican
support.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said Tuesday the administration's new proposals are
''largely consistent'' with Republican principles regarding
predatory lending.
</P>
<P>
   The high-cost mortgage loans, while legal, increasingly have
drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''For millions of Americans, a home is the sole financial
asset,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who appeared
with HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo at a news conference. ''Predatory
lending ... blights our nation's cities and rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   A task force of the two agencies ''learned about some practices
that are clearly abusive,'' the report says, in public hearings it
held in April and May in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore
and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the consequences for the borrowers -- especially
losing their homes in foreclosure -- have been ''disastrous,'' it
says.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many neighborhoods, these abusive practices threaten to
erode the enormous progress that has been made over the past
several years in revitalizing neighborhoods and expanding home
ownership,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends:
</P>
<P>
   --Lenders should be required to recommend home mortgage
counseling to people applying for high-cost loans.
</P>
<P>
   --Mortgage brokers should be required to demonstrate the
appropriateness of a loan for an applicant.
</P>
<P>
   --Lump-sum credit life insurance should be banned on all mortgage
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The task force heard many complaints from consumer advocates and
individuals about ''aggressive door-to-door solicitation that
prompts some borrowers who never would have sought loans on their
own initiative'' to agree to mortgages with ''oppressive'' terms,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The issue shot into prominence in March when Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan criticized predatory lending in a speech,
calling it ''abusive'' and saying it can damage poorer
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say some consumer finance companies have taken advantage
of people with low incomes or inferior credit histories, many of
them elderly or members of minorities, who cannot get conventional
loans and are desperate to become homeowners or raise cash by
borrowing against their homes. Some lenders make the high-cost
mortgage loans without considering the borrowers' ability to repay,
according to critics.
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry officials maintain that finance companies
provide a valuable service to consumers whose low incomes and poor
credit records prevent them from qualifying for normal loans. They
say new regulations could dry up credit in many of the poorer areas
that need it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a major
industry group, proposed changing the mortgage lending process to
make it easier for consumers to understand and by guaranteeing a
specified closing cost at the beginning.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Pays Up for Pinochet's Cars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A wealthy Chilean farmer paid $100,000
Tuesday for two armored Mercedes Benz automobiles once used by
former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Lobos, 76, beat out four other bidders at a government
auction, offering more than twice the minimum asking price of
$23,500 for each car. Lobos said buying the cars was his way of
honoring the former strongman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've worked for 60 years now and I wanted to give myself this
pleasure,'' he told reporters. ''It's for my general.''
</P>
<P>
   The made-to-order cars were designed for Pinochet in the final
days of his 1973-90 dictatorship. Pinochet kept the cars after
stepping down, but the civilian government that succeeded him
reclaimed them.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted with armored gasoline tanks, bulletproof windows,
soundproof glass and fire-resistant materials, the light-brown cars
reportedly can reach speeds of 140 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The cars have recently only been used for visiting statesmen.
Current President Ricardo Lagos deemed them an unnecessary luxury
and ordered them sold.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, meanwhile, still moves about in a small fleet of
armored vehicles owned by the army. He is awaiting a Supreme Court
decision on his appeal of an earlier ruling stripping him of
immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Without immunity, Pinochet could stand trial for human rights
abuses committed during his regime.

<HEADLINE> US Financier Frankel Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Eccentric financier Martin Frankel,
accused of bilking millions out of U.S. insurance companies, is
betting on an equally eccentric legal strategy -- pleading guilty to
German tax evasion charges in hopes he won't be extradited to face
American justice.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers were to make closing arguments Wednesday in the German
case. Last week, Frankel admitted he failed to declare millions of
dollars worth of diamonds smuggled into Europe during his
four-month run from the law.
</P>
<P>
   The two-judge panel was expected to rule on the case by Friday.
Germany has no jury trials.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, a 45-year-old native of Toledo, Ohio, could get up to
10 years in prison on the German charges, which include falsifying
a stash of bogus passports -- a charge he also pleaded guilty to
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't appear to worry Frankel, who has made a habit
of holding impromptu courtroom news conferences before hearings
begin while the judge waits impatiently for him to finish. Last
week, he brazenly told reporters he would much rather sit in a
German cell than be sent back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A mountain of lawsuits await him on the other side of the
Atlantic, where he is accused of running an unlicensed brokerage
from his fortress-like, two-mansion compound in Connecticut and
cheating insurance companies in five states out of $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel -- who allegedly channeled some of that money into cars
and clothes for a clutch of girlfriends -- is expected to face much
more time behind bars if found guilty of the U.S. charges.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence could be so stiff that Frankel has even likened the
long years he may face to the equivalent of a death sentence. His
strategy appears to pinned on the hopes that Germans -- with their
outspoken stance against the death penalty and excessive punishment
-- will refuse to send him home to such a fate.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction still might not rule out his eventual extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Hans-Gerd Meine said any extradition would be
impossible until the German case had run its course, including
potentially lengthy appeals. But he said Frankel could still be
sent back afterward.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial's opening last week, Frankel seemed set for stall
tactics. He surprised the court by saying he wanted to call four
defense witnesses from the United States and Italy -- which could
have taken months to arrange.
</P>
<P>
   But he backed down during Friday's proceedings, apparently
abiding by a pretrial agreement with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Germany allege he evaded paying a 20 percent
customs duty on more than 500 diamonds -- valued from $5 million to
$8 million -- found with him when he was arrested in a Hamburg hotel
Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   That arrest ended an international manhunt that began when
authorities responding to a May 1999 fire at Frankel's compound
found a file cabinet billowing smoke from smoldering documents --
but no trace of Frankel. He bolted just a day earlier, traveling
first to Rome, then Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In October, he was indicted on U.S. federal fraud, conspiracy
and other charges in Connecticut. At least three of his associates
have pleaded guilty to charges related to his alleged money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance commissioners in five U.S. states -- Arkansas,
Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee -- have also filed a
federal lawsuit asking for more than $600 million in damages from
Frankel for the money he allegedly bilked from companies in their
jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> France Rated No. 1 in Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- France has the best health care system in the
world, followed by Italy, while war-torn Sierra Leone has the
worst, according to a contentious first attempt to rank the world's
health systems.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which spends more on health care than any
other nation, came in 37th.
</P>
<P>
   In the analysis published Wednesday, the World Health
Organization evaluated the health care systems of its 191 members
and graded them based on how well each country performs given the
resources at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Previous assessments have looked just at how healthy people are,
''and you're left with the image that the rich (countries) do well
because they're rich,'' said study co-author Dr. Julio Frenk. This
new analysis praises health systems ''that utilize few resources
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The report essentially measures value for money: comparing a
population's health with how effectively governments spend their
money on health, how well the public health system prevents illness
instead of just treating it and how fairly the poor, minorities and
other special populations are treated. It also examines how fairly
the bill is divided among people.
</P>
<P>
   When each country's measurements were added together, even study
co-author Dr. Christopher Murray, a Harvard health economist and
the health organization's chief of health policy evidence, was
surprised. He had expected Scandinavian countries or Canada to be
the world's best, because they're always presented as models.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Norway hit No. 11, Canada 30.
</P>
<P>
   Some health economists raised concerns about the method used to
compile the rankings, in which several Mediterranean countries
scored unexpectedly high.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny countries with few patients to care for -- San Marino,
Andorra, Malta -- crowd onto the surprising best list. Singapore,
Spain, Oman and Austria also made the top 10. Japan, which came top
for the health of its people, placed 10th overall.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the list were Sierra Leone, Myanmar, Central
African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the worst-faring countries are in sub-Saharan Africa.
Largely because of the AIDS epidemic, healthy life expectancy for
babies born this year in many of those nations has dropped to 40
years or less, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contended the rankings seemed to say more about the
health of people in each country rather than the quality of the
health care systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are obviously getting an olive oil effect,'' said Nick
Bosanquet, health policy professor at London University's Imperial
College, referring to the famed Mediterranean diet.
</P>

   ''No previous analysis of the Italian health system has placed
it near No. 2 in the world,'' he said. ''Any set of rankings that
puts Finland at 31 and Italy at 2, or even France at No. 1, raises
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans -- while good at expensive, heroic care -- are very poor
at the low-cost preventive care that keeps Europeans healthy, said
Princeton University health economist Uwe Reinhardt.
</P>
<P>
   The United States spends a stunning $3,724 per person on health
each year. But measuring how long people live in good health -- not
just how long they live -- the Japanese beat Americans by 4&AMP;frac12; years,
and the French lived three more healthy years. Yet Japan spends
just $1,759 per person on health and France $2,125.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a pretty big gap,'' noted Murray. ''For the money we're
spending, we should be able to do a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of debate over rankings and what criteria to use, the
WHO won wide praise for establishing a way countries' improvement,
or worsening, can be measured.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could disagree with it, but it's not silly, what they've
done,'' said Julian Le Grand, professor of social policy at the
London School of Economics.

<HEADLINE> Witness Says Skakel Confessed  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Tears rolled down Michael Skakel's face
as the first of two former classmates testified that the Kennedy
family nephew confessed 20 years ago to killing a teen-age
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just very upset about hearing this moron get up there and
lie,'' Michael Sherman, Skakel's lawyer, said after Tuesday's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney was referring to John Higgins, who said Skakel
admitted he killed Martha Moxley in 1975. Both Skakel and Moxley
were 15 at the time of the bludgeoning in upscale Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses, Higgins and Gregory Coleman, were students with
Skakel at the Elan School, a Maine residential substance abuse
treatment center for youths, in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Both testified before a judge who will decide whether there is
enough evidence for a trial and, if so, whether the 39-year-old
Skakel will be tried in juvenile court. The hearing was to resume
Wednesday and is expected to last several days.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman testified that he had noticed Skakel had special
privileges at the school, including a stereo and records. Coleman
said he made a comment to Skakel in 1978 that it appeared he could
get away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said Skakel replied: ''I'm going to get away with
murder. I'm a Kennedy.'' Skakel's father, Rushton Skakel Sr., is
the brother of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said Skakel told him he beat Moxley's skull in with a
golf club after she rejected his romantic advances.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also said that he heard Skakel make an admission to the
murder during a therapy session in which participants were urged to
get in touch with their pain and then repeatedly scream ''I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, the defense lawyer, pointed out that Coleman waited 20
years to say anything about the purported confession. Coleman said
he called a TV reporter after seeing a segment on the Moxley
killing, and Sherman asked why Coleman didn't call police. Coleman
said he didn't know why.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also ran through Coleman's criminal record, including a
1983 conviction for robbery and a 1999 conviction for trespassing.
Coleman is serving a year in prison on that count. Sherman
suggested that Coleman was looking for a deal from prosecutors by
agreeing to testify against Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins told the judge that one night while he and Skakel were
on ''night owl duty'' -- watching to ensure no one ran away from the
dormitory -- a sobbing Skakel admitted his involvement in the Moxley
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said Skakel told him he remembered going through golf
clubs stored in the Skakel family garage, then running through the
woods and seeing pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said that he didn't know whether he did it and he couldn't
remember,'' Higgins said. ''He eventually said that he, in fact,
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins admitted that he and Skakel were never close friends,
and that he had lied about Skakel's alleged comments when contacted
by a police detective many years later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to talk to this guy -- or anybody else -- about
it, ever,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman suggested Higgins had only come forward after he heard
about a reward. But Higgins said he had never tried to claim the
reward, which later was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel became upset during Higgins' testimony, a tear trickling
down his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley was beaten to death with a 6-iron; the club was traced to
a set owned by the Skakels.
</P>
<P>
   The club broke into several pieces, and the handle was never
recovered despite an extensive search of the neighborhood that
included draining swimming pools and checking the Long Island
Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's body was found under a tree on her family's estate. She
had been at the Skakel house the night before with a group of
friends, including Michael Skakel and his older brother, Thomas
Skakel, then 17.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities suspected Thomas Skakel for years, but switched
their attention to Michael after he changed his story about his
movements the night of the murder. A judge, acting as a grand jury,
began investigating in 1998 and determined there was enough
evidence to arrest Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law in effect in 1975, Skakel could face a maximum of
four years if he is convicted as a juvenile. If he is convicted as
an adult, he could get 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's brother, John, who was 17 when his sister was murdered,
said he thought Skakel's emotion was fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't tears of joy. I think the reality is starting to
tumble down around him,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Sierra Leone President  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States is backing Sierra
Leone's president in demanding that rebels who killed and maimed
thousands of people in the west African nation be brought to
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of six West African countries were scheduled to
meet with the Security Council Wednesday to discuss their efforts
to help restore normalcy in Sierra Leone after its eight-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   With last summer's peace agreement under serious threat, an
international effort is being launched to help the embattled
government take back territory it lost to the rebels as well as
crack down on the main source of rebel funds and bring leaders to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord gave rebel leaders including Foday Sankoh top
government posts and amnesty for war atrocities. But the United
Nations reserved the right to future rebel prosecutions for human
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was arrested several weeks after his Revolutionary United
Front rebels took about 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage in early May
and is currently being held by Sierra Leone government authorities
who have said they want to try him.
</P>
<P>
   At a Security Council briefing Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke praised the United Nations' farsighted reservation last
summer and said the United States would like something done
''swiftly and efficiently'' to bring ''these odious people'' to
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has sent
Secretary-General Kofi Annan a letter asking for the extension of
the international war crimes umbrella to cover RUF leaders, a move
the United States backs, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the need for swift justice would probably rule
out a new tribunal, which would take a long time to set up.
</P>
<P>
   But Human Rights Watch, in a letter to the Security Council
Tuesday, called on the United Nations to set up an international
tribunal for Sierra Leone that would prosecute all those accused of
war crimes and atrocities -- not just Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights organization also called on the council to
strictly enforce the arms embargo it imposed on Sierra Leone in
1997 and changed in 1998 to apply to rebel forces only. And it
backed a British proposal for an embargo on all diamond
transactions not authorized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The British have also called for the 13,000-strong U.N.
peacekeeping force sent to Sierra Leone to be increased to 16,500
and given additional powers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, European Union foreign ministers welcomed the Sierra
Leone government's decision to put Sankoh on trial and appealed to
the international community to support a strategy that would repel
the rebels, restore the peace process and rebuild the country.

<HEADLINE> GOP Gains on Energy-Security Issues  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are trying to gain new political
traction from an old peeve: the Clinton administration's
stewardship of national defense secrets.
</P>
<P>
   They rushed to embrace a seemingly ready-made election-year
issue: the loss of classified computer hard drives at the Los
Alamos nuclear lab.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as mysteriously, the drives resurfaced behind a
copying machine. That made the case even more bizarre
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were quick to couple that with concern over rising
gasoline prices to launch a fierce attack on Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of thing people get mad about,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., referring mostly to gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts suggested that problems plaguing the Energy
Department would not help Vice President Al Gore. But they
disagreed over the extent of the damage -- either to Gore or to
congressional Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lott did not call for Richardson's resignation directly, but
other Republicans have.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't served this president well. He hasn't served this
nation well,'' asserted Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., one of those who has called directly for
Richardson to resign.
</P>
<P>
   For many in Congress, the temporary loss of computer hard drives
at the New Mexico lab was more clear-cut than the complex issues
surrounding earlier disclosures of lost secrets -- including
technology transfers to China by U.S. satellite makers and
suspected Chinese espionage at nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Those earlier examples never caught on with the public.
Furthermore, those activities stretched back into the GOP Bush and
Reagan administrations.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent Los Alamos laboratory security breach was of
recent vintage -- and the lost-and-found saga was easy to put in
simple language.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a place such as Los Alamos ... you have less security than
at Wal-Mart in terms of checking in and checking out,'' fumed Sen.
Craig Thomas, R-Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   If colleagues believed the hard drives never left the secure
area, ''we will then be convinced that Santa Claus is a viable
being and ... the tooth fairy will trot across the stage,'' said
Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was cited as further evidence of what House
Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla., calls a
Clinton ''culture of disdain about security.''
</P>
<P>
   They cite a long list:
</P>
<P>
   -- Former CIA Director John Deutch's mishandling of classified
material, including processing classified material on unsecured
home computers attached to the Internet. The 1996 security breach
is currently subject of a Justice Department criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   -- The loss earlier this year of laptop computers containing
classified material from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   -- The discovery in December of a listening device at the State
Department in a seventh-floor conference room. A Russian found
monitoring the transmissions from his car parked outside the
department was expelled from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   -- A Pentagon review panel was criticized last winter for giving
security clearances to employees of defense contractors who had
criminal records, financial problems and histories of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a while, the Republican ads write themselves,'' said
Stuart Rothenberg, who publishes a political newsletter. He said he
fully expects Republicans to use the Los Alamos developments as a
campaign issue. ''It goes to the question of competence, of
preparedness. I think it could move some voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Andy Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press, said he doesn't believe the matter will have
the public impact that it might have had during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kohut said, ''Anything that doesn't make the government
look good is not good for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And it has enough of a curiosity angle with the hard drive
missing, then found again, to attract a significant amount of
public attention,'' Kohut added.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Mark Mellman doesn't see that voters will
hold Gore in particular or Democrats in general to blame for either
high gasoline prices or lax security at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the security issue, Mellman conceded, ''Everybody is
in favor of being able to keep our secrets secret.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors Charles Schulz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four months after his death, Charles Schulz is
getting an honor he always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed a bill Tuesday giving the creator of
the ''Peanuts'' comic strip the Congressional Gold Medal, the
country's highest civilian honor and the one thing that Schulz -- a
World War II veteran -- had desired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peanuts'' fans across the country started a letter-writing
campaign advocating the tribute for the artist who brought to life
the angst-ridden character of Charlie Brown for nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz gave the nation ''a unique sense of optimism, purpose,
and pride. Whether through the Great Pumpkin Patch, the Kite-Eating
Tree, Lucy's Psychiatric Help Stand, or Snoopy's adventures with
the Red Baron, 'Peanuts' embodied human vulnerabilities, emotions,
and potential,'' the measure said.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old cartoonist died in February of complications
from colon cancer. His wife Jeannie is expected to accept the
award.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Eyed in Swayze Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tobacco, not alcohol, may have caused Patrick
Swayze to crash land his airplane earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said Monday they found a broken clamp on a
pressure hose that would have caused the cabin of Swayze's Cessna
to lose pressure. That, combined with the actor's chain-smoking,
could account for reports that he acted intoxicated immediately
after the landing in Prescott Valley on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze was flying from Van Nuys, Calif., to Las Vegas, N.M.,
when he made an emergency landing in a subdivision under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were reports of erratic behavior, bloodshot eyes
and empty beer cans in the plane, Swayze, 47, has not been charged
with a crime. Officials, who weren't able to interview him until 12
hours after the landing, say they don't have enough evidence to
support charges.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Crispin, an investigator with the National Transportation
Safety Board, said authorities have not ruled out the possibility
Swayze had been drinking, but they now have another possible
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze is best known for his roles in hit films such as ''Dirty
Dancing'' and ''Ghost.''

<HEADLINE> Kansas Launches Tour in Reno, Nev.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Kansas isn't ready to become ''Dust in the
Wind'' just yet.
</P>
<P>
   After a career spanning nearly 30 years -- some of them
admittedly lean -- they launched a tour here Tuesday night with Yes.
And next month, they'll issue their 19th album, ''Somewhere to
Elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunion disc marks the end of a 17-year absence by guitarist
Kerry Livgren, who also is chief writer on the group's first album
since 1998. He and bassist David Hope, who left Kansas with Livgren
in 1983, plan to drop by only occasionally for the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Along with opening for Yes, the band plans to continue a
decade-old tradition of more than 100 concert dates a year.
Guitarist Rich Williams said the group wouldn't mind cutting back a
bit if the new album is a hit, but will never stop touring.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hobby that turned into a career and we still enjoy it.
It keeps us going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I retired and was home all the time, my wife would go
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the group's biggest hits are ''Dust in the Wind,'' and
''Carry on Wayward Son.''

<HEADLINE> Condemned Man Evidence Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Results of independent genetic tests filed Tuesday
in a federal court call into question evidence used to condemn a
man to death for the 1993 abduction and strangulation of a
7-year-old girl, The Dallas Morning News reported on its Web site
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Blair, 30, was convicted in 1998 of molesting and
strangling Ashley Estell after she was abducted from a suburban
Dallas soccer field. The case sparked the Texas Legislature to pass
tough sexual-predator measures called ''Ashley's Laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Results of the DNA test, filed in Midland, show that hair found
on the floorboard of Blair's car ''could not have originated from
Ashley Estell, Michael Blair or any of their maternal relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The hair was among five that a forensic analyst used at trial to
link Blair to the girl. Defense attorneys and the state are
discussing procedures for DNA tests on the remaining hair samples
because some of the samples would be destroyed during testing.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's attorney's have also asked the federal court to subpoena
background information on Charles Linch, a forensics expert whose
analysis of hair and fiber provided the key physical evidence
against Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Linch underwent treatment for depression and alcoholism at the
urging of his supervisors at Dallas County's Southwestern Institute
of Forensics Sciences, who said they considered him a danger to
himself and possibly others, the newspaper previously reported.
</P>
<P>
   A previous DNA test, sought by Blair's appeals lawyers and
completed in January 1998, already contradicted Linch's findings
that a hair on a plaid blanket in Blair's car was ''microscopically
similar'' to Ashley's.
</P>
<P>
   Collin County District Attorney Tom O'Connell said the most
recent DNA result doesn't change his opinion about Blair's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no testimony ... (the hair) was hers or was his, so
from the standpoint of what DNA is all about, I don't think it's
quite as applicable to this situation,'' said O'Connell, who had
not seen the report.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, a previously convicted child molester, was convicted of
abducting Ashley on Sept. 4, 1993. The girl's body was discovered a
day later.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has had two executions that were stayed. A new date won't
be set until his federal appeals run their course.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans removed its indefinite reprieve for Johnny Paul Penry, a
mentally retarded murderer who has been on death row in Texas for
almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve was granted in December so the court could consider
appeals. Penry, who has an IQ estimated at between 50 and 60 and
the reasoning capacity of a 7-year-old, was convicted of the 1979
rape-slaying of a Livingston housewife.
</P>
<P>
   The court denied his appeal, which alleged violations of Penry's
constitutional rights. His death sentence was thrown out by the
U.S. Supreme Court in 1988, but he was retried in sentenced to
death in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala President's Family Moves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- The mother, sister and other family
members of Guatemala's president have left the country out of fear
of being targeted by a kidnapping ring.
</P>
<P>
   President Alfonso Portillo's mother, sister, son-in-law and two
nephews departed for Canada on Tuesday -- the first time a
president's family has left because of a threat by organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo said he received information that a kidnapping ring
known as Los Pasaco was targeting his family after he refused to
grant clemency for two of its members facing the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have information that led us to believe that there could be
some reprisal against my family,'' Portillo said. ''We are talking
about a ring that is dangerous, organized and with highly dangerous
people on the run, and it's better to take precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Amilcar Cetino Perez and Tomas Cerrate Hernandez are
scheduled to die by lethal injection June 29 for the January 1997
kidnapping of Bonifassi de Botran, one of the heirs to the sizable
Botran liquor distillery fortune.
</P>
<P>
   De Botran's family paid a ransom for her safe return, but days
later her body was found in a shabby home outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Two other members of the kidnapping ring escaped from prison 18
months ago, before being tried.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo did not say what security methods his family would be
taking in Canada. But even if the ring does attack a family member,
Portillo said he would not negotiate with assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his mother would return to Guatemala once the
men are executed, but the other family members plan to remain in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo's wife, the only family member protected by the
presidential guard, decided to stay with him in Guatemala. Also
remaining are nephews and cousins, whom the president did not
believe to be in danger. He did not say why.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, about 4,000 Guatemalan troops started patrolling
streets round the clock to help police who have been losing the
battle against a stubborn wave of kidnappings and robberies.

<HEADLINE> S.Koreans Keep Eye On U.S. Military  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAEHYANG-RI, South Korea (AP) -- A 63-year-old Roman Catholic
priest was the first into the fray at an anti-U.S. protest,
grabbing the throat of a policeman. Then leftist students waded in,
kicking police shields of reinforced plastic on cue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm quite old. I can't fight all these young people,'' said a
weary Rev. Moon Jung-hyun, resting later under a tree. ''That is
why I choose only one person, holding the neck. That is all I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon has long been a regular at demonstrations against the U.S.
troop presence in South Korea and has been arrested several times
for his cause, all to no avail. Now, in the wake of an inter-Korean
summit last week, the conduct of the American military is under
more scrutiny than it has been in years.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the 37,000 U.S. soldiers based in the South will
not change soon, despite the warming of ties between democratic
South Korea and communist North Korea. Most South Koreans support
the presence, mindful of the North's huge military across the
heavily armed border.
</P>
<P>
   But there are fresh questions about what role, if any, the U.S.
military should have if the Koreas make peace and reunify years, or
even decades, from now.
</P>
<P>
   One emergent view in the South is that U.S. forces, deployed
since the 1950-53 Korean War as a deterrent against the North,
could spoil reconciliation, said Han Jai-bong, a political theory
professor at Yonsei University in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the summit, Pyongyang reiterated a demand for their
withdrawal with bitter rhetoric that contrasted with its friendly
gestures toward the South.
</P>
<P>
   Han said some Koreans, buoyed by the first-ever meeting between
leaders of the two Koreas, might now think: '''Our fate is in our
hands. We're not going through Beijing or Washington or Tokyo or
Moscow.'
</P>
<P>
   ''If you start following that line of argument, then OK, what
about the American forces here?'' Han said.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, however, has said U.S.
troops should stay in Korea as guarantors of regional security even
if the peninsula reunifies. It is unclear what kind of realignments
that scenario would prompt among the four regional powers: the
United States, China, Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a warning that Korea's Cold War remains intact, Kim told a
group of 140 South Korean soldiers Monday to stay on their guard:
''If you are weak, inter-Korean talks will not progress smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Secretary Madeleine Albright is scheduled to visit
Seoul on Friday on an overnight trip, and will discuss the summit
with Kim. Topics will likely include the U.S. troop deployment in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the summit, the U.S. military was the focus of
scattered opposition in South Korea, most dramatically at a U.S.
Air Force bombing range near a seaside village, Maehyang-ri.
Villagers and activists claim the range is the source of noise and
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, South Korean police detained six protesters who
occupied the range. A day earlier, Moon and about 100 other
protesters confronted riot police guarding the range as U.S. jets
swooped toward seaside bull's-eye targets, guns crackling.
</P>
<P>
   Civic groups that campaigned against corruption ahead of
parliamentary elections in April have joined a drive for revision
of the Status of Forces Agreement, the legal code governing the
terms of the U.S. military presence in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say the code, known as SOFA, is too lenient toward the
United States, allowing it favorable land deals for bases as well
as too much jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers who commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and South Korean officials plan to restart stalled talks on
revising SOFA, but no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do really try to protect civilian populations from the
impact of the training that we must do,'' said Lee Ferguson, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. military. ''There's a lot of detail that
we would like to sit down and talk to the South Korean side
about.''
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional, small anti-U.S. protests near the U.S.
Embassy. But the rallies are a shadow of the violent showdowns in
the 1980s between police and students who accused Washington of
propping up South Korea's former authoritarian governments.
</P>
<P>
   In today's democratic South, anti-U.S. sentiment is more complex
because it is localized in areas where residents have specific
gripes about American troops, said Scott Snyder, Korea
representative of the Asia Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is more a kind of a 'not-in-my-backyard' syndrome, than a
broadbased protest against American influence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Subway Derailment Injures 60  </HEADLINE>
By DIEGO IBARGUEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A subway train derailed in the New York City
borough of Brooklyn late Tuesday, sending jolted passengers
skidding along the floors of their cars. At least 60 people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the injuries were serious, but none were considered to
be life-threatening, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People got shook up pretty badly,'' Giuliani told reporters at
the scene. ''Heads were injured and they bounced back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   The first three cars of a southbound ''B'' train derailed about
10 p.m. just as it pulled out of the DeKalb Avenue station. The
wheels of the third car skipped, causing the derailment, said
Richard Sheirer, director of the city's Office of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were just riding along and all of a sudden, the brake went
on and we all fell to the floor,'' said Ursula Janses, 61, standing
outside and clutching a wad of wet paper towels to her head, where
she was struck by a dislodged overhead handrail.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Charles, who was on her way home after work, said it felt
like someone had pulled the emergency brake. Passengers fell to the
floor and skidded toward the fronts of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   She said the conductor spoke over the loudspeaker, telling
passengers he had been injured, and to wait where they were for
paramedics to arrive. Those on the train remained calm, even though
the lights went out and the car doors had opened, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just waited,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel filled the street above the station, and
rescuers carried some passengers in stretchers and helped others to
safety. The most seriously injured included a passenger with a
heart condition and the other two had head traumas.
</P>
<P>
   Service in Brooklyn on the N, R, B, D and Q trains was expected
to be delayed through Wednesday's morning commute. The station is
near Junior's, a popular restaurant, and Long Island University's
Brooklyn campus.

<HEADLINE> Gas Price Investigation Opened  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A preliminary Federal Trade Commission inquiry
found nothing to explain why drivers in Chicago and Milwaukee are
paying as much as 65 cents more for a gallon of gas than other
parts of the country, prompting the agency to open a formal
investigation that will involve subpoenaing oil companies.
</P>
<P>
	   FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky told some members of the Illinois
congressional delegation Tuesday that the sudden price spikes are
''sufficiently questionable'' to warrant formal investigation into
possible price gouging and collusion.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency will being issuing subpoenas by the end of the week,
according to the lawmakers who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   An interim report is expected within 30-45 days, said Sen. Dick
Durbin, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Nations were meeting Wednesday in Vienna, Austria, and it
was widely believed that some increases in crude oil production
would be approved. The Clinton administration has been quietly
trying to move OPEC in that direction.
</P>
<P>
	   But analysts were anticipating only modest increases that likely
would do little to drive down gasoline prices that have reached as
high as $2.33 a gallon for regular grade in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department's weekly survey showed the cost of
gasoline nationally increased 5 cents a gallon from last week to
$1.68, a record high for a fourth week in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   ''There is gouging on the part of the large oil companies,''
insisted Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. He
and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the top Democrat in the House,
met with President Clinton last week to emphasize ''the seriousness
of the matter,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leading Democrats reportedly raised concerns that if
gasoline prices are not reined in, it could mean trouble for the
presidential bid of Vice President Al Gore and for Democratic
efforts to regain control of the House in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have lost no time in trying to tar the
administration, the Environmental Protection Agency's cleaner
gasoline rules and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson -- already under
attack because of security problems at the Los Alamos nuclear
weapons lab in New Mexico -- for the gasoline price surge.
</P>
<P>
	   ''This is the kind of thing people get mad about, and they want
action,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   At the request of the Clinton administration and members of
Congress, the FTC has for the past week been conducting an informal
inquiry into the steep gasoline prices. Until now the agency's
actions amounted to fact-finding, with no threat of subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
	   Durbin said Pitofsky told him and other Illinois lawmakers that
the agency's stepped-up probe could result in anything from
exoneration of the companies connected with the refining,
distribution and sale of gasoline to ''disgorgement,'' or the
payment of any illegal profits to the federal treasury. Any
potential criminal acts would be referred to the Justice Department
for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, citing reports of huge profits by the oil companies this
year, told a group of reporters ''the circumstances clearly warrant
a broadened investigation to see if there is collusion.'' However,
indications were the FTC was confining its investigation to the
hardest-hit Chicago-Milwaukee corridor.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky was unavailable for comment. FTC offices were closed
for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., who also met with Pitofsky,
questioned whether the agency has enough evidence to start a formal
investigation. He said the administration appears to be looking for
ways to blame the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry executives have strongly criticized suggestions that
companies are colluding or gouging customers. They blame price
increases on market conditions, tight supplies, transportation
problems and complications in refining the newly required
cleaner-burning gasoline, especially when ethanol is used in the
blend as it is in Chicago and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
	   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Indiana, Gov. Frank O'Bannon suspended for 60 days the
state sales tax on gasoline. The reduction is expected to cut gas
prices by about a dime, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House
Science Committee, released a Congressional Research Service memo
saying that the use of ethanol in the clean-air program was
responsible for about 25 cents of the recent spike. Pipeline
problems account for another 25 cents, according to CRS.
</P>
<P>
	   Several governors have urged the EPA to lift the new, stricter
clean-air rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House, trying to stem political fallout in the
Midwest, which is viewed as pivotal to Democratic hopes in the
November elections, rejected suggestions that the EPA's requirement
for cleaner fuel in areas with severe summer ozone problem is to
blame.
</P>
<P>
	   ''That's an argument that just doesn't stand the test of
logic,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA has said the cleaner gasoline should have added 3 cents
to 8 cents to the cost of a gallon of fuel.

<HEADLINE> 2 Arrested in British Truck Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By MAUREEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The deaths of 58 migrants during a painful,
four-month odyssey from southern China to England has brought home
the scale of the global trade in smuggled humans -- and the gaps in
international borders that let illegal immigrants slip through.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Chinese migrants fitting the description of the
victims was detained in Belgium two months ago, Belgian police
confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Film footage of the group smiling and waving was shown by the
British Broadcasting Corp., which said their numbers matched the 56
men and four women found in the truck in the English port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they are not the same group, the incident suggests the
huge numbers of migrants moving illegally -- and more often than not
undetected -- through Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If they are the same, it raises questions about how they were
allowed to disappear again.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian police said they detained several groups of Chinese
found in the villages of Bornem and Puurs, about 15 miles south of
Antwerp, on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''From their papers, it was obviously the case of illegal
people-trading,'' said police spokesman Frank van den Bulck.
</P>
<P>
   He said the migrants were ordered to leave the country and
placed unescorted on a train to Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   The 58 victims found in Dover, along with two survivors, were
discovered late Sunday stowed with a cargo of tomatoes after a
five-hour ferry ride from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. They had
died of respiratory failure, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kent police said there was nothing to indicate that the truck
was the same one in the BBC film.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dutch police were questioning a man they arrested
during raids on three houses in Rotterdam. They refused to say
whether the suspect was a 24-year-old Dutch engineer who last week
registered a company that leased the truck. Britain's Daily
Telegraph newspaper reported Wednesday that Rotterdam police had
confirmed the arrested man was Arie Van der Spek, who set up the
firm, Van der Spek Transporten.
</P>
<P>
   In Dover, Dutch and British police interrogated the truck driver
who brought the young stowaways, most in their 20s, on the
disastrous final leg of their journey from southern China's Fujian
province.
</P>
<P>
   Fujian is notorious for immigrant-smuggling gangs, known as
''snake heads'' who charge up to $60,000 per person for perilous,
illegal passages the West.
</P>
<P>
   The two survivors, vital to tracing the smugglers, remained
under police guard -- traumatized by their struggle to escape as
their companions collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have 60 young people in the back of a truck, there would
have to have been some organization to get these people over from
China,'' Kent county police Detective Superintendent Dennis
McGookin said in Dover. ''In liaising with the Chinese police
hopefully we will know more on this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The disaster has focused international attention on the
racketeers and on the desperate risks illegal immigrants take to
flee oppression or poverty.
</P>
<P>
   European and Chinese leaders alike pledged new attempts to stem
the tide.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said European leaders would
tackle the ''trade in human misery and human beings.'' In Beijing,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said the international
community must ''join hands to crack down on illegal immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   But still they kept coming. Britain's Home Office said 128
people had been caught at Dover alone since Sunday, including
Iraqis, Afghans, Iranians and Poles.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officers find up to 2,000 illegal immigrants hidden in
trucks at or near British ports each month -- and believe many more
slip through.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese attorney in London, Wahplow Tan, said Chinese families
in Britain who feared their relatives were among the dead were
afraid to come forward for fear of deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports Wednesday suggested the authorities may allow the two
survivors to remain in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will always look at cases where compelling compassionate
circumstances are to be found,'' said a Home Office official quoted
in The Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A prayer vigil at the Dover docks on Tuesday evening was
attended by only 30 people -- a sign of resentment in the port,
which some residents feel has been deluged with illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was something that needed to be done to say we are
thinking of them, particularly in a town where there is so much bad
feeling,'' said the Rev. Robin Blount, a Port of Dover chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should remember these are not all 'illegal' immigrants,
as many are fleeing terrible situations and seeking asylum.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 9, Astros 6, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Gary Sheffield capped a four-run 10th inning with
his 21st homer of the season, leading the Dodgers to a 9-6 victory
over the Houston Astros on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied 5-5, Chad Kreuter led off the 10th with a
double off Joe Slusarski, and pinch-runner Paul LoDuca scored the
go-ahead run on pinch-hitter Jose Vizcaino's single.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Vizcaino was traded to the New York Yankees for
catcher-first baseman Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   After Todd Hollandsworth singled and Mark Grudzielanek struck
out, Sheffield homered to left, making it 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (4-0) picked up the win with one perfect inning of
relief. Jeff Shaw blew his sixth save in 18 opportunities this
season, giving up Jeff Bagwell's 17th homer leading off the ninth
</P>
<P>
   Chris Truby had an RBI groundout in the bottom of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Slusarski (1-4) allowed four runs on five hits in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown ended a string of three straight complete games,
allowing four runs on nine hits and a walk, with five strikeouts in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   In was only the second time in nine career starts against
Houston that Brown allowed more than one earned run. He allowed
three earned runs in a no-decision July 26, 1998, pitching for San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Valdes, who relieved starter Chris Holt in the seventh,
gave up an unearned run in the eighth. With two outs, Alex Cora
reached on shortstop Tim Bogar's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Yorkis Perez relieved Valdes and allowed a single to
pinch-hitter Kevin Elster, then walked Hollandsworth to load the
bases. Doug Henry relieved Perez and walked Grudzielanek to bring
in Cora and make it 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed 10 hits and two walks in six innings, striking out
six.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers had a double, single and two RBIs for Houston before
leaving in the fourth inning with a strained hamstring. He is
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers led off the first with a double to right-center, moved to
third on Craig Biggio's sacrifice bunt, and scored on Bagwell's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Cora tied it in the second when his double to the left-field
bullpen screen drove in Chad Kreuter from first.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros regained the lead on Mitch Meluskey's eighth home
run, leading off the bottom of the second.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Grudzielanek singled, went to third on Sheffield's
single and scored on Shawn Green's infield grounder to tie it 2-2.
Sheffield went to second on Eric Karros' walk and scored on Adrian
Beltre's single to center for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers' two-run single up the middle scored Tim Bogar and Glen
Barker to give Houston a 4-3 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Green's single to center in the fifth drove in Sheffield and
tied the score for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek went 3-for-5 and walked with the bases loaded in
the eighth to put Los Angeles ahead 5-4.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Barker had a career-high three hits, all singles and two in
the infield. ... Spiers' wife Laura gave birth to a baby girl
Monday. ... Bogar ended an 0-for-25 slump with an infield single in
the fourth ... Green's single in the fifth gave him a 50-game
streak of reaching base by either a hit or walk ... The Dodgers are
0-3 when Sheffield does not start ... The Dodgers and Astros are
the only two NL teams with five players who have 10 or more home
runs.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Giants 2, 8 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rick Ankiel dominated at home again with six
strong innings, and Craig Paquette hit a three-run homer as the St.
Louis Cardinals beat the San Francisco Giants 7-2 in a rain
shortened game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was called in the top of the ninth after an hour and 29
minute rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks' two-run homer in the second was the only damage
against Ankiel, 20, who allowed three hits, walked three and struck
out eight. Ankiel (6-3) worked on nine days' rest so he could pitch
at home, where he's 5-0 with a 2.52 ERA; he's 1-3 with a 5.83 ERA
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Paquette hit his sixth homer, and first since May 25, off Russ
Ortiz (3-7) as the Cardinals broke a 2-2 tie with four runs in the
fifth. Jim Edmonds added his 21st homer, an RBI single and a
home-run robbing catch high above the center-field wall of Burks to
end the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds leaped and grabbed onto the top of the eight-foot-high
wall and caught the ball with his free arm. He homered in the third
to tie the score 2-2 and drove in a run with his hit in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, 1-2 in the majors in home runs,
had fairly quiet nights. Bonds, who has 26 homers, struck out his
first three at-bats, while McGwire, who needs one homer to tie Mike
Schmidt for seventh on the career list at 548, singled and scored,
walked and struck out twice.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central-leading Cardinals, who've won seven of eight, are
11 games above .500 (40-29), matching their season best.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have lost 13 of 16 on the road and dropped to .500
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz lasted 4 1-3 innings, giving up six runs on seven hits
with five walks and five strikeouts. Ortiz, who won 18 games last
season, has given up 21 earned runs in 22 innings and is 0-2 his
last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford, who was in a 2-for-15 skid, had an RBI single in
the first for St. Louis. Pinch-hitter Larry Sutton singled and
eventually scored on Edgar Renteria's sacrifice fly to make it 7-2
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny threw out Ramon Martinez and
Calvin Murray attempting to steal, and is 19-for-34 on the season.
... The Cardinals didn't win their 40th game last season until July
5. ... Jeff Kent was 0-for-1 with two walks, ending a 10-game RBI
streak. The NL RBI leader with 66, Kent had 14 during the streak.
... Burks is batting .382 career against the Cardinals with 17
homers and 51 RBIs. ... St. Louis starters lead the majors with 38
victories, with relievers contributing only two.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Minnesota Twins left-hander Eric Milton
will skip his next start after being hit in his throwing hand
during batting practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milton (6-2, 5.06 ERA) was scheduled to start the series finale
of Minnesota's three-game series at Texas on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Twins manager Tom Kelly said X-rays revealed no broken bones.

   While Milton will skip his start, Kelly said he still plans for
the pitcher to throw on the side Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Joe Mays (3-9, 5.72 ERA) will move up a day to

   The only hit he allowed was Steve Finley's two-out single in the
fourth inning. Arizona's lone run was unearned. Tollberg walked
three and struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman pitched a scoreless ninth for his 18th save in 19
opportunities, and fourth in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's two homers and Arizona's weak offense spoiled a strong
outing by Todd Stottlemyre (8-5). Stottlemyre has lost his last
three starts. The Diamondbacks were shut out in the first two of
those losses, then scored one run Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 7 2-3 innings, Stottlemyre allowed two earned runs on six
hits. He struck out 10, his first double-digit strikeout game in
his two seasons with Arizona and 17th of his career, and didn't
walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko, in his first multiple-homer game with San Diego and 10th
of his career, put San Diego up 1-0 with a 414-foot shot over the
swimming pool beyond the right-field fence in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres made it 2-0 with an unearned run in the fifth. Bret
Boone led off with a single, and attempted to steal second. Catcher
Kelly Stinnett's throw went into center field for an error,
allowing Boone to advance to third.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera lofted a sacrifice fly to Travis Lee in right. Lee
fired the ball to Stinnett as Boone attempted to score. Boone
crashed into the Arizona catcher, and Stinnett dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored their lone run without a hit in the
fifth. Lee led off with a walk and moved to second on Stottlemyre's
one-out sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack hit a sharp grounder to second baseman Boone, who
couldn't handle it, then threw wildly to home as Lee scored from
second.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's 13th home run of the season on an 0-2 pitch with two
outs in the fifth put San Diego ahead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Walker pitched a scoreless eighth in relief of Tollberg.
</P>
<P>
   Home plate umpire Doug Eddings threw Arizona second baseman Jay
Bell out of the game after Bell vehemently protested a called third
strike that ended the fifth inning. Bell, who thought the pitch was
high, slammed his bat to the ground in disgust and shouted at
Eddings, who immediately ejected the player.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and Eddings had a confrontation Monday night when Bell was
called out at first base. Replays showed Bell should have been
safe.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In addition to his throwing error and dropping the ball in
the collision at home, Stinnett was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts.
... After severe thunderstorms cooled the desert air, the roof was
open at Bank One Ballpark. ... Klesko has hit safely in 10 of his
last 11 games. ... Since June 2, Arizona is 5-11. ... Tollberg, who
has 102 career minor league starts, was 6-0 in Las Vegas with a
2.83 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 4, Devil Rays 3  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Paul Abbott pitched seven strong innings and
Rickey Henderson had a two-run single as the Seattle Mariners beat
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 4-3 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott (4-2) allowed a two-run homer to Gerald Williams in the
fifth inning after the Mariners took a 4-1 lead with an unearned
run in the third on shortstop Felix Martinez's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored three runs in the second inning to beat
Steve Trachsel (5-7) for the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud doubled, John Mabry walked and Joe Oliver singled in
Olerud to make it 1-0. After David Bell walked to load the bases,
Henderson singled to center.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki got two outs for his 11th save in 13 chances.
Sasaki put two runners on base before Ozzie Guillen popped out to
end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored a run in the third on a walk to Guillen, a
single by Martinez and Quinton McCracken's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, the Mariners made it 4-1 when
Olerud doubled again, went to third on a wild pitch by Trachsel and
scored when Martinez's wide throw from shortstop pulled first
baseman Fred McGriff off the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen doubled before Williams hit his seventh homer of the
season in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, baseball's career stolen base king, delighted the
Safeco Field crowd of 29,349 with his 1,347th career steal in the
seventh after apparently being picked off by Trachsel. McGriff
tried to run Henderson down, but missed as Henderson dove into
second.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott gave up three runs and four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel allowed four runs -- three earned -- and five hits in his
third complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: If RHP Gil Meche isn't able to take his turn in the
rotation for the Mariners on Friday night against Baltimore, Brett
Tomko will start in his place. Meche has experienced a mysterious
''dead arm'' this season. ... The Devil Rays' record in June
dropped to 11-7. ... Trachsel has a 9.75 ERA in his three starts --
all losses -- against Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Trade Leyritz to Dodgers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The New York Yankees finally made a trade, just
not the one everyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series champions picked up defensive insurance for
struggling second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, acquiring infielder Jose
Vizcaino from the Los Angeles Dodgers for Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll have a lot of chances to win over there,'' Vizcaino said.
''I think I'll have more playing time over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, a switch-hitter who plays second, third and shortstop,
was hitting .204 with four RBIs, including a go-ahead pinch-hit
single in Los Angeles' 9-6, 10-inning win over Houston on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Vizcaino has only two errors in 34 games,
giving Yankees manager Joe Torre a late-inning defensive
replacement option for Knoblauch, who has 13 errors in 48 games.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he would use a defensive replacement for the 1997
Gold Glove winner for the immediate future. Knoblauch made three
throwing errors last Thursday, forcing Torre to send him home
early, and hit a fan in the stands with a throw on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz was hitting .218 with one homer and four RBIs in limited
playing time with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been talking about it for a week,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ''It came to fruition tonight. I think
it will help us both. Leyritz has been on championship clubs before
and knows how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With starting catcher Todd Hundley on the disabled list with a
strained muscle in his right side, Leyritz will get a chance to
catch and be a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can catch him occasionally but basically he is a threat from
the right side,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ''He'll strengthen
our bench.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing four straight games to the Chicago White Sox over
the weekend, there was speculation New York was close to making a
trade. Detroit's Juan Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa of the Cubs have been
the most prominent names mentioned for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   New York also received an undisclosed amount of cash from the
Dodgers in the deal. Vizcaino makes $3.5 million this season;
Leyritz makes $1 million.

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Lisa Leslie tied a season-high with 21
points and grabbed a career-high 14 rebounds as the Los Angeles
Sparks snapped Houston's six-game winning streak with a 90-84
victory over the Comets on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory put second-place Los Angeles (7-2) one game behind
the Comets (9-2) in the WNBA's Western Divsiion.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie scored 11 of her points during a four-minute stand late
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika added 21 points for Los Angeles, while Ukari Figgs
had 12 points and a career-high eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Sheryl Swoopes led all scorers with 27 points, and
Cynthia Cooper had 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets held a 12-7 lead when the Sparks went on an 11-0
blitz in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Houston failed to make a basket for nearly 10 minutes of the
opening half.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles began the second half with a 7-2 spurt in the first
1&AMP;frac12; minutes to extend its lead to 53-43.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets narrowed the deficit to 84-78 with nearly a minute to
play, but the Sparks made 6 of 8 free throws in the final 60
seconds to secure the victory.

<HEADLINE> Keim Closes In on 2nd Olympic Berth  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Jenny Keim didn't have time for the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Diving with a partially torn right triceps that she injured in
mid-May, Keim qualified first for the 3-meter springboard finals
Tuesday night in pursuit of her second Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little sore and it's going to be a long week,'' said
Randy Ableman, Keim's coach who spoke on her behalf while she
received treatment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Keim, who finished ninth on springboard at the 1996 Olympics,
took the lead for good after her eighth of 10 dives in the
semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   She concluded with her favorite dive, a forward 1&AMP;frac12; somersault
with a twist, earning marks ranging from 7.0 to 8.5 from the seven
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Keim, who turned 22 last Saturday, finished first with 536.55
points on the opening night of the U.S. Olympic Trials at King
County Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to be greedy, but it's never enough,'' Ableman said.
''I know we're only halfway there. It's going to be a heck of a
contest Wednesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Keim had to miss a couple weeks of training in Miami, Fla.,
after tearing her triceps. Ableman said the injury will especially
affect her during the 10-meter competition that begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Melisa Moses Hyams, fourth on springboard at the Atlanta Games
but bothered by injuries recently, failed to make the 12-woman
finals by one spot. She finished 13th with 461.07 points.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Hyams had only begun training two weeks ago. Over the last
four years, she's undergone three shoulder surgeries, elbow and
knee surgeries and had a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have any expectations. I wanted to do the best I
could; obviously, I didn't do very well,'' she said. ''I was fairly
consistent for nine dives, but I really trashed one of them. I gave
a dive away. You can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Davison, a 20-year-old from Columbia, S.C., finished
second with 528.86 points. She was fifth on springboard at the '96
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy myself when the pressure's on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davison was cheered by 15 family members, including her brother,
Brian, who paced a hallway above the seating section between her
dives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love to see him walk back and forth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The top two finishers in Wednesday night's finals earn Olympic
berths.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Rojohn, a part-time model and server at a steak house
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., dropped to third on her final dive after
briefly leading after her seventh dive. She finished with 520.35
points.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Lewandowski of Bloomington, Ind., was fourth with 502.92,
and Angie Trostel of Cincinnati was fifth with 496.20.

<HEADLINE> Reggie White May Join Titans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Reggie White, the NFL's career sacks
leader, reportedly is interested in coming out of retirement to
play for the AFC champion Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   No firm negotiations between White and Titans officials have
been held. But White and coach Jeff Fisher have discussed how he
would be used by Tennessee, according to a report posted Tuesday on
the CBS SportsLine.com Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to Titans officials Tuesday night weren't
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no way of knowing yet where this is going, because
there haven't been any numbers out there from either side,'' an
unidentified source said to be close to White told SportsLine.com.
''But he really never wanted to leave when he did, and there's
something inside of him that can't leave it behind yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of White's return to the field was fueled
Tuesday when NFL officials upheld their suspension of Titans'
defensive tackle Josh Evans for the 2000 season for a repeat
violation of the league's substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Evans also has triggered speculation the Titans
might seek Arizona defensive tackle Eric Swann, who is expected to
be released by the Cardinals later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Swann has expressed a preference to play in his home state of
North Carolina with the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   White, 38, is a native of Chattanooga and played for the
University of Tennessee. He began his professional career with the
Memphis Showboats of the United States Football League.
</P>
<P>
   During his 14 years with the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green
Bay Packers, White amassed a league-record 192&AMP;frac12; sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay still holds contractural rights to White, but it's
believed the Packers wouldn't seek compensation if he opts to come
out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans currently are only $54,000 under the NFL salary cap,
but will get back Evans' $900,000 base salary as a result of his
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap still could be a problem, because the team is
negotiating a contract extension with running back Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year pro John Thornton filled Evans' spot during the
Titans' recently concluded minicamp. A second-round pick in 1999,
Thornton started three games as a rookie and totaled 33 tackles and
4&AMP;frac12; sacks.

<HEADLINE> Royals 8, Angels 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mike Sweeney had four hits, including a
game-tying RBI single in the ninth, and Joe Randa followed with his
second RBI single as the Kansas City Royals rallied from three runs
down for a 8-6 victory over the Anaheim Angels on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Randa, Carlos Beltran and Jeff Reboulet each had three hits in a
17-hit attack by the Royals, who snapped their three-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago (6-2) pitched two innings of one-hit ball in
relief of starter Jeff Suppan to earn the victory. Ricky Bottalico
got three outs for his fifth save in 10 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival (4-4) blew a save for the fifth time in 22
chances, giving up singles to all four batters he faced. Beltran
and Jermaine Dye opened the inning with singles and advanced on a
wild pitch to Sweeney, who lined an opposite-field single to right
that scored Beltran. Randa then singled to left, scoring Dye with
the go-ahead run. Luis Ordaz added an RBI single against Mark
Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon hit his fifth career grand slam and Garret Anderson
added a two-run homer for Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cooper was charged with five runs -- four earned -- and nine
hits in six-plus innings, including a pair of RBI singles by
Sweeney. The right-hander, who had a no-decision against Tampa Bay
in his previous start despite pitching eight scoreless innings, was
removed with a 6-3 lead after Johnny Damon and Reboulet opened the
seventh with singles.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, who stole second and advanced to third on Reboulet's hit,
scored on Beltran's sacrifice fly against Shigetoshi Hasegawa. The
right-hander then gave up an RBI single to Randa that narrowed the
gap to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored four runs on their first hit of the game --
Salmon's 16th homer into the left-field bullpen in the third
inning-- to take a 4-3 lead. Suppan, who surrendered three homers in
a 6-4 loss at Anaheim on May 19, walked Darin Erstad and Kevin
Stocker with two outs, and hit Mo Vaughn on the left forearm with a
2-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan, who has given up a team-high 21 homers this season,
walked Salmon on four pitches his next time up with one out in the
sixth. Anderson, whose grand slam on May 21 helped beat the Royals
in Anaheim, followed with his 18th home run for a 6-3 lead.
Anderson is only three shy of his career best, established last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 21-3 loss Sunday to Oakland, the most lopsided in
the team's 32-year history, the Royals built a 3-0 lead in the
first three innings. Reboulet singled in the first inning, advanced
on Beltran's double and scored on Dye's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran scored on a single to center by Sweeney, who made it 3-0
in the third with a single to left after Beltran singled and
advanced on Cooper's errant pickoff throw.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan was charged with six runs, four hits and four walks over
six innings. He also hit two batters, including Troy Glaus, who
homered twice against the right-hander the last time he faced the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Four of Salmon's five grand slams have been hit in Anaheim.
... Angels team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum has a busy week ahead --
attending to players from other teams. Before he performs
arthroscopic surgery Friday on the left shoulder of Royals
left-hander Jose Rosado, he is scheduled to meet with Houston's
Billy Wagner. The Astros' struggling closer wants a second opinion
on his left elbow, following an MRI that showed a partial tear of
the flexor tendon that could end the left-hander's season. ... Dye
is leading AL outfielders in All-Star voting, and could become the
first Kansas City player to get a starting nod since Bo Jackson in
1989. That was the year Jackson led off the midsummer classic at
Anaheim with a long home run to center field. ... Anaheim
right-hander Kent Bottenfield threw a simulated game Tuesday and is
expected to be activated in time to start Saturday against
Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Police Shootings Spark Outrage  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE FARROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- What began as an undercover drug arrest ended
with the deaths of two unarmed men in a hail of 20 police bullets
fired into their car. Both men were black. The officers were white.
</P>
<P>
   A race-tinged incident like this sounds familiar to many across
the country, but these shootings have stirred such anger that black
civic leaders are calling for acts of civil disobedience and the
Justice Department has sent a mediator to St. Louis. Attorney
General Janet Reno also has agreed to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The African-American community is outraged at the vigilante
action by undercover guerrilla cowboys,'' said Tiahmo Rauf, a local
leader of the National Action Network, a group founded by the Rev.
Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Rauf led an emotional meeting Monday night of about 100 people
at a community center near the fast-food restaurant where Earl
Murray and Ronald Beasley were killed June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Police have acknowledged that Beasley was not being
investigated. Friends and relatives say he had simply asked his
friend Murray for a ride to a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, police said, stopped off at the restaurant to complete a
drug deal he had made with an undercover officers.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers then arrived in separate cars and boxed in Murray.
The officers -- who have not been identified -- said they opened fire
in self defense after Murray furiously tried to ram his way free.
</P>
<P>
   But others criticized the police for alleged racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's happened time and time again where you have white
officers shooting black people, not black officers shooting black
people or white officers shooting white people,'' said James
Buford, head of the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling -- the practice of stopping and arresting
minorities who fit a general criminal description -- has come under
increased scrutiny nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded that
the New York Police Department improperly uses racial profiling to
stop and question people, leading to racial tensions that can lead
to ''tragic and unnecessary'' incidents like the shooting of Amadou
Diallo. The unarmed African immigrant died in a hail of 41 police
bullets in February 1999. The four white officers who said they
fired because they thought Diallo had pulled a weapon -- it was a
wallet -- were acquitted of all charges earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent allegations of profiling in other states -- including
New Jersey, Florida, Connecticut and Illinois -- prompted President
Clinton to require federal law-enforcement agencies to record race
and gender in all stops. At the state level, some police
departments are requiring officers to record the race of all
drivers they stop.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan signed a bill
that requires local and state police agencies to track whether
officers are deliberately targeting members of certain racial
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Racial tension has been building in St. Louis for years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an officer was charged with second-degree murder
after allegedly striking a fatal blow to the head of an alleged
burglar, who was black, following the man's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   That came on the heels of an acquittal for an officer accused of
attacking a mentally retarded black 19-year-old. The teen suffered
head cuts and a broken ankle when he struggled with police after
accidentally tripping the burglar alarm at his family's apartment
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Robert McCulloch pledged a thorough investigation of
last week's shooting, but angered Rauf and others by refusing to
turn over restaurant surveillance tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Rauf has called for McCulloch to turn over the videotapes or
prepare for a march on his office. He also threatened a shutdown of
busy Interstate 70, a ploy that proved successful last summer in
getting minority contractors a greater share of work in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a long, hot summer and we're going to keep
rumbling until we get what we want,'' Rauf said. ''We want nothing
less than those cops being indicted because they're criminals.''

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Disks' Timeframe Unclear  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They may have contained highly classified
nuclear secrets, but two computer drives causing all the ruckus at
the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory left virtually no paper
trail while they were missing.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing dozens of people and conducting a string of
polygraph tests, investigators are stymied in trying to determine --
even in general terms -- when the two hard drives vanished from a
highly secured vault at the federal laboratory in New Mexico. It
may have been as long as six months ago, government officials fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last actual inventory that gives us a degree of certainty
took place as part of the Y2K inventory,'' Rep. Porter Goss,
R-Fla., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an
interview Tuesday. That was a few days after New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   ''That screams at me and says we've got a procedure problem,''
added Goss, a former CIA officer who has kept in close touch with
the FBI and Energy Department investigation into the disappearance
-- and then reappearance -- of the two hard drives, which contain
information about how to dismantle nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was to make his first
appearance on Capitol Hill Wednesday on the Los Alamos case as he
testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the laboratory to require basic logout and login
procedures for the devices is expected to be among the issues
troubling committee members. Energy Department and lab officials
have said no such tracking was required under a relaxed policy
instituted in the early 1990s for material classified as ''secret''
-- as opposed to ''top secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was still electronically examining the two drives, which
suddenly reappeared behind a copying machine last Friday not far
from the vault where they were supposed to be kept. The area, where
access was limited to people with high security clearances, had
been searched several times, raising the possibility someone might
have misplaced and then returned them.
</P>
<P>
   But when were they last taken from the vault and by whom?
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, the Energy
Department's new top security officer, and Los Alamos Lab Director
John Browne said in congressional testimony that a scientist had
reported seeing the two devices in the vault on April 7, a month
before they were found missing and seven weeks before senior lab
officials were notified.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the investigation said Tuesday that this
account, although not entirely dismissed, has come under suspicion
because of ''conflicting statements'' made during interviews and
polygraph tests. Another individual has told investigators he went
into the vault on April 27 and would have noticed if they had been
missing then, but does not recall actually seeing them.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear, said Goss, is that there was inadequate tracking
on paper of the use of the two drives, which belonged to an
emergency nuclear response team. Members of the team, known as
NEST, have been the focus of the FBI criminal investigation. The
team is trained to be ready to find and disarm a nuclear device on
short notice. The disks, or drives, are designed for use in a
laptop computer and are part of an emergency response ''kit''
available to team members.
</P>
<P>
   All 26 individuals who had unescorted access to the vault have
been given polygraph tests, according to Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Browne, the lab's director, has testified that security rules
for the tracking of items classified as secret were eased
government-wide in 1992 to reduce the cost of handling the large
amount of documents carrying this designation. In early 1993 it was
extended by then-President Bush to government contractors such as
the University of California, which runs the Los Alamos lab. The
policy was continued by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board a year ago
cited inadequate tracking of secret nuclear materials in a stinging
rebuke of security at the Energy Department and its weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   While the current Los Alamos security break likely did not
involve espionage, ''in some ways it's worse,'' former Sen. Warren
Rudman, chairman of the advisory board, said in an interview.
''Espionage is very hard to guard against. You win some and lose
some. Here you've got a situation where there just sloppy
accountability and record keeping.''

<HEADLINE> Prince William To Miss Royal Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- His birthday is the most eagerly anticipated royal
event in years. But Prince William, who turns 18 on Wednesday, will
not be joining his relatives at a private Windsor Castle party
marking several royal birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   William, who finishes his studies at Eton later this summer,
will be cramming for his final exams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have an exam on the day but I will be studying for my
History of Art exam the next day,'' William told the British news
agency, Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   In a royal birthday landmark, the British newspaper The Sun
reported Wednesday that William's great-grandmother, the Queen
Mother Elizabeth, would make a rare public speech to thank her
well-wishers at her birthday pageant in July. It will be the first
chance many Britons will have to hear her speak.
</P>
<P>
   The private event Wednesday will celebrate several royal
birthdays -- that of the Queen Mother, who turns 100 in August; the
50th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Princess Anne; the
40th birthday of the queen's son, Prince Andrew, and the 70th
birthday of the queen's sister, Princess Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace has not disclosed details of the party, but
reports said more than 600 guests, including many British and
European royals, would be treated to drinks, dancing and a hearty
midnight breakfast at the castle. The queen has spent $150,000 of
her own money on the fete, The Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   William, the elder son of Prince Charles and the late Princess
Diana, said he would ''no doubt ... celebrate privately with some
friends'' at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   After he finishes his studies at Eton, William will become fair
game for the photographers eager to snap his picture and a public
eager to devour images of the handsome prince, even though recent
polls have found that many Britons would prefer giving William some
privacy until he begins his royal duties.
</P>
<P>
   William has announced that he will postpone the use of the
designation His Royal Highness, which royals usually adopt at 18,
because his unlikely to carry out royal duties until he has
finished university.
</P>
<P>
   The party Wednesday marks a thaw in relations between the queen
and her former daughter-in-law, the Duchess of York. It is the
first time the former Sarah Ferguson has been on a royal guest list
since Princess Diana's funeral in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Not invited, however, is Prince Charles' longtime love Camilla
Parker Bowles, despite signs that she is gradually being welcomed
into the royal fold. Following the first social meeting between the
queen and Parker Bowles this month, she and Charles attended their
first semiofficial engagement together on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Germany, England Knocked From Euro  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, England (AP) -- Bye bye English fans. Bye bye
defending champion Germany. So long Lothar Matthaeus.
</P>
<P>
   Romania did UEFA a favor by ousting troublesome England from the
European soccer championships Tuesday, while Portugal's reserve
team brought Germany's reign to an end with a 3-0 humiliation that
had German fans jeering their players.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus, 39, made his world record 150th appearance, but
finished at a new low.
</P>
<P>
   England, whose fans disgraced their team and their nation by
rioting in Brussels and Charleroi, needed just a point against
Romania to make it to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Keegan's team led 2-1 early in the second half after
coming from behind. But goalkeeper Nigel Martyn, a last-minute
replacement for David Seaman, who injured his left leg in the
warmup, gave away a tying goal with a needless punchout, and
substitute Ioan Ganea fired home a penalty kick two minutes from
the end for a 3-2 Romanian win.
</P>
<P>
   That put the Romanians into the last eight along with Group A
winner Portugal and avoided UEFA taking the option of kicking out
England because of its violent fans.
</P>
<P>
   European soccer's governing body threatened that unprecedented
step if the England fans rioted again in the game against Romania.
They behaved well, perhaps because they were expecting to go to
Brussels for a quarterfinals showdown with Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Romanians go to Brussels. Keegan knows his team
wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I am devastated,'' he said. ''We did not play well
enough, but with five minutes to go I thought we could hang on to
something. But it was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've spent three matches chasing the football. We got into a
position of being 2-1 up, but we never played as well as we can. We
have to ask if we can pass it better and control a game. The answer
in this tournament is, sadly, we couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanian coach Emerich Jenei said the absence of standout player
Gheorghe Hagi, who is retiring from international soccer after Euro
2000, inspired his players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank my team, because they were very confident and able to
qualify,'' Jenei said. ''Because Hagi was absent, they tried to
make up for it. We showed today we are a good team. The penalty was
not a penalty, it was a present.''
</P>
<P>
   While England's huge army of fans trooped north in defeat, the
Germans went east in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   The fans jeered their own stars off the field after the
Portuguese, who rested nine of their regulars, strolled to a
comfortable win. Portugal even got the first hat trick of the
championship by a player who had been seething on the bench, Sergio
Conceicao.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm delighted to score three score goals and help Portugal
win,'' the Lazio player said. ''We had a brilliant game, people
said we could not repeat the form we showed against England, but we
showed we have a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's elation after wins over England, Romania and Germany
contrasted with the mood of German coach Erich Ribbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no fighting spirit, so it was there for all to see
what happened,'' said Ribbeck, who was expected to step down as
coach Wednesday after a stormy spell. ''I admit that I've failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus, whose appearances in the starting lineup at age 39
have been greeted with derision by some, won't want to remember his
last three games. Against the Romanians he was slow and constantly
caught out of position.
</P>
<P>
   The final positions in the remaining two groups will be decided
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the top of Group D are World Cup holder France and
co-host the Netherlands. They meet in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Group C is still wide open, with all four teams having a chance
of gaining the last eight.
</P>
<P>
   Group leader Yugoslavia, which has four points, meets Spain in
Bruges, Belgium, with the Spaniards one point behind. Norway, which
also has three points, faces Slovenia (one point), in Arnhem,
Netherlands.

OPEC Members May Boost Oil Output
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members appeared near an agreement to boost
daily crude oil production by at least half a million barrels above their quota
-- a move that hasn't impressed the markets as U.S. prices soared to a
3&AMP;frac12;-month high. Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries hoped to reach a formal decision Wednesday in Vienna, Austria. An
increase of 500,000 barrels daily would not significantly add to the flow of
crude to the market because it would equal roughly the amount of crude that
OPEC's 11 members are already pumping in excess of their official quotas.

<HEADLINE> Erving's Son Struggled With Alcohol  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- It has been a week since Julius Erving went
public with the news that his youngest son, Cory, is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, investigators have received more than 600 tips.
Family and friends have offered a $50,000 award. Police divers have
searched lakes and the Orlando Magic organization has distributed
leaflets with Cory's picture.
</P>
<P>
   The effort has turned up no credible leads for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   There is no trace of his car, a black Volkswagen Passat, which
investigators say is crucial to answering the mystery of what
happened to Cory Erving after he was last seen buying bread for a
family cookout over the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family remains hopeful, but obviously as each day goes by
it gets more frustrating,'' said Orlando Magic senior vice
president Pat Williams, who has known the Ervings for more than 25
years and is serving as a family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Erving moved with his family to Florida from the
Philadelphia area three years ago after the former Philadelphia
76ers star took a job as an executive with the NBA's Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Erving's disappearance is especially frustrating because
his family thought Cory was turning his life around after spending
the past five years in and out of drug rehabs in Florida and Texas.
He was studying for his high school equivalency degree and had
taken a job at a bakery-cafe.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Turquoise Erving, a regular customer at the cafe,
would give him only small amounts of money from his paycheck
because carrying too much cash might tempt him to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've done everything they can for this boy,'' Williams
said. ''He has had the best care and the best treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his battles with drugs and alcohol, Cory Erving has a
fun-loving, make-'em-laugh personality.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very witty,'' said Ed Sepko, general manager of Panera,
the bakery-cafe where Cory Erving had worked for two months. ''He
was a person you could joke around with.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not like Cory Erving to disappear without telling
anybody, Sepko said, since he would always ask when he wanted time
off. Sepko said he didn't know about the past drug problems when he
was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Julius Erving spoke of the difficulties his son may
have faced growing up. He struggled in school with dyslexia and may
have felt some pressure to succeed as a member of a famous family,
''living in the shadow of a public figure like myself,'' the
athlete said.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Erving children, Cory looks most like his father. But
the almost effortless success of his father seemed to elude him. He
didn't share his father's athletic talent and fared even worse
academically.
</P>
<P>
   His siblings fared better. Older brother Julius III, 26, runs a
sports and entertainment marketing business in the Philadelphia
area. His 23-year-old sister, Jazmin, is getting a master's degree
in marketing at Georgia State in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the exclusive confines of the gated community in which
his family lives north of Orlando, Cory Erving was known to hang
out in drug neighborhoods. In the days before he disappeared, he
apparently got in a fight with a person who broke the window of his
car with a brick. A witness has told investigators that Cory tried
to buy a gun and get even.
</P>
<P>
   The most credible tip received was a reported June 10 sighting
of Erving with an unidentified blond woman in Altamonte Springs,
just north of Orlando. Investigators don't have much else to work
with.
</P>
<P>
   The family has received calls of support from the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Bill Cosby and several NBA stars, including Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   As for Julius Erving, ''I'm awed by his composure and his
strength,'' Williams said. ''It's hard, very hard for him.''

<HEADLINE> Racial Profiling Lawsuit Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by
several current and former Highland Park police officers that
alleged racial profiling by members of the city's police
department.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joan Gottschall said Tuesday that lawyers
for the officers failed to connect the facts in a way lawyers for
Highland Park or the court could understand. Plaintiffs' lawyers
have 30 days to file a second, more coherent complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Keevan Morgan, a lawyer for the police officers, did not return
telephone messages seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three current and two former officers sued the department in
1998 over unfair labor practices, alleging, among other things,
that they were ordered to target minority drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Thomas Sullivan, a former U.S. attorney hired by the
city to investigate the police department, released a report saying
he found no evidence top police officials ordered officers to
target black and Hispanic drivers in the 1990s. Sullivan said that
while racial profiling was not officially sponsored by the command
staff, he did criticize the department for not quashing an
atmosphere that ''seemed to condone race-based conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Highland Park Mayor Dan Pierce said he was pleased with the
ruling, adding that the city will continue efforts to ensure
diversity and tolerance in the wealthy northern Chicago suburb.

<HEADLINE> Some Union Members Lean Toward Bush  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Another blue-collar shift under his belt,
union plumber Mark Evans strolls through Rouge Steel's revolving
gates, a mugshot of President Clinton taped to his identification
badge.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, he calls the image a spoof, not an endorsement of
Democrats or their presumptive presidential nominee, Vice President
Al Gore. Truth be told, the United Auto Workers member says he'll
probably vote for Gore's Republican rival, George W. Bush, in
November.
</P>
<P>
   To Evans, it's no easy call: ''I'm not really fond of either
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions are a traditional Democratic constituency, but
Evans represents a split among rank-and-file members over which
candidate would best represent the working class.
</P>
<P>
   While the 13-million-member AFL-CIO endorsed Gore last fall,
some major unions are holding out and Bush and other candidates are
seeking votes from members willing to break ranks.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Teamsters' executive board, which hasn't made
an endorsement, is to talk with Bush by telephone and meet
personally with consumer advocate Ralph Nader of the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Evans can't pinpoint why he leans toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I'm in the middle,'' Evans, 44, said Monday.
''When you're a cork in the middle of the ocean, there's only so
much you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   His uncertainty comes amid organized labor's anger with Gore
over legislation granting permanent normal trade relations to
China. Pushed by the Clinton administration, the bill passed the
Republican-controlled House last month. Senate passage is still
required, and is virtually assured.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to name Commerce Secretary William Daley -- the
administration point man on China trade -- as his new campaign chief
also angered labor. Leaders of the 1.5-million Teamsters union
called it ''a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers say the bill will open markets to U.S. products;
detractors led by organized labor contend it would cost American
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James P. Hoffa says his union may not
endorse anyone for president and he has made no secret of his
disappointment with Gore over his support for the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   But many union members interviewed this week weren't focused on
that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't agree with China and everything going over there,''
said Rick Duffy, a suburban Dayton, Ohio, bus driver and
Amalgamated Transit Union member. ''But sometimes you have to put
your personal preferences behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy said he will support Gore because his record proves he
''will do what he can for the working man.'' To Duffy, Bush's
record ''stands against labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, with three children, Duffy believes he's been better
off under Clinton and would continue to be under Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Gerard, 42, a UAW member at Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge
complex, feels betrayed by the Clinton economy. He was a middle
manager at a Detroit-area electrical distributor before abruptly
losing his job to downsizing in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went through a difficult period for a while after that,'' he
said. ''It's been a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard said he will vote for Bush as ''a lesser of two evils.''
</P>
<P>
   While labor unions traditionally support Democrats, the
Teamsters have swung between Democrats and Republicans over the
years. The union supported Bush's father in 1988, but jumped to
Clinton in 1992, and didn't endorse anyone in 1996 when Clinton was
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, UAW President Stephen Yokich said his union will
consider endorsing an alternative to Bush or Gore, mentioning Nader
as a prospect.
</P>
<P>
   David Rohde, a Michigan State University professor specializing
in presidential politics, said Bush might fare better among union
members than GOP nominee Bob Dole in 1996. The more moderate Texas
governor is ''seen as more favorable to some labor voters than
Dole,'' Rohde said.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls in the 1996 general election found that 30 percent of
union households voted for Dole, 59 percent for Clinton and 9
percent for Reform Party candidate Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   As for the China trade deal, Philadelphia union hotel worker
William Hollis considers it ''just one little decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Democrat and I've been a Democrat for a long time,''
said Hollis, 53. ''I guess I'll vote from there.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Teamsters Local 676's vice president, Vince
Buondonno, said ''a lot of people in the Teamsters are going to
support Bush, because of where we've gone in the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, the China trade deal has the United Steelworkers
of America polling members to consider whether to shift political
allegiances from Gore, spokesman Marco Trbovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Dearborn's UAW Local 600 headquarters, member David
Bartlett described Gore as ''more a working man type of candidate''
worthy of his vote. But when quizzed about the China deal, Bartlett
said he hadn't heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really need to read more about that,'' said the 39-year-old
auto worker. ''That would influence if I do vote.''

<HEADLINE> Gore To Sharpen Contrasts With Bush  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore looked to sharpen
differences with Texas Gov. George W. Bush as he resumed his
''progress and prosperity'' tour with a trip to one of the
Midwestern battlegrounds that will likely settle the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from spelling out a plan to augment Social Security, the
Democratic presidential contender vowed to underscore differences
he thinks can be exploited.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be giving a speech on Social Security and what I propose
to protect Social Security and what he proposes that would drain
money out of Social Security and empty the trust fund,'' Gore told
reporters aboard his airplane Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was headed Wednesday to Iowa to draw those contrasts in a
state with a lot of elderly voters that also has voted Democratic
in the last three presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   He has been loath to mention Bush by name, but that could
change. Asked whether he planned to name Bush, Gore said: ''Sure,
but I will never launch a personal, negative attack on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Gore was scheduled to propose a targeted
reduction in estate taxes, a plan costing $7 billion over 10 years,
according to Democrats familiar with the proposal. While Bush and
other Republicans have called for the estate tax to be eliminated,
Democrats warn that doing so would blow a hole in the budget and
mainly benefit the very rich.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's proposal, which was being previewed to Democratic
legislators, the estate tax reduction would be targeted at smaller
farmers and businesses while remaining for large operations, said
Democrats familiar with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the nation's farmers would be affected,
those Democrats said. Many family farmers -- particularly in the
Midwest where Gore is spending the next two days -- complain they
are forced to sell farms because of the crushing weight of estate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   After Iowa, Gore heads to Minnesota, where he and wife Tipper
plan to attend a horse show with Gov. Jesse Ventura and his wife
Terry and overnight at the governor's mansion. Gore also planned to
hold his seventh ''school day'' education event in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's topics include the environment.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has launched the high-profile ''progress and
prosperity'' tour to spotlight and take some credit for the good
economy, it's been repeatedly interrupted by outside events.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent pause came Tuesday when Gore raced back to
Washington from Kentucky, where he detailed a plan to augment
Social Security, to be on hand in case of a tie in the Senate on
hate crimes legislation. As president of the Senate, Gore can cast
a tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed easily, 57-42, and his vote wasn't needed.
But it was the latest instance where Gore has interrupted his
campaign to vote on issues playing a role in the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Tuesday's return was politically motivated, Gore said:
''It's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic leaders said they asked him to return because
they anticipated a close vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore allies think Bush can be hammered on the hate crimes issue
because of the 1998 death of James Byrd, a black man who was
dragged behind a pickup truck in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally don't understand why it is so difficult to see
that these crimes are really different,'' Gore told reporters as he
flew to Washington. ''They are fueled by the forces of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Gore returned to Washington for possible tie votes
on Kosovo, abortion, gun control and the confirmation of two
Hispanic judges.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, a key state targeted by Bush and Gore, the vice
president described a tax-free savings plan to augment Social
Security and help working-class Americans put away money for
retirement, a first home, or college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to cost $200 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If America doesn't keep making the right choices, we will
never be able to give our families the help they need,'' Gore said,
elaborating on his plan to use government funds to boost Americans'
savings and offer a ''threshold of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan counters Bush's proposal to allow taxpayers to divert
some Social Security taxes into private investments, which Gore
said would ''empty the trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said Gore's plan was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Low-income working people living paycheck to paycheck cannot
afford it, and it doesn't stop Social Security from going broke,''
Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, which would not involve Social Security
taxes, a married couple earning up to $30,000 could contribute $500
per year to a private savings plan, which would be matched by a
refundable tax credit of $1,500.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian To Show Famous Diamonds  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This fall, visitors to the National Museum of
Natural History will be able to see what are probably the two most
famous diamonds in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary Dresden Green Diamond is leaving its home in
Germany on loan, to go on display alongside the Smithsonian's Hope
Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-carat stone from the famed Green Vault museum will remain
at the Smithsonian until late January.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's rare, very rare, that you see two diamonds like this
together. In fact it's probably the one and only time it will
happen,'' said Museum Director Robert Fri.
</P>
<P>
   Fri said New York jeweler Ronald Winston arranged the visit of
the Dresden Green. ''It's something he has been interested in doing
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of an obvious playmate for the Hope,'' Fri said of
the two colored stones. Winston's father, Harry, donated the Hope
to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresden Green is slightly smaller than the blue, 45-carat
Hope. The two stones have brilliant color, became known in Europe
at about the same time, share somewhat similar histories and both
are believed to originate in India's Golconda Mines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the reason the Hope is so well known is that it's
large and blue. Green is even rarer than blue in diamonds and no
other green diamond in the world is larger or even close,'' said
Jeffrey Post, curator of the National Gem and Mineral Collection at
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   While boron included in the stone produces the Hope's blue
color, the green tone of the Dresden is the result of exposure to
natural radiation, Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he explained, it's possible to irradiate diamonds and
turn them green, ''so one of the reasons the Dresden Green is of
interest it's a well documented green diamond'' that got its color
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   First reports of the Dresden Green occur in London in 1726. It
was purchased by Friedrich Augustus II, Elector of Saxony and King
of Poland, in 1741.
</P>
<P>
   In 1742 Augustus had it mounted in a special badge of the Order
of the Golden Fleece, an organization founded in 1429 to encourage
virtue and faith among nobility.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later King Louis XV of France had a blue gem, believed
to be the same one now known as the Hope Diamond, set in his own
badge of the Order of the Golden Fleece.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, the Hope Diamond has been recut and
moved from owner to owner, developing a legend of bad luck along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the Dresden Green, essentially a one-owner stone that
survived war after war locked away in a castle for safekeeping, and
displayed in the Green Vault museum in times of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Only after World War II did it leave Saxony -- now a state in
southeastern Germany -- carted off by a Russian group called the
Soviet Trophies Commission.
</P>
<P>
   For many years Soviet authorities told the people of Dresden the
entire collection of gems had been lost, Post said. But in 1958,
when the Soviets were attempting to show good will to the East
German Communist government, the collection was suddenly found and
returned.
</P>
<P>
   While it hasn't developed the sinister reputation some attribute
to the Hope Diamond, the Dresden Green may not be all that lucky
either.
</P>
<P>
   A letter written by Frederick the Great, King of Prussia,
recalls an incident when Augustus was asked to supply heavy
artillery for a siege and refused due to the scarcity of money,
having spent a large sum to buy the green diamond.

<HEADLINE> FBI Testimony Barred in Waco Trial  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- A judge hearing the $675 million wrongful
death case against the government over the deadly 1993 Waco siege
has excluded testimony from three FBI negotiators who said tanks
should not have been used to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys, who considered the evidence important to
their case, said the ruling by U.S. District Judge Walter Smith
would force them to adjust their case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have to shift gears and bring other witnesses,'' said
attorney James Brannon after the trial opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will consider whether the government used excessive
force in the April 19, 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound.
Cult leader David Koresh and about 80 of his followers died, some
in the blaze that destroyed their compound, others in gunfire. The
government contends that cult members started the fire and that no
federal agents fired guns.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Smith agreed with government lawyers who say the
negotiators' testimony and communications fell under a privilege
that shields the federal government from liability even if its
agents' actions prove negligent. It is designed to give federal
officials the ability to act without fear of a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford, defending the government, said
the agents were making difficult decisions in a tense situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''How negotiations are discussed shouldn't be second-guessed by
the court system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether plaintiffs' attorneys can use a March
1993 memo warning that the FBI would face trouble if tanks were
used at the compound and children died. The memo by FBI profiler
Peter Smerick to on-scene commander Jeffery Jamar has been
described by Brannon as his best evidence from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Jamar ordered the use of tanks to insert tear gas into the
compound on April 19, 1993, to force out the Davidians. Fire broke
out about six hours into the operation, destroying the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Michael Caddell said the judge's ruling
won't preclude plaintiffs from asking Smith to allow some of the
testimony related to efforts to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Four federal law officers and six Davidians were killed when
agents tried to serve a search warrant on the compound at Mount
Carmel, outside Waco, on Feb. 28, 1993, because of suspected gun
violations. That began a 51-day siege that ended after the FBI
tear-gassed the wooden complex and it went up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Five Davidians were convicted in 1994 of voluntary manslaughter
in the agents' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   This lawsuit consolidates nine civil cases filed by survivors
and victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will act only as an advisory panel to the judge, who
will deliver the verdict. Separately, the judge will consider the
question of whether federal agents shot at Davidians during the
siege's fiery end.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' presentation Tuesday included testimony from
survivors, some of whom were children at the time. One recalled how
her bedroom was riddled with bullet holes after the initial raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was completely destroyed ... all my quilt coverings were
full of holes. If I had been sleeping, I would not be here today,''
said Natalie Nobrega, now 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jaunessa Wendel, who was 8 at the time of the raid, testified
that her mother, Jaydean, was fixing her hair in their room when
gunfire shattered the window, spraying glass into her brothers'
crib. Jaydean Wendel was killed.

<HEADLINE> Stonehenge Opens to Public  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONEHENGE, England (AP) -- Amid the beating of drums, the sound
of cheers -- and, in fine English fashion, the pouring rain --
thousands of revelers celebrated the summer solstice at the
prehistoric monument of Stonehenge on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1984, the organization that oversees
Stonehenge allowed observers to watch the sun rise on the year's
longest day at the ancient monument, 80 miles southwest of London.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was not forthcoming, but that didn't seem to bother the
6,000-strong crowd of druids, New Age followers and
curiosity-seekers. Samba drummers mixed with robed druids, and
thousands of revelers packed the center of the stone circle as dawn
came at 4:44 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''People came here to party, to celebrate,'' said Stephen Wilson
of the Council of British Druids. ''It's the first solstice of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been an astonishing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to previous years, there were no arrests or reports
of disturbances. Police praised the ''carnival-like'' atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Revelers were banned from holding solstice ceremonies at the
5,000-year-old site in 1985 after clashes with police.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, English Heritage allowed 100 people to gather within
the encircling rocks at dawn to celebrate the summer solstice as
part of a step toward admitting larger crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Stonehenge was opened to 150 druids who planned a
sunrise ceremony. But about two hundred people crashed the event,
clambered on the stones and clashed with police.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people were arrested, and others remained there in
defiance of police, prompting the cancellation of the druid
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The stones are the remnants of the last in a sequence of
circular monuments aligned along the rising of the sun at the
midsummer solstice -- the longest day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been intense debate over exactly what purpose
Stonehenge served and how it came to be built. Some experts believe
it is aligned with the sun simply because its builders came from a
sun-worshipping culture, while others believe the site was part of
a huge astronomical calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Others theorize that Stonehenge was a druid temple.
</P>
<P>
   English Heritage, which manages the site, said the success of
the event augured well.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Sign Gabe Northern  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Free-agent linebacker Gabe Northern has signed
a two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Pittsburgh
Tribune-Review reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Northern, who started 32 consecutive games at
outside linebacker for the Buffalo Bills, would compete for the job
left open when free agent Carlos Emmons signed with Philadelphia.
Joey Porter is also trying to replace Emmons.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said Northern's agent, Peter Schaffer, confirmed the
signing. Ron Wahl, a Steelers spokesman, did not immediately return
a message left for him Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bills and Steelers use four linebackers on defense
behind three linemen. Northern, 26, a four-year veteran from
Louisiana State, will be replaced in Buffalo by Keith Newman, a
fourth-round draft choice last year.
</P>
<P>
   The paper did not have the exact amount of Northern's contract,
but said he would count $500,000 against the Steelers' salary cap.

<HEADLINE> MLB Offers To Take Back 22 Umpires  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball, while still bickering with its
umpires, is offering to rehire some of the 22 who were fired last
September after their failed mass resignation.
</P>
<P>
   During about two dozen negotiating sessions over the past three
months, the new umpires union and owners have found themselves in
four areas of disagreement: pay; the fate of the 22 former umps;
that discipline be taken only with ''just cause;'' and management's
demand that umps get prior approval before talking with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made an effort to compromise and accommodate the 22 in
particular ways and have frankly not gotten a serious response,''
Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations in
the commissioner's office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, without specifying how many of the 22 could return,
said baseball had offered a combination of jobs and termination
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the talks said the new union, formed
after the umps dumped Richie Phillips' Major League Umpires
Association, was asked to share in the cost of dealing with the 22.
The group includes well-known umps such as Richie Garcia, Frank
Pulli and Terry Tata. The old union has filed a grievance trying to
regain jobs for the 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guys that have given 28, 25 years of their life to baseball
shouldn't be cut off from their medical, cut off from their
pension, cut off from their severance pay,'' said AL ump Joe
Brinkman, vice president of the new union. ''They shouldn't try to
crush them. We'd like to see them satisfy the 22 so they could go
home and hold their heads up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22 were let go last Sept. 2 after a failed mass resignation
plan by Phillips' MLUA, which was largely controlled by NL umps.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, umpires voted in a new union, the World
Umpires Association, which they said would be less contentious than
the Phillips-led group. The new union is negotiating a contract to
replace the agreement that expired Dec. 31, and both sides have
agreed there will be no strike or lockout through at least July 14.
No new talks currently are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Management is insisting that in any new deal, umpires agree that
they will never speak with reporters without approval. The only
exception would be that crew chiefs could explain controversial
decisions about 15 minutes after the final out of games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't talk about baseball, our personal life,
anything,'' Brinkman said. ''That's going a little far. We're still
in the United States, where we have freedom of speech. They want to
muzzle us completely. You have to be able to give your side of the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires said they would agree only if management and teams
promised never to criticize them. Negotiators for the
commissioner's office said they could agree on behalf of
management, but players couldn't be stopped from speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consistent with other sports, we don't want umpires engaging
in the same sort of mudslinging and petty criticism that sometimes
others in the game engage in,'' Alderson said. ''We don't think
it's good for the profession. We think it's demeaning to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires want raises that would give them average salaries about
25-30 percent above NBA officials. Umpires, who currently make
$95,000 to $282,500, including postseason bonuses, made about the
same as NBA officials when the previous contract began in 1995, but
their NBA counterparts have been given raises in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We work 58 percent more games than basketball does and we're
asking for 30 percent more in money,'' Brinkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball management counters that umps gets more pension money
than NBA referees, and they get up to five weeks' vacation. NBA
referees aren't eligible for vacation until after 10 seasons, a
baseball management lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires also want a ''just-cause'' clause involving discipline.
The expired agreement didn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't discipline just because you want to,'' Brinkman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners, tired of their many grievance losses with players, say
they won't agree to having arbitrators review cases, which could
lead to more litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had enough of that in recent years,'' Alderson said.
</P>
<P>
   While no talks are scheduled, both sides anticipate scheduling a
meeting before June 30. That's when either side can give two weeks'
notice of a strike or lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came in with a preconceived idea of everything they
wanted to do,'' Brinkman said, ''and there's been no listening to
umpires.''

<HEADLINE> Test: Baseballs Barely Legal  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseballs aren't juiced, just hyperactive.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the record number of homers flying out of parks,
balls from this year and the last two were tested by Jim Sherwood,
who runs the Baseball Research Center at the University of
Massachusetts' Lowell campus.
</P>
<P>
   And while he found the balls didn't exceed baseball's standards
for liveliness, they came close.
</P>
<P>
   ''The balls today are at the upper end of the spectrum,'' Sandy
Alderson, the commissioner's executive vice president of baseball
operations, said Tuesday after meeting with Sherwood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know where we are in the spectrum, but how does that relate
to five years ago, 10 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   When a baseball is fired at a wall made of 2&AMP;frac12;-inch thick,
northern white ash, it is required to rebound at 54.6 percent of
its original speed, plus or minus 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a ball must hold its shape within 0.08 of an inch
after being subjected to 65 pounds of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a range of specifications the ball has to fall
within,'' Alderson said. ''There is a consistency within that range
among the balls we've seen from the last three years. We're looking
to see if we can find balls to test from further back.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two problems in testing older balls, according to
Alderson: finding them and making sure they haven't changed since
they were made.
</P>
<P>
   Through Tuesday, there were 2,631 homers in 1,026 games this
season, an average of 2.56 per game, matching the average for
April. Last season's final average of 2.27 set a record, breaking
the previous mark of 2.19, set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many theories on why so many home runs are being
hit, including smaller ballparks in Houston and San Francisco, more
players lifting weights following Mark McGwire's record 70-homer
season in 1998, more weak pitchers due to expansions in 1993 and
1998, and juiced balls.

   Rawlings, which has supplied all major league balls since 1977,
checks to make sure each ball weighs 5-5&AMP;frac14; ounces and has a
circumference of 9-9&AMP;frac14; inches -- measurements specified in the
Official Baseball Rules.

   ''While the ball this year is the same it's been in recent

<HEADLINE> Less Estate Tax Repeal Sought  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stung by mass defections in the House, Senate
Democratic leaders and the Clinton administration are trying to
rally the party against a Republican bill repealing inheritance
taxes in favor of a less costly alternative aimed at farmers and
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers met Tuesday with Senate
Democrats to stiffen the resolve of wavering members and to outline
arguments against full repeal: eventual cost of $50 billion a year,
major benefits for the wealthiest Americans and ways the money
could be used better.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have an alternative,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., said after the meeting. ''We'll exempt small
businesses and farms, but we certainly have to draw a distinction
between the millionaires and billionaires in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments were made by President Clinton and House
Democratic leaders, but 65 of them jumped ship this month to help
Republicans win a 279-136 vote for repeal by 2010. It would take a
two-thirds vote to override a threatened veto -- 290 if all 435
members voted, or just over half the 20 who did not vote this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have seen estate tax repeal, long one of their top
tax priorities, surge in popularity this year amid a powerful
lobbying campaign by the National Federation of Independent
Business, the National Association of Manufacturers and several
farm groups that have stressed the impact of estate taxes on
middle-class people and businesses. These personal stories about
the ''death tax'' have overwhelmed the fact that only about 2
percent of people leave estates large enough to accrue the tax.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also is gaining steam in the presidential campaign.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP nominee, has
proposed repealing it as part of his larger tax-cut package, while
Vice President Al Gore favors the more targeted approach -- similar
to a 10-year, $22 billion plan pushed by House Democrats. Aides say
Gore plans to announce details Wednesday of a smaller plan that is
expected to cost $7 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic defections to the GOP repeal bill can be avoided in
the Senate ''with a credible alternative,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont. ''There are ways to provide relief from the estate tax
without total repeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although details are still being worked out, Baucus said the
emerging Democratic measure would focus on family farms and small
businesses, mainly by raising the amount of an estate that is
exempt from tax. Clinton has said he would sign a limited estate
tax cut but not total repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals this year have a $675,000 exemption; small
businesses and family farms can pass $1.3 million tax-exempt to
heirs. With minimal estate planning, a married couple can double
those amounts.
</P>
<P>
   This, Democrats say, would help the fraction of taxable estates
that are farms and small businesses without handing a huge tax cut
to the wealthy. Internal Revenue Service figures show that almost
half of the estimated $27 billion in estate taxes this year will be
paid by estates worth more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to deal with the legitimate concern of farmers and
small business people ... without giving a windfall to the
wealthiest people,'' said Al From, head of the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the House bill
would be brought to the Senate floor intact -- bypassing the
customary committees -- possibly as early as next week but maybe not
until July. Lott said he hopes to negotiate an agreement with
Democrats for a limited number of amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said House GOP leaders are unlikely to go along with
anything less than their bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the overwhelming vote we had in the House, I think we
will push for full repeal,'' said Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Hate-Crimes Measure  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House-backed measure to expand the
federal law on hate crimes could fall victim to election-year
politics, despite a victory in the Republican-led Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Its future was extremely clouded after Tuesday's high-profile
vote that brought Vice President Al Gore in from the presidential
campaign trail in case his tie-breaking vote was needed.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the Senate's 57-42 vote to add the hate-crimes
measure to a sprawling defense bill, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., had the Senate put aside the underlying defense
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it turned to a foreign aid measure that it will
continue to debate on Wednesday -- with no set time for when the
Senate might get back to debating the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the hate-crime measure in limbo, even though
Democrats vowed to try to keep it alive.
</P>
<P>
   The House has never passed such a measure, nor is support for it
seen as strong there.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore and Senate Democrats were able to claim an
important, but possibly largely symbolic, victory after 13
Republicans crossed party lines to vote with them on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although his vote wasn't needed, Gore was on hand for the vote
in the Senate. At a news conference afterward, he credited families
of victims of hate crimes for pushing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This vote is a sign of hope for all of America,'' Gore said.
The vice president had been campaigning in Kentucky when Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota told him his presence
might be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans suggested Gore's trip to the Capitol was political
grandstanding -- and that the vote was never in serious doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate had passed an identical bill the year before by voice
vote, but it died in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore disputed that his return to the Senate was politically
motivating, saying, ''It's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote further bogged down the defense bill, which has now
become a catchall for many pet pieces of legislation, mostly pushed
by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a campaign-finance proposal pushed by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., was added to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott suggested that, unless some way was devised to separate the
unrelated amendments, the entire defense bill might have to be
indefinitely put aside.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has insisted his top priority is getting needed spending
bills through Congress -- even if it means that other major pieces
of legislation must fall by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   In another vote on the defense bill on Tuesday, the Senate
rejected 59 to 41 a proposal to set up a commission to explore
closer ties with the government of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It also rejected, 50-49, a proposal to permit military women
serving overseas to have abortions in base hospitals, so long as
the procedures are paid for with private funds.
</P>
<P>
   The hate-crimes measure was sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., who said it would give ''the federal government a stronger
role in dealing with the festering problem of hate crimes that
continues to plague our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the measure was too broad --
and would amount to federalization of many crimes of violence,
including rape.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch offered his own version, calling for a study of whether
states and localities were pursuing hate crime prosecutions, and
providing $5 million a year for the Justice Department to help pay
for such prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate accepted Hatch's amendment, 50-49, then went on to
approve Kennedy's.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual
orientation, gender or disability to the list of hate crimes
already covered under a 1968 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It also would give federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a
hate-crime case if local authorities refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd,
a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck; and
the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old
homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being
beaten into a coma and tied to a fence.

<HEADLINE> Study: Chickenpox Preventable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A five-year study of a chickenpox vaccine
found that inoculations can reduce cases by 80 percent, suggesting
the itchy rite of childhood can be prevented just like the mumps
and measles.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing study by Los Angeles County health officials for the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was conducted in
the Antelope Valley, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Chickenpox cases in the region dropped from 2,934 in 1995, when
the vaccine was introduced, to 587 by 1999. The rates declined in
all age groups, but were most dramatic among children 1 through 4
years old.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of complications from the disease, such as bacterial
infections, also fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is ... the vaccine works,'' said Dr. Laurene
Mascola, a researcher and chief of the county's acute communicable
disease control branch. ''You can prevent chickenpox.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus often strikes children before the age of 10 and
sickens its victims for 10 days with itchy rashes, fevers and
fatigue. The highly contagious disease, which is often spread by
touch or airborne droplets, infects as many as 4 million people
each year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Antelope Valley, with about 300,000 residents, is one of
three areas chosen by the CDC for the study. The other two are in
west Philadelphia and Travis County, Texas. The California
vaccinations were voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the nation's first
chickenpox vaccine, Varivax, in 1995 and the CDC and the American
Academy of Pediatrics has recommended vaccinating children for the
ailment at 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   California, which has one of the highest chickenpox rates in the
country, will make chickenpox vaccinations mandatory next year for
children entering its schools or day-care facilities. Half the
states in the country have made chickenpox vaccinations mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine also displayed an economic and social value.
Chickenpox victims and their caretakers in the Antelope Valley
missed 14,842 days of work and school in 1995, which dropped 82
percent to 2,718 in 1999.

<HEADLINE> US Joint Forces Commander Nominated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- An Army general has been nominated to head
the U.S. Joint Forces Command, responsible for the joint service
training of 1.2 million American servicemen, The Virginian-Pilot
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. William Frank Kernan, 54, commanding general of Fort
Bragg, N.C., and the 18th Airborne Corps, was nominated last week
to replace retiring Adm. Harold W. Gehman, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   If selected, he would become only the second non-Navy man to
lead the post. The other was Marine Corps Gen. John Sheehan, who
preceded Gehman.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and Gehman's office declined to confirm the
nomination, but U.S. Sen. John Warner's office said it was notified
of the nomination on June 13 by the Defense Department. A hearing
on Kernan's candidacy is scheduled for June 27, Warner's office
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kernan served in Vietnam as a rifle platoon leader with the
101st Airborne Division, and in 1989, he parachuted into combat in
Panama as commander of the 75th Ranger Regiment. Later, he was
commander of the 101st Airborne Division.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Joint Forces Command, formerly known as the U.S.
Atlantic Command, was activated Dec. 1, 1947, as one of the
original unified commands established after World War II.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower at the start of
trading Wednesday, with the Nasdaq composite index sinking back
below 4,000, as investors took some profits from technology stocks
and remained worried about the effect that rising interest rates
will have on corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening minutes of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 2.12 at 10,433.04.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.87 at 1,471.08, and
the Nasdaq composite index was down 30.75 at 3,982.61.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq had given up the gains that on Tuesday propelled it
past 4,000 for the first time in more than two months. Oracle was
down $4.547 at $81.50. After the close of trading Tuesday, the
company announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that handily beat
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle shares have run up substantially in recent weeks,
prompting some investors to take profits Wednesday.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading Wednesday,
with the Nasdaq composite index sinking back below 4,000. Investors
took some profits from technology stocks and remained worried about
the effect that rising interest rates will have on corporate
profits.

   Still, the Dow Jones industrial average eked out a modest gain,
rising 15.91 to 10,451.07 in early trading on Wall Street.

<P>
   The Nasdaq had given up the gains that on Tuesday propelled it
past 4,000 for the first time in more than two months. Oracle led
the decline, tumbling $2.297 to $83.75.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of trading Tuesday, the company announced fiscal
fourth-quarter results that handily beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle shares have run up substantially in recent weeks,
prompting some investors to take profits Wednesday. Also, analysts
said some investors may have been disappointed in the relatively
slow growth of Oracle's core database business.

<P>
   Investors are scouring corporate earnings reports for any signs

   Rising interest rates have begun hurting profits at a wide range
of companies, and investors remain unsure of whether the Federal

<HEADLINE> Ag Dept. Told: Tighten Enforecement  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department needs to tighten
its enforcement of sanitation standards in meat and poultry plants
and require processors to do more testing for deadly microbes,
auditors said today.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's switch to a science-based inspection system four years
ago is improving meat safety, but the agency ''reduced its
oversight beyond what was prudent and necessary for the protection
of the consumer,'' according to report by the department's
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspection system requires companies to identify
potential hazards in slaughterhouses and processing plants and
implement controls for foodborne pathogens. Previously, companies
relied on USDA inspectors to find contaminated meat by poking and
sniffing it. The inspectors' job now is to ensure that the plants
are following their sanitation plans and to do some microbial
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plans are inadequate, however, the auditors said.
Although packers are required by the department to identify at
least one ''critical control point'' in their processing
procedures, some of the plans reviewed by the auditors did not list
a single one, which limits USDA scrutiny of the facility, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Critical control points can include anything from a steam
pasteurization unit that treats cattle carcasses in a
slaughterhouse to temperature controls in a processing plant. USDA
inspectors are required to monitor critical control points to make
sure they are working properly.
</P>
<P>
   The department ''also needs to assert itself more aggressively
in the plants' testing programs,'' the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   Plants are shipping products to consumers without testing for
specific pathogens like E. coli O157:H7 or Listeria monocytogenes
even after tests for generic versions of those bacteria are
positive, the report found. And plants aren't testing at all for
some major pathogens such as campylobacter, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the department required plants to reassess their
sanitation plans to control for listeria, a problem with hot dogs,
deli meats and other ready-to-eat products, but didn't require
plants to document the review, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials had no immediate comment this morning on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton announced that the department
would require processors to start testing for listeria. USDA
officials are considering tighter standards for E. coli, a problem
in ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors reviewed 15 of the 6,000 plants nationwide that the
department oversees.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Test Is Still On  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korean guarantees and warming relations
on the Korean peninsula do not undercut the need for a U.S.
national missile defense system, the Air Force chief of staff said
Wednesday as the Pentagon prepared for a critical $100 million test
of the system July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Ryan, at the same time, said that while military
leaders are concerned about the unknown cost of the system to
protect the 50 U.S. states against a limited nuclear missile
attack, he believes it will not affect already tight military
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all agree that a missile defense system, where feasible,
ought to be pursued. But ... it ought to be over and above current
needs,'' Ryan said at a defense writers group.
</P>
<P>
   He said North Korea is not the only nation that could have the
capacity in the next 20 years to launch a nuclear missile against
U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, North Korea's communist government pledged to
continue its moratorium on testing of long-range missiles and
proposed a joint meeting of North and South Korean Red Cross
organizations. The moves were a followup to a summit between the
two countries' top leaders during the weekend and to U.S. lifting
of some economic sanctions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan on Monday told reporters in another forum that he believes
missile defense ''can be affordable'' although there is no good
estimate of cost. He told the defense reporters Wednesday that
although the military hopes all cost will be ''over and above''
their planned budgets, there are no firm commitments that it will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, in a written statement Tuesday, left open the possibility
he would recommend going ahead with the system even if the July
test fails.
</P>
<P>
   The test of an interceptor missile system ''will be our most
demanding trial to date, he said. It will be the first to
incorporate a communications link from ground radar to the missile
interceptor in flight. That, Cohen said, would provide
''last-minute guidance on where to find the target in space.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's technology chief, acknowledged
Tuesday that the Pentagon's scientists and engineers are pushing
the envelope of technological know-how in trying to shoot down
long-range ballistic missiles in space -- a goal the United States
has pursued, off and on, for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly a high-risk overall program,'' Gansler said,
referring to the possibility of setbacks. ''And it's not a high
probability of being able to precisely get everything to work on
this flight'' in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said it wanted to score two missile intercepts
before continuing toward deployment. It managed one intercept last
October, but the most recent test, in January, missed its target.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a failure in July would preclude Cohen
recommending to President Clinton that he keep to the schedule for
deploying a limited missile defense by 2005, Gansler said, ''It
depends what type of failure it was.'' At any rate, he added, it
will be a decision for Clinton based on factors beyond the
technical aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is scheduled to decide this fall whether to give
the go-ahead for starting construction on a high-powered missile
defense radar on the Alaskan island of Shemya, has said he also
will consider such factors as cost, the global threat of missile
attacks on U.S. soil and the impact on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   If the July test goes as planned, a modified Minuteman II
missile will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., on July
7 and head west. Cued by high-speed computers at Colorado Springs,
Colo., a single interceptor rocket will be fired from Meck Island
in the Pacific in pursuit of the target. A 130-pound ''kill
vehicle'' will release from atop the interceptor rocket and
maneuver into the path of the target 144 miles above Earth,
colliding with the mock warhead at a speed of 12,000 miles an hour
and destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   The last such intercept attempt failed in January because the
mechanical ''eyes'' aboard the ''kill vehicle'' did not work right.
Because of the work needed to fix that problem, the following test
was delayed from April to July.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the concept of intercepting long-range missiles
outside the Earth's atmosphere is flawed because decoy launches
could fool the U.S. interceptor. The Pentagon acknowledged decoys
present a long-term challenge, but said the system can overcome the
crude decoys likely to be encountered in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to such critics, Gansler said a panel of
independent experts recently concluded in a classified report to
Cohen that the program is on track to achieving its goal, although
it may take longer than planned.

<HEADLINE> No Espionage Evidence at Los Alamos  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has found no evidence of espionage or
indications that missing computer disks containing nuclear secrets
ever left the Los Alamos weapons lab, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury has been convened to consider the case, he told a
Senate hearing. Investigators also have lifted fingerprints from
wrappings of the hard drives, which apparently disappeared in late
March and reappeared last week behind a copying machine at the New
Mexico facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI has now determined that these are the authentic disk
drives. ... So far there is no evidence of espionage, nor is there
evidence that the drives have ever left the Los Alamos X
Division,'' Richardson told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said ''the working theory'' is that the two drives,
which contain information on how to dismantle an array of nuclear
devices, disappeared ''at the tail end of March of this year'' but
that the time has yet to be pinpointed.
</P>
<P>
   The disks were discovered missing from the highly secured vault
on May 7 by members of a nuclear emergency response team, but the
disappearance was not reported to senior lab managers or the Energy
Department for 24 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not know everything, but we do know more about this case
this morning,'' Richardson said, appearing for the first time on
Capitol Hill to discuss the security flap that has prompted some
senators to call for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican members of the Armed Services Committee opened the
hearing with a blistering attack on Richardson, saying he had
broken promises made a year ago to assure that secrets are safe at
the nation's weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've lost all credibility,'' Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
chairman of the Intelligence Committee, told Richardson. He
reiterated his view that Richardson ought to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who chairs the Armed Services
Committee, said he would soon introduce legislation directing an
examination of whether the nuclear weapons programs, including the
labs, should be turned over to an independent agency or the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson acknowledged the seriousness of the disappearance of
the hard drives -- even if there was no espionage -- and offered a
list of actions he has taken over the past year to beef up security
at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In two years I've done more on security than has been done in
the last 20 years,'' said Richardson. Until the latest security
controversy, he had been held in high regard on Capitol Hill and
largely escaped direct criticism stemming from another alleged
security breach last year at the Los Alamos lab involving former
scientist Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, members of both parties showed little sympathy for
Richardson this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no tolerance for data of this kind to be missing,''
declared Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the
committee. He said lab scientists were ''worried about their own
skins'' and tried to cover up the loss for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing dozens of people and conducting a string of
polygraph tests, investigators were still uncertain when the two
drives disappeared. The last written record showed them to be in
the vault of the high-security ''X Division,'' where nuclear
designers work, at the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the FBI now puts the loss at the end of March.
Originally investigators were told by a Los Alamos scientist that
he saw the disks in the vault on April 7. Richardson also said that
the investigation is focusing on ''a handful of X Division
employees who have offered conflicting statements to
investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last actual inventory that gives us a degree of certainty
took place as part of the Y2K inventory,'' Rep. Porter Goss,
R-Fla., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an
interview Tuesday. ''That screams at me and says we've got a
procedure problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The lab's failure to require basic logout and login procedures
for the devices is among the issues troubling members of Congress.
Energy Department and lab officials have said no such tracking was
required under a relaxed policy instituted in the early 1990s for
material classified as ''secret'' -- as opposed to ''top secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he has changed the procedure and now requires
information such as the data on the hard drives to be encrypted,
and has required the vault to have guards when someone enters and a
formal logout and login procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of close tracking of the devices has confounded
investigators trying to determine when the devices first were
taken.
</P>
<P>
   All 26 individuals who had unescorted access to the vault have
been given polygraph tests, according to Richardson.

<HEADLINE> Billy Crudup: All Work, No Fame  </HEADLINE>
By MARK KENNEDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Believe it or not, Billy Crudup was very close
to becoming king of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old actor who gravitates toward low-budget, dark
films was on the short list for the goody-two-shoes role of Jack in
''Titanic,'' the highest-grossing movie of all time.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get it, of course. Director James Cameron handed the
part to the blond and cheery Leonardo DiCaprio. Probably that was a
good thing, says Crudup.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had done 'Titanic,' it would have made, probably,
$200,000 -- worldwide,'' he says, laughing. ''So I think my life
would have been very, very similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so the hero aboard the doomed ship: ''I would have said,
'Jim, this guy is too happy-go-lucky, man. I don't get it. Maybe,
out of a moment of confusion, he decides to drown a little girl on
the way to safety?'''
</P>
<P>
   He's only partly kidding, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup's more likely to play guys you'd rather not share a
lifeboat with: a killer in ''Sleepers,'' an arrogant sprinter in
''Without Limits,'' a heartless cad in ''Inventing the Abbotts''
and a haunted politician in ''Waking the Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   None of those movies have made much cash or elevated the
talented actor into DiCaprio-like stardom. But Crudup says he's in
no hurry for hype.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard for me to say I don't feel successful because there
aren't photographers outside my apartment wanting to get a picture
of me when I'm going to get a slice of pizza,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as people keep letting me do this, I'd be an idiot to
complain.''
</P>
<P>
   True to form, his latest role is a doozy: In ''Jesus' Son,''
Crudup plays a heroin-addicted, house-demolishing, directionless
moron. The character doesn't even have a name -- just an unprintable
expletive.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney movie, it ain't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, acting is hard for me,'' he says. ''What's rewarding
about acting is when I learn something and grow. So it's just as
hard for me doing a sweet little happy-go-lucky role as it is doing
a guy who's having a nervous breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Crudup was born in New York, reared in Florida and Texas, and
attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He then
studied acting at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Making his Broadway debut at age 27 in Tom Stoppard's
''Arcadia,'' Crudup won the Outer Circle Critics Award as
outstanding newcomer. Other stage work includes ''Bus Stop,''
''Three Sisters'' and ''Oedipus.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he first realized he was a big ham as a teen-ager.
During a class project, he recited a soliloquy from ''Hamlet'' with
such enthusiasm that his peers were left slack-jawed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was about this tall'' -- Crudup holds his hand about 4 feet
off the ground -- ''and it was really important for me to get girls
to think that I was cute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way that I did that was to say something funny in class. I
didn't care about being silly -- I was already considered silly by
virtue of being 4 feet tall.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, a short haircut has left his already lean features
almost gaunt: His chin is sharp enough to cut cheddar, his
cheekbones are so high they appear to be tucked under his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He is tight, taut and coiled, but for a guy with such a gloomy
resume, he's also funny and light. He's a character actor who
suspects he might be cursed with movie-star good looks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't trust my own instincts enough to just do something
that I don't create a character with,'' he says. ''Just say the
lines and try to be personable? Or try to be affable or work on
wielding charisma?
</P>
<P>
   ''I think probably the work that I would do in that would be
really cheesy movie acting. I would be mimicking something that I'd
seen before and I wouldn't be able to watch myself in that movie. I
would probably need to scrub 'til I got the first five or six
layers of skin off me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Alison Maclean, director of ''Jesus' Son,'' watching Crudup
work was inspiring: ''Billy talks a lot about looking for a certain
kind of transcendence as an actor and that, for me, means being
really willing to be out there, taking huge risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie that was supposed to put Crudup squarely on the
Hollywood map was ''Without Limits,'' the 1998 biopic of Steve
Prefontaine, the arrogant, mustachioed athlete who inspired a
generation of distance runners.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup so transformed himself into the brash part that director
Robert Towne even sliced in documentary footage of the real
Prefontaine at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the effort, though, audiences didn't exactly run to see
it -- par for the course for Crudup's movie career.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I've learned is that there's a vested interest in the
industry to create a certain kind of actor. They can sell more
movies, and it's hard not to think of yourself as a failure when
everybody says that everybody is going to see and appreciate it --
and they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, fans -- often runners -- continue to approach him for
tips on technique. He obliges: Tuck your rear under your hips to
free up your legs.
</P>
<P>
   When admirers come near, however, they often make a mistake --
not about him but about the pronunciation of his name. And fans
aren't the only ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dude, get this,'' he says, sighing heavily. ''The trailer for
'Waking the Dead' said, 'Starring Billy CRUD-up...' Are you kidding
me? Even the people who are releasing my movies don't know it? I
have worked so diligently to try to have people not butcher my name
probably since I was 2 and could speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is CRUDE-up! People are going to find a way to get it
right. I'm going to force it down their throats!'' he says with a
laugh, then wistfully adds: ''I'll do some big blockbuster -- then
they'll know!''

<HEADLINE> Dave Matthews Prepares for Tour  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A warm Virginia breeze blows through
the open doorway of the home where the Dave Matthews Band is
recording its next album. Rocking chairs gently sway on the front
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Matthews is inside fixing himself some coffee. He offers a
cup, explaining that he's still groggy after another late night in
the studio. His black T-shirt bears the deep wrinkles that are the
mark of someone with little time to fold laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews was days away from the start Monday (June 19) of the
band's biggest summer stadium tour, 52 dates over seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get really nervous about this time, terribly afraid that I'm
going to fail,'' he says. ''Once I'm onstage it's a great feeling,
but I'm an egomaniac so I don't want to disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   ''If 60,000 people tell me they loved a show, then one walks
past and says it sucked, that's the comment I'll hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite critical acclaim, coast-to-coast sold-out shows and
three hit studio albums -- the last, ''Before These Crowded
Streets,'' in 1998 -- this songwriter turned rock hero remains
notably humble. Perhaps that's because Matthews knows how lucky he
is.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the pop acts that dominate radio playlists, DMB
has risen to the status of a supergroup through years of touring,
developing a following in cities across the country long before its
major-label release on RCA in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And it's one of the few traditional bands that broke onto the
national scene in the early '90s to remain in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews offers a tour of the home, set on 130 acres and down
several dirt roads, over a creek and beside a pond where band
members sometimes swim.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Steve Lillywhite is in the studio, fiddling with the
song ''Gray Street,'' which Matthews says is the band's current
favorite of the songs to be included on their next release,
expected in November or December.
</P>
<P>
   Lava lamps decorate the studio, casting a multicolored, globular
glow onto the walls. Twinkling lights fill the fireplace, and a
mound of wax covers the floor where candles have been stacked to
create a mood during sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews says ''Gray Street,'' like the early versions of many
songs, has too many words.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to ramble on ambiguously for too long,'' he says in his
self-deprecatory way.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asks if it would be OK to go for a drive. It will be
easier to talk away from the distractions and tensions of the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the house awaits his dusty four-wheel-drive Subaru
station wagon that needs a tuneup. Cars clearly are not this rock
star's excess.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love nice cars, but this one works for me because I live way
down dirt roads. It's easier for me if I don't have to think about
what I'm driving.''
</P>
<P>
   During a drive through Charlottesville and the rolling
countryside, Matthews chats about the recording process, his love
for central Virginia, his dog, the tour, butterflies and everything
in between. Thoughts pour out in a rat-a-tat stream of words.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a tour, Matthews says, he typically yearns for
simpler days. He changes his gravelly voice to that of a spoiled
boy who doesn't want to go to school: ''I don't want to go! I want
to stay here with my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog?
</P>
<P>
   ''Mutt. She chose me. She came to my house one day and barked
until I let her in. Her name is Goda. That's 'a dog' spelled
backward. Clever, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews says he was pushing to finish the album before the
tour, but the band overruled him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bluer than our previous albums, a little more melancholy.
It's got a sadness to it. The sadness comes, I guess, from the
quiet times in the writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The handful of cuts played by Matthews indeed have a sad quality
-- at least the lyrics -- but the music remains manic, with dissonant
crescendos that come from the odd assemblage of instruments.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Bartender,'' a man speaks to a bartender as he would to
God. ''Digging a Ditch'' is about life being a preparation for
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theme is obvious -- you dig your ditch and then lie down in
it at the end. It's not morbid. The character in the song is
looking forward to it. It's a very sweet sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews says that after months of recording, the band is eager
to play for crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those nerves are still there.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say, 'This is your biggest tour yet! Isn't that great!'
I'm thinking, 'Hold on. It hasn't happened yet. It's not great yet.
Right now, it's still this massive obligation we have to meet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Long-time bandmates include Stefan Lessard on bass; LeRoi Moore
on saxophone, flute and clarinet; and Boyd Tinsley on violin. On
several occasions during this day's session, Matthews had
complimented drummer Carter Beauford.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm nervous, my good friend Carter puts a hand on my
shoulder and says, 'You'll be fine.' He gives me a backbone. He is
my backbone. I really look up to him for inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews also is excited about the launch of his new label,
According to Our -- ATO -- Records, which he hopes will promote
talented unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's dumb luck involved with success, and there are also
dummies involved in deciding who gets air play. It's the audiences
that make bands like Nirvana come out of the woodwork and blow the
lids off. Then the record companies spend the next 10 years trying
to reproduce what happened naturally, releasing watered-down
imitations of a feeling that can't be manufactured.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Matthews quickly changes topics as several butterflies
flutter into the path of his car. That launches a conversation
about the monarch butterfly, which some researchers fear is being
jeopardized by genetically engineered crops. Matthews makes an
impromptu appeal for the ''butterfly people'' to give him a call.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity provides odd benefits, such as being able to help
causes such as Planned Parenthood or the Rainforest Action Network,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, most people do not get the opportunity to
express their opinions on the rainforests or saving butterflies.
It's no sacrifice for me to contribute a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, born in South Africa, moved to Charlottesville -- home
to the University of Virginia -- in 1986 and worked as a bartender,
a job that introduced him to area musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a real simple life available and there are also
trappings of sophistication -- musicians, artists and authors. When
I think of how I came to be, I doubt I would even be playing music
other than in my room if I didn't live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews says that in recent years he sticks out in
Charlottesville, but nobody makes a big deal of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little obvious here, but people are mellow. Plus, nobody
knows I'm coming in my Subaru.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jim Carrey Can Relate to Character  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS J. ROWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''You probably have a whole number planned on me
right now,'' Jim Carrey says, suddenly self-conscious during an
interview. Then, adopting the voice of a writerly alter ego, he
offers his suspicions about how an article on him might come out:
</P>
<P>
   ''He seemed to talk about psychology a lot ... Maybe he was
worried. ... He's a Zelig-type person.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is: He DOES talk more than a little about psychology,
really doesn't seem all that worried about what might get into
print, and concedes himself that he's Zelig-like.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest movie, ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' the 38-year-old
actor shows some of the chameleon qualities of Woody Allen's famous
character, but they're two sides of the same man -- a Rhode Island
state trooper who suffers from split-personality disorder. After
years of being treated like a doormat by absolutely everyone and
making Barney Fife look like a standup guy, the trooper finally
snaps. Unless on medication, he's foul-mouthed, hard-drinking and
hot to trot.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey says he can relate all too well to the character and his
niceness-to-a-fault.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's familiar territory to me,'' he says. ''My father and
myself. This just runs in our family ... Me not so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was real aware of it growing up. My dad was just the
sweetest guy in the world, and would give you the shirt off his
back and then blister up in the sun -- that kind of a guy. But you
know, every once in a while I'd see him kind of lose it, because he
didn't express his stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey was that way, too: ''There have been moments when I lost
it. Sure, yeah. No one ever got hurt. The most I ever did was hit a
wall and hurt my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   He then contorts his face into a rictus of pain and holds his
hand like a damaged claw, adding tremulously: ''That felt good --
and it'll continue to feel good for the next five weeks! Probably
when the rheumatism sets in.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey says he no longer sublimates his rage like that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to tell people when I'm upset or when they're doing
something that's intrusive or whatever it is, and it just makes
things a lot easier, a lot more even.''
</P>
<P>
   How did he manage to break the pattern?
</P>
<P>
   ''Years of combing the self-help section,'' he says. ''I've
always been fascinated with psychology and why people are motivated
to act the way they do. That's why I'm an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's when Carrey begins to wonder how he's sounding as he
discusses that kind of ''between-the-lines stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly spins out of it, though, when asked about moving back
into comedy after two films that showed off his serious acting
chops, ''The Truman Show'' and ''Man on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he doesn't want to be predictable. ''It's about
throwing the hounds off the trail,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And it's about appealing to a lot of different people. ''I'm not
necessarily looking to drag the same audience to each movie. ... I
AM a Zelig type of person in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Man on the Moon,'' the biopic about comedian Andy Kaufman,
Carrey completely subsumed himself in the character -- to the point
that director Milos Forman said: ''I really can say that I never
worked with Jim Carrey. I worked with Andy, Tony (Kaufman's cheesy
lounge-lizard character), and Kaufman's other characters Latka,
Elvis and Foreign Man.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Carrey and the Farrelly brothers, who worked
together on 1994's ''Dumb and Dumber,'' agreed to reunite for ''Me,
Myself &AMP; Irene'' and Peter Farrelly recalls telling him:
</P>
<P>
   ''Listen, man. Why don't you look at this as a vacation? Just
have fun, and go home at night and be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Farrelly said Carrey didn't have to go through such
intense method acting for their movie, ''though he did fall in love
with Irene in this one.''
</P>
<P>
   (Carrey and co-star Renee Zellweger indeed are an item, but
despite what's been reported, Carrey says he hasn't gotten her a
ring.)
</P>
<P>
   Both Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the directing-writing team who
also made ''Kingpin'' and ''There's Something About Mary,'' are
glad to see Carrey back in a silly comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of ironic that he got a lot of attention for 'Man on
the Moon' and 'The Truman Show' but, truthfully, 50 people could
have done 'The Truman Show.' Nobody could have done this but Jim.
There's just nobody that could pull it off -- all of the physical
stuff,'' Peter says.
</P>
<P>
   And the brothers predict Carrey will continue to try throwing
the hounds off the scent by making unpredictable career choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he'll probably go back and forth from now on,'' Bobby
says. ''It'd be a shame if he didn't do comedy at all anymore. He's
just too good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a notable run as ''the white guy'' on the Fox sketch
comedy program ''In Living Color,'' the tall, lanky Carrey with his
Gumby-like body became a movie star in 1994 with ''Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective,'' then ''The Mask'' and ''Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   He broke through the $20-million-a-movie salary barrier, then
stumbled with ''The Cable Guy,'' a box-office disappointment that
critics excoriated.
</P>
<P>
   He won back-to-back best-actor Golden Globes for ''The Truman
Show'' and ''Man on the Moon'' but was snubbed by the Academy
Awards both times.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he's returning to a serious role in ''Phone Booth,'' a
thriller directed by Joel Schumacher about a man who picks up a
ringing phone and is told by a caller with a sniper rifle that
he'll be shot if he hangs up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a story about crucifixion and salvation -- basically what
we all have to go through if we really want to deal with our
mistakes,'' says Carrey. ''It will not be 'Fun Jim Carrey Guy.' I
will be the guy facing his own demise and his own
self-realization.''
</P>
<P>
   Come fall, his live action rendering of ''How the Grinch Stole
Christmas'' will hit theaters, and he says the trick to playing the
Dr. Seuss character was realizing the Grinch was hurt -- not a mean,
angry troll.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love exploring this stuff,'' he says, reverting to his
psychological ruminations. ''I love figuring out what a character's
made of, why he might be the way he is. It's fascinating stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to figure out why Carrey says he's conservative
with his investments and why he believes in hard work and saving.
</P>
<P>
   His financially strapped background is well-known: His father
lost his job when Jim was 13, and he, his parents and two of his
three older siblings took jobs as janitors and security guards at a
factory near his hometown of Jackson's Point, Ontario. Eventually,
they lived out of a van and a tent pitched on the lawn of his
sister's home.
</P>
<P>
   A ninth-grade dropout, Carrey started stumping the standup
circuit when he was 15, and despite it all, says warmly that most
of what he's achieved resulted from his parents' encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't call what I was doing 'stupid.' They'd say it was
creative and funny. ... I love my background.''
</P>
<P>
   And if life puts some boulders in your way, that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what life is: like Navy SEAL training.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything that's ''adversive'' makes you a better person, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Adversive? ''I just made a new word! Look at that!''

<HEADLINE> Story of Nation's 1st Serial Killer  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Ted Bundy, Jack the Ripper, Charles
Manson and Jeffrey Dahmer were deadly and efficient serial killers,
but no match for Herman Mudgett, who terrorized the country a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mudgett's story is told in a novel by five writers who have
collaborated on ''The Devil's Rood.'' Known as the U.S. Five, the
writers are Jacksonville University professor Bob Stanton and four
of his former students: Sandi Branum, Gary Izzo, Dedra Torelli and
Nina Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The book's title is a play on words -- a rood is a cross or
crucifix and the book's cover has the upside-down shadow of the
cross, which typically casts an anti-Christian image. Izzo calls
Mudgett the ''devil's rood,'' the embodiment of an antichrist and
in a sense the devil's rod or instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Mudgett, who had five distinct personalities, is believed to
have killed as many as 250 people, many of whom were visitors to
the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Some were boarders in his
''castle,'' which was constructed near the fair site.
</P>
<P>
   The castle contained a bizarre labyrinth of windowless rooms,
secret passageways, false floors, trapdoors and a vault. Most of
the rooms had gas vents, which were controlled from the killer's
bedroom. Many of the rooms were soundproof and could only be locked
from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The true-life horror tale is told in dramatic monologue, letters
-- many of them authentic -- and diary entries of spouses, employees
and victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seventy-five percent of it is true,'' said Izzo, who said the
team used news accounts and books about Mudgett's trial on charges
he killed a business associate in Philadelphia. He left bodies from
Fort Worth, Texas, to Indianapolis to Toronto. Mudgett, also known
as H.H. Holmes, was hanged May 7, 1896.
</P>
<P>
   The writers shaped the book using ''dramatic monologue.''
Reading the dramatic monologue form is much like listening to one
end of a telephone conversation because only the words of the
speaker are recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt this was a very powerful way of delivering a novel,''
Stanton said. ''What it does is force the reader to become
imaginatively involved.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the most friendly structure for readers, though. But
the authors are confident that readers can adapt after a few pages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reader has to figure out what the other person is
responding to,'' Izzo said. ''It makes the reader much more active,
much more involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five writers chronicled three main characters and
wrote about up to 10 characters each. The novel has 44 characters,
plus five personalities by Mudgett.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm attracted to people and events on the edge,'' said
Stanton, who has written books on writers Truman Capote and Gore
Vidal.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton chose Mudgett and the other characters were doled out to
his collaborators in a lottery fashion. The five writers got
together for weekly three-hour sessions over a period of three
years, reading and criticizing one another's work. Disagreements
were settled with a majority vote. The novel, published by Creative
Arts Book Co., went through eight edits.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he wrote as Mudgett, Stanton said he doesn't fully
understand him.
</P>
<P>
   ''How does he maintain his sanity and continue functioning
normally? There is this thing in him that allows him to go on, even
though he is destroying lives left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton and Izzo said Mudgett had no qualms about murder and
often killed for sexual satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the most beautiful sound on Earth is that of someone
faced with the unexpected end to her life, when she must make a
primal, uncivilized scream,'' Holmes, one of Mudgett's alter-egos,
says in a letter in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was an opportunist serial killer,'' Stanton said, ''He is
nonchalant. He really doesn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the horrors committed by Mudgett were overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were scenes we know that are extremely unpopular and
they were controversial even when they wrote them,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was the rape of Alice Pietzel, the daughter of his
dead business associate, on a train by Mudgett.
</P>
<P>
   ''He raped her on the very night she identified her father as
the dead person in the morgue,'' Stanton said. ''Obviously, he was
a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudgett's trial was covered extensively by The New York Times,
which called it the ''Trial of the Century.'' It was discovered
that he was married to three women at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo and Stanton don't know why Mudgett's story had slipped away
from the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a national story 100 years ago,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy was far worse than Ted Bundy. He killed between 100
and 250 people. No one really knows.''

<HEADLINE> Artist Drew Atrocities, Landscapes  </HEADLINE>
By LOUINN LOTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On one side of the exhibit are stark sketches
of Japanese war atrocities. On the other are exuberant paintings,
pastels and charcoal drawings of families and lush landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The dichotomy is not all that strange for the work usually
displayed inside the Museum of Tolerance/Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Los Angeles. What is striking is that the 144 pieces were done by
one artist -- 90-year-old Liu Kang, a man considered Singapore's
national treasure. It is his first exhibition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, I was showing how the Japanese had really lost
their humanity,'' Liu said in Chinese through an interpreter, as he
pointed with his cane at the ink sketches along the wall. ''The
main aim of my 'Chop Suey' series is for the older Japanese
generations to feel shame, and for the younger generations to know
what took place and for it never to be repeated again.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''Chop Suey'' series was created in 1946 after the Japanese
occupations of Malaya and Singapore in World War II. Liu named the
series after a popular Chinese dish prepared with a variety of
ingredients but no set recipe. The artist used the term to describe
the jumbled state of mind of the victims and the seemingly endless
combinations of tortures the Japanese used.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are sketches of what I personally have witnessed, what
I've seen and what I've heard, and the experiences of my friends,
neighbors and family,'' Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sketches show acts of torture, but also the everyday
indignities of life under occupation -- street scenes of soldiers
urinating in public or humiliating husbands in front of their
wives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lived near a military headquarters and could hear the
screams of the people. I could almost feel the torture when they
forced water down the prisoner's throat, and when his stomach was
fully bloated, they would jump up and down on it. Very noble places
like a church were defiled. The soldiers would do anything at their
convenience: rapes, killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would do it out of sheer spite.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese occupied Malaya, then Singapore in 1942, Liu
was running a coffee shop in Muar in Malaya. Because Liu helped a
youth group design antiwar slogans, he was called into a Japanese
military headquarters for interrogation. His ability to draw saved
him when he offered to do a portrait for the interrogator, proving
he was not a rebel, only a lowly artist. The day after he submitted
his work, he fled Muar to Singapore and after the Japanese
surrendered in World War II, he moved his family there.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said he hurriedly left 200 of his works behind as he fled
areas that became too dangerous. He never knew whether the pieces
were saved or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is still coming to grips with the excesses of the war
machine it unleashed on Asia in the earlier half of this century.
In 1992, the government finally admitted it had taken part in the
systematic sexual slavery of Asian women, who were repeatedly raped
by Japanese troops and euphemistically called ''comfort women.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu's sketches of the horrors during the war prompted Japanese
exchange students who viewed the exhibit to speak with him and
express remorse, he said. Through that, he felt he had achieved his
objective.
</P>
<P>
   ''The students approached me,'' Liu said. ''They were very moved
and felt regretful. I told them that I had succeeded in my purpose,
because if they felt shame, then I have truly fulfilled the
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Liu was reluctant to linger too long at the ''Chop Suey''
exhibit, which closes July 16. The energetic artist preferred to
talk about his body of work: paintings inspired by studies in Paris
and his encounters as a young man with the great works of Western
art, including Matisse, van Gogh, Gauguin and Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   His engagingly warm smile grew wider as he pointed to pieces of
which he was particularly fond, work done in the ''Nanyang'' or
South Seas School of Art style that he founded in the 1950s. In
Chinese, ''nan'' means south and ''yang'' means seas.
</P>
<P>
   The artist found rustic charm and breathtaking beauty in the
South Seas region, including the Pacific and South China seas, and
developed the style that concentrates on the traditions of the
region, the people and their way of life as subject matter in
vibrant, bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   Joy also permeates his work, especially evident in a series of
exuberant pastels featuring Liu's family in everyday activities,
including sleep. One pastel on paper is a 1950 self-portrait that
has a handsome young Liu standing shirtless in a pose.
</P>
<P>
   Liu offered some advice for young artists. He suggested they
practice the fundamentals, the basic techniques of painting or
drawing. He urged them to travel and to find new inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Become a person of noble, great character because that will
translate into your painting. Go into the daily life of people,
their happiness, their sufferings. Enrich yourself with a social
consciousness,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: W. Hodding Carter  </HEADLINE>
By JERRY HARKAVY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKPORT, Maine (AP) -- Marco Polo beckons. Kit Carson calls.
Stanley traipsing through the jungle in search of Livingstone seems
promising.
</P>
<P>
   So many adventures, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for a father of three preschoolers who left his
family for two successive summers while he retraced the voyage of
Leif Eriksson, the Viking explorer considered the first to sail to
the New World.
</P>
<P>
   W. Hodding Carter's account of an admittedly quixotic notion
that blossomed into a 1,900-mile journey in a 54-foot replica of a
square-rigged Viking cargo ship is detailed in ''A Viking Voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   Snorri, the opened-decked wooden vessel built at a Maine
boatyard, offered no protection from the elements to Carter and his
11-member crew, who came perilously close to crashing into icebergs
and being eaten by polar bears before arriving triumphant in
northern Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   But the 37-year-old writer, whose previous sailing experience
was highlighted by flipping his family's Sunfish under a barge
moored on the Mississippi, says he has no place among the current
crop of author-adventurers who push the envelope to showcase their
outdoors skills or macho derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he sees himself as Everyman, following in the footsteps
of the famous, whom he suspects are more like you and me than
history might have us believe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think of myself as the average guy who's decided that he's
just going to make that odd dream work,'' says Carter, who has no
shortage of odd dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, he and a friend traveled west on a rubber raft,
foot and horseback from St. Louis to the Pacific, a trip chronicled
in Carter's first book, ''Westward Whoa: In the Wake of Lewis and
Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on his resume: paddling a canoe along the route laid out by
Thoreau in Maine's North Woods, pursuing John Wilkes Booth by
minivan across northern Virginia and finishing second in the
Louisiana Oyster Eating Contest. (He ate 135 oysters in 15
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   His writing, in magazines as well as books, weaves history,
travel and adventure, all larded with self-effacing humor.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's earlier exploits seemed like baby stuff after his 87
days at sea as Leif the Lucky and the advance work that preceded
them. He lined up Lands' End, the Wisconsin mail-order clothier, as
sponsor, selected his crew and found a boat builder, Rob Stevens of
Phippsburg, who was so intrigued by the project that he became part
of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The initial voyage across the Davis Strait, the big stretch of
open water between Greenland and Baffin Island, ended when Snorri's
rudder assembly broke and the Canadian Coast Guard had to be
summoned to tow the boat back to Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was down and depressed about it, but I knew this was where
we had to fight back and learn from our mistakes,'' said Carter,
who made a commitment to come back better prepared the following
year. ''It's almost like I needed that failure to make things work
out right.''
</P>
<P>
   While preparing to resume the voyage, he went along with a
suggestion that he buy himself some Viking clothing that would give
him a better sense of what it was like to be sailing in Erikkson's
shoes 1,000 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The custom-made threads were costly, but worth every penny.
While other crew members wearing modern foul-weather gear shivered
in the cold, wet conditions, Carter was warm as toast surrounded by
30 pounds of wool and leather.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked like a big brown marshmallow,'' he recalled. ''I'm
dancing around like Viking Man. The heat is shooting up my arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The clothing was an eye-opener that helped change his
sensibility about the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe they weren't these tough, brutal, gruesome guys,'' he
said. ''Half of them were wimps like me. They just had the right
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite access to radio, e-mail and instant communication via
satellite, Carter also found himself developing a different mindset
about the passage of time and the need for patience.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how the crew's morale plummeted as Snorri was
becalmed for two weeks in northern Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made 100 miles in 12 days, and that was all by rowing,'' he
said. It was very humbling, and it put us very much on a par with
the Vikings.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of the hardships Carter endured equaled the pain of
being separated from his wife and children for so long. He decided
that on his next adventure, they will travel as a family.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Carter, his wife Lisa, 4-year-old twins Anabel and
Eliza, and Helen, 2&AMP;frac12;, are getting set to spend a year or so on a
deserted island, an undertaking loosely patterned on ''Swiss Family
Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Carter might set his sights on something more
ambitious. One particularly intriguing possibility: crossing the
Alps by elephant, more than 2,000 years after Hannibal did the
trick.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from ''A Viking Voyage'' by W. Hodding Carter:
</P>
<P>
   ''The Vikings did not make boats capable of withstanding direct
iceberg impact. Not even icebreakers are made to do that. Our
precious replica was about to be smashed to bits. I could just see
it. Upon impact, the crew would fly through the subarctic air,
crashing on the slippery iceberg. Whump. Desperately we'd claw at
its granitelike surface. Klllhhh. And then, even if we managed to
hang on, just as we thought we were safe, the frozen bastion of
fresh water would begin its slow, unyielding roll. Icebergs, we had
learned, are not static, despite their stately demeanor. They roll,
topple, or spontaneously break apart in resounding explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''As I prepared fresh pork and beans and we munched on fresh
apples, the guys debated whether we needed a bear watch. More out
of regard for our collective exhaustion than reality, Terry had
determined that our anchorage was secure enough to bypass anchor
watch. I, however, could not even believe we were debating the
issue of polar bear watch. Polar bears enjoy traveling great
distances in a day. They can climb over the side of a
three-foot-high boat faster and better than we could burp,
something we were all quite proficient at. And, lest anyone forget,
polar bears love meat.''

<HEADLINE> Ag Dept. Told: Tighten Enforcement  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department needs to tighten
its enforcement of sanitation standards in meat and poultry plants
and require processors to do more testing for deadly microbes,
auditors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's switch to a science-based inspection system four years
ago is improving meat safety, but the agency ''reduced its
oversight beyond what was prudent and necessary for the protection
of the consumer,'' according to a report by the department's
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said USDA's enforcement actions were
inconsistent and often ineffective in preventing repeat violations
of federal safety standards. Congress should give the department
authority to levy fines against plants, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspection system requires companies to identify
potential hazards in slaughterhouses and processing plants and
implement controls for foodborne pathogens. Previously, companies
relied on USDA inspectors to find contaminated meat by poking and
sniffing it. The inspectors' job now is to ensure that the plants
are following their sanitation plans and to do some microbial
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plans are inadequate, however, the auditors said.
Although packers are required by the department to identify at
least one ''critical control point'' in their processing
procedures, some of the plans reviewed by the auditors did not list
a single one, which limits USDA scrutiny of the facility, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Critical control points can include anything from a steam
pasteurization unit that treats cattle carcasses in a
slaughterhouse to temperature controls in a processing plant. USDA
inspectors are required to monitor critical control points to make
sure they are working properly.
</P>
<P>
   The department ''also needs to assert itself more aggressively
in the plants' testing programs,'' the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   Plants are shipping products to consumers without testing for
specific pathogens like E. coli O157:H7 or Listeria monocytogenes
even after tests for generic versions of those bacteria are
positive, the report found. And plants aren't testing at all for
some major pathogens such as campylobacter, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the department required plants to reassess their
sanitation plans to control for listeria, a problem with hot dogs,
deli meats and other ready-to-eat products, but didn't require
plants to document the review, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the audit, USDA officials said they
were reviewing their oversight and testing requirements and
considering ''a number of microbiological-based performance
standards'' that plants would be required to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton announced that the department
would require processors to start testing for listeria. USDA
officials are considering tighter standards for E. coli, a problem
in ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors reviewed 15 of the 6,000 plants nationwide that the
department oversees.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the industry disagreed that USDA's oversight
and testing requirements were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making a major change in how food is inspected. The
change is going in the right direction,'' said Jenny Scott, senior
director of food safety programs for the National Food Processors
Association. ''The industry has been given the responsibility to
produce a safe product and the agency has taken the responsibility
to ensure that they do so.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 10; Nasdaq Loses 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed Wednesday, with the
Nasdaq composite index struggling to stay above 4,000. Investors
took some profits from technology shares and remained worried about
the effect that rising interest rates will have on corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite was down
7.78 at 4,005.58.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.90 to 10,445.06 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.53 at 1,471.42.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq had lost some of the momentum that on Tuesday
propelled it past 4,000 for the first time in more than two months.
Oracle led the decline, tumbling $2.797 to $83.25.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of trading Tuesday, the company announced fiscal
fourth-quarter results that handily beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle shares have run up substantially in recent weeks,
prompting some investors to take profits Wednesday. Also, analysts
said some investors may have been disappointed in the relatively
slow growth of Oracle's core database business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lehman Brothers analyst Neil Herman said Oracle's
prospects are very strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company was more upbeat than we can remember over the last
seven years,'' Herman told clients. He rewarded Oracle by raising
his earnings estimates and reiterating his ''buy'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are scouring corporate earnings reports for any signs
of weakness and have proven themselves ready to punish any company
that misses analysts' estimates or shows any sign of slowing
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the list of those unfortunate companies that won't
achieve earnings projections has been small, they come at a bad
time,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates have begun hurting profits at a wide range
of companies, and investors remain unsure of whether the Federal
Reserve has finished boosting rates. The central bank will hold its
next meeting on rates June 27 and 28, and anticipation of that
meeting is keeping many investors on the sidelines, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the decision is announced, stocks should start rising
again, Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the Fed will not raise interest rates, but either
way, the news will be on the table, and thus out of the market's
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were trading actively after OPEC members informally
agreed Wednesday to boost daily crude oil production starting in
July. Analysts are waiting for the formal meeting later in the day
to see if the increase in output will be enough to drive prices
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil was up 18.8 cents at $83.438.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $4.188 to $79.125. In a surprise move, a federal
judge delayed implementing business restrictions against the
company and sent the antitrust case directly to the Supreme Court.
The judge's initial ruling called for Microsoft to implement
certain business restraints by Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 460.54 million shares
at midday, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.51 to 525.18.

<P>
   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas likens Tobey Maguire, his co-star in ''Wonder
Boys,'' to Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart. ''I'm going to enjoy
watching his career,'' Douglas says. Maguire, who was born on June
27, 1975, starred in a short-lived Fox sitcom ''Great Scott!'' in
1992. The following year, he made his feature film debut in ''This
Boy's Life,'' which starred his friend Leonardo DiCaprio. By 1997,
he was attracting serious attention with his performances in ''The
Ice Storm'' and ''Deconstructing Harry.'' His first starring role
was in the 1998 film ''Pleasantville.'' He was also one of the
stars of ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Carly Simon wrote most of the songs for her new album ''The
Bedroom Tapes'' (Arista) while undergoing chemotherapy for breast
cancer. ''I'm feeling so much as if music once again has come to my
rescue,'' said Simon, who was born on June 25, 1945. She says she
is now in good health. Simon doesn't have a favorite song on the
CD, though she enjoys moving to the beat of ''Big Dumb Guy'' and
likes ''Actress,'' which was inspired by hearing little girls
worrying about bad camera angles after an audition. ''I could
easily put myself in that place -- a little girl putting on
lipstick, imagining I was going to be a movie star one day. It
became my voice. Sometimes songs start with somebody else's voice
and become my voice,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Lola Glaudini  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. KENNEDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lola Glaudini always knew she wanted to be an
actress. But only recently did she realize that she doesn't want to
be a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   In Glaudini's new film ''Groove,'' now in limited release, she
plays Leyla, a seasoned Manhattan partygoer who moves to San
Francisco, where her first order of business is to check out the
rave scene. The film depicts one night at an underground rave. It's
a low-budget, independent film -- and that's just how she likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ''With 'Groove,' as opposed to other, bigger films, I was able
to have a collaborative relationship with a director, and I felt
like I really grew and learned a lot,'' said Glaudini, who played
Dolores Mayo for two seasons on ABC's ''NYPD Blue.'' ''It is much
more important to me to have these kinds of experiences than to
become a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini grew up studying ballet. After college, she moved to
Spain to learn flamenco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love dance, and I still take classes for exercise, and I'm
still involved in that part of my life, but not as a profession.
It's personal, as opposed to professional,'' she said during an
interview to promote ''Groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Her next film is ''Blow,'' starring Johnny Depp.
</P>
<P>
   1. What is a rave?
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini: A rave is a music-driven event that is about a
community convening and celebrating electronic music. It's a call
and response, a participatory event between the DJ and the dancers.
It is important to define a rave in a non-slanderous way because I
think rave has been co-opted by the mainstream media as a dirty
word that is synonymous with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drug use is certainly prevalent in the movie. Can a rave be
separated from drug use?
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini: I think there are people who take drugs and people who
don't take drugs, but I don't think a rave exists that is a
completely sober rave. But a nice thing about the film is that it
shows people who hide behind that happiness of drugs -- they get
stuck behind this need to always be having a good time. It shows an
important aspect of drug-taking, which is hiding and running away
from certain things.
</P>
<P>
   3. What do you think attracts people to raves?
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini: First and foremost, it is the underground aspect. From
my personal experience in the mid-'90s in New York, and also
abroad, I think a lot of it has to do with the utter acceptance of
whomever you may be, and that you can really sort of shed your day
skin and go someplace where no one really judges you by your shell.
And you can wear a puffy bunny suit if that's what you want to do.
And it doesn't matter. And I think there is one kind of common
thread, which is a love of the music.
</P>
<P>
   4. What kind of music do you like?
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini: Electronic music. Getting involved in this film was a
nice sort of exploration of a certain type of music that I like.
But I know that one reason electronic music and raves can never
become super-mainstream is that they happen over the course of six
to eight hours. There is no beginning, middle and end or blip or
sound bite that you can play on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   5. What do you do in your time off?
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini: I dance, I do yoga, I go to a lot of films. To me,
movies are the modern literature. I read a lot and I also spend a
lot of time traveling.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Sinead O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Singer Sinead O'Connor has a new full-length
album, and the songs on ''Faith and Courage'' (Atlantic Records)
reflect a newfound serenity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think age kind of mellows you,'' she said in an interview.
''I was 20 when my first record came out; 25 when everything hit
the fan. I'm 33 now, and having expressed a lot of stuff helped
mellow me. The fact I did a lot of screaming and shouting was quite
healthy and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now my reasons for writing songs are wanting to perhaps supply
some nurturing, soothing or healing through music -- provide little
droplets of faith and courage through music.''
</P>
<P>
   What ''hit the fan'' was the reaction to O'Connor's tearing up a
picture of Pope John Paul II on NBC's ''Saturday Night Live'' in
1992. Journalists still ask why she did it, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a symbol of tearing down of the church's secrets and
lies. In Ireland, it was coming out (that) there had been child
abuse within the church and it had been shut up. It wasn't an
attack on the man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her single ''No Man's Woman'' on the new CD sounds feminist. Is
she?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very much a feminist. Women can say that now without it
meaning they hate men. I adore men. I think there should also be a
men's movement which is not anti-women.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, O'Connor was ordained as a priest in the Latin
Tridentine Church, a splinter group of the Roman Catholic church.
On the day of the interview, she wore a navy dress, adorned with a
crucifix around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't want to dwell on her ordination because she didn't
do it for publicity. ''It was about reclaiming a place for women in
the church,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Are her days of controversy behind her? Probably not. Just as
her new album was being released, O'Connor was quoted in the
July/August issue of Curve, the largest-circulation lesbian
magazine in the United States, as saying she is a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   1. Is all your anger gone?
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor: I feel a lot less now. There's a huge difference
between 23 and 33. I was lucky enough to make records and direct my
anger in ways that were safe. I didn't have to resort to criminal
behavior. I have normal human anger as opposed to rage.
</P>
<P>
   2. Why did you dedicate your new CD to Rastafarians and to your
father?
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor: It's an acknowledgment of love for my father. And
Rastafari people have a huge sense of the presence of God in every
person. And they don't deny the magic of religion. I moved to
London when I was 17. I had an Irish manager who was a huge reggae
fan. I got into roots reggae, which talks about scriptures and
spirituality in the world. The song on the new album 'Daddy I'm
Fine' is reassurance for my father. I wasn't a happy girl and left
school at 16. There were eight of us. I was always the slippery one
he worried about.
</P>
<P>
   3. Why did you start wearing your almost-shaved-head hairdo?
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor: My manager suggested it. I was happy to do it. The
record company wanted me to look like a sex symbol. I wanted to be
taken seriously as a singer and musician and not just a sex symbol.
Now I set clippers high and do it myself. After a while, you get
used to it by the feel of it. It's handy for a woman in this
business to have an image. People look at my head; I don't have to
put on posh clothes and makeup. I did grow it a couple of years
ago. I got the idea to chop it off. I was almost sorry. But I feel
more me like this.
</P>
<P>
   4. Is your songwriting improving?
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor: Yes. Writing for the album before this, something
began to happen to my songwriting. I think it's probably to do with
age again, more direction, more clarity, not always writing about
me but pretending to be other people. I tend to write in first
person but they're not always about me. 'Jealous' on 'Faith and
Courage' is about a man friend whose ex-wife beat him up so badly
she put him in hospital. She found out he wanted to marry somebody
else, after she had dumped him years before.
</P>
<P>
   5. Will you tour?
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor: No. My daughter is 4 and too young. I'll do a couple
more videos. I may do the odd show here and there and some TV. My
son is 13 and he is taller than me. He's a big, strong character. I
love to see little old ladies with big sons. Walking in Dublin with
my daughter in the buggy and him with his arm around my shoulder is
the nicest feeling in the world.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Ray Price  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- He's been in country music for more than 50
years. But singer Ray Price, whose hits include ''Heartaches by the
Number'' and ''Spanish Eyes,'' shows no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to be in the business at least five or 10 more years,''
said Price, 74, who recently bought a new tour bus to transport
himself and his 10-piece band across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Price and his band do about 100 shows a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two or three years ago, we did 182,'' he said in an interview.
''Fans come to the shows, bless their hearts, they always come.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a new CD, ''Prisoner of Love'' (Justice Records),
which he hopes will attract an even wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a big opportunity for me,'' said Price, who hadn't
released an album since 1992. ''For someone my age, it's a real
blessing. If my career can boom again, I can't think of anything
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD includes ''Better Class of Losers,'' a song Price
believes was overlooked when he previously recorded it; ''Prisoner
of Love'' and ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' which most listeners would
consider pop; and ''Soft Rain,'' written by Price. The album ends
with ''What a Wonderful World,'' a song recorded and made famous by
Louis Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Billboard magazine lists 108 Ray Price singles that made it to
the best-selling country chart. But a half-dozen or so made it to
the best-selling pop chart, prompting some controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you got a pop hit, you sold a lot more records,'' Price
said. ''It was my style, really. I sang ballads, sort of laid-back.
I'm still a country boy. I don't pretend to be anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   His first crossover hit was ''Crazy Arms'' in 1956. He used a
drummer and bassist to create a 4/4 country shuffle rhythm that
became something of a trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was strictly country and it went pop. I never have figured
that one out yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One way his performances have changed over the years, he said,
is that he has learned to communicate with his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to rarely say anything when I was onstage, just sing,''
he said. ''Lately, I've become more relaxed and enjoy the audience
more, really. I kind of involve them in the show. I like it and it
surprises people that I have a personality.''
</P>
<P>
   At every performance, Price sings ''Crazy Arms,'' ''San Antonio
Rose,'' ''Heartaches by the Number,'' ''Release Me,'' ''Spanish
Eyes,'' ''Make the World Go Away,'' ''Night Life,'' ''For the Good
Times'' and ''I Won't Mention It Again.'' He sings them because
these are the songs his fans want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Depending on how the show goes, I may close with 'Danny Boy,'
a big hit for me in the pop field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he tours, Price hires local string players to increase his
band to 18 or 20 pieces. He began adding strings in the '60s, when
his singing was changing from honky-tonk to a smoother, pop-crooner
style. ''I liked strings, and I just think strings in the
background makes the music more accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Price was born on Jan. 21, 1926, in the small eastern Texas town
of Perryville. He joined the Marines at 17 and served in World War
II. When he returned home, he sang on a friend's demonstration
record. Western swing star Hank Thompson heard him and arranged a
contract with Bullet Records.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been in 1949, in the summertime, when I recorded
in Nashville,'' Price recalled. ''It didn't take too long. At that
time, you recorded four songs and you had three hours to do it,
good, bad or indifferent. They only put out one, 'Jealous Lies,'
written by a friend I'd played some dates with in Texas. It was out
in maybe a month.''
</P>
<P>
   After ''Jealous Lies,'' Price began working in Texas and writing
songs for Lefty Frizzell, who was a popular entertainer at the
time. ''That helped me get on Columbia Records, where I was about
30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's not touring, Price and his wife raise racehorses on a
ranch in eastern Texas. He has toured in Japan, Germany, France and
Canada, but only recently performed in New York City for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just never happened before,'' he explained. ''But I guess
I'm old enough now not to be leery any more. I just come on in and
do what I do and that's it.''

<HEADLINE> Youth Movement in Country Music  </HEADLINE>
By TOM GARDNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are some of the brightest stars in country music, ranging
from veterans LeAnn Rimes, Lila McCann and The Wilkinsons to
relative newcomer Jessica Andrews. Yet no one is older than 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's wonderful that the whole teen genre's actually
coming around right now. There are a lot of young artists out
there,'' said Rimes, 17, who cut her first record when she was 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''My suggestion for them -- even though they're young -- is,
'Don't let people push you around.' There are people in this
business who tell you (that) you're too young and you don't know
what you're doing. Put your opinion in there,'' she said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rimes is suing her father Wilbur Rimes and another former
co-manager, claiming they diverted $7 million from her earnings
into their own pockets. Her parents divorced two years ago in a
split so extensively publicized that Rimes no longer reads articles
about herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time that somebody wrote something bad about me, I
cried. It was about Tanya Tucker and them saying that I couldn't
stand her and all this bad stuff I never would say. Right after
that, I put up this wall that I was never, ever going to listen to
my press again, good or bad,'' Rimes said. ''Really, I don't care
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Wilkinson, 18, who sings with her father Steve and her
16-year-old brother Tyler, just finished her third Fan Fair in
Nashville, Tenn. She said she had never seen so many young people,
both on stage and off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is that predisposition against young people. I
think that is wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCann, also 18, believes being young isn't the big deal it once
was.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people might have been shellshocked at first, but now
they're getting used to it,'' she said. ''I've always been used to
being young in the business. I didn't know it any other way, so
it's pretty normal for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann, the only one in the group who isn't home-schooled,
combined high school -- including cheerleading -- with a career.
</P>
<P>
   She missed the prom when she was a sophomore, so McCann made
sure her concert schedule didn't conflict with her senior prom and
graduation in suburban Tacoma, Wash., this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Went last year. Went twice this year. Got it covered,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilkinsons now live in Nashville, but Amanda is returning to
Canada to graduate with her peers in Trenton, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   She said their second album, coming two years after the first,
is more musically complex and the lyrics are a little more grown
up, but not too much so.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's maturity steps that you take. It's not the right time,
I don't think, for us to be singing songs like 'Make Me Feel Like a
Woman,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''LeAnn broke a lot of ground, I think, for the younger
people,'' said 16-year-old Andrews. ''When I first started my
career, visiting radio and with my first single, they automatically
assumed I was the next LeAnn Rimes. Now they know we're so totally
different on style, our voices, our music, our stage presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rimes almost didn't record the megahit that launched her career.
When ''Blue'' composer Bill Mack heard her perform on a local radio
program, he recalled the song he had sent to Patsy Cline just
before she was killed in a plane crash in 1963. He dusted it off
and sent it to her.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rimes' father liked the powerful ballad, he believed
the words were too mature for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wilbur tossed it in the trash,'' Mack said. ''LeAnn took it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Gallimore was busy producing albums with country stars Tim
McGraw, Faith Hill and Jo Dee Messina and didn't need to take on
11-year-old Andrews. But friends persuaded him to make the two-hour
drive to her family's home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was overwhelmed,'' he said. ''I knew I had to be a part of
her music.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasey Walker was reluctant to represent McCann, but changed her
mind after hearing her sing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'N-o-o,' I'm not interested in managing a child,'''
she recalled. ''She walked up to the mike and opened her mouth to
sing and I swear, I thought I was witnessing the Streisand of
country music.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's meltdown from stardom at 13 into drugs and alcohol was
a factor in Rimes' decision to take a yearlong break from touring
and recording to rediscover herself, Rimes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They build you up to tear you down, and I think she was built
up so much, she just got into her own world and had to learn some
things. She's a normal person like everyone else. Everyone else can
make mistakes and they don't get condemned for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, now 41, just released her 30th album.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, who is based in Nashville, said her parents and the
people she travels with are the ones who help her cope with
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are certain ways you gotta handle stress. You gotta have
fun, too. I surround myself with goofy people. I take my career
very seriously, but you can't take it too seriously,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> American Superchef Faces Iron Chefs  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Iron Chefs are Japan's latest cult hit to
invade Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They are an unlikely group of international superstars: Chefs
who use their culinary skills and creative thinking to please an
eccentric lord who has nothing better to do than eat well and wear
clothes inspired by Liberace.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of their ''Iron Chef'' cook-offs, which are
shown in the United States on the Food Network, was felt the minute
they walked off the plane at Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as we landed, people recognized (Takeshi) Kaga as the
host of the show,'' producer Matsuo Toshihiko said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Kaga, who portrays the well-fed lord, is a stage actor who
starred as the first Tony in ''West Side Story'' and the first
Jesus in ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He made the trip to the Big Apple to watch his chefs face off
against American superchef Bobby Flay.
</P>
<P>
   The Iron Chefs compete against world-renowned challengers, with
each side preparing several courses within an hour. At the
beginning of each episode, Kaga unveils a secret ingredient --
ranging from ordinary asparagus to live eel -- that must be used in
all the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuji TV, which produces the ''Iron Chef'' show, also made a
conscious decision to treat it more like a sporting event than a
cooking tutorial. There are four judges, who assign numerical
ratings, and play-by-play announcers, who are dubbed into ''Kung
Fu'' movie-style English and end up sounding like Howard Cosell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iron Chef'' has been on the air in Japan for seven years. It
has been nominated twice for international Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   While the show is no longer in regular production in Japan, it
continues to build its American audience with episodes airing
weekly on the Food Network. It has become the network's second most
popular prime-time program. In Japan, the Iron Chefs now appear in
TV specials.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. cook-off, a Manhattan dance club was cleared out to
make room for the audience and for a giant disco ball that holds
the ingredient du jour.
</P>
<P>
   Kaga entered wearing many layers of colorful robes. Members of
his procession tossed yellow peppers along his path like rose
petals.
</P>
<P>
   For an interview before the show, Kaga wore black leather pants,
a black velvet jacket and a black shirt with ruffles -- an
understated ensemble compared with his usual velvet and
rhinestones, but enough to make him stand out in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''My clothes work well in New York City,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three chefs made the trip from Japan: Hiroyuki Sakai, who
specializes in French cuisine; Masahiko Kobe, the Italian chef; and
original master chef Rokusaburo Michiba.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Japanese chef Masaharu Morimoto, head chef at New
York's Nobu restaurant, who defended the Iron Chefs' reputation
against Flay, the chef-owner of Manhattan's Mesa Grill and Bolo.
</P>
<P>
   Flay's specialties are Southwestern and Mediterranean cooking,
and he doesn't use Asian ingredients in his restaurants' dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a possibility that I'll be using something I've never
cooked with. I'll just have to make it up as I go along,'' Flay
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the secret ingredient is chili peppers, maybe I'll lose,''
said Morimoto. ''But as long as it's not Mexican food or sushi, the
contest will be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Toshihiko chose Manhattan because of its reputation as
a leader in food -- and theater.
</P>
<P>
   ''The show is not too far from theater. Look at the costumes and
the dialogue. It's very dramatic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real acting comes when the chefs prepare a meal that Kaga
doesn't like.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to pretend to eat it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Chickenpox Preventable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first community-wide study of a
chickenpox vaccine confirms earlier conclusions that it can reduce
cases of the itchy rite of childhood by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing study by Los Angeles County health officials for
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was conducted
in the Antelope Valley, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Chickenpox cases in the region dropped from 2,934 in 1995, when
the vaccine was introduced, to 587 by 1999. The rates declined in
all age groups, but were most dramatic among children 1 through 4
years old.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of complications from the disease, such as bacterial
infections, also fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is ... the vaccine works,'' said Dr. Laurene
Mascola, chief of the county's acute communicable disease control
branch. ''You can prevent chickenpox.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus often strikes children under age 10 and sickens its
victims for 10 days with itchy rashes, fevers and fatigue. The
highly contagious disease, which is often spread by touch or
airborne droplets, infects as many as 4 million people each year in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Antelope Valley, with about 300,000 residents, is one of
three areas chosen by the CDC for the study. The others are in west
Philadelphia and Travis County, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The California study, focusing on a relatively isolated region
of about 300,000 residents, is the first in the country to assess
the impact by tracking every known case of chickenpox. The
vaccinations were voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said previously that the vaccine is 80 to 90 percent
effective.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine in 1995
and the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended
vaccinating children for the ailment at 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   California will make chickenpox vaccinations mandatory next year
for children entering its schools or day-care facilities. Half the
states have mandatory chickenpox vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine also displayed an economic and social value.
Chickenpox victims and their caretakers in the Antelope Valley
missed 14,842 days of work and school in 1995, which dropped 82
percent to 2,718 in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Census: 100,000 Missing Homes Left  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two weeks before a self-imposed deadline, the
Census Bureau has reached over 99 percent of the 42 million
households that failed to return a questionnaire, Census director
Kenneth Prewitt said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Census-takers have 100,000 of the 42 million homes left to track
down, said Prewitt, who had hoped to have the current operation
complete around July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good census,'' Prewitt said at a news conference at
the National Press Club. ''Every major operation has performed
better than expected. We've continually been on or ahead of
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau mailed forms out to 120 million homes in
March, and at least 78 million households were returned, Prewitt
said. That number could climb even higher in the next couple months
as the agency sorts through late, incoming responses.
</P>
<P>
   Census operations are far from over, though, he said. The Census
Bureau is conducting quality control checks of enumerators' work.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, enumerators began at-home visits for its
''Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation,'' a separate, random sample of
314,000 households around the country. Results from that operation
will be used to statistically adjust data from the real population
count, a process known as ''sampling,'' which Democrats support and
Republicans oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of sampling say it helps account for portions of the
population historically missed in the census, including the poor,
minorities, inner-city residents that tend to vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, it is up to states to decide whether to use sampled
or actual data as a basis for redrawing congressional and state
legislative district lines. Republicans, in general, fear that
sampling could skew political districts in Democrats' favor.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Helps CBS Morning Show  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The CBS summer hit ''Survivor'' has unexpectedly
helped rescue the network's struggling ''Early Show'' with Bryant
Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   Since ''Survivor'' debuted three weeks ago, ''The Early Show''
has brought the contestant voted off the tropical island on the
previous night's episode in for an interview Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, morning show viewership during the past three weeks
has been 13 percent higher than the previous three weeks, even
though the morning TV audience generally gets smaller as summer
approaches. On Thursdays, the increase has been 15 percent, Nielsen
Media Research said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are coming in the rest of the week because they
like what they see,'' said Steve Friedman, executive producer of
''The Early Show,'' ''and on a news show, that's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to make top-rated ''Today'' or second-place
''Good Morning America'' nervous, but it beats the alternative for
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The morning show, anchored by Gumbel and Jane Clayson, has been
searching for something -- anything -- to reach viewers since its
debut in November. For much of this year, it has scored lower
ratings than the show it replaced, despite CBS's big investment in
luring Gumbel and building a new studio.
</P>
<P>
   Now CBS can use a news show to promote a prime-time
entertainment show while taking advantage of a pop culture
phenomenon to promote the news show.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Early Show'' has also held a round-table discussion about
''Survivor'' on Wednesdays, even inviting an entomologist on the
day contestants ate wriggling bugs. This week, a former
''Gilligan's Island'' cast member joins in.
</P>
<P>
   And next month, ''The Early Show'' is sponsoring its own ''Big
Apple Survivor Contest,'' sending three teams out on a New York
City scavenger hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to capitalize on it,'' Friedman said. ''But
we're also trying to capitalize on it by having some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS News spokeswoman Sandra Genelius defended the heavy emphasis
on the entertainment series. CBS is eager to get people to sample
''The Early Show,'' she said, pointing out that all of the network
morning programs have a mixture of news, entertainment and
lifestyle features.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Early Show'' will try the same thing when another CBS
reality show, ''Big Brother,'' debuts next month. The show, which
follows a group of strangers trying to live together in a
California house, will be the focus of morning show segments
reviewing the previous night's activity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, news anchor Julie Chen of ''The Early Show'' will
be featured on ''Big Brother,'' interviewing contestants
immediately after they are voted out by their housemates.
</P>
<P>
   After an internal debate on the issue, CBS News President Andrew
Heyward determined Chen's role in the entertainment series was
''not incompatible'' with her news job, Genelius said.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Law Proclaimed in Nigeria  </HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Muslims in Nigeria's north cheered the
formal declaration of Islamic law Wednesday, despite an upsurge in
religious violence that has already killed thousands of people and
forced many of the region's minority Christians to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation made by Kano state Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso was
met with deafening chants of ''Allah Akbar,'' or ''God is great,''
from the crowd gathered in the state capital's main prayer grounds
to celebrate the announcement, according to residents and local
journalists contacted by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the fulfillment of our dreams,'' said Hassan Dambaba, a
school teacher in Kano city. ''Now we can practice our religion as
we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed soldiers and anti-riot police patrolled Kano city
Wednesday and guarded key intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Kano, the fourth and largest Nigerian state to adopt Islamic
law, or sharia, has a history of ethnic and religious clashes.
Despite government assurances, hundreds of Christians have been
fleeing the predominantly Muslim state since last week fearing more
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic courts created under the new legal system have the power
to try criminal cases involving Muslims and mete out punishments.
Sharia supporters have said the laws would only apply to Muslims,
but the change has angered and frightened many Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The new courts have already handed down sentences such as
floggings, and a convicted cow thief had his hand amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to implement Islamic law in the northern state of Kaduna
triggered bitter religious bloodletting in February and March that
killed up to 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is sharply divided along
ethnic and religious lines. Thousands have been killed since
President Olusegun Obasanjo took office last year, ending 15 years
of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Nigeria is predominantly Christian, and northern
Nigeria is overwhelmingly Muslim. Northerners dominate Nigeria's
military, and wielded immense power during army rule.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was declared a public holiday in Kano. But sharia does
not come into full effect until Nov. 26, the first day of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan, to give the government time to enact
the necessary laws and to train judges in the Islamic code.
</P>
<P>
   Others states also plan to follow suit. The northern state of
Jigawa announced Wednesday that it would introduce sharia in
August.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Uses Nazi Image To Criticize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- In an unusual outburst, ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl
used an image from the Nazi era Wednesday to attack a critic.
</P>
<P>
   Heide Simonis, a Social Democrat who governs Schleswig-Holstein
state, had urged Germans to boycott companies that contribute to
Kohl's fund-raising drive to pay off fines from his conservative
party's financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl compared Simonis' appeal to the Nazi regime's call for
Germans to boycott Jewish stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remembered how my mother took me as a child to stores, and
other people didn't shop there anymore because there was a sign
that said: 'A German does not buy here,''' Kohl said on ZDF public
television when asked about Simonis' move.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by the same network, Simonis called Kohl's
comparison ''obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonis had urged the boycott after Kohl announced in March that
he was asking supporters for money to help the Christian Democratic
party pay expected fines by parliament for illegal fund-raising.
Kohl's appeal has raised more than $3.9 million for the party he
once led.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats' scandal broke last year, when Kohl
admitted that he accepted $1 million in anonymous -- and therefore
illegal -- donations for his party while chancellor in the 1990s.
The admission prompted an ongoing parliamentary inquiry into
whether decisions were bought during Kohl's 16 years in power,
something he denies.
</P>
<P>
   Under German law, the Christian Democrats face a fine of three
times the amount illegally accepted by Kohl, or $2.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Congress Debates Estate Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stung by mass defections in the House, Senate
Democratic leaders and the Clinton administration are trying to
rally the party against a Republican bill repealing inheritance
taxes in favor of a less costly alternative aimed at farmers and
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers met Tuesday with Senate
Democrats to stiffen the resolve of wavering members and to outline
arguments against full repeal: eventual cost of $50 billion a year,
major benefits for the wealthiest Americans and ways the money
could be used better.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have an alternative,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., said after the meeting. ''We'll exempt small
businesses and farms, but we certainly have to draw a distinction
between the millionaires and billionaires in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments were made by President Clinton and House
Democratic leaders, but 65 of them jumped ship this month to help
Republicans win a 279-136 vote for repeal by 2010. It would take a
two-thirds vote to override a threatened veto -- 290 if all 435
members voted, or just over half the 20 who did not vote this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have seen estate tax repeal, long one of their top
tax priorities, surge in popularity this year amid a powerful
lobbying campaign by the National Federation of Independent
Business, the National Association of Manufacturers and several
farm groups that have stressed the impact of estate taxes on
middle-class people and businesses. These personal stories have
overwhelmed the fact that only about 2 percent of people leave
estates large enough to accrue the tax.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also is gaining steam in the presidential campaign.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP nominee, has
proposed repealing it as part of his larger tax-cut package, while
Vice President Al Gore favors the more targeted approach costing
only about $7 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, announced Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa, would
increase the exemption for family farms and small businesses to a
maximum of $5 million, up from $2.6 million, if certain
estate-planning steps are taken.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the repeal bill, Gore said, ''want to give away the
store to those who already own the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic defections to the GOP repeal bill can be avoided in
the Senate ''with a credible alternative,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont. ''There are ways to provide relief from the estate tax
without total repeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although details are still being worked out, Baucus said the
emerging Democratic measure would focus on family farms and small
businesses, mainly by raising the amount of an estate that is
exempt from tax. Clinton has said he would sign a limited estate
tax cut but not total repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals this year have a $675,000 exemption; small
businesses and family farms can pass $1.3 million tax-exempt to
heirs. With minimal estate planning, a married couple can double
those amounts.
</P>
<P>
   This, Democrats say, would help the fraction of taxable estates
that are farms and small businesses without handing a huge tax cut
to the wealthy. Internal Revenue Service figures show that almost
half of the estimated $27 billion in estate taxes this year will be
paid by estates worth more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to deal with the legitimate concern of farmers and
small business people ... without giving a windfall to the
wealthiest people,'' said Al From, head of the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the House bill
would be brought to the Senate floor intact -- bypassing the
customary committees -- possibly as early as next week but maybe not
until July. Lott said he hopes to negotiate an agreement with
Democrats for a limited number of amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said House GOP leaders are unlikely to go along with
anything less than their bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the overwhelming vote we had in the House, I think we
will push for full repeal,'' said Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>

   The bill is H.R. 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft helped propel the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Nasdaq composite higher today after a federal judge
delayed implementing business restrictions against the software
company.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite was up
19.44 at 4,032.80, building on the Tuesday gains that pushed the
index to its first close above 4,000 in more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 43.22 to 10,478.38 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 0.08 at 1,475.95.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $5.125 to $80.063. In a surprise move late
Tuesday afternoon, a federal judge said he would delay sanctions
against the company while it appeals the antitrust decision that
could force it to be broken in two. The judge's initial ruling
called for Microsoft to implement certain business restraints by
Sept. 5. Also, the judge sent the case directly to the Supreme
Court, which is close to completing its current term and may not
rule for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle fell $1.484 to $80.063. After the close of trading
Tuesday, the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that
handily beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle shares have run up substantially in recent weeks,
prompting some investors to take profits Wednesday. Also, analysts
said some investors may have been disappointed in the relatively
slow growth of Oracle's core database business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lehman Brothers analyst Neil Herman said Oracle's
prospects are very strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company was more upbeat than we can remember over the last
seven years,'' Herman told clients. He rewarded Oracle by raising
his earnings estimates and reiterating his ''buy'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are scouring corporate earnings reports for any signs
of weakness and have proven themselves ready to punish any company
that misses analysts' estimates or shows any sign of slowing
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the list of those unfortunate companies that won't
achieve earnings projections has been small, they come at a bad
time,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates have begun hurting profits at a wide range
of companies, and investors remain unsure of whether the Federal
Reserve has finished boosting rates. The central bank, which has
increased rates six times in the past year, will hold its next
meeting June 27-28, and anticipation of that meeting is keeping
many investors on the sidelines, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the decision is announced, stocks should start rising
again, Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the Fed will not raise interest rates, but either
way, the news will be on the table, and thus out of the market's
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were trading actively after OPEC members agreed to
boost daily crude oil production starting in July. Oil ministers
agreed to boost production by 708,000 barrels daily, or by 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices rose on the belief that the production increase will
be too little to dramatically influence prices. Oil companies
followed; Exxon Mobil was up 81.3 cents at $84.063.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 669.77 million shares
in the early afternoon, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>

grew up with and Seattle has nurtured, it has more than 80,000
artifacts, including Elvis Presley's black leather jacket, Janis
Joplin's floral bell-bottom pants and the Fender Stratocaster
Hendrix played at Woodstock, plus more than 100 films and 100 oral
histories.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also includes a Sound Lab where visitors can get a
lesson in playing guitar and other instruments, and experience via
virtual reality the sensation of performing on stage and hearing
the roar of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 47, left Microsoft in 1982 after being diagnosed with
cancer, which he later beat. Since then, he has bought a basketball
team, the Portland Trail Blazers, and a football team, the Seattle
Seahawks, and is contributing more than $100 million to build a
stadium for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   He also plays guitar in a rock band, Grown Men, which just
released its first CD. Allen -- listed by Forbes magazine as the
fourth-richest man in the world, with $28 billion -- created a rock
museum to share that musical experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you give the young people the keys to the kingdom of rock
and roll, just a feeling that they can make their own music, then
they'll find their own path through music,'' he told Newsweek in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product is a crumpled-looking red, blue, purple,
silver and copper-colored building with cables intended to
represent snapped guitar strings. It was likened to ''giant blobs
of Jell-O'' during its three-year construction.
</P>
<P>
   Allen had asked for something ''swoopy,'' Gehry said, recalling
their first 1996 meeting on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very descriptive term,'' said Gehry, architect of the
celebrated and riotously curvy Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.
''I loved it. The way he said it, you couldn't not like it. He was
so endearing ... grasping for a way to describe what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the lackluster first five years of Cleveland's Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, which had just over half a
million visitors last year and had to cut back on operations to
finish in the black, organizers of Seattle's museum are projecting
first-year attendance of 800,000 to 1 million. Admission is $20.
</P>
<P>
   The grand opening weekend's performances will offer everything
from soul to heavy metal and rap, with a lineup including such
artists as Alanis Morisette, James Brown, Bo Diddley, Paul Revere
and the Raiders, the Kingsmen, Metallica, Eminem, Patti Smith and
the Eurythmics.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria State Proclaims Islamic Law  </HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Muslims in Nigeria's north cheered the
formal declaration of Islamic law Wednesday, despite an upsurge in
religious violence that has already killed thousands of people and
forced many of the region's minority Christians to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation made by Kano state Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso was
met with deafening chants of ''Allah Akbar,'' or ''God is great,''
from the crowd gathered in the state capital's main prayer grounds
to celebrate the announcement, according to residents and local
journalists contacted by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the fulfillment of our dreams,'' said Hassan Dambaba, a
school teacher in Kano city. ''Now we can practice our religion as
we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed soldiers and anti-riot police patrolled Kano city
Wednesday and guarded key intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Kano, the fourth and largest Nigerian state to adopt Islamic
law, or sharia, has a history of ethnic and religious clashes.
Despite government assurances, hundreds of Christians have been
fleeing the predominantly Muslim state since last week fearing more
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic courts created under the new legal system have the power
to try criminal cases involving Muslims and mete out punishments.
Sharia supporters have said the laws would only apply to Muslims,
but the change has angered and frightened many Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The new courts have already handed down sentences such as
floggings, and a convicted cow thief had his hand amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to implement Islamic law in the northern state of Kaduna
triggered bitter religious bloodletting in February and March that
killed up to 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is sharply divided along
ethnic and religious lines. Thousands have been killed since
President Olusegun Obasanjo took office last year, ending 15 years
of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Nigeria is predominantly Christian, and northern
Nigeria is overwhelmingly Muslim. Northerners dominate Nigeria's
military, and wielded immense power during army rule.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was declared a public holiday in Kano. But sharia does
not come into full effect until Nov. 26, the first day of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan, to give the government time to enact
the necessary laws and to train judges in the Islamic code.
</P>
<P>
   Others states also plan to follow suit. The northern state of
Jigawa announced Wednesday that it would introduce sharia in
August.

<HEADLINE> New Dresden Synagogue Planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) -- Officials in Dresden laid the
cornerstone Wednesday for a new synagogue on the spot where the
city's synagogue stood before it was destroyed by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony in the eastern city came exactly 162 years after
the cornerstone was laid for the original synagogue. That structure
stood from 1840 until it was burned by the Nazis on Nov. 9, 1938 --
the night known as Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass,
when Hitler's followers destroyed hundreds of synagogues across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The modern, cube-like building -- the most expensive undertaking
to revive Jewish life in eastern Germany -- is set to open on the
anniversary of Kristallnacht in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   City and state governments are each paying $2.5 million toward
the $10.8 million synagogue, with another $2 million collected from
donations. The rest of the money is not yet secured, but officials
expressed confidence they would raise it.
</P>
<P>
   There are 300 members of Dresden's Jewish community. For a time
they were forced to use a building located in the city's Jewish
cemetery for services.

<HEADLINE> Russians Troops in Criminal Cases  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- More than 450 criminal cases involving Russian
troops in Chechnya have been opened since the military campaign
began last fall, the military prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has repeatedly dismissed accusations from Chechen
civilians, human rights groups, and many Western governments of
looting, rape and murder by federal troops in Chechnya. But human
rights activists said the criminal cases announced Wednesday were
too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Ushakov, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said
467 cases had been opened in all. Seventy-two officers and soldiers
have been prosecuted, and 145 more cases are under investigation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say what kind of punishment awaited those who have
been prosecuted, or say what crimes the servicemen were accused of.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented
four large massacres of civilians in Chechnya since September, when
the Russian forces rolled in. Two were in Grozny and two in the
village of Alkhan-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
   The government figures ''should be regarded with utmost
skepticism,'' Human Rights Watch researcher Malcolm Hawkes said. He
said the Russian government has shown no willingness to prosecute
anyone for the massacres, and appears to be trying to hide its lack
of resolve by reporting relatively minor criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be oversleeping, or going absent without leave,''
Hawkes said in a telephone interview Wednesday. Prosecutors
routinely report ''high numbers of prosecutions of criminal cases,
but each time we ask for details, the details are absent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the United Nations called on Russia to open an
inquiry by independent observers into the alleged massacres and
other war crimes. Russia has rejected what it calls international
interference, and prosecutors have previously said they found no
evidence to support some of the foreign human rights groups'
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government has permitted three human rights
observers from the European Union to be based in Chechnya beginning
this week.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Annan See End to Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak smiling
tightly by his side, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday
defended his meeting with a Hezbollah chieftain, the first ever
between a top international official and a leader of the Shiite
Muslim group.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's groundbreaking parley with Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah on Tuesday was yet another sign of how some longstanding
Middle East realities were abruptly rearranged by Israel's troop
pullout last month from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And so was Israel's decision to refrain from kicking up a fuss
about the meeting when Annan arrived in Jerusalem a day later.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Barak nor his foreign minister, David Levy, breathed a
word of public criticism about the secretary-general's discussions
with Nasrallah -- an encounter that would have been unthinkable
during the nearly two decades when Hezbollah's guerrillas fought to
drive Israeli troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   For all the show of public politeness, however, Israel radio
reported a sometimes tense atmosphere in Barak's closed-door talks
with Annan. It said the U.N. chief backed Lebanese claims that
Israel is in violation of some parts of the newly redrawn border
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah is now the de facto authority in the former occupied
zone -- as Annan matter-of-factly acknowledged at a joint news
conference with Barak. And that, he said, was good enough reason to
include the group in talks about south Lebanon's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hezbollah has been, and is, a player in the south of
Lebanon,'' Annan said as the Israeli leader looked on. The U.N.
chief added that Hezbollah fighters had exercised ''restraint,
responsibility and discipline after the (Israeli) withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said nothing about the meeting, but some in his government
expressed hopes it would encourage Hezbollah to continue enforcing
the uneasy calm that has prevailed in the south since Israel's
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my opinion the meeting...is to be welcomed,'' said dovish
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, meanwhile, took the opportunity to
underscore Israel's view that Syria -- now undergoing a leadership
transition in the wake of President Hafez Assad's death on June 10
-- bears the responsibility for keeping a tight lid on Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Annan should deliver any message to Bashar Assad,
son of the late president and his near-certain successor, Barak
spoke of past ''Syrian activities, terror activities with
proxies,'' in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio said Barak warned Annan that if an expanded U.N.
peacekeeping force does not soon deploy throughout the former
Israeli-occupied zone, ''hostile elements'' might take advantage of
the power vacuum and bring about bloodshed. As well as urging a
full U.N. deployment, Israel is eager to see Lebanese army troops
policing the south.
</P>
<P>
   Annan pointed to a decision by Lebanon's government, announced
last week, to send in 1,000 men. However, Lebanese officials say
the plainclothes security force will not deploy all the way to the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also told reporters he had received indications from
Hezbollah that it would continue to act with restraint -- even
though the group said publicly after the meeting that attacks
against Israel would resume if border disputes are not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council verified last week that the Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon has ended, but Lebanon says Israel
still occupies a few patches of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who is touring the Mideast to supervise the
implementation of the 1978 U.N. resolution demanding Israel's
pullout, predicted a speedy settlement of the border disputes, as
did Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to clarify (the issues) in the next 24 hours, I
hope, or maybe 36 hours, but basically we are determined to follow
on with the implementation,'' the Israeli leader said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a six-person team of Lebanese military mapmakers
finished resurveying the border in the company of U.N. officials, a
Lebanese army cartographer said. In their last inspection, the
Lebanese and U.N. officials went to Kfar Chouba and Majidiyeh, two
border villages on the foothills of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   The mapmakers registered 17 instances of Israeli encroachment on
Lebanese territory, according to the cartographer, who spoke on
condition he not be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   While largely quiet, south Lebanon still holds dangers. A
Lebanese man died in a land mine explosion near a former Israeli
outpost outside the port city of Sidon, Lebanese officials said --
the fourth Lebanese civilian killed by mines since Israel's May 24
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Gains 37; Dow Rises 52  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft helped propel the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Nasdaq composite higher today after a federal judge
delayed implementing business restrictions against the software
company.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite was up 36.94 at 4,050.30, building on the Tuesday
gains that pushed the index to its first close above 4,000 in more
than two months.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 52.32 to 10,487.48 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.02 at 1,475.97.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose $6.75 to $81.813. In a surprise move late Tuesday
afternoon, a federal judge said he would delay sanctions against
the company while it appeals the antitrust decision that could
force it to be broken in two. The judge's initial ruling called for
Microsoft to implement certain business restraints by Sept. 5.
Also, the judge sent the case directly to the Supreme Court, which
is close to completing its current term and may not rule for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector was mixed. Handspring, a maker of
handheld electronic organizers, made a solid if unremarkable debut
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares were priced at $20 and rose to
$26.75.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle fell 92.2 cents to $85.125. After the close of trading
Tuesday, the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that
handily beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle shares have run up substantially in recent weeks,
prompting some investors to take profits Wednesday. Also, analysts
said some investors may have been disappointed in the relatively
slow growth of Oracle's core database business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lehman Brothers analyst Neil Herman said Oracle's
prospects are very strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company was more upbeat than we can remember over the last
seven years,'' Herman told clients. He rewarded Oracle by raising
his earnings estimates and reiterating his ''buy'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are scouring corporate earnings reports for any signs
of weakness and have proven themselves ready to punish any company
that misses analysts' estimates or shows any sign of slowing
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the list of those unfortunate companies that won't
achieve earnings projections has been small, they come at a bad
time,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates have begun hurting profits at a wide range
of companies, and investors remain unsure of whether the Federal
Reserve has finished boosting rates. The central bank, which has
increased rates six times in the past year, will hold its next
meeting June 27-28, and anticipation of that meeting is keeping
many investors on the sidelines, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the decision is announced, stocks should start rising
again, Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the Fed will not raise interest rates, but either
way, the news will be on the table, and thus out of the market's
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were trading actively after OPEC members agreed to
boost daily crude oil production starting in July. Oil ministers
agreed to boost production by 708,000 barrels daily, or by 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices rose on the belief that the production increase will
be too little to dramatically influence prices. Oil companies
followed; Exxon Mobil was up 93.75 cents at $84.188.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 791.88 million shares
in the late afternoon, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.04 to 527.73.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: No Milosevic Deal  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, now indicted in connection with bloodletting in Kosovo,
might face additional charges for his role in previous Balkan wars,
the chief prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes tribunal said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, also announced that Milosevic's
archenemies in Kosovo -- the former commanders of the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought Milosevic's forces
until a year ago -- are being investigated on suspicion of war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is already indicted by the tribunal for his alleged
role in atrocities during the Serb crackdown on Kosovo Albanians
that ended a year ago. Del Ponte's denial that the tribunal might
drop the indictment was a response to news reports that the United
States is considering offering Milosevic safety guarantees in
exchange for him stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   ''My investigators will continue their forensic work in Kosovo
to gather additional evidence concerning the existing indictment of
Slobodan Milosevic,'' Del Ponte told reporters. ''We have no
intention to withdraw this indictment.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what kind of international pressure could be
brought on the court, which answers to the United Nations, but Del
Ponte's comments were an indication that the court itself was not
aware of any kind of deal for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication in any case that Milosevic is
contemplating a deal that would see him step down in exchange for
safety guarantees. While facing international isolation, he has
managed to consolidate his rule by outmaneuvering a split political
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In her comments Wednesday, Del Ponte said the tribunal is
''investigating the criminal responsibility of Milosevic for (wars
in) Bosnia and Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic fomented Serb rebellions, first in Croatia and then in
Bosnia, in response to decisions by the non-Serb majorities in
those two republics to secede from Yugoslavia. Hundreds of
thousands of people died in those two wars.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments on the Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile, appeared
calculated at least in part to dispel Serb criticism that the war
crimes tribunal is biased against Serbs. Serbs have accounted for
the majority of those indicted as a result of the Croatian, Bosnian
and Kosovo wars, and no ethnic Albanian has been publicly indicted
for the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are investigating KLA activity during the conflict,'' Del
Ponte said. ''Our mandate is always to look at the highest
responsibility in the chain of command, and that is also the case
for the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia has barred tribunal officials from entry since the end of
the Kosovo bloodshed. Del Ponte urged Serb officials to allow them
in so they can interview Serb victims and witnesses of atrocities
in Kosovo who later fled the province.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations in New York, Yugoslavia denounced a report
on Kosovo by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, accusing him of
anti-Serb bias and of failing to condemn attacks on Serbs in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the June 6 report, Annan said revenge attacks by Kosovo
Albanians against the province's Serb minority appeared to be an
''orchestrated campaign'' of violence.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslav envoy Vladislav Jovanovic said in a letter
circulated Wednesday that Annan's report ''obfuscates the true
situation in Kosovo.'' He said the report emphasizes the security
for the Albanian population ''and the lack of it for the Serbian
population is marginalized.''

<HEADLINE> Seals Die in Caspian Sea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- Thousands of seals have been found dead
along Kazakstan's Caspian Sea coast -- deaths officials blame on
unusually warm weather but environmental experts say are linked to
oil pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have collected and destroyed the bodies of 11,000 seals,
said Galina Yeroshenkova of Kazakstan's Emergency Situations
Agency. She said Wednesday that the deaths have come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Bekbulat Yeleushev, a department head in Kazakstan's
Environmental Ministry, said, ''The disease developed as a result
of a very warm winter, for which the seals were not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But Makhambet Khakimov, head of the non-governmental group
Caspian Nature, said deaths are continuing. Researchers from his
organization were finding more dead seals, as well as sturgeon,
along the shore, Khakimov said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Astrakhan Fishing Institute has concluded the seals
were killed by an infectious disease that hit the animals after
their immune systems were weakened by oil-related pollutants in the
sea.

<HEADLINE> McCain Speaks on Social Security  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush are ignoring Social
Security's real long-term problems in favor of negative attacks on
their competing plans to set up new retirement savings options,
Sen. John McCain said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., said the presidential candidates' focus on
tearing down each other's proposals leaves no room for a serious
debate on how to keep the current system from going broke as the
baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe that wins or loses elections,'' said McCain, who sought
the GOP nomination this year as a champion of government reform.
''But it doesn't bode well for a bipartisan approach and solution
to the Social Security problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless something is done, Social Security benefits will exceed
payroll taxes collected beginning in 2015 and the program's cash
reserves will be exhausted by 2037. McCain and Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., are pushing legislation that would create a
13-member commission made up of members of Congress to recommend
how to fix the system.
</P>
<P>
   ''A majority of non-retired Americans do not believe they will
get Social Security,'' Moynihan said. ''It's something we really
have to worry about -- and we're trying to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators led by McCain and Moynihan
appeared Wednesday before reporters with Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J.,
and Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, to announce introduction of a House
version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House and Senate have reacted coolly
to the idea and have all but abandoned any effort to tackle Social
Security until after this year's election. McCain said if Bush, the
Texas governor, and Vice President Gore would endorse the
commission idea it might gain more momentum, but neither has done
so.
</P>
<P>
   Although both parties use Social Security as a wedge political
issue, proponents of the commission said they would keep at it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm optimistic that we'll find some open doors,'' Saxton said.

trio of teen-age brothers promoting their new album, ''This Time
Around.''
</P>
<P>
   Some arrived as early as 6 a.m. for the Tuesday afternoon
concert, hoping to be among the first 107 in line to get a
wristband allowing them to meet the band.
</P>
<P>
   ''We waited seven hours,'' said Renee Oehlerking, 14, of Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson -- Isaac, 19, Taylor, 17, and Zac, 14 -- became a hit in
1997 with their first album, ''Middle of Nowhere,'' which included
the pop song ''MMMbop.''

<HEADLINE> Mouse Brain Now Self Repairing  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have managed to make new neurons grow in an area of
the brain once thought to lack the ability to regenerate, raising
hopes of developing new ways of treating neurological diseases and
head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers induced the creation of the neurons in the
neocortex of lab mice by triggering stem cells, or precursor cells,
that already exist in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Other research has shown that under specific conditions,
transplanted stem cells can form new neurons. The new study
indicates that transplantation may not be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a combination of molecular signals can accomplish the
same thing, said Dr. Jeffrey Macklis, a neuroscience professor at
Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital who led the study.
It was published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were encouraged to find that the new cells
showed evidence that they were incorporated into the brain
circuitry. The cells migrated to areas populated by the dead
neurons and sprouted axons, or connections, into the proper tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Macklis and fellow researchers Sanjay Magavi and Blair Leavitt
triggered the new growth by killing specific neurons -- a procedure
that the scientists do not envision as part of any future
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Future experiments will focus on understanding exactly what
triggers the creations of neurons and developing drugs or molecular
manipulations that do not involve killing cells to create new ones,
Macklis said.
</P>
<P>
   Any new treatments for neurological disorders like Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's disease or nervous system injuries are many years
and experiments away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to keep in mind that you can do things in the
brain of a mouse that you can't necessarily do in people,'' said
Bruce Dobkin, director of the neurologic rehabilitation and
research program at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that a connection sprouted does not mean it
functions like the neuron it replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little bit like you're wiring a switch on your door to
the bell in the hallway,'' Dobkin said. ''You can do some things to
know that there seems to be a connection there, but you still
haven't pressed the button and seen the bell go off.''

<HEADLINE> Potential Tuberculosis Drug Found  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental drug shows promise in fighting tuberculosis at a
time when TB is becoming increasingly resistant to existing
antibiotics, especially in poor countries, researchers said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If tests are successful and the compound, PA-824, is approved,
it will be the first new TB-specific drug on the market in 30
years, said C. Kendall Stover, a scientist at PathoGenesis Corp.,
where it was developed.
</P>
<P>
   Stover said it kills all of the drug-resistant forms of TB that
have been tested to date, including the strains resistant to more
than one drug.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on mice and guinea pigs indicate PA-824 is at least as
potent as today's first-line anti-tuberculosis drug, isoniazid, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It also hits different molecular targets, affecting the
bacteria's fatty cell wall and shutting down protein synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This drug is sort of a Trojan horse,'' Stover said. ''The
bacteria actually activates it and turns it into something that
hits these targets and kills the bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were published in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis can be contracted by inhaling droplets from an
infected person's sneeze or cough.
</P>
<P>
   TB, a major killer in the 19th and early 20th centuries, was
once thought to be on the verge of eradication with the advent of
powerful antibiotics in the 1940s. But it re-emerged in the 1980s
in the aftermath of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it kills an estimated 2 million people a year. If treated
correctly over a course of six months or more, most cases are
curable. But if the patient stops treatment, the bacteria can grow
resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Reichman, executive director of the New Jersey Medical
School National Tuberculosis Center, said the new drug has the
potential to kill TB even before symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   If PathoGenesis decides to pursue the research, PA-824 could be
ready for tests on people in two years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Blasts Zimbabwe Election Move  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Zimbabwe's move to ban foreign diplomats from
observing this weekend's election was an ''outrageous step,'' a
State Department spokesman said Wednesday. The United States will
continue to press for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deplore the decision to refuse accreditation to the U.S.
election-observer delegation,'' said State Department spokesman
Phil Reeker, adding that the delegation included members of the
private International Republican Institute and National Democratic
Institute as well as U.S. Embassy employees in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker was reacting to a government announcement Tuesday that no
members of non-governmental organizations or diplomats based in
Zimbabwe would be accredited as observers in Saturday and Sunday's
violence-tainted parliamentary vote -- meaning they could not enter
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is truly a sort of outrageous step against the standard
practice,'' he said. ''It makes absolutely no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said Zimbabwe's restrictions on election observers ''will
detract from the credibility of the elections'' and that is going
to ''further tarnish Zimbabwe's reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   With the hotly contested elections only four days away,
Zimbabwe's High Court Tuesday rejected an appeal that would have
allowed the electoral commission to accredit some international
observers.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 international observers have been accredited. But
non-governmental organizations have been denied, and Reeker said
employees already working in the U.S. embassy and other embassies
were also being denied approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly flies in the face of standard diplomatic
practice,'' he said, adding that the department had been ''in touch
at the highest available levels'' of the Zimbabwe government to
''urge them to reconsider their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe's ruling party, which is facing its
biggest electoral challenge after 20 years in power, has been
highly critical of what it calls outside interference in the
country's affairs. The opposition says that international observers
are needed to help determine whether the elections are fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government of Zimbabwe and the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union Patriotic Front is primarily responsible for these
deeply troubling developments and the election climate which we see
now in Zimbabwe,'' Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still hope very much that the people of Zimbabwe will be
able to express their views this weekend in the elections, and that
the voting process will be free of manipulation and intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 31 people, mostly opposition supporters, have died in
political violence since February, when ruling party militants and
war veterans began illegally occupying more than 1,400 white-owned
farms.
</P>
<P>
   The two other U.S. groups that Reeker referred to are private
organizations. The International Republican Institute said Tuesday
it had canceled plans to monitor the elections after being stalled
repeatedly on accreditation. The National Democratic Institute
wasn't sending another delegation but already has representatives
on site in Zimbabwe and they were being denied accreditation as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union also said Zimbabwe's government had refused
to accredit 17 EU-sponsored African election observers.

<HEADLINE> ATF Report Cites Corrupt Gun Dealers  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Large numbers of firearms are illegally
distributed by corrupt gun dealers and at gun shows, according to a
government report that also found that a quarter of traffickers are
convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration quickly seized upon Wednesday's
report by the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms to bolster its case for stricter gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Rifle Association said the administration
should focus on enforcing gun-control laws already on the books.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent that felons are buying guns, they ought to be
arrested and put in jail,'' said James Baker, the NRA's chief
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Although corrupt licensed gun dealers were involved in fewer
than 10 percent of ATF's investigations, they were associated with
the largest total number of diverted guns, 40,365. They also had
the highest average number of guns per investigation, 354.
</P>
<P>
   Gun shows, where licensed and unlicensed dealers sell, were
associated with the second-highest average number of guns per
investigation, 130, and accounted for nearly 26,000 trafficked
firearms. Fourteen percent of ATF investigations involved firearms
trafficked at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report shows that loopholes in our laws help make gun
shows and corrupt gun dealers major channels for gun trafficking,''
President Clinton said in a statement. ''Many of the diverted
weapons supplied by traffickers were later used to commit serious
crimes, including homicides, robberies and assaults,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on 1,530 investigations that ATF initiated
between July 1996 and December 1998, involving 84,128 firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,670 traffickers identified by ATF agents in those
investigations, 25 percent of them were convicted felons, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will continue to press Congress to pass his
proposals to crack down on illegal gun trafficking, including
handgun licensing and registration, and changing rules that
currently allow some gun buyers to avoid background checks at gun
shows. People who buy from unlicensed dealers at gun shows are not
subject to the background check, but those who buy from licensed
dealers are.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that would do some of those things, including
requiring background checks for all buyers at gun shows, has been
gridlocked in the Republican-run Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the report shows a need
for, among other things, a state-based system for licensing
firearms owners, something that's not included in the
administration's proposals before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 percent of the investigations examined in the report
involved firearms being trafficked by so-called straw purchasers
who buy on behalf of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said ATF agents recommended for prosecution
almost three-fourths of the 1,530 firearms investigations. Of the
1,083 defendants whose cases were fully adjudicated, nearly 97
percent of them were found guilty.

<HEADLINE> Report Blasts Monaco on Laundering  </HEADLINE>
By EMMANUEL GEORGES-PICOT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French parliamentary report into financial crimes
in Europe says the tiny principality of Monaco is a
money-laundering paradise with laws that fail to meet international
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The National Assembly concluded in the report, released
Wednesday, that Monaco, whose laws guarantee anonymity in banking
transactions, was an ''offshore center favorable to money
laundering.''
</P>
<P>
   Monaco is ''one of the most hypocritical territories concerning
the fight against money laundering,'' said Arnaud Montebourg, a
Socialist deputy who is one of the authors of the report, speaking
at a news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended that France review treaties dating back
to 1641 that link it to the Mediterranean principality and consider
penalizing Monaco by cutting subsidies it receives from the French
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Monaco government declined to comment on the report, saying
it ''wanted to study in detail the voluminous document'' before
issuing any response.
</P>
<P>
   The report accused Monaco of choosing a system of weak laws that
does not satisfy international standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Riviera principality, known as a playground of the rich and
famous, is uncooperative in the international fight against money
laundering, the report concluded. It noted that in 1998, Monaco
cited only 37 suspected cases of potentially illegal transactions --
40 fewer than other European tax havens.
</P>
<P>
   Monaco's bid to join the Council of Europe and the 16-nation
region that uses the euro was unlikely to succeed unless it
reviewed its legislation, the report said. It noted that the
principality was ''voluntarily placing itself on the margin of the
community of states it hopes to join.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said Monaco had 10 times more bank accounts than
residents, and that nonresidents held 60 percent of the more than
340,000 bank accounts opened in the principality.
</P>
<P>
   Monaco has no centralized catalogue of accounts held in the
principality, and the organization charged with overseeing money
laundering is woefully understaffed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   France bears partial responsibility because Monaco's top civil
servants and magistrates are appointed by France and the Bank of
France oversees Monaco lending agencies, the report said, calling
on France to recall its magistrates.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Haider Visits Libya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Right-wing Austrian leader Joerg Haider
traveled to Libya on Wednesday with a business delegation to
improve relations in tourism and learn more about a Libyan water
project, media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Haider and a delegation from the tourism, oil and pipe building
sectors arrived in Tripoli to ''lead the way towards concrete
economic cooperation,'' the Austria Press Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two months that Haider visited the
Libyan capital. In May, Haider made an unofficial visit to Tripoli,
where he met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Libyan state media were reporting on the
''official'' visit of the governor of the southern Austrian
province of Carinthia, the Austria Press Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Haider said he expects to sign an agreement on tourism and learn
more about a project of Gadhafi's to create a ''manmade river'' to
carry water from the oases in the heart of the country to the
coast, where most of Libya's industry and population are
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to establish the possibility for cooperation in this
enormous project,'' APA quoted Haider as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, who stepped down as head of the far-right Freedom Party
shortly before his May visit, is credited as the main reason
Austria has become isolated by its partners in the European Union
and other countries. He is known for his anti-foreigner stance and
his past praise of Nazi work policies.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's 14 EU partners imposed sanctions on the Alpine nation
to express their displeasure with the inclusion of the Freedom
Party's -- then under Haider -- inclusion in the Austrian coalition
government run by Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel last January.

<HEADLINE> Chief: U.S. Needs Missile Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The easing of tensions with North Korea does
not diminish the need for a U.S. missile defense system, which
should remain a priority ''over and above'' other military needs,
the Air Force chief of staff said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Ryan acknowledged concern at the Pentagon about the
unknown cost of a national missile defense system but said U.S.
military leaders all support it if it proves feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan spoke to a defense writers group just after North Korea
pledged to continue its moratorium on testing of long-range
missiles and proposed a joint meeting of North and South Korean Red
Cross organizations. The moves were a follow-up to a summit between
the two countries' top leaders during the weekend, and to the U.S.
lifting some economic sanctions against North Korea on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean guarantees and warming relations on the Korean
peninsula do not undercut the need for a U.S. national missile
defense system, Ryan said. He said other potential troublemaking
states could gain the ability to hit U.S. territory in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has announced the next $100 million test of the
system for July 7 with a planned interception of a missile over the
Pacific Ocean. Even if it fails, Defense Secretary William Cohen
has said he might recommend development of a system. President
Clinton is expected to decide before leaving office whether to go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Pentagon cost estimate for the system's 100
interceptors is $36 billion over 20 years, but estimates keep
changing, with full extent of the detection and interception system
not yet decided.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said that while military leaders are concerned about the
unknown cost of the system to protect the 50 states against a
limited nuclear missile attack, he believes it will not affect
already tight military budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping it's going to be over and above'' projected
military defense needs, he said. But he said there is no commitment
that it will remain that way.
</P>
<P>
   He said the system is needed despite development on the Korean
Peninsula because North Korea is not the only nation that could
have the capacity in the next 20 years to launch a nuclear missile
against U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Ryan said:
</P>
<P>
   --The Air Force will never have enough equipment to conduct two
major theater wars at the same time. ''We can't afford to go
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --Underfunding has forced the military to put off needed
replacement of facilities at bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   --On whether the modern U.S. military is willing to enter any
conflict that might lead to American casualties, he said there is
no machismo in the military that says soldiers need to face undue
danger, but Air Force fliers risk their lives every day enforcing
the no-fly zone over Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Angola Rebel Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- UNITA rebels staged a hit-and-run attack
on the outskirts of a northern Angolan city, killing four people
and wounding four others, news reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters, armed with rifles and grenades, also kidnapped two
women and two youths and burned 15 huts in two neighborhoods
outside the city of Uige, 150 miles northeast of Luanda, the Roman
Catholic radio station Ecclesia reported.
</P>
<P>
   The attack took place at dawn Tuesday and lasted about two
hours, according to the Ecclesia correspondent in Uige, who cited
hospital sources and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA -- a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- have been engaged in
low-intensity fighting since the government ousted the rebels from
their central highland strongholds in a major offensive last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told The Associated Press earlier this week that
government and UNITA representatives held secret peace talks over
the weekend in Mozambique. Neither side has officially confirmed
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Angola has been torn by civil war almost without interruption
since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Vieques War Games Planned  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. Navy on Saturday plans to
launch its biggest Vieques war games since a bombing accident last
year, but a Puerto Rican agency is insisting it has the final say
on whether bombs will fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy notice -- published as an ''environmental assessment''
in local newspapers Wednesday -- said the exercises would begin
Saturday, and came as the USS George Washington Battle Group,
carrying 15,000 sailors and Marines, began deploying from Norfolk,
Va., for a six-month tour of the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Several ships attached to the battle group and warplanes will
train in the outlying Puerto Rican island for two to six days
before joining the George Washington, according to a notice sent to
Puerto Rican authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had hoped to begin on Wednesday what would be the
largest exercise since a civilian security guard was killed by two
stray 500-pound bombs in April 1999, sparking a frenzy of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1983 accord in which Puerto Rico's government pledged
to keep Navy training plans secret, the local Planning Board
released documents this week detailing the proposed exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The board insists it must approve training, and it set a public
comment period that expires Friday. It was awaiting responses from
state and federal agencies on environmental concerns, said
spokeswoman Ivelisse Prado. Gov. Pedro Rossello, however, said he
believed the board had no power to decide when the Navy can use
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of U.S. religious groups, including the National Council
of Churches and the United Church of Christ, denounced the planned
bombing and urged President Clinton to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques islanders blame decades of bombing for environmental
damage, stunted tourism, and what they say is a high cancer rate.
After the accident, protesters occupied the training ground until
federal officials evicted them last month. Dozens have since been
arrested on the range.
</P>
<P>
   As many as five ships from the Washington Battle Group will fire
up to 600 inert rounds onto the range. Aircraft will launch and
drop as many as 550 laser-guided rounds and dummy bombs, the Navy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing won't significantly harm the environment, it said --
a claim disputed by activists such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who
was barred Sunday from collecting soil samples from the range for a
planned lawsuit against the Navy. Kennedy argued Tuesday that the
Navy could bomb elsewhere and that its Vieques exercises were
''obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect his passion on the subject,'' Cmdr. Bill Cullin,
spokesman for Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said in an interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''But to make the case that we have not done well with the
environment is not a good case. I feel strongly about this: He has
a family that has done extraordinary things in the armed forces,
and this is a disservice to that fine record.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy responded: ''I'm proud of my family's military history.
I come from a naval family and I love the United States Navy and
that's one of the reasons I want them to stop this activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy insists Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet
can hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad -- training that saves countless lives.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy argued the Navy actually carries out amphibious
landings, bombing and shelling in different areas of the range.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton ordered the Navy to use dummy bombs instead
of live munitions and to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if the
island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum expected
next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions again.

<HEADLINE> FBI: Gun Checks Go Smoothly  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite last month's breakdown, the FBI
computer system used for criminal background checks on gun buyers
nationwide works virtually all the time without fail, an FBI
official assured lawmakers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months that the National Instant Criminal Background
Check System has been used, computers have only been down 3 percent
of that time, said David Loesch, assistant director of the FBI's
Criminal Justice Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NICS has proven to be a highly effective system,'' said
Loesch, noting that 95 percent of all background checks are
finished in two hours.
</P>
<P>
   However, gun sellers disagree, saying they often have problems
with the NICS. In May, a computer failure at the FBI Criminal
Information Center in Clarksburg, W.Va., halted gun sales
nationwide for almost four days, including on a Saturday, the
heaviest sales day.
</P>
<P>
   That hurts dealers, said Robin Ball, who owns an indoor shooting
range in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delays, outages and recorded messages have a very negative
impact on the process of doing business,'' she said. ''Customers
know the system is supposed to be instant and can't understand why
they get delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We send an angry customer away who can't complete a transfer,
not because of being ineligible to own a gun, but because the
government's system is incomplete or unreliable,'' Ball added.
</P>
<P>
   Loesch's report to the Senate Judiciary Committee blamed a
defect in database management software for the 66-hour May
shutdown. ''We're learning as we go to make this thing better,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   NICS went fully online in 1998, after a three-day waiting period
for gun buys was phased out. But ''the NICS system has not yet
lived up to its promise,'' said Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, who pointed out that last year computer outages caused 215
hours of down time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of an instant check, we have a system that too often
causes needless delay to law-abiding citizens who are simply
exercising their constitutional rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole -- who proposed an instant
gun check amendment back in 1988 that led to the NICS -- also
testified, suggesting improvements. He recommends operating the
system 24 hours a day instead of the current 17, allowing the FBI
to permanently keep a record of all NICS gun purchase denials for
possible prosecution of criminals, and requiring all checks to be
completed in eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   For those that can't be resolved in eight hours, the FBI would
be authorized to use private data collectors to check a person's
criminal record, Dole said. ''Private checks would reconcile most
instances where the police records are lacking,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sickle Cell Complication Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have figured out the cause of a fast-killing
complication of sickle cell anemia and shown that most patients can
be saved by aggressive treatment with everything from antibiotics
to transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Children's Hospital Oakland in California and
elsewhere determined that many cases of ''acute chest syndrome''
are triggered by infections and fat clots in the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome is the leading killer among people with sickle cell
anemia, an incurable blood disorder that almost exclusively strikes
blacks and once killed most sufferers by age 20.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also showed that a prompt combination of
treatments helped all but 3 percent of patients recover, including
many who were so sick they were on respirators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe it's going to fundamentally reshape how
sickle cell acute chest disorder is treated,'' said lead researcher
Dr. Elliott P. Vichinsky, chief of hematology and oncology at
Children's. ''Survival rates will be dramatically improved.''
</P>
<P>
   The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and
reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 Americans have sickle cell disease, an inherited
disorder in which an abnormal form of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin
inside their red blood cells reduces the cells' oxygen level,
causing chronic anemia and jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, acute chest syndrome killed about 15 percent of
patients who got it, partly because many emergency room doctors
failed to quickly diagnose and treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard A. Drachtman, director of the pediatric sickle cell
program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New
Brunswick, N.J., said sickle cell specialists at university
hospitals now give patients with acute chest syndrome most
treatments the study lays out, but without knowing what is best.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proves that what we're doing is the state of the art,''
Drachtman said. ''It points the way and could lead to how to
prevent acute chest syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   In sickle cell patients, anything that reduces a patient's
oxygen level can trigger a painful ''crisis'' where oxygen-depleted
hemoglobin molecules clump together, twisting normally round red
blood cells into inflexible sickles, or half-moon shapes. The
sickles get trapped in tiny blood vessels, reducing oxygen supply,
damaging organs, and weakening the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In acute chest syndrome, patients develop severe chest pain,
fever, cough, pneumonia and shallow, rapid breathing. Tissues
become further starved of oxygen, sometimes causing brain damage,
respiratory failure or heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, doctors treated 538 patients for 671 acute chest
syndrome episodes in the mid-1990s. Treatment included multiple
antibiotics, drugs to dilate lung passages, and lung ''exercises''
to boost breathing capacity. To reverse ''sickling'' of red blood
cells, patients got oxygen and transfusions of healthy, oxygen-rich
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Patients were hospitalized an average of 10&AMP;frac12; days, and only 18
died.

<HEADLINE> Study OKs Umbilical Blood Transplants  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Transplants of umbilical cord blood are as effective as bone
marrow transplants at saving the lives of childhood leukemia
victims and others whose ravaged immune systems must be restored, a
study found.
</P>
<P>
   That's an encouraging finding, because most patients awaiting a
bone marrow transplant die before genetically matched marrow can be
found.
</P>
<P>
   Using umbilical cord blood instead offers patients another
option. More important, umbilical cord blood appears more likely
than marrow to work when the donor and the recipient are unrelated.
But more research is needed to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings ''hopefully will go a long way toward
convincing people that there is a place for cord blood
transplants,'' said Dr. Joel A. Brochstein, director of pediatric
stem cell transplants at Hackensack University Medical Center in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The study -- the first large comparison of cord blood vs. marrow
-- was reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. It
was conducted the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry at
Medical College of Wisconsin and the Paris-based Eurocord-Cord
Blood Transplant Group.
</P>
<P>
   It found that cord blood is less likely to work, but also less
apt to trigger a potentially fatal complication called graft versus
host disease. The disease happens when the new tissue attacks the
recipients' body. It kills up to 40 percent of patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, recipients of cord blood and marrow had about the
same five-year survival rate: 50 percent for those with malignant
diseases and 85 percent for those with nonmalignant diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't say that cord blood is better, but it appears to
produce the same survival,'' said Dr. Mary Horowitz, scientific
director of the Milwaukee-based registry.
</P>
<P>
   The transplants didn't ''take'' among 11 percent of those
getting cord blood and 2 percent of those receiving marrow. But
patients getting cord blood were only about 40 percent as likely as
those getting marrow to develop graft versus host disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wash,'' Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   She said cord blood transplants are probably less likely to work
because they provide only one-tenth the cells marrow transplants
do.
</P>
<P>
   The study of patients 15 or younger examined the medical records
of 113 who had received cord blood and 2,052 who got marrow, each
from a sibling with the same tissue type.
</P>
<P>
   The children's immune systems had been wiped out by chemotherapy
or radiation given for leukemia, or by genetic blood disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Both cord blood and marrow are rich in stem cells, which are
''immature'' cells that turn into platelets, red blood cells and
infection-fighting white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe cord blood cells are less likely to attack
the recipient because they are young and ''more forgiving,'' and
because during pregnancy they learned to tolerate the mother's
immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Cord blood has other advantages: There is less chance it is
carrying infectious agents, there is no infection risk to a donor,
and once it is saved, cord blood is available whenever needed.
Marrow donors must undergo painful marrow removal in a hospital.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes N. Korean Pledge  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States welcomed North Korea's
pledge to refrain from long-range missile tests and said it looked
forward to holding talks soon on the issue with the communist
state.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea promised to maintain a moratorium on the tests two
days after the United States lifted some economic sanctions against
it, saying the U.S. action will facilitate efforts to set up
high-level talks on improving ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome the North Korean statement and the continued
restraint by Pyongyang,'' State Department spokesman Phil Reeker
said Wednesday. ''And we look forward to conducting bilateral
missile talks soon to address the range of issues related to the
North Korean missile program.''
</P>
<P>
   The North's statement follows a historic summit last week
between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il, who pledged to renounce hostilities, promote
unification and arrange reunions of separated families.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang agreed in September not to test-fire a new missile as
long as talks continued with Washington on improving ties.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides had preparatory talks in Rome and Reeker said
Wednesday that the United States ''expects to conduct some
bilateral missile talks soon to address the range of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea planned to send a high-level official to Washington
early this year, but the visit was put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   After half a century of embargo, Washington on Monday said it
would open trade with North Korea in nonmilitary goods, open air
travel and shipping routes, and ease restrictions on U.S.
investment in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Marking a beginning of newly liberalized trade, Coca-Cola
announced it was sending several hundred cases of drinks into North
Korea on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Asset Swap Changes Forced  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved a
multimillion-dollar asset swap between the nation's second and
third largest waste disposal companies after they agreed to sell
assets or modify contracts in 15 metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   The department's antitrust division said Wednesday that Allied
Waste Industries Inc. and Republic Services Inc. agreed to alter
their original deal. That resolved the government's concern that
the deal would have resulted in higher prices for waste collection
and disposal in those markets, which include New York; Nashville
and Memphis, Tenn., and Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The government filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court here to
block the original swap and simultaneously filed an agreement with
the companies, which, if approved by the court, would resolve that
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relief required ... was necessary to prevent consumers in
several parts of the country from having to pay higher prices for
waste collection and disposal,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Joel I. Klein.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the original deal would have substantially
lessened competition in 15 markets in Florida, Georgia, Indiana,
Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia. In
each of these markets, Allied and Republic are either the only
firms or among a very few firms providing commercial waste hauling,
roll-off waste hauling or municipal solid waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial waste hauling is the collection of trash from trash
bins, usually with front-end load trucks, from office and apartment
buildings and retail businesses. Roll-off waste haulers collect
larger containers of bulkier waste from construction sites and
factories. Municipal solid waste service companies accept trash
from waste haulers at landfills, incinerator and transfer stations
and legally dispose of it for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Allied agreed to sell waste collection and-or disposal
operations in Augusta, Ga.; Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa
Counties, Fla.; Memphis and Nashville, Tenn.; New York, N.Y., and
Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Republic agreed to sell collection and disposal operations in
Anderson, Ind.; Columbus, Ohio; Lakeland, Fla.; Louisville,
Ky.-Sellersburg, Ind., and Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two companies agreed to alter existing
contracts and offer new waste hauling service contracts in Albany,
N.Y.; Augusta, Ga.; Burlington and Camden Counties, N.J.;
Clarksville, Tenn.; Columbus, Ohio; Lakeland, Fla.; Escambia, Santa
Rosa and Okaloosa, Fla.; Louisville, Ky.-Sellersburg, Ind.; Macon,
Ga.; Monmouth County, N.J., and Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Allied and Republic also agreed to fixed limits on the length of
contracts, notice of contract terminations and liquidated damage
provisions in new and existing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Scottsdale, Ariz., Allied is the second largest waste
hauling and disposal company in the United States. It had $6
billion in sale during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., Republic is the third largest
waste company, with 1998 revenue of $1.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> Driver accused of bus death pleads guilty to traffic violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUINTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A Bridgeton man accused of running
a stop sign and hitting a school bus, killing a 14-year-old boy,
pleaded guilty Wednesday to several motor vehicle charges.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Hannah, 43, must serve five and a half months in jail and
pay a fine of $1,872, said Municipal Court Administrator Florence
Mowers. Hannah's license was revoked for four years. He also must
serve 30 days of community service and pay $150 in court costs,
Mowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah pleaded guilty to driving while his license was
suspended, driving without auto insurance, running a stop sign,
driving with fictitious license plates and not using a seat belt,
Mowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah was driving with a suspended license in March 1999 when
he hit the school bus, knocking it on its side. Scott Agnew, of
Mullica Hill, an eighth-grader who attended Woodland Country Day
School in Bridgeton, died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A blood test indicated no trace of alcohol or other drugs in
Hannah's body at the time of the accident at Routes 647 and 667 in
Quinton Township, about 8 miles southeast of Salem. Those results
made it difficult for prosecutors to prove recklessness, said
Samuel Bullock, the Agnew family's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said they didn't file criminal charges because
there was no evidence that Hannah was speeding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, there was a terrible collision, and, very
tragically, a young boy was killed,'' said Salem County Prosecutor
John E. Bergh.
</P>
<P>
   An honors student who played basketball, soccer and baseball,
Scott Agnew was a mild-mannered boy who never got into trouble and
who loved to read, his father, Tom Agnew, told The Philadelphia
Inquirer. He would have been a freshman at Clearview Regional High
School this year.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's mother, Donna Peterson Agnew, is the township school
superintendent. She went to the scene shortly after the accident,
thinking one of her district's buses had been involved and soon
learned that her son had died, Tom Agnew said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Clergy Warn on ID Cards  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MURPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- More than 130,000 Greek Orthodox clergymen
and followers packed central Athens on Wednesday to oppose changes
in national identity cards and assert their power as lines between
religion and politics continue to blur.
</P>
<P>
   ''A deep social rift is beginning,'' declared the head of the
Greek Orthodox Church, Archbishop Christodoulos, in the second mass
rally to resist plans to remove religious affiliation from state
IDs. On June 14, up to 120,000 people gathered in the northern city
of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
   But Premier Costas Simitis insists the measure, which is part of
1997 privacy protection reforms, will not be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos and his supporters also refuse to back down,
setting up a momentous struggle between Greece's two most powerful
institutions: the Orthodox church and the long-governing
Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Victory is assured,'' Christodoulos boomed during an 80-minute
address.
</P>
<P>
   The rally took on the character of a highly choreographed
political event -- reinforcing accusations from critics that
Christodoulos is meddling in state affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos repeatedly stated he has no political ambitions,
but called the church ''a great popular force'' that will ''not be
a slave'' to any government.
</P>
<P>
   He also hinted that it is sometimes justified to disobey laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a citizen wants to write his religion on his ID, no one
can forbid this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos said clergymen may collect signatures from those
in favor of an optional religious entry on IDs and present the list
to Greece's president. Some media commentators have speculated it
could be an attempt to force early elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who can ignore the voice of the people?'' he said from atop a
66-foot platform facing the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   On the broadest level, the battle has become an allegory for the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis' government has worked hard to push Greece into the
mainstream of the European Union. An important milestone was
reached Tuesday: confirmation that Greece will become the newest
member of the EU's single currency group.
</P>
<P>
   Many church leaders are deeply suspicious of the modernization
drive. They see it as a threat to the Christian Orthodox character
of the nation and possibly the stirrings of an eventual separation
of church and state in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ''Theocracy or Democracy?'' asked a banner headline in the
left-leaning Eleftherotypia newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Peddlers sold crosses and flags of Greece and the two-headed
eagle symbol of the former Byzantine Empire. Bewildered tourists
struggled through the crowds to reach their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the supreme demonstration of protest against the
removal of religion from identity cards and the transformation of
Greece into an atheist state,'' the church said in a memorandum
sent to parish priests.
</P>
<P>
   About 97 percent of Greece's native-born population of 10.5
million is baptized into the Orthodox Church, which sees itself as
the true guardian of Greek identity and traditions. The church
strongly promotes the belief that it safeguarded the Greek language
and customs during four centuries of Ottoman rule.
</P>
<P>
   But religious minorities such as the Muslims and Jews say the
current ID cards make them targets for discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Date change is causing problems for Miss America  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A plan to hold the Miss America
Pageant one month later than usual this year could put the squeeze
on people who want to see it in person.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant, which has always been held in September, has been
moved to Oct. 14 this year because ABC network officials were
worried about the pageant telecast facing competition from the
Summer Olympics, which will be carried by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But casinos that traditionally set aside rooms for use by
contestants, traveling companions, family members and state pageant
officials are having trouble making space this year because they
booked reservations and events for early October before the date
change was announced, pageant CEO Robert M. Renneisen said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only problem.
</P>
<P>
   The closing and demolition of Trump World's Fair casino hotel
has eliminated another 500 rooms from the city's inventory,
exacerbating the room squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're scrambling to find room for the pageant ... not only
for the contestants but for the judges, the media and all the
people who come in and make this such a profitable event for the
city,'' Renneisen told the Metropolitan Business and Citizens
Association at a luncheon meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Beds aren't the only things that will be in demand. There will
be fewer seats this year, too.
</P>
<P>
   A $90 million renovation of Convention Hall, the Depression-era
Boardwalk arena that hosts the pageant, will make 3,450 general
admission seats unavailable for the pageant. The hall's seating
capacity this year will be about 8,251, according to Susan
Ricciardi, director of media relations for the Atlantic City
Convention and Visitors Authority, which operates the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll certainly sell out and there will be people who won't
get seats,'' Renneisen said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are making for an interesting introduction for
Renneisen, a former casino executive who was hired by the pageant
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got the date change, the Convention Hall renovation
and they've got a CEO who's never been to a pageant before in his
life,'' Renneisen said.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Aid to Terrorism Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday
approved legislation to make it easier for victims of terrorism to
collect multimillion-dollar court judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sets up a process under which American plaintiffs who
prevail in court could recover their judgment by seizing frozen
assets of nations that sponsored the terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, championed by a group of former hostages and
families of terrorism victims, next goes to the full House for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the measure on grounds that
other countries might retaliate by seizing U.S. diplomatic
properties abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have moved one step closer to giving these victims and
their families the justice they deserve,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate and has
been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. It has wide
bipartisan support in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Among those the law was intended to help is Terry Anderson, a
former chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was held captive in Lebanon for nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson earlier this year won a $341 million judgment against
Iran, whom he accuses of orchestrating his imprisonment, but he has
been unable to collect it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure could also benefit the families of pilots shot down
off the coast of Florida by Cuban fighter jets in 1996; and Stephen
Flatow, of West Orange, N.J., who maintains that his daughter,
killed in Israel in 1995, was another of Iran's victims. He was
awarded a $247 million judgment against Iran.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Push Genetic Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats urged Republicans Wednesday to move
quickly on legislation to protect workers from genetic
discrimination, saying swift passage will help employees who fear
losing their jobs or health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions of Americans may be afraid to have genetic testing
done because the results of those tests could put their health
insurance in jeopardy,'' House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, ''In a sense the
genetic code is the key to who we are. No one ought to have a right
to pick that lock.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Social policy must keep pace with science,'' said Rep. Louise
Slaughter of New York, the measure's House sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill Democrats are pushing would ban discrimination based on
genetic information. They hope to get the 218 signatures necessary
to force a vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., questioned the Democrats' motivation and said Republican
leaders plan to push a version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trying to make politics out of this seems to be rather
curious,'' Feehery said. ''We're going to do something on this
issue.'' He did not elaborate on a GOP version but said Republicans
wanted to attach it to patients' rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With a complete map of the human genome -- a breakthrough
scientists say is nearing completion -- doctors will be able to
predict the medical futures of their patients, such as those more
likely to suffer from cancer, diabetes or heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is all of the genes that give instructions for
an individual's biological development and the functioning of the
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation said some employers and insurers
are reluctant to take on the extra financial burden of people with
ailments whose treatments can pile up substantial medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   In February, President Clinton issued an executive order that
barred federal agencies from discriminating against employees on
the basis of genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is happening today in job sites all around the country,''
said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. and a sponsor of the Senate bill.
''Individuals are being turned down. They are denied promotions. It
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Seargent of Wilmington, N.C. said she had been employed
since 1996 as an office manager, receiving many promotions and
raises during her tenure. But she was fired in December, not long
after beginning treatments -- estimated to cost $48,000 a year -- for
Alpha-1, a genetic lung and liver disease that killed her brother
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I lost my job, I lost all my life and disability
insurance,'' Seargent said. ''In less than 10 minutes, we went from
a secure middle-class family to financially scraping by.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Visit Sick Friend in Ark.  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton cleared his morning
schedule Wednesday and rushed home to Arkansas to visit a longtime
friend who is terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, joined by Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea,
flew to Fayetteville to visit Diane Blair, a former political
science professor at the University of Arkansas, and her husband,
Jim. The couples have been friends for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair is suffering from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons arrived in a dreary, steady rain, bringing with
them a large bouquet of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit, Mrs. Clinton got into a small jet and headed to
New York and her Senate campaign. The president and Chelsea
returned to Washington on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One had to circle the runway at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington because two construction vehicles were too near
the restricted runway as Clinton's plane came in for its first
landing attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Dan Neely, a base spokesman, said air traffic
controllers waved the plane off. The plane circled once and landed
a few minutes later, Neely said. He did not know why the two
vehicles were there, nor why they were not discovered earlier.
Neely said Air Force One has been waved off at least once before,
although he did not know when.
</P>
<P>
   During their time in Arkansas, the Clinton spent nearly two
hours with the Blairs, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They laughed, they talked,'' Lockhart said. ''It was a
wonderful visit for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit was Clinton's third trip to Arkansas to see the Blairs
in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   The friendship dates to the early 1970s when both Clintons
taught at the University of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair left her political science teaching post at the
university last fall because of her illness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, then governor, officiated at the Blairs' 1979 wedding,
and Hillary Clinton served as what Jim Blair described as ''best
person.'' When the Clintons were married, they had the reception in
the backyard of the Blairs' home.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Blair was Hillary Clinton's adviser during a nine-month
period in 1978 and 1979, when she turned a $1,000 investment in the
cattle futures market into nearly $100,000. At the time, Blair
already was one of the state's most prominent trial lawyers. Later
he became general counsel for Tyson Foods Inc., one of the state's
most powerful businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The two couples have kept in frequent touch by telephone. Often
when they've returned to Arkansas, the Clintons visited the Blairs
in this college town or at the Blairs' vacation home at Beaver
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   On their last visit, in April, the three Clintons and the Blairs
took a meandering motor trip through town and the university
campus.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped in front of the law school, where a brass plaque
commemorates the president's and first lady's days on the faculty.
Clinton began teaching there in 1973, Mrs. Clinton in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 51; Dow Gains 63  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft helped propel the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Nasdaq composite higher Wednesday after a federal
judge delayed implementing business restrictions against the
software company.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose for the fifth straight day and very nearly
returned to where it began the year. The index, which has mounted a
steady recovery from devastating losses in April and May, is now
just less than six points below its Dec. 31, 1999, close. At its
low point on May 23, the Nasdaq was down 28.6 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing the continued shift out of industrial and value
companies and into growth companies,'' said Tom Galvin, chief
equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in New York. Yet
he pointed out that without Microsoft, market averages would have
barely budged Wednesday, suggesting that investors remain
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose 50.65 points to close at 4,064.01. The index
closed at 4,069.31 on Dec. 31. Even with the comeback, Nasdaq is
still 19.5 percent below the all-time high of 5,048.62 reached
March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 62.58 Wednesday to
10,497.74 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 3.18 to
1,479.13.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft climbed $5.75 to $80.688. In a surprise move late
Tuesday afternoon, a federal judge said he would delay sanctions
against the company while it appeals the antitrust decision that
could force it to be broken in two. The judge's initial ruling
called for Microsoft to implement certain business restraints by
Sept. 5. Also, the judge sent the case directly to the Supreme
Court, which is close to completing its current term and may not
rule for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The broader technology sector was mixed. Handspring, a maker of
handheld electronic organizers, made a solid if unremarkable debut
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares were priced at $20 and rose to
$26.938.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle was lower for most of the day before finishing with a
gain of 14.1 cents, closing at $86.188. After the close of trading
Tuesday, the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that
handily beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle shares have run up substantially in recent weeks,
prompting some investors to take profits Wednesday. Also, analysts
said some investors may have been disappointed in the relatively
slow growth of Oracle's core database business.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are scouring corporate earnings reports for any signs
of weakness and have proven themselves ready to punish any company
that misses analysts' estimates or shows any sign of slowing
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a period where investors recognize that the economy
is slowing, but they understand that there will be some potholes
along the way,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates have begun hurting profits at a wide range
of companies, and investors remain unsure of whether the Federal
Reserve has finished boosting rates. The central bank, which has
increased rates six times in the past year in a bid to contain
inflation, will hold its next meeting June 27-28, and anticipation
of that meeting is keeping many investors on the sidelines,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the list of those unfortunate companies that won't
achieve earnings projections has been small, they come at a bad
time,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Once the interest-rate decision is announced, stocks should
start rising again, Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the Fed will not raise interest rates, but either
way, the news will be on the table, and thus out of the market's
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were trading actively after OPEC members agreed to
boost daily crude oil production starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers agreed to increase production by 708,000 barrels
daily, or by 3 percent, but oil prices rose on the belief that the
production increase will be too little to dramatically influence
prices. Oil companies followed; Exxon Mobil was up 68.75 cents at
$83.938 and Chevron rose $1 to $91.25.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 1.20
billion shares, compared with 1.23 billion on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.92 to 527.61.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.8 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 1.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
slipped 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 declined 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Some dissension on Pirro jury  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - There were signs of strife Wednesday
in the jury deliberating the tax evasion case against Albert Pirro,
husband of the district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   One juror met with Judge Barrington Parker and the lawyers soon
after the jury began its third day of deliberations, and whatever
he said prompted the judge to remind all the panelists that ''each
juror is entitled to his or her own opinion'' and to negotiate in a
''polite, friendly fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Go back to work and try to lower the temperature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to tell whether the dissension was over a minor
matter or signaled a possible 11-1 split on a verdict. Jurors
deliberated an additional seven hours, for a three-day total of 16&AMP;frac12;
hours, without any further signs of turmoil, and left the federal
courthouse chatting amiably.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro and his brother Anthony, who was his accountant, are
accused of hiding $1.2 million of Albert's income and deducting
personal spending as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The key witness at the month-long trial was an Internal Revenue
Service agent, and the juror who spoke to the judge said during
jury selection that he had once been audited by the IRS. He was
required to pay $2,000, he said, but held no grudge or ill feeling
toward the tax agency.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, who was in on the secret conference about the juror's
complaint, said it would be speculating to deduce which way the
jury was leaning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really have no idea,'' he said. ''The jury is just doing
what it's supposed to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers and prosecutors would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   As he left, Pirro stood with his wife, District Attorney Jeanine
Pirro, on the courthouse steps, then held her hand briefly before
heading off with his lawyers. It was his 53rd birthday, and he said
waiting for a verdict was not pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every minute is like an hour,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Poland Gives Israel Begin Records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Poland handed over to Israel on Wednesday
secret police archives collected on former Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin during his student days at Warsaw University.
</P>
<P>
   The records date from 1931-35, when Begin studied at the
university, and include his student ID and confirmation that he had
been accepted to study in the law faculty. Polish officials
searched for the documents at the request of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international political success of Prime Minister Begin is
a contribution to the joint history of our nations,'' Deputy
Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said after handing the documents
to Israeli Ambassador Yigal Antebi at a ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Polish officials located the file on Begin in the State
Protection Office, which administers communist-era secret police
files.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, Begin left Warsaw for
Vilnius, Lithuania, before making his way to Palestine in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 he became Israel's sixth prime minister and shared the
1978 Nobel Peace Prize with Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat after
the two leaders signed the Camp David peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   About 3.5 million Jews made up a thriving community in Poland
before World War II. About 3 million were killed in Nazi death
camps and ghettos, and others left in the 1960s during
communist-sponsored anti-Semitic campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Court bars sex offenders from Hudson County facility  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Sex offenders who have already served
criminal sentences can't be held in a Hudson County facility
because keeping them there violates the state's lease with the
prison, a court ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern State Prison Annex in Kearny is the only
corrections facility in the state system for sex offenders who have
done their time but are deemed too dangerous to be released.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief, unanimous opinion, a state appeals panel affirmed an
earlier judge's ruling that said the state was wrong to keep the
sex offenders in space it leases from Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the decision, Hudson County officials said they will
ask the judge to again order those convicted sex offenders moved.
The judge did just that last year, but held the action while the
state appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections houses adult prisoners in its
leased space next to the Hudson County Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   But area residents joined county and local officials in
protesting the move to keep the sex offenders there.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey law allows a civil court judge to put sex offenders
in a state psychiatric hospital. The state plans to build a
permanent facility to eventually house those sex offenders in the
civil commitment program.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said no
decision has been made on appealing the decision to the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just evaluating the decision and looking at our
options,'' spokesman Roger Shatzkin said.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent consideration is what to do with the 92 offenders,
Shatzkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we're looking at alternative placements. But it's
really premature until the judge rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Offenders in the civil commitment program are supervised by the
state Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Although some sex offenders had been placed in the state's five
psychiatric hospitals, inmates from state prisons were to go
directly to the Kearny location, said Laurie Facciarossa, a
spokeswoman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some were placed and some were in the process. It remains to
be seen what the placement procedures will be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents praised the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hardworking families of Hudson County, especially Kearny,
do not deserve to live near these high-risk prisoners, and we vowed
to fight this proposal every step of the way. I am grateful the
courts have seen the state's plan as we have,'' Hudson County
Executive Robert C. Janiszewski said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson County freeholder Sal Vega said it was clear to all in
the community the state's plan was not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pleased the courts have sided with the people of Hudson
County once again,'' Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fight by the county and the town worked, Kearny Mayor
Alberto Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From day one, I said we would never give up the fight and
we're pleased the county has led the charge in removing the sexual
predators from Kearny,'' Santos said.

<HEADLINE> UN Votes To Keep NATO in Bosnia  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council voted Wednesday
to keep the NATO-led peacekeeping force and the U.N. mission in
Bosnia for another year, but Russia abstained to protest
Yugoslavia's exclusion from a 46-nation meeting on Bosnia last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the war in Bosnia ended, the council approved a
resolution by a vote of 14-0 stating that ''the situation in the
region continues to constitute a threat to international peace and
security.''
</P>
<P>
   The council gave strong backing to the Stabilization Force led
by NATO which has played a key role in providing security since the
3&AMP;frac12;-year war in Bosnia ended in 1995 with the signing of the Dayton
Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The council also supported the 3,400-strong U.N. mission in
Bosnia, which helps oversee some civilian components of the Dayton
pact, including the return of refugees and the building of
government institutions. Some 1,575 U.N. civilian police train and
monitor officers from the Serb, Muslim and Croat communities.
</P>
<P>
   In the resolution, the council welcomed positive steps taken by
Croatia to implement the Dayton agreement, emphasized that the
return of refugees ''continues to be crucial to lasting peace,''
and expressed support for a declaration issued on May 24 at a
meeting of Bosnia's Peace Implementation Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Brussels meeting was boycotted by Russia and China in
protest of Yugoslavia's exclusion by the council. Yugoslavia, a
signatory to the Dayton agreement, called its omission a violation
of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The council's steering board barred Yugoslavia from the meeting
because the Belgrade government includes indicted war criminals and
because sanctions resulting from Yugoslavia's actions in Kosovo bar
hundreds of officials from entering the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's vote, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov
said his government backed the ''general thrust'' of the Bosnia
resolution but protested the further isolation of Yugoslavia,
saying it would have ''very serious consequences for the entire
Balkan region and international efforts to stabilize the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   China's U.N. Ambassador Wang Yingfan voted for the resolution
but echoed Lavrov's warning saying: ''Isolating and excluding
(Yugoslavia) does not help to solve the problem of
Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the other problems of the Balkans
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain, and Canada, however, supported the
Peace Implementation Council's decision to exclude Yugoslavia -- and
its declaration.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. deputy ambassador James Cunningham called the Peace
Implementation Council's role vital and said Yugoslavia had done
nothing since it walked out of a council meeting in December 1998
in Madrid ''to support implementation of the Dayton accords or to
merit its participation in the peace implementation process.''

<HEADLINE> German Union Accepts Improved Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's largest public workers union accepted an
improved wage offer Wednesday, won after threatening a walkout with
other unions in what would have been the country's first
large-scale strike in years.
</P>
<P>
   Workers belonging to the 3.1 million-member OeTV union approved
the new offer by a 60.1 percent vote.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the teacher and police unions also approved
the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators reached a last-minute agreement last week to avert
strikes, which had the potential to be the largest since an 11-day
walkout in 1992 left garbage piled in the streets and disrupted
public transport and airport traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The new wage offer covers federal, state and city workers for 31
months, instead of the 24-month contract previously offered. The
offer includes a 2 percent raise effective Aug. 1 and an additional
2.4 percent in September 2001 for 14 months. All workers will
receive a retroactive payment of $50 a month back to April, when
the old contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   Workers had sought a 5 percent increase, but the government said
the figure was too high and would force layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Although 49.5 percent of GEW teachers' union members voted
Wednesday to accept the deal, 48 percent voted against it. Under
the 80,000-member union's rules, the offer is approved if more than
25 percent vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of votes against the deal were ''a sign of
disappointment from members in the east,'' said GEW board member
Heiko Gosch.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue during the wage talks has been boosting pay to
members working in the former East Germany, who are paid 86.5
percent of those in the west. Union leaders in the east have
complained they gained little under the new offer, although the
agreement raises salary levels to 90 percent by March 2002 -- a year
earlier than the first proposal.

<HEADLINE> Study: Many US Gas Masks Defective  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half of the U.S. military's gas
masks have ''critical'' defects, rendering them useless against
attacks by biological or chemical weapons, according to a Pentagon
study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which sampled 19,218 masks from all military
branches, found 10,322 had a defect ''that has the potential to
result in mask leakage and may impact the protection of the
wearer.''
</P>
<P>
   The defects included dirty or leaking valves, disconnected
drinking tubes and missing gaskets in a device that allows the
wearer to be heard from behind the mask. Of the masks tested, fewer
than 5,000 passed without any kind of defect.
</P>
<P>
   News of the flawed masks comes four months after another
Pentagon report criticized military leaders for distributing
chemical protective suits while the manufacturer was under
investigation for deceiving the government.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year mask study, conducted by a Pentagon panel called
the Joint Service Integration Group, was completed last November,
six years after the Defense Department's inspector general first
reported defects in the masks and recommended testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had the services not spent six years in denial, a
technological or material solution could have been programmed to
reduce mask maintenance and make it rugged enough for battle,''
said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who chaired a House
subcommittee hearing on the military's defective protective
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Admiral David Stone told the subcommittee that the Navy has
been working to repair problems with the masks. He also said
''plans are being developed for testing all masks of pre-deploying
ships to ensure they are in serviceable condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said after the hearing that the
Defense Department has ''put a lot of money into developing better
protective gear, including gas masks.''
</P>
<P>
   While not disputing the report's findings, Army spokeswoman
Nancy Ray said the survey was not entirely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The criteria did not necessarily reflect how the mask would be
used in the field,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon panel concluded that poor maintenance and
inadequate training caused some of the defects. They said new masks
should be developed that require less maintenance, have fewer sharp
edges and contain leak detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Shays was not impressed with the Pentagon's explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the availability and reliability of individual protective
equipment were a military priority, these problems would have been
addressed as quickly and effectively as the Defense Department
fixes a rifle that overheats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problems were manufacturer defects found when masks
came out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon study concerns the M40 masks used by the Army and
Marine Corps, the Air Force's MCU-2/AP and the Navy's MCU-2/P.

<HEADLINE> Child Vaccine Recommendations Made  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- All children under 2 years old should be
vaccinated with an expensive new drug that helps prevent meningitis
and other bacterial infections, a government advisory committee
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians and child health experts met in Atlanta to confer
with the 12-member government committee on the use of Prevnar,
which fights the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae -- the leading
cause of pneumonia, meningitis and millions of ear infections every
year in children.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after FDA approval of the drug in October, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices voted to recommend Prevnar vaccinations for
all children up to age 5.
</P>
<P>
   However, information about the high cost of the drug -- about $58
per shot -- caused the committee to reconsider. Infants need as many
as four shots; older children require fewer because they respond
better to the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's latest recommendations call for all children up
to 2 to get the shots. Children between 2 and 5 should get the
vaccine if they are at high risk -- a group that includes black,
American Indian and Eskimo children and youngsters with sickle cell
anemia, HIV or other immunodeficiency diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued the same
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Newby, general manager of the Meningitis Foundation of
America, said she was ''disheartened'' by the recommendations and
called on the CDC to urge vaccination of all children up to age 5,
regardless of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''This disease is too serious, too crippling and to deadly to
depend on doctors, nurses and parents to individually make the
right decision about who should receive it or not,'' she told the
CDC committee.
</P>
<P>
   American children under 5 suffer 16,000 pneumococcal blood
infections and 1,400 pneumococcal meningitis cases every year -- and
until Prevnar, there has been no way to prevent them, the FDA said.
In up to half the cases of meningitis, children suffer brain damage
or hearing loss -- and about 10 percent die.
</P>
<P>
   A different pneumococcal vaccine for adults has been available
for years.

<HEADLINE> Band Member Held in Peru  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A 61-year-old Salvation Army band member from
New Zealand could be in prison for a year awaiting trial on a
possible drug smuggling charge, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stewart was preparing to board a European-bound flight
when he was arrested June 10 at Jorge Chavez International Airport.
Police said Wednesday they discovered 13 pounds of cocaine in
Stewart's check-on baggage, and were holding him for investigation
pending formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the New Zealand foreign affairs ministry, Brad
Tattersfield, said Stewart is in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is expected to go before a judge who will decide if the
evidence is sufficient to continue holding him, said Tattersfield,
adding that if the case proceeds, it could be as long as 12 months
before his trial begins.
</P>
<P>
   Little information was available about Stewart. The foreign
affairs ministry in New Zealand described him as a self-employed
builder who plays the euphonium -- a brass wind instrument similar
to a tuba -- in the Salvation Army band in his home town of
Gisborne.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Victor Garcia, of the Salvation Army chapter in Lima, said
Stewart's family requested the local organization's help but that
''we don't know exactly what the anti-narcotics police are doing
with the case and for us it has been difficult to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said Stewart was not doing evangelical work with the
local Salvation Army chapter. He said Stewart did not contact the
local organization, but that he believed the New Zealander was
heading to Portugal when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the New Zealand embassy in Santiago, Chile, and the
British consul in Lima, declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Terrorism Center Set-Up in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- At their one-day Kremlin summit on Wednesday, the
leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States established a
joint anti-terrorist center and moved ahead with long-stalled plans
for a free-trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which is to coordinate efforts to combat organized
crime and insurgencies throughout the former Soviet republics, will
be located in Moscow and headed by a general from the Russian
Federal Security Service, a KGB successor agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the center's
establishment as a ''major step in fighting religious extremism and
terrorism on post-Soviet territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of ex-Soviet states grouped in the commonwealth share
common concerns about Islamic insurgencies. Russia has labeled
Chechen rebels as terrorists, and leaders of the former Soviet
republics in Central Asia have used the term to describe their
Islamic opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the victory of the hard-line Islamic Taliban in
neighboring Afghanistan, the Central Asian leaders have sought
Russian assistance in countering the alleged threat of
fundamentalism in their nations.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbek President Islam Karimov, who had previously balked at
Russia's continued influence in Central Asia, has recently made
efforts to strengthen ties with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russian interests in the region must be openly acknowledged,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkmenistan, a Central Asian country traditionally reluctant to
join in CIS programs, was the only member of the 12-nation alliance
that did not sign the agreement on the anti-terrorist center.
</P>
<P>
   The CIS leaders also decided Wednesday to end the CIS' symbolic
involvement in a peacekeeping mission in Tajikistan, which was
deployed in the Central Asian nation after a five-year civil war
that ended in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents also discussed a plan to establish a free-trade
zone, which has been under discussion since the CIS was created in
December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   They approved a basic framework for implementing the plan, which
requires each country to work out specific import and export
procedures and taxation adjustments within a year, the Interfax
news agency reported. No other details were given.
</P>
<P>
   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said he and Putin
agreed at the summit to adopt the Russian ruble as the common
currency for the Russia-Belarus Union, a loose alliance between the
two Slavic neighbors, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
   A single currency is envisioned in their union treaty, but
Russia -- whose economy and currency is far stronger than Belarus' --
has shown little enthusiasm for carrying out the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many agreements reached at past CIS summits have not been
implemented, and the group's role has been limited mostly to
serving as a discussion forum for leaders of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, the CIS leaders issued a statement backing
Moscow's opposition to the U.S. plans to amend the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, saying the move would ''undermine
global strategic stability.''

<HEADLINE> Analysis of a new television ads from Hillary Rodham Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton's new
television advertisements featuring Ed Koch:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLES: ''Trust Me'' and ''I Love New York.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds each.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Team Hillary, the Clinton campaign advertising group
that includes media guru Mandy Grunwald.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: In New York City beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPTS: ''Trust Me'':
</P>
<P>
   ''I like Rick Lazio, but I'm not voting for him. He's wrong on
too many issues. He opposes licensing and registration of handguns,
which I support and Hillary supports. He's not really pro-choice,
because he won't support funding abortion for poor women, which I
support and Hillary supports. And he's not really for the patient's
bill of rights, because he voted against the right to sue your HMO.
Hillary's my choice. Trust me. I love New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I Love New York'':
</P>
<P>
   ''I like Rick Lazio, but I'm not voting for him. He's wrong on
too many issues. He opposes licensing and registration of handguns
which I support and Hillary supports. He's not really pro-choice,
because he won't support funding abortion for poor women, which I
support and Hillary supports. And he was willing to run on the
Independence line with Pat Buchanan, which I could never agree
with. Hillary had the guts to say no to Buchanan. She's my choice.
Trust me. I love New York.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Former Mayor Ed Koch, smiling in an avuncular fashion
and dressed in a suit and tie, looks directly at the viewer and
speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The former mayor is known for speaking his mind and
endorsing whoever he thinks will serve his native city best,
regardless of ideology. In the past, that has sometimes meant
leaving the Democrats to endorse Republicans like Rudy Giuliani and
Al D'Amato. Koch's support for Clinton may therefore impress
independent-minded voters, traditional Democrats and longtime New
Yorkers who genuinely like Koch's style, from his accent to his
opinionated views. An endorsement from Koch also gives Clinton,
with her lack of New York roots, a shot of local credibility. Here
the ''Trust me, I'm a New Yorker'' speech downplays Koch's
potential to be in-your-face and substitutes a wise-old-man
schtick. It's a classic attack on positions held by Clinton's
Republican rival, Rep. Rick Lazio, but it's delivered in an
avuncular fashion that softens the negative content.
</P>
<P>
   The ads highlight four issues on which Clinton is more liberal
than Lazio. The campaign is betting that down-staters will agree
with her endorsement for gun licensing, Medicaid-funded abortions,
and the right to sue HMOs. The second ad's reference to Pat
Buchanan is designed to strike a chord with Jews, who make up a
large percentage of undecided voters, and minorities, who support
Clinton but whose voter turnout is crucial to her. The Independence
Party is the state wing of the national Reform Party for which
Buchanan is a presidential candidate. Clinton said she would not
accept a ticket with Buchanan; Lazio sought the Independence
endorsement. In the end, the Independence Party rejected both
Clinton and Lazio and went with its own lesser-known candidate.

<HEADLINE> DOE Cleanup Contracts Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Department efforts to privatize the
cleanup work at some of its old bomb-making plants have failed to
save time or money, according to congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the complex cleanup projects we reviewed, DOE's
privatization initiative has had little success in achieving cost
savings, keeping the projects moving forward on schedule or getting
improvements in contractors' performance,'' GAO Associate Director
Gary Jones said in prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
   She was to testify Thursday to a House Commerce subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   DOE started its privatization plan five years ago. The key
component allows contractors to competitively bid on fixed-price
contracts. The contractor designs, finances and builds the
facilities needed to do the cleanup work and typically receives
minimum guidance from DOE. The department only pays for products or
services delivered.
</P>
<P>
   That is different from past practices, in which DOE signed
cost-reimbursement contracts. Under those, DOE would finance the
operations, tell contractors how to perform cleanup activities and
pay them for their efforts regardless of what was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   GAO analyzed three fixed-price contracts. But DOE Senior Adviser
for Environmental Affairs Ellen Livingston said the agency
currently has 37 fixed-price contracts spread out among 44 cleanup
sites. While Livingston did not dispute GAO's findings, she said
some of its contracts were yielding positive results.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said GAO and Congress previously urged DOE to move
toward privatization. ''Nobody was happy with the old cost-plus
approach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va., who chairs the Commerce
Committee, said the agency needs to do a better job managing
contracts, whether they are fixed-price or not.
</P>
<P>
   He said previous GAO studies showed, under the old system, the
agency's cleanup projects were experiencing cost overruns averaging
60 percent above contract price. But Bliley said things appear to
be worse now.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the cost of a cleanup project at the Hanford
nuclear reservation in Richland, Wash., had increased 120 percent
above the contract price from $6.9 billion to $15.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''DOE's fixed-price contract reform efforts have made a
deplorable situation much worse,'' Bliley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, DOE said it planned to terminate the Hanford
contract with BNFL Inc., a subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels. It
cited the escalating costs and concerns about BNFL's performance.
Livingston said the department would probably seek a new contract
using the cost-reimbursable approach.
</P>
<P>
   David Campbell, BNFL manager of external corporate affairs,
blamed the overruns on the project's expansion and said it would
have gone up in price no matter what kind of contract was in place.
</P>
<P>
   BNFL also is working under a $238 million, fixed-price contract
in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and the company recently said it would need at
least $100 million more to complete that job.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department forces changes in asset swap by waste companies  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department approved a
multimillion-dollar asset swap between the nation's second and
third largest waste disposal companies after they agreed to sell
assets or modify contracts in 15 metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   The department's antitrust division said Wednesday that Allied
Waste Industries Inc. and Republic Services Inc. agreed to alter
their original deal. That resolved the government's concern that
the deal would have resulted in higher prices for waste collection
and disposal in those markets, which include New York; Nashville
and Memphis, Tenn., and Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The government filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court here to
block the original swap and simultaneously filed an agreement with
the companies, which, if approved by the court, would resolve that
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relief required ... was necessary to prevent consumers in
several parts of the country from having to pay higher prices for
waste collection and disposal,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Joel I. Klein.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the original deal would have substantially
lessened competition in 15 markets in Florida, Georgia, Indiana,
Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia. In
each of these markets, Allied and Republic are either the only
firms or among a very few firms providing commercial waste hauling,
roll-off waste hauling or municipal solid waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial waste hauling is the collection of trash from trash
bins, usually with front-end load trucks, from office and apartment
buildings and retail businesses. Roll-off waste haulers collect
larger containers of bulkier waste from construction sites and
factories. Municipal solid waste service companies accept trash
from waste haulers at landfills, incinerator and transfer stations
and legally dispose of it for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Allied agreed to sell waste collection and-or disposal
operations in Augusta, Ga.; Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa
Counties, Fla.; Memphis and Nashville, Tenn.; New York, N.Y., and
Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Republic agreed to sell collection and disposal operations in
Anderson, Ind.; Columbus, Ohio; Lakeland, Fla.; Louisville,
Ky.-Sellersburg, Ind., and Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two companies agreed to alter existing
contracts and offer new waste hauling service contracts in Albany,
N.Y.; Augusta, Ga.; Burlington and Camden counties, N.J.;
Clarksville, Tenn.; Columbus, Ohio; Lakeland, Fla.; Escambia, Santa
Rosa and Okaloosa, Fla.; Louisville, Ky.-Sellersburg, Ind.; Macon,
Ga.; Monmouth County, N.J., and Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Allied and Republic also agreed to fixed limits on the length of
contracts, notice of contract terminations and liquidated damage
provisions in new and existing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Scottsdale, Ariz., Allied is the second largest waste
hauling and disposal company in the United States. It had $6
billion in sale during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., Republic is the third largest
waste company, with 1998 revenue of $1.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> Guilty plea to first-degree murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A 20-year-old man who once faced a
possible death penalty was promised a sentence of no more than 25
years to life after he admitted in court Wednesday that he shot and
killed a neighbor who was raking leaves on his 91st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Kojinsky of Cold Spring pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder in the 1999 shooting of Charles Guardino.
Westchester County Court Judge Joseph West said the sentence would
be at least 22 years and no more than 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Kojinsky could have been sentenced to life without parole if
convicted at trial. District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said that
despite the judge's promise, she would still seek a life sentence
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro decided earlier this year not to seek the death penalty
despite the first-degree murder charge. She has yet to seek capital
punishment in five first-degree cases.

   Kojinsky was accused of accosting Guardino as the elderly man
was raking leaves outside his home on Oct. 13, when Kojinsky was 19
and living in Shenerock. The teen-ager allegedly stole Guardino's
wallet and shot him as he tried to take his car keys.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Arlene Popkin said Kojinsky, whose criminal
record consisted of one petty larceny, was drunk at the time of the
killing.

<HEADLINE> Royals Celebrate Milestone Birthdays  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Queen Elizabeth II and most of her nearest and
dearest gathered Wednesday for a night of partying to celebrate a
slew of royal birthdays. But the birthday boy himself wasn't there
-- Prince William turned 18 at school, cramming for an art history
exam.
</P>
<P>
   The royal mega-party at Windsor Castle was to celebrate five
royal milestones in the year 2000, including the queen's sister,
Princess Margaret's 70th, her daughter Princess Anne's 50th, and
her son Prince Andrew's 40th.
</P>
<P>
   But foremost among the celebrations were the 100th birthday, on
Aug. 4, of the Queen Mother Elizabeth, whose enduring popularity
has been a bulwark of the British monarchy, and William's coming of
age on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The party in the State Apartments at Windsor Castle, which rises
above the Thames River 25 miles west of London, began with a dinner
for about 80 friends. Royalty from Spain, Belgium and Norway were
on the guest list, as was ex-King Constantine of Greece, who now
lives in north London.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner guests were joined later by about 700 others for
drinks. Among them was Sarah, Duchess of York, whose ex-husband is
Prince Andrew. It is the first time since the 1997 funeral of
Princess Diana that the duchess has been included on the royal
guest list.
</P>
<P>
   William, who finishes his studies at Eton later this summer, is
studying for exams that determine university entrance. Although
Eton is just across the Thames from Windsor, he was not expected at
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have an exam on the day, but I will be studying for my
History of Art exam the next day,'' William told the British news
agency Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to study art history, probably at Edinburgh University,
after taking a year off to work or travel. And he has decided to
postpone until after university the use of the designation His
Royal Highness, usually conferred at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   That means he won't have to be called ''sir'' and needn't be
bowed and curtsied to. William -- second in line to the throne after
his father, Prince Charles -- has said he wants to be known simply
as William.
</P>
<P>
   Official birthday photos and TV film released last week showed a
relaxed and informal young man at ease with his friends at school.
They also provided a vivid reminder that Prince William is the
tall, blond, handsome image of his late mother.
</P>
<P>
   TV documentaries have been bringing out images of Diana that had
finally begun to fade from sight nearly three years after her death
in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Like Diana, William faces a life of international celebrity. And
when he leaves Eton, he leaves the protection of the press
guidelines for minors set out by the press self-regulatory body,
which bans intrusive coverage of the young.
</P>
<P>
   With opinion polls offering mixed results on the monarchy's
future, William's arrival on the public scene could bring new
support from the younger generation, which is the least
enthusiastic about the royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian newspaper published an opinion poll on June 12
showing support for the royal family at its lowest point in modern
times -- with only 44 percent believing the nation would be worse
off without the royals. The ICM Research poll of 1006 adults was
taken May 26-28 and had a 3 percent margin of error. It said the
previous low point had been 50 percent in August 1997, just before
Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian interpreted the figures as a reflection of public
indifference because of a sharp rise -- from 20 to 29 percent, in
the number of people who answered ''don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   However, The Daily Telegraph, published a Gallup poll a week
later that suggested a 10-point increase -- from 50 percent to 60
percent -- in the number of people who believe the monarchy and the
royal family should continue to exist, but become more democratic
and approachable. The margin of error was 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   William seems already headed down that path, putting off his
HRH, enjoying his schooldays away from royal confines, and
apparently avoiding the traditional Oxford or Cambridge educations
of the upper classes.

<HEADLINE> US: Chinese Journalists No Problem  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese journalists are setting up house
within earshot -- or at least within view -- of the Pentagon, but a
Defense Department spokesman said he is not worried.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said he learned of Chinese plans to
take up residence in a building that has a clear view of some of
the building's outside windows from a front-page Washington Times
story Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report quoted a Real Estate agent on the building's new
tenants, with confirmation from an official of the Chinese
government-affiliated Xinhua News Agency. It also quoted a China
specialist, Rick Fisher, as saying the building could provide a
base for covert monitoring of the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang Liu, Xinhua bureau chief, called the suggestions of spying
''groundless, absurd and irresponsible.'' He said he was accurately
quoted, however, in denying that his agency conducts spying.
</P>
<P>
   He said Xinhua purchased the seven-story building in Arlington,
Va., where it has been seeking new offices and living quarters for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   The building is less than a mile from the military headquarters,
and a few buildings away from parking lots surrounding the
Pentagon. Liu said it is farther away from the Pentagon than the
National Press Club building, which houses journalists from around
the world, is from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really nonsense. It's like a tale from the Arabian
Nights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Bacon said, ''We'd have to be pretty naive to
assume this stuff doesn't happen,'' referring to the potential for
attempts to spy on the military headquarters. ''The key to
protecting yourself is taking proper countermeasures to make sure
your information is secure.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials declined to discuss what measures are
taken to ensure against electronic eavesdropping from surrounding
buildings or passing vehicles. But he said it was safe to assume
there would be no effort to deny the Chinese journalists use of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the Chinese presence raised no particular concern, he
said, ''If you stand and look around the Pentagon, you can see a
lot of buildings.''

<HEADLINE> Five Orange police officers indicted in suspect's death  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Five Orange police officers violated the
civil rights of a man they mistakenly believed killed a colleague
by beating, robbing and pepper-spraying the suspect, who was
handcuffed throughout the ordeal, federal authorities charged
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Faison, erroneously suspected of murdering Orange police
Officer Joyce Carnegie last year, died after less than an hour in
custody due to ''egregious misconduct,'' including an attempted
cover-up, U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man - the fourth taken into custody - later confessed to
gunning down Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   The five-count indictment, returned Tuesday and unsealed
Wednesday with the arrests of the officers, stems from a yearlong,
continuing federal civil rights probe of Faison's arrest. It said
the officers sought to ''punish'' Faison, who was arrested on April
11, 1999, three days after Carnegie was shot and killed while
approaching a robbery suspect on a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The acts of vigilantism demonstrated by these officers on that
tragic day went against the fabric of law enforcement and all that
it stands for,'' said FBI Agent Joseph R. Lewis, the head of the
bureau's Newark office.
</P>
<P>
   The officers will face civil rights charges but no one will be
charged with murder in Faison's death, said Chuck Davis, a
spokesman for the state Attorney General's Office. A state
investigation concluded ''there was insufficient evidence to reach
a charge of homicide,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Faison's family members said at a news conference Wednesday they
still hope for more charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just so glad that the truth came out,'' said Faison's
stepmother, Sagirah Williams. ''They just murdered our son for no
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Indicted were Lt. Thomas Smith, 36, of Caldwell, who retired
last year; Officers Paul Carpinteri Jr., 36, of Orange; Andrew
Garth, 31, of Bloomfield; Tyrone Payton, 34, of Orange; and Brian
Smith, 30, of Orange. The Smiths are brothers.
</P>
<P>
   All five face a charge of conspiring to deprive Faison, 27, of
East Orange, of his civil rights. Payton faces three counts of
depriving Faison of civil rights, while each of the others face one
count of depriving Faison of his civil rights. Each count carries
up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were all freed on $100,000 bail after an initial
court appearance. Arraignments were scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Willis, Brian Smith's attorney, said the prosecution's
case rests on the testimony of two police officers whose stories
are inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were two guys who were flipped, and then flipped
again,'' Willis said of the informants.
</P>
<P>
   He would not name the officers, but said prosecutors were
looking for additional witnesses in the case as late as two weeks
ago. He said the case was long delayed because it is weak. He said
his client has turned down several offers to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   All five officers were present at Faison's arrest, where Payton
kicked Faison as he lay on the sidewalk, hands cuffed behind his
back, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Faison was unable to walk afterward, so Payton and Carpinteri
carried him to their police car and threw him in the back, after
which Thomas Smith and Garth struck Faison, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Faison was driven past a hospital to a back entrance of the
police station to conceal the beating and placed on the floor of
the station out of public view, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton pointed his service handgun at Faison's head, took money
from Faison's pockets and said it should be given to the mother of
the slain officer, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Smith then put pepper spray into Faison's mouth and nose
at point-blank range, the indictment said. Faison was then carried
up to the main floor of the station.
</P>
<P>
   Payton and Carpinteri prepared false reports to conceal what
happened, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Orange police said Faison, who had asthma, resisted
arrest, was subdued with pepper spray and later collapsed and died.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were suspended without pay. Orange Police Director
Donald F. Wactor expressed sympathy for the Faison family in a
statement and said the department ''will never condone the
mistreatment of any person and is committed to the fair and just
application of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Faison's father, Earl Williams, said it took a long time for the
indictments because the case involved police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police officers are a little above regular people,'' Williams
said. ''You just can't throw the book at them and expect for it to
hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   East Orange Police Sgt. DeLacy Davis, founder of Black Cops
Against Police Brutality, said his organization received threats
from police officers for supporting the Faison family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew that there were black police officers who knew the
truth and they did not divulge the truth,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Faison, an aspiring rap artist, was one of four men detained
following the shooting in which the killer was described as a black
male with a shaved head. Condell Woodson later confessed to the
crime and is serving a life prison sentence.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Campaign Scheme  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thai businesswoman Pauline Kanchanalak agreed
Wednesday to plead guilty to a scheme to illegally contribute more
than $690,000 to Democrats in return for access to President
Clinton and other officials, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement filed in U.S. District Court, she admitted using
accounts of her sister-in-law and mother-in-law to give more than
$457,000 to the Democratic National Committee and five state
Democratic committees in connection with a June 18, 1996, coffee at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended the coffee, as did Kanchanalak, two executives
of a Thai corporation known as the CP Group and John Huang, an
administration and Democratic party official. Last year, Huang
pleaded guilty to scheming to make campaign contributions with
funds from the Indonesia-based Lippo Group.
</P>
<P>
   Kanchanalak agreed to plead guilty to two counts, conspiracy to
cause false statements about donors to be made to the Federal
Election Commission and causing an illegal corporate contribution.
The government agreed to drop a more extensive indictment against
her.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the same plea bargain, Kanchanalak's sister-in-law
and business associate, Duangnet ''Georgie'' Kronenberg, agreed to
plead guilty to one count of causing a $10,000 illegal corporate
contribution to the Democratic National Committee in February 1996.
The government agreed to drop its existing indictment against her
and not to prosecute Kanchanalak's mother-in-law, Praitun
Kanchanalak.
</P>
<P>
   The government also agreed not to deport the two defendants as a
result of their guilty pleas, if they abide by the agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Kanchanalak and Kronenberg agreed to cooperate with the
continuing investigation of the Justice Department's campaign
financing task force. They are two of 25 people charged by the task
force since it was set up four years ago by Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Kanchanalak's attorney Reid Weingarten said the government had
vowed to bring money laundering charges against her and her family
''if a resolution was not negotiated.'' She ''was caught up first
in a political system that voraciously sought campaign
contributions and then in a political controversy about campaign
finance that demanded scapegoats,'' Weingarten added.
</P>
<P>
   Reno resisted pressure from Republicans on Capitol Hill, FBI
Director Louis J. Freeh and former task force chief Charles LaBella
to turn the investigation over to an independent counsel before the
law authorizing such counsels expired.
</P>
<P>
   Kanchanalak and Kronenberg were to enter their pleas Friday
before U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   Kanchanalak could face up to six years in prison and a fine of
$350,000.
</P>
<P>
   The government and her lawyers advised the court that her
conspiracy violation was aggravated by more than minimal planning,
by her own role and by her willful attempt to obstruct justice
during the investigation. It was mitigated in part by her
acceptance of responsibility in pleading guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Together, those elements translated to a recommended sentencing
level of 6 months to a year in prison, Justice Department officials
said. But Weingarten expected the judge ''to be in a position to
give her probation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kronenberg faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a
$100,000 fine. The government agreed not to seek any prison time
for her.
</P>
<P>
   Kronenberg's attorney Jim Hamilton said she ''is a homemaker, a
mother and a part-time employee who, as a result of her employment,
became involved in political matters she did not fully appreciate.
... Her plea to one misdemeanor is an acceptable conclusion to a
very unfortunate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are barred from political contributions. Also,
foreigners are barred from making either ''hard'' money
contributions to federal campaigns or ''soft'' money donations, not
intended for a particular campaign.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Convened in Lab Case  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A grand jury has been convened to look into
the two-month disappearance of nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos
weapons laboratory as the FBI focuses on ''a handful'' of
scientists, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Richardson said investigators have not found
any evidence suggesting the two computer drives containing the
information left the most secure area of the New Mexico lab, or
that espionage was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers remained unconvinced after hearing Richardson,
who spoke at a public session and then back-back closed-door
meetings with Senate committees.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were concerned secrets might have been compromised,
the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, ''We
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear there was a lack of accounting for a great period
of time,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Government computer experts continued to examine the drives
electronically to determine if information had been copied. The
FBI, seeking to learn who last handled the devices, was studying
fingerprints found on an external wrapping and on the drives.
</P>
<P>
   They are believed to have disappeared ''at the tail end of
March'' from a vault in the top-secret ''X Division'' at Los
Alamos. The drives were found last Friday behind a copying machine
in an area that had been thoroughly searched at least twice,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation ... has focused on a handful of X-Division
employees who have offered conflicting statements to
investigators,'' said Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury has been convened in New Mexico ''to examine issues
related to the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury is often empaneled when people under investigation
are giving conflicting or possibly deceptive statements, a Justice
Department official explained, requesting anonymity. The purpose is
to provide a forum before which they can be questioned under oath
and set up a situation where they face possible prosecution if they
lie.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the drives have not been compromised, those involved in
thee disappearance and mysterious reappearance could face felony
charges for mishandling nuclear secrets. Officials said DOE
regulations requiring any security breach to be reported within
eight hours were violated.
</P>
<P>
   A former Los Alamos nuclear scientist, Wen Ho Lee, is in jail
awaiting trial and could face a maximum of life in prison for
security violations. He was arrested in December and accused of
illegally copying top-secret nuclear weapons files while also
working in the X Division. The alleged copies of the files have not
been found.
</P>
<P>
   The latest security breach has unleashed particularly angry
rhetoric on Capitol Hill because the lapse follows repeated
assurances by Richardson that security was a top priority and that
America's nuclear secrets were safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've lost all credibility,'' Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
chairman of the Intelligence Committee, told Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe you are part of the problem. Look in the mirror,''
lectured Shelby, who has said Richardson should resign.
</P>
<P>
   At times combative and at other times subdued, Richardson
acknowledged the seriousness of the disappearance of the hard
drives -- even if there was no espionage -- and listed the steps he
has taken over the past year to tighten lab security.
</P>
<P>
   ''In two years I've done more on security than has been done in
the last 20 years,'' he told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   But they were in no mood for such explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers instead accused Richardson of trying for months to
sidestep a requirement from Congress last year that would put
nuclear weapons programs under a largely autonomous agency within
his department. They said this would streamline accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson contended the new agency was being given too much
independence; he staffed it with his own senior advisers. On
Wednesday -- under intense attack -- he said he was ready to accept
the agency as created.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Warner said he would soon introduce legislation to
look at whether an independent agency or the Defense Department
should take over the nuclear weapons programs, including the
research labs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Lieberman predicted that if security does not improve
and the administration does not give wide berth to the new nuclear
weapons agency, there will be strong bipartisan support for putting
the Pentagon in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really is the last chance,'' Lieberman, D-Conn., told
Richardson.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: $1T Increase in Surplus  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is preparing to announce a
mammoth $1 trillion increase in the administration's 10-year budget
surplus projection, and will propose using it for faster debt
reduction, beefed up Medicare benefits and deeper tax cuts,
Democrats say.
</P>
<P>
   The new forecast is expected to bring projected surpluses for
the decade ending in 2010 to $1.9 trillion, without counting Social
Security. That would more than double the $746 billion the White
House predicted in February, a deluge of cash fueled by the
formidable economy.
</P>
<P>
   A deep, long-lasting recession could make the projected
surpluses shrink or vanish. Nonetheless, with Treasury Department
figures showing that it has been collecting unexpected mountains of
revenue in recent months, the projected deluge of cash has been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it has already influenced election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting,
is using the bigger numbers to fend off Democratic arguments that
his plans for tax cuts and Social Security are irresponsible. And
Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic candidate, has
trotted out a parade of spending and tax-cut proposals that would
be financed from federal surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were refusing Wednesday to discuss the
announcement, which Clinton could make as early as Monday. But on
condition of anonymity, some congressional Democrats, lobbyists and
others discussed its general framework.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Tuesday he would use some of the surplus -- $40
billion over 10 years -- to boost Medicare reimbursements to
hospitals and other health care providers. Lawmakers say the
payments are aimed at restoring cuts made as part of the 1997
budget-balancing deal that went deeper than expected.
</P>
<P>
   But when he announces his new surplus figures, he will also
propose making his prescription drug plan for Medicare recipients
more generous.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they expect him to propose beginning a portion of
that plan aimed at helping people with catastrophic illnesses
earlier than expected. They said he might propose starting it in
2003, when his overall prescription plan would begin, instead of
2006, which he proposed in his fiscal 2001 budget in February.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's prescription drug plan would cost $149 billion over 10
years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. Clinton said
the catastrophic portion of it would cost $35 billion from 2006
through 2010, but he provided no details of how it would work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also endorse fencing off Medicare's projected
surpluses from use for spending or tax cuts. That idea is also
supported by Gore, and the House voted 420-2 Tuesday to do the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have routinely spent Medicare surpluses for other
purposes for decades. But now, surpluses have grown so large that
politicians have found there is enough money for spending and tax
cuts without using the Medicare funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also propose using a large portion of the new
surplus figure to move up the date by which he plans to eliminate
the $3.5 trillion publicly held portion of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   His budget envisioned eliminating that debt by 2013. The new
numbers will move up that date, perhaps to sometime within the next
decade, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall national debt is $5.7 trillion. The remaining $2.2
trillion is money the government owes its own trust funds, like
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also propose some extra spending for education and
other domestic programs, Democrats said, but not for fiscal 2001,
the year for which Congress is now writing spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   On the tax side, Democrats said Clinton will make his tax-cut
proposals bigger.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that, he is expected to eliminate some of the tax
increases he proposed in February to help pay for his budget
initiatives. Most of those proposed tax increases had virtually no
chance of being approved by Congress anyway, and dropping them will
let him boast a bigger net tax-cut figure.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Clinton proposed $351 billion in tax cuts over 10
years, as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office. It was
partly paid for with $205 billion in tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might also propose eliminating the 3 percent federal
excise tax on telephone tax. A measure phasing out the levy by 2002
passed the House last month by 420-2, at a five-year cost of $20
billion, underlining the idea's widespread popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed a $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut and letting
Social Security recipients invest part of their payroll taxes that
support the program in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor would not
use any of the additional money to beef up his tax cut or spending
proposals. Instead, he said Bush would use extra surpluses for debt
reduction and strengthening Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll stand by our plan,'' Fleischer said. ''Our plan is based
on cautious, conservative assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's recent spending and tax proposals have included a
10-year, $500 billion tax-cut package for child care, education and
other purposes; voluntary, tax-free retirement accounts financed
partly by federal payments; and new spending for the environment,
health and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the candidates choose to use it says a lot about what
kind of leader they would be,'' said Gore spokesman Douglas
Hattaway. He said Bush's tax cut ''primarily benefits the rich.''

<HEADLINE> EPA: Wholesale Gas Prices Drop  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesale gas prices in Chicago and Milwaukee
have dropped at least 25 cents a gallon over the last week but
prices at the pump increased, the head of the Environmental
Protection Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question we want answered is why, with these kinds of
reductions in wholesale prices, why are the consumers not seeing
the benefit?'' Carol Browner said after a Capitol Hill meeting
between lawmakers from six Midwestern states and oil company
executives. ''We're very disappointed the meeting did not produce
real answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale prices in Chicago fell from $1.60 a gallon on June 15
to $1.31 per gallon Wednesday, according to the EPA, citing figures
from OPIS Energy Group, a private company that tracks gas prices.
In Milwaukee, wholesale gas was $1.58 on June 15 and $1.33 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A gallon of regular unleaded gas was selling at an average of
$2.13 in Chicago and $2.02 in Milwaukee on Wednesday, the EPA said.
On June 15, drivers were paying $2.11 a gallon in Chicago and $2.01
in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The average for the nation on Wednesday was $1.64 a gallon,
according to AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cavaney, president and chairman of the American Petroleum
Institute, acknowledged after the meeting that wholesale prices are
going down. But he disputed the EPA figures, saying the decrease is
steeper and started a week sooner than the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said the wholesale price drop appeared to coincide with
the Clinton administration's call for an investigation into
possible price gouging and collusion by the oil companies. The
Federal Trade Commission told lawmakers Tuesday it has begun a
formal inquiry into the situation in the Midwest and plans to issue
subpoenas by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows that it is not cleaner gasoline that is the
problem,'' Browner said. ''I think we have some very poor
management going on and there's some unfair treatment of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavaney insisted oil companies are not at fault for the high
prices in parts of the Midwest. Instead, he blamed ''a whole set of
unique circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is working. The prices are falling,'' Cavaney said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not predict when the lower wholesale prices
would begin to show up at the pump, saying those are individual
business decisions the oil companies cannot control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of this process is keeping the pressure on,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who convened the meeting. ''The
good news is that there is a drop in spot prices in Chicago. We
would hope we would see a drop in retail prices very, very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other Republicans again pressed Browner to relieve
supply problems they say are caused by complications in refining a
newly required cleaner-burning gasoline, especially when ethanol is
used in the blend, as it is in Chicago and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol, made from corn and subsidized by a federal tax break,
burns cleaner than other fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The federal pollution reduction program requires cleaner fuel in
areas with severe summer ozone problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and the other lawmakers, along with the governors of
Illinois and Wisconsin, want Browner to suspend the new rules to
give refiners flexibility and possibly increase available stocks,
which would drive down prices.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said such a move could hurt more than it would help.
</P>
<P>
   ''To go back to something that's not in stock, that's not being
made, could cause more disruptions,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Two more indicted in Central Park attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A grand jury has indicted three more young men
on charges of taking part in attacks on dozens of women last Sunday
in Central Park, a Manhattan prosecutor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal said the three were
charged with first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree riot. The
defendants face up to seven years in prison if convicted on the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Court Judge Cynthia Kern released Julio de la Cruz, 22,
of North Bergen, N.J., who posted $25,000 bail, and kept Isaiah
Forbes, 18, of Queens, jailed on $20,000 bail. She set July 10 as
their next court date.
</P>
<P>
   The third indicted defendant Trevor Britton, 29, of Brooklyn,
was not in court. He is jailed on $20,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The three indictments make a total of eight men charged by the
grand jury in connection with the assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defendants, Leslie Marcano, 19, of the Bronx, and Mark
Daniels, 21, of Irvington, N.J., appeared but Rosenthal said the
district attorney's office had not asked the grand jury to take any
action in their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said city parole officials asked her office to hold
Marcano for them. As for Daniels' case, Rosenthal said only that
the investigation of his case is continuing. Kern released Daniels
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police announced the arrests of three more suspects
in connection with the park assaults, bringing to 20 the number
charged in the June 11 attacks on women by several packs of men.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of women have told police they were doused with water,
chased, stripped, molested or assaulted. On Monday, four more women
reported that they were sexually abused, bringing the number of
known victims to 53.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14 of the women also said they were the victims of
robberies or attempted robberies, and at least four women have
declared that they intend to sue the city on the grounds that
police failed to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police Department is
conducting an internal investigation into allegations that some
officers ignored pleas for help. He has warned that police officers
could be fired if the investigation finds that the allegations are
true.

<HEADLINE> Cherry Hill rabbi held without bail in murder-for-hire of wife  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Rabbi Fred Neulander, accused of having his
wife killed so he could carry on an affair, was taken to jail
Wednesday, where he will await his trial and a possible death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, through his attorney, pleaded innocent to charges of
capital murder, felony murder and conspiracy before Superior Court
Judge Linda G. Rosenzweig.
</P>
<P>
   The judge then revoked his bail, saying, ''If anything creates
an incentive to flee, it is the prospect of the death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenzweig also said she considered the evidence, guilty pleas
by two men who said the rabbi paid them $30,000 to kill his wife
and an 84-page statement by one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the judge adjourned the hearing, Neulander
stood, talked briefly with one of his attorneys, then was
handcuffed and led out of the courtroom. He did not look back.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to the Camden County Jail, said Dennis Wixted, one
of his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the rabbi was free on $400,000 bail on lesser
charges filed against him in 1998. A Camden County grand jury
indicted him on the more serious charges Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Neulander, 52, was beaten to death with a metal pipe on
Nov. 1, 1994, in the Cherry Hill home she shared with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance of the rabbi, Leonard Jenoff, 54, of
Collingswood, came forward in April and confessed to Camden County
Prosecutor Lee Solomon, saying he felt remorse about Mrs.
Neulander's death.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff pleaded guilty June 1 to aggravated manslaughter. His
alleged accomplice, Paul Daniels, 27, of Pennsauken, pleaded guilty
a week later to aggravated manslaughter and robbery. Jenoff and
Daniels have said they will testify against Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said in making her decision, she took into
consideration their confessions, which she called ''unequivocal,
unhesitating.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the judge issued her ruling, Neulander attorney Jeffrey
Zucker asked her to consider either keeping the bail at $400,000,
increasing it, or allowing the rabbi to remain at home under
electronic monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   He said Neulander has shown no inclination to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never indicated a desire to run, to flee, to do anything
but have his day in court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Neulanders' three children, Rebecca, Benjamin and Matthew,
were in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Mrs. Neulander's brother, Ed Lidz, of
Montville, issued the family's first public statement since the
killing. Lidz said he and his brother and sister have refrained
from speaking out of deference to the children.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''now that the evidence has become so
overwhelming,'' he thought it appropriate to issue a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an obvious understatement to say Carol's murder was the
most devastating event in all our lives,'' he said. ''There hasn't
been a day since Nov. 1, 1994, that we haven't thought of Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   Lidz said he and his brother and sister supported prosecutors in
their bid to have the rabbi jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the very beginning, we as a family have sought only two
things - justice and closure,'' Lidz said. ''Maybe, just maybe,
we're finally getting to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's attorneys said they are considering asking that the
rabbi's trial be held somewhere other than Camden County because of
the extensive publicity the case has received.
</P>
<P>
   James Lynch, assistant Camden County prosecutor, said his office
would not object to that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make sure this gentleman gets a fair trial,'' Lynch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said the attorneys also will consider appealing the
revocation of bail for Neulander. But, he said, ''He'll make the
best of it. He expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, a seventh-generation rabbi, could become the first
New Jersey clergyman and one of only a few in the country to face
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Willie ''Saleem'' Clayton, a Muslim minister in
Philadelphia, was sentenced to die for fatally shooting two men in
1980. Clayton is still on Pennsylvania's death row.
</P>
<P>
   A former minister of the Covenant Church in Alabama could have
faced the death penalty, but was sentenced to life in prison
without parole in 1998 for murdering a man with the help of the
man's wife, with whom the minister was romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   A non-denominational minister in Florida also could have been
executed, but was sentenced to life in prison in 1996 after
pleading guilty to strangling an elderly couple who suspected he
had stolen thousands of dollars from them.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Neulander, 58, wanted his wife killed so he
could continue having an affair with Philadelphia radio personality
Elaine Soncini. They said he thought that divorce would jeopardize
his position as senior rabbi at Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue
in Cherry Hill, which he founded with his wife in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned three months after his wife was killed, though,
after reports surfaced about two extramarital affairs he had
allegedly had with members of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander spoke in court only to tell the judge that he had
reviewed the aggravating factors.

<HEADLINE> Braille Harry Potter Books Coming  </HEADLINE>
By MARK PRATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The eagerly awaited next book in the Harry Potter
series will be released in Braille just weeks after the print
version -- instead of the usual several months -- in what is sure to
delight blind children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait for it,'' said Andrew Harmon, a 14-year-old from
New Hampton, N.H., who is blind. ''I love the fantasy stuff,
especially the magic. The words put me into the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the blind would have to read the next adventures of
wizard-in-training Harry Potter much later than everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Braille Press in Boston will work a little
magic of its own and rush out a version within two to three weeks
of the July 8 release of the print version.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean Karl Belanger, 12, of Dover, N.H., won't have to
bug his mom to read it to him, and it will allow him to talk about
the book with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the other books, sometimes I heard my friends talking
about them, and I would say 'Ooh, I wish I had this,''' Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Day of Bellingham, Wash., who has two blind children and
runs a Web site that offers resources for parents and teachers of
the blind, said some children's books take a year to come out in
Braille. ''This is just unheard of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit National Braille Press wanted to release the
Braille version of the new book simultaneously, but Scholastic, the
print version's publisher, refused to give out advance copies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a good working relationship with Scholastic that goes
back about 10 years, but they wouldn't even let us have an advance
copy to work with,'' said Diane Croft, director of publishing and
marketing at the National Braille Press.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic spokeswoman Chris Moran said the company was
complying with author J.K. Rowling's wishes by not providing any
advance copies of the print edition.
</P>
<P>
   Also in compliance with the author's request, Moran would not
release the name of the new book. The Braille organization's Web
site said it was ''Harry Potter and The Doomspell Tournament,'' but
Moran said that was only a working title.
</P>
<P>
   The Harry Potter books have been credited with getting many
children interested in reading. The series is so popular, many
bookstores plan to be open just after midnight on July 8 to
accommodate the stampede expected for the release of the fourth
book.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Charlson, a librarian at the Perkins School for the Blind in
Watertown, a Boston suburb, said the school library will stock at
least 10 Braille copies of the newest book.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have six to 10 copies of the other Potter books and there's
still a waiting list,'' Charlson said. ''As soon as they finish
one, they come in asking for the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braille version can be ordered from the National Braille
Press by calling 1-800-548-732 or on the Web site at www.nbp.org.
It is offered for $20 on the Web site, below the $25.95 retail
price.

<HEADLINE> Turmoil in Fiji Likely To Linger  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's new military rulers and the gunmen
holding the deposed government hostage said Wednesday they expected
a prompt end to the standoff -- but an end to ethnic turmoil looked
anything but imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini told local TV
Wednesday that negotiators are the ''closest we have come'' to
freeing deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 30 members of
his government who have been held hostage in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see no reason why it cannot happen by this weekend,''
Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   But with Fiji's economy in a tailspin, its ethnic Indian
minority living in fear and the threat of international sanctions
looming, no one expects the South Pacific nation to recover easily
from its break with democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Failed businessman George Speight, the leader of the gunmen who
stormed parliament and took the government hostage on May 19, said
Wednesday that he expects to release the hostages by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He and the army, which assumed power 10 days after the raid on
parliament, have been talking for four days about the makeup of an
interim government that would lead to new elections within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Already offered is an amnesty for Speight, who admitted on
Wednesday that he fears reprisals from the Indian minority once the
standoff is over.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry was the nation's first prime minister of Indian
descent, and the coup against him has been accompanied by
widespread attacks on Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I dare say that the majority of the Indian population is going
to carry some scars and some pain for quite some time,'' said
Speight, who has been demanding that Fijians of Indian descent be
stripped of political power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to be smart about it and take the necessary
precautions,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his followers said their armed takeover of
parliament was meant to restore dignity to the Fijian majority,
whose rights, they said, had been trampled upon by an arrogant
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict, however, has as much to do with power and
privilege as Fijian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Speight is a front man for Fijians who lost their
ability to make sweetheart deals under Chaudhry, especially in the
country's lucrative timber and sugar industries.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the standoff is likely to take a heavy toll on
the tropical island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Australia and New Zealand have said they will
impose sanctions on Fiji, a cluster of islands 2,250 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia, if it does not return to full
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Already lost are millions of dollars a day in tourism revenue,
Fiji's sizable garment industry has been hurt, and many sugar
growers sympathetic to Chaudhry are boycotting this year's harvest
until the hostages are released.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the economic woes is the fact that many Indo-Fijians,
who make up about 44 percent of the population of 812,000 and who
control much of the commerce, are leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are bracing in our embassy for long lines of Indo-Fijians
asking for visas,'' U.S. Ambassador Osman Siddique said.
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians shopped side by side at the
main vegetable market in Suva, the capital, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old Indian vendor, Salesh Deo, said he would like to
leave because of the tensions, but he believes most people here are
not racist.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really, they are good people,'' he said of his indigenous
countrymen.

<HEADLINE> Camden man convicted of shooting Heisman winner Rozier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A Camden man has been convicted of attempted
murder in connection with the shooting of Heisman Trophy winner
Mike Rozier and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Pierce, 39, also was convicted Tuesday on gun charges in
state Superior Court in Camden County. Assistant Camden County
Prosecutor Victoria Pinette said she would seek life in prison for
Pierce when he is sentenced July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Rozier, 36, of Camden, was shot twice in the stomach and once in
the hand while drinking in a Camden neighborhood on Nov. 7, 1996,
police said. His friend, Bart Merrill, 37, also of Camden, also was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said Merrill and Pierce had argued previously, and
on the night of the shooting Pierce pulled out a handgun. Rozier
intervened, trying either to take the gun away or talk Pierce into
putting it away.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce fled to Maryland and was arrested a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill was shot to death in December 1998 in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   As a 5-10, 198-pounder senior, Rozier ran for 2,148 yards at
Nebraska and scored 29 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Rozier won the Heisman as a running back at Nebraska in 1983.
The No. 1 draft pick in 1984, Rozier played with the now-defunct
USFL Pittsburgh Maulers before joining the Houston Oilers in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Rozier retired after he was waived by the Atlanta Falcons in
1992. In seven NFL seasons, Rozier had 1,159 carries for 4,462
yards and 30 touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Egyptian Leaders Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- The Iranian and Egyptian presidents spoke by
telephone in the first direct contact between the leaders of the
two states since the time of Iran's Islamic revolution, the
official Iranian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak congratulated Mohammad Khatami
on Iran's accession to the G-15 group of nations, the Islamic
Republic News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak expressed the hope that relations between Iran and Egypt
would further develop, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Iran and Egypt broke relations in 1979 after the new Islamic
government in Tehran condemned Egypt's peace treaty with Israel
that year. Relations also deteriorated because Egypt gave refuge to
the ousted Iranian shah, who died in Egypt in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak was host chairman of the G-15 summit that admitted Iran
to the group of developing nations from Africa, Asia and Latin
America. The two-day summit finished in Cairo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami said Iran and Egypt are two large countries with ancient
civilizations that helped form Islamic civilization and he hoped
they would try to strengthen their relations, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Recently relations have begun to improve, but there are still
obstacles on the road to full normalization.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt insists that Iran must rename a street in Tehran that is
named after Khaled al-Islambouli, a Muslim militant army officer
who assassinated Egypt's President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Iran continues to object to Egypt's peace treaty and dealings
with Israel, a country that Iran sees as evil and an enemy of
Islam.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate fended off efforts Wednesday to
scale back President Clinton's package of anti-narcotics assistance
to Colombia, giving new life to a measure that has languished for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Senators demonstrated strong support for the plan, which
contains $934 million for Colombia, as they worked toward passage
of a foreign aid bill for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval of the overall $13.4 billion foreign aid bill was
expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Colombia money would go toward training special
counter-narcotics battalions in the Colombian military and for
dozens of American-made helicopters for transporting troops and
drug surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   It would help the Colombian military combat left-wing guerrilla
and right-wing paramilitary groups that are protecting cocaine and
heroin traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed the Colombia anti-narcotics money, but as
part of another piece of legislation. It has not yet taken up its
version of the foreign aid bill.
</P>
<P>
   The overall foreign aid bill is $1.7 billion less than Clinton
had requested in foreign aid, drawing strong complaints -- but no
veto threats -- from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been pressing Congress to complete work
on the Colombia funds for months.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate turned back two attempts to reduce the package.
</P>
<P>
   On a 89-11 vote, it rejected a move by Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., to chop $225 million and spend it instead on domestic drug
treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone argued that the measure could drag the United States
into a lengthy, Vietnam-style military quagmire. ''It would be a
tragic mistake for us to get involved in this civil war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Senate rejected 79-19 a proposal by Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., that would have cut all but $200 million of the money.
''Let's not get into another new armed conflict,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the spending was
in the national interest. Colombia ''is in our neighborhood. The
drugs that are coming out of Colombia are going right into the
United States,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism on Capitol Hill was fueled by the human rights record
of the Colombian Army and a suspicion of links between the army and
paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote, the Senate adopted an amendment by Sen. Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., that would release the money only after the
administration certified in writing that it ''supports the military
and political efforts of the government of Colombia'' to resolve
conflicts with both the guerrillas and paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted earlier this year to provide $1.7 billion in
anti-narcotics aid for Colombia over a two year period. The Senate
bill only covers the first year.
</P>
<P>
   On another Latin American issue, House leaders worked to try to
resolve a deadlock on an agriculture spending bill caused by a
dispute over efforts to ease sanctions on Cuba to permit sales of
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed such a measure last year, and the House
Appropriations Committee recently endorsed such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-Castro forces thus far have kept the entire agriculture
bill from coming to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders have said that, generally, they would support some
easing of the sanctions. A Tuesday night bargaining session failed
to resolve all outstanding issues, leadership aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This stew ain't ready to serve yet,'' said John Feehery, a
spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert. He said that ''some
significant issues'' remained unresolved even though, ''We want to
try to bring people together'' on the divisive issue.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Vieques War Games Planned  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. Navy on Saturday plans to
launch its biggest Vieques war games since a bombing accident last
year, but a Puerto Rican agency is insisting it has the final say
on whether bombs will fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy notice -- published as an ''environmental assessment''
in local newspapers Wednesday -- said the exercises would begin
Saturday, and came as the USS George Washington Battle Group,
carrying 15,000 sailors and Marines, began deploying from Norfolk,
Va., for a six-month tour of the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Several ships attached to the battle group and warplanes will
train in the outlying Puerto Rican island for two to six days
before joining the George Washington, according to a notice sent to
Puerto Rican authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had hoped to begin on Wednesday what would be the
largest exercise since a civilian security guard was killed by two
stray 500-pound bombs in April 1999, sparking a frenzy of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1983 accord in which Puerto Rico's government pledged
to keep Navy training plans secret, the local Planning Board
released documents this week detailing the proposed exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The board insists it must approve training, and it set a public
comment period that expires Friday. It was awaiting responses from
state and federal agencies on environmental concerns, said
spokeswoman Ivelisse Prado. Gov. Pedro Rossello, however, said he
believed the board had no power to decide when the Navy can use
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of U.S. religious groups, including the National Council
of Churches and the United Church of Christ, denounced the planned
bombing and urged President Clinton to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican activists also pledged to prevent it -- but refused
to say how. ''We are returning to the fight against the Navy,''
declared Vieques resident Ismael Guadalupe, who is being tried a
second time in federal court for trespassing on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques islanders blame decades of bombing for environmental
damage, stunted tourism, and what they say is a high cancer rate.
After the accident, protesters occupied the training ground until
federal officials evicted them last month. Dozens have since been
arrested on the range.
</P>
<P>
   As many as five ships from the Washington Battle Group will fire
up to 600 inert rounds onto the range. Aircraft will launch and
drop as many as 550 laser-guided rounds and dummy bombs, the Navy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing won't significantly harm the environment, it said --
a claim disputed by activists such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who
was barred Sunday from collecting soil samples from the range for a
planned lawsuit against the Navy. Kennedy argued Tuesday that the
Navy could bomb elsewhere and that its Vieques exercises were
''obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect his passion on the subject,'' Cmdr. Brian Cullin,
spokesman for Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, told The Associated
Press Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''But to make the case that we have not done well with the
environment is not a good case. I feel strongly about this: He has
a family that has done extraordinary things in the armed forces,
and this is a disservice to that fine record.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy responded: ''I'm proud of my family's military history.
I come from a naval family and I love the United States Navy and
that's one of the reasons I want them to stop this activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy insists Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet
can hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad -- training that saves countless lives.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy argued the Navy actually carries out amphibious
landings, bombing and shelling in different areas of the range.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton ordered the Navy to use dummy bombs instead
of live munitions and to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if the
island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum expected
next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions again.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Injures Two in Belfast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Police arrested a man Wednesday
in connection with an explosion that injured a father and son in a
Catholic area of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the blast was not immediately clear, though
Northern Ireland's police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
said it had ruled out a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   An RUC spokesman said a 30-year-old man was being questioned in
connection with the explosion behind a house in the west Belfast
neighborhood of Ballymurphy.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came one day after the Ulster Freedom Fighters,
Northern Ireland's largest pro-British paramilitary group,
threatened to break its six-year cease-fire at midnight. The
outlawed group had accused Catholic groups of waging a campaign of
intimidation against Protestants living in north and west Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Tension in the neighborhood is high in advance of a parade by
the Protestant Orange Order in the neighboring Upper Springfield
Road district on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The RUC said the blast occurred in a garden shed. The two men
hurt in the explosion were a father and his adult son, both of whom
suffered head injuries. Their conditions were not known.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb disposal experts were examining the shed to try to pinpoint
the cause of the explosion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate candidate from New York visits Baltimore's Little Italy </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) - The newest candidate in the nation's
most-watched U.S. Senate race sought support far from his New York
home on Wednesday, and was greeted like a rock star by those among
his small but devoted band of admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, he is handsome,'' sighed Rosemary Medura as U.S. Rep. Rick
Lazio stepped out of a sport-utility vehicle in Baltimore's Little
Italy neighborhood. ''I hope he beats her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio took a walking tour of Little Italy on Wednesday evening
with a House colleague, U.S. Rep. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a
three-term Republican from Baltimore County.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers are described as good friends who were
planning to share a Washington apartment until Lazio entered the
Senate race last month against First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio is a super guy and one of my best friends in
Congress,'' Ehrlich wrote in the invitation for the Little Italy
event. ''This race is a dead heat, and he needs all of our help to
bring his character and integrity to the U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion, shows Clinton and Lazio each favored by 42 percent of
voters. Sixteen percent of the registered voters surveyed were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, Ehrlich and their entourage paraded through several
blocks of Little Italy, stopping at Vaccaro's Italian Pastry shop,
making an appearance at Sabatino's Italian Restaurant and taking a
picture with a white-aproned employee of Aldo's Ristorante
Italiano.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Lazio was visiting Baltimore when he has a tight
schedule and a lot of campaigning to do, Lazio said, ''A lot of
people wanted to meet me and support me. A lot of them have
relatives back in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also said concerns about high taxes, education and the
quality of health care are universal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think whether you're in Baltimore or New York, a lot of
these concerns are the same concerns,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Italy tour was more than a way for Lazio to revisit
his Italian roots. An Ehrlich press aide said the accompanying
reception at Aldo's was a $500-a-plate fund-raiser, expected to
raise a total of $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of Maryland's most prominent Democrats, Comptroller William
Donald Schaefer, lent his considerable presence to Lazio's Little
Italy visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just happened to be walking by,'' the former governor and
Baltimore mayor joked. ''I saw this crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Schaefer added, ''I like the way he campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously unpredictable comptroller endorsed Republican
George Bush in 1992 against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the congressmen strolled down the street, several
neighborhood residents bounded out of their rowhouses to shake
hands with Lazio. Others stood along the street, holding signs
declaring their support.
</P>
<P>
   Matilda Chiparelli stood holding a sign reading ''Anybody but
Hillary - Go Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I was in New York so I could vote against her,''
Chiparelli said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLD LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- A U.S. pilot parachuted to safety
Wednesday before his fighter jet crashed in northeastern Alberta,
Canadian military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot managed to eject before his F-16 slammed into the
ground during a training exercise near Canada's Cold Lake air base.
</P>
<P>
   Base spokeswoman Capt. Leah Wilson said the pilot had just minor
injuries and was walking around after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time we don't know what led to the pilot ejecting,''
she said. ''Presently our priority is to insure his safety and
bring him back home and secure the crash site.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's name and base were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The jet was taking part in a month-long military exercise that
involves aircraft from several countries.

<HEADLINE> Accused faints at alcohol death trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AVON, N.Y. (AP) - The woman accused of providing the alcohol
that killed a 20-year-old man collapsed Wednesday as her trial got
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Welch, 40, is charged with second-degree manslaughter in
connection with the July 1999 death of Joseph Kingsbury, who died
from alcohol poisoning after a high school graduation party at
Welch's house.
</P>
<P>
   Police say she provided alcohol to minors at the party at her
Avon home 20 miles south of Rochester. Police say she also
encouraged Kingsbury to drink, at the high school graduation party.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury was found unconscious the morning after the party and
was later was pronounced dead at a Rochester hospital. Autopsy
results showed Kingsbury had a .44 percent blood alcohol level when
he died - more than four times the legal limit for driving.
</P>
<P>
   Reports said Welch collapsed in the judge's chambers Wednesday
while in the middle of a plea bargain that would have prevented the
need for a trial altogether. The manslaughter charge carries a
maximum sentence of 15 years in prison upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was not told of the collapse.

<HEADLINE> 'Liberation War' in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOORA, Zimbabwe (AP) -- With parliamentary elections looming,
President Robert Mugabe ventured to this rural outpost Wednesday
and claimed his opponents wanted to restore white rule in this
southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has consistently dwelled on race during the heated
campaign, though whites account for less than 1 percent of the
population and have played only a small role in politics since the
country received independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole countryside, all the farms, are ours, not the
whites','' Mugabe told about 8,000 cheering supporters in the rural
town of Goora, 90 miles north of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The president reiterated his plan to seize the country's 4,000
white farms after the elections beginning Saturday, calling it
Zimbabwe's last ''liberation war.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a black man's country. All others may be settlers, may
be residents, but they cannot be our rulers,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the head of the European Union observer mission
expressed concern about reports of violence and intimidation
preceding the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Violence and intimidation have no place in a democratic
election campaign (and) should be condemned,'' Pierre Schori told
reporters in the southeastern city of Bulawayo. ''We all want to
see a democratic and prosperous Zimbabwe play its rightful role
here in Africa and in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a U.S. government spokesman described Zimbabwe's
move to ban diplomats from observing the elections as an
''outrageous step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwean government announced Tuesday that no members of
non-governmental organizations or diplomats based in Zimbabwe would
be accredited as observers in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman Phil Reeker said the
restrictions ''will detract from the credibility of the elections''
and that is going to ''further tarnish Zimbabwe's reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe is not up for re-election until 2002, and his ruling
party and its allies control 147 of the 150 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   However, the main opposition, the Movement for Democratic
Change, has capitalized on popular discontent with the country's
enfeebled economy. The group has mounted the first serious
opposition to Mugabe's 20-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   To combat soaring inflation, Mugabe promised the government
would reinstate price controls for certain staple goods, such as
cornmeal. But he also said the government would raise the price it
pays for corn to help small farmers cope.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how his cash-strapped government would be able
to carry out both moves simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen white farmers attended the rally and donated tons
of grain that was to be distributed afterward. Several farmers said
they had received threats from ruling party militants who have
occupied more than 1,600 farms nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the militants have been staging rallies on their
land, the farmers said, though the property was not being occupied
full-time.

<HEADLINE> Yellow cloud from refinery drifts over South Philadelphia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A yellow cloud of gritty material from an
oil refinery blanketed South Philadelphia on Wednesday evening,
causing a lot of burning eyes and coughing, but company officials
said it posed no threat to residents.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow-brown dust began pouring from the Sunoco refinery
beginning shortly after 3 p.m. after a crude oil processor in one
of the plant's units malfunctioned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The processor was using a sandy substance that is used to break
down crude oil, said Jerry Davis, spokesman for Philadelphia-based
Sunoco. That material being vented into the air would cause some
discomfort, but was not harmful or toxic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly it's not something that people need to be concerned
about as regards health effects,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunoco and Philadelphia firefighters said people with
respiratory problems were advised to close their windows and to
contact emergency officials if they had trouble breathing.
Officials in Delaware County and in New Jersey were also notified,
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people called news organizations to report burning
eyes or respiratory problems from the smoke.

<HEADLINE> Navy jet crash victim mourned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - Squadron mates and relatives gathered
Wednesday in a packed chapel and heralded Lt. William Joseph Dey as
a born leader, ace pilot and good husband.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old pilot from Hightstown, N.J., died Sunday in the
crash of his F-14 Tomcat jet at an air show at Willow Grove Naval
Air Station near Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The radar intercept officer in the back seat of the jet, Lt.
David Erick Bergstrom, 31, of Annandale, Va., also was killed. A
memorial service for Bergstrom is scheduled for Friday in the same
chapel at Oceana Naval Air Station, where both men were instructors
in Fighter Squadron 101.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can think of no higher honor than to tell you what I think
of Dey,'' said Cmdr. Joseph Aucoin, who had commanded Dey overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Dey was a leader all his life - in sports, in school and then in
the Navy, Aucoin said. Dey would best his fellow aviators in the
air, then during debriefings afterward ''would show us how he had
humbled us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Brian Fleisher recalled a time when Dey and squadron mates
were on a break from duty in Kosovo. They rented a villa in Greece,
and Dey persuaded his comrades to leave the pool and climb a hill
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time he did something, he had to have an injury,
something to remember it by,'' Fleisher said. ''It wouldn't be an
outing if he didn't pick up a scar.''
</P>
<P>
   Dey's widow, Deborah, remembered him as a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a little girl, you dream of the man you're going to
marry,'' and Dey was that man, said Mrs. Dey, who had been at the
air show on Saturday, her fifth wedding anniversary. She and their
18-month-old daughter left Sunday to return to Virginia and did not
witness the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''He once gave me a little plaque that said 'Happiness is being
married to your best friend,' and he was it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, two sailors folded the American flag
draping Dey's casket and handed it to his widow as a lone trumpeter
played ''Taps.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone then filed out of the church and stood outside as four
Navy jets flew overhead in tribute, with one jet pulling away to
symbolize the lost pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of spectators saw Sunday's crash. Investigators said
the F-14 banked sharply, sheared trees and plunged to the ground
just outside the air station's boundary, bursting into flames. The
cause of the crash has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Dey graduated from the Naval Academy in 1992, then went into the
aviator training pipeline. He graduated from Fighter Squadron 101,
the Tomcats' training squadron, in October 1996 and was assigned to
Fighter Squadron 41.
</P>
<P>
   While deployed with the Norfolk-based carrier Theodore Roosevelt
as a member of Fighter Squadron 41, he flew combat missions in
Kosovo and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred back to Fighter Squadron as an instructor last
October.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Awards Medals of Honor  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 55 years after World War II ended, 22
Asian-American veterans received the nation's top honor for bravery
on the battlefield. ''Their motto was 'Go for broke!' President
Clinton told them in a somber White House ceremony. ''They risked
it all to win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven living veterans -- one hobbling on a single crutch, others
stooped with age -- walked to the center of a stage under a tent on
the White House South Lawn and faced the current commander in
chief. After a story was read about their heroism, Clinton leaned
over and secured a blue ribbon around their necks, the golden
Medals of Honor dangling on their chests.
</P>
<P>
   ''They risked their lives above and beyond the call of duty and
in doing so, they did more than defend America,'' Clinton said.
''In the face of painful prejudice, they helped to define America
at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives accepted framed medallions for the remaining 15 Medal
of Honor recipients who have died.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the 22 veterans were members of the 100th
Infantry Battalion or 442nd Regimental Combat Team, volunteer units
that saw fierce combat and were among the most decorated units in
U.S. military history. Members of the units received more than
18,000 individual decorations, but only one received the Medal of
Honor.
</P>
<P>
   A prevailing climate of racial prejudice against Asian Pacific
Americans during World War II prevented them from being awarded the
military's top honor, said Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, who has
worked for years to get them recognized.
</P>
<P>
   After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941,
Japanese-Americans in the U.S. military were forced to surrender
their weapons, Clinton said. An executive order authorized military
commanders to force more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans onto buses
and trains and into camps where they lived in tar paper barracks
behind barbed wire, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, the Army recommended against the formation of a combat
unit of Japanese-Americans because of the ''universal distrust in
which they are held,'' Clinton said. But a few months later,
President Roosevelt authorized the unit saying ''Americanism is a
matter of the mind and heart'' not race or ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known of the 22 heroes is Akaka's colleague, Sen.
Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who lost his right arm in combat in Italy.
After struggling to secure the medallion around Inouye's neck,
Clinton grasped the senator's left arm and patted him on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice against Japanese-Americans was slow to ebb, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back from the war as a highly decorated soldier, Inouye tried to
get a haircut, but was told: ''We don't cut Jap hair,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As Captain Inouye said later, 'I was tempted to break up the
place,''' the president said. ''But he had already done all the
fighting he needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one of the veterans have received the Distinguished
Service Cross, the second-highest military award. In 1996 the
Congress authorized the Army to review the records of the 104 Asian
American veterans of World War II awarded the Distinguished Service
Cross and determine if some deserved to be upgraded to Medals of
Honor.
</P>
<P>
   At Akaka's request, the Army approved a request in May to
upgrade the Silver Star given to James K. Okubo to the Medal of
Honor. The House and Senate approved it last week and Clinton
signed legislation Tuesday -- in time for Okuba, a medic in the
European theater, to receive the medal, posthumously, at the White
House ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Polls Vary in Mexico Elections  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two new polls Wednesday showed Mexico's July
2 presidential election too close to call, while a third indicated
an opposition candidate was well on his way toward ending the
ruling party's 71-year lock on power.
</P>
<P>
   The election is seen as one of the most competitive in Mexican
history, with ruling-party candidate Francisco Labastida and
center-right opposition candidate Vicente Fox in a tight race.
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of a leftist party is running a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted by a political consulting firm and a private
Mexican university, 42 percent of respondents supported Labastida,
compared with 38.5 percent for Fox and 18 percent for Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   That survey, which questioned 1,800 people between Thursday and
Monday, had a 2.5 percent margin of error -- making the results a
statistical dead heat between Labastida and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a statistical tie in a poll conducted by Zogby
International for the Reuters news agency, in which 43.6 percent of
respondents planned to vote for Labastida while 40.7 percent were
for Fox. Cardenas had 14.5 percent. The poll interviewed 1,330
people from June 10-18 and had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Another poll, conducted by former ruling-party pollster Maria de
las Heras, gave Fox a surprising 44 percent of the vote compared
with 34 percent for Labastida and 16 percent for Cardenas. The
poll, which questioned 2,054 people between June 10-15, had a 2.5
percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   All three polls were taken in people's homes. Polls conducted by
telephone in Mexico are considered to be less reliable because only
a third of Mexicans have phones.
</P>
<P>
   But home surveys tend to favor ruling parties in emerging
democracies, because people fear government retaliation for an
opposition vote, one pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are inhibited against speaking against the government
in a home setting,'' said Rob Allyn, part of a U.S. team hired by
Mexican businessmen to conduct exit polls during the election.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, prosecutors said Wednesday they have
received 325 complaints of election violations in the race -- most
filed by opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Patino, Mexico's special prosecutor for electoral crimes,
confirmed prosecutors are investigating a complaint by workers at
the state oil monopoly that executives used company information and
resources to support the ruling party.

Ottawa To Abolish Job Fund
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government has decided to abolish the
scandal-plagued Canada Jobs Fund and channel future job creation
spending through other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The move, to be announced today, will take political
responsibility for job initiatives away from embattled Human
Resources Minister Jane Stewart and parcel it out among several
cabinet colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It was less clear, as officials put the finishing touches on the
strategy Wednesday, whether it would mean a fundamental reform in
the way projects are funded.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told The Canadian Press that $110 million budgeted
annually for the jobs fund will be redistributed to four existing
regional development agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cash may still be awarded as non-repayable grants to
businesses and community organizations in areas of high
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But some could be redirected to repayable loans or other kinds
of programs.

Leadership Candidate Wants Alliance Vote Delayed
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Alliance leadership hopeful Tom Long apologized
Wednesday for membership manipulations by his Quebec organizers,
but a fellow candidate says the weekend vote is hopelessly tainted
and should be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's really unfortunate is that these events taint the
process for everybody across the country, all the candidates and
all the members,'' Keith Martin, a Canadian Alliance MP and
leadership long shot, told The Canadian Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sad thing is the Alliance came into being to turn our
backs on this old-style of slimy politicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, a longtime backroom organizer for Ontario Conservatives,
was forced to change course and apologize after days of brazening
out the controversy with explanations of aggressive campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   He called a news conference to say he was ''embarrassed and
angry'' about revelations of widespread membership buying in
Quebec's Gaspe region, people signed up without their knowledge and
others receiving unsolicited membership cards that weren't in their
names.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Monday, Long defended his camp's tactic of buying
$10 memberships for new recruits, saying it was no different than
offering free newspaper subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday that checks revealed 700 bogus party
memberships in the Gaspe. They have been stricken from party lists,
he said.

Mohawks Reach Tentative Land Deal
</P>
<P>
   KANESATAKE, Quebec (AP) -- Nearly 10 years after the Oka crisis,
Kanesatake Mohawks signed a tentative agreement with Ottawa
Wednesday to give them control over hundreds of hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which must still be ratified by the Mohawks this
fall, would give the aboriginals an ''interim land base'' in their
community, about 50 kilometers west of Montreal. Kanesatake is not
an official Indian reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Kanesatake council would have control over that land and be
able to establish bylaws, zoning rules and a process for resolving
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would see this as very much self-government in the making,''
federal Indian Affairs Minister Robert Nault said after signing the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Kanesatake was the scene of a 78-day armed standoff after Mohawk
Warriors put up barricades in July 1990 to stop the nearby town of
Oka from expanding its golf course on land they considered theirs.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Gay Law Scrapped in Scotland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Scotland's parliament on Wednesday
repealed a law that barred the promotion of homosexuality in
schools -- a highly controversial measure that the British
government has failed to get rid of in England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The law -- known as Section 28 -- was passed by Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative government, and its repeal was one of the
campaign promises of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party when
they ousted the Tories in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials argue that the law inhibits staff in local
authorities, which run many schools and colleges, from counseling
gay and lesbian people, and makes it difficult for teachers to stop
people from bullying of homosexual students.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Scottish parliament approved the repeal bill 99-17.
In England and Wales, the repeal would be by the House of Commons
in London.
</P>
<P>
   ''Repeal is not and never has been about the promotion of
homosexuality in our schools,'' Communities Minister Wendy
Alexander told the parliament. ''Nor is repeal about political
correctness or even marriage. It is about building a tolerant
Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander called Section 28 an ''ugly restraint'' on the ability
of local government to support all members of their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Conservative legislator Keith Harding appealed
earlier for the place of marriage to be more formally enshrined in
the repeal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I may be old fashioned but I feel I speak for a majority of
Scots when I say marriage is a cornerstone of civilization,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In England, legislation introduced by the Labor government to
scrap Section 28 has been held up by the Conservative-dominated
House of Lords.

<HEADLINE> Jury Hears 911 Tape in Davidian Case  </HEADLINE>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The panic and terror within the walls of the
Branch Davidian complex were relived Wednesday as the audiotaped
drama of the first moments of the government's 1993 raid was played
in a multimillion-dollar wrongful death trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 75 men around us and they are shooting at us at
Mount Carmel!'' sect member Wayne Martin screamed in the telephone.
''Tell them there are children and women in here and to call it
off!''
</P>
<P>
   The pops of gunfire could be heard in the background as
sheriff's officials on the phone scrambled to calm Martin while
simultaneously trying to reach federal Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was captured on 911 tapes by the McLennan County
Sheriff's Office, whom Martin called when shooting started on Feb.
28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting began when federal agents tried to serve search and
arrest warrants on the Mount Carmel complex outside Waco on
suspected gun violations. Four federal agents and six Davidians
died that day.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal ended 51 days later when the FBI tear-gassed the
wooden complex and a fire engulfed the building. In the end, about
80 Davidians were killed either by gunfire or the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and family members of the Branch Davidians are seeking
$675 million in a wrongful death lawsuit that among other things
argues that the ATF agents fired indiscriminately, knowing women
and children were inside. The government contends that cult members
shot first during the raid and started the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's plea for ATF agents to stop firing on the complex had
been heard at the 1994 criminal trial of five Davidians, who were
convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the deaths of four federal
agents.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday was the first time a jury heard the entire first
tape capturing the beginning of the raid and siege. That segment
included a recording of Martin's insistence that he had a right to
shoot back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a right to defend myself! They started shooting
first!'' Martin yelled in a speakerphone to Sheriff's Lt. Larry
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell them to hold their fire, leave the property and we'll
talk!''
</P>
<P>
   More of the exchange was heard when government attorneys
countered with tape segments of their own. The excerpts included
recordings of Lynch trying to persuade Martin to maintain the cease
fire so injured agents could be retrieved and to arrange help for
injured people inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The injured agents were removed, but the Davidians rejected
medical help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want anything from your country,'' Martin said on one
tape. ''That's what our wounded are telling us. They don't want
your help.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and four of his children ultimately died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford, a lead counsel for the
government, said as he left the courthouse: ''We do not believe the
plaintiffs have proven through the evidence they presented so far
that the ATF is responsible for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs' lead counsel, Michael Caddell, said the 911
tapes demonstrated poor leadership and judgment by law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to believe there was a mistake, an error in judgment on
both sides. ... I think the ATF made the first error in judgment
and I think the most serious error in judgment,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, Dick DeGuerin, the Houston lawyer who
represented Davidian leader David Koresh and visited Mount Carmel
during the siege, testified that all the bullet holes he saw while
facing the right front door of the Davidian complex were from shots
fired from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will act only as an advisory panel to U.S. District
Judge Walter Smith, who will deliver the verdict. Separately, Smith
will consider the question of whether federal agents shot at
Davidians during the siege's fiery end.

<HEADLINE> Pair linked to Wendy's gun arrested  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - A pair of aspiring Ohio rappers were
arrested Wednesday for selling the gun used in last month's
basement massacre in a Queens fast food restaurant for $250 during
a Long Island visit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gardier, 23, of Cleveland, and Jamal Gales, 27, of
Berea, Ohio, were arraigned in federal court later Wednesday. They
were accused of selling the black, .38-caliber semiautomatic pistol
used to kill five people in a Wendy's on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Gardier was charged with possessing a stolen firearm, while
Gales was charged with illegally transferring a stolen firearm.
Both were released on $150,000 bond, although Gales must now answer
outstanding criminal charges in Queens and Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bernard was a young man who set out to New York with no
intention of committing a violation of federal law,'' said John
Carman, Gardier's court-appointed lawyer. ''But unfortunately, he
will forever linked now to the Wendy's killing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court,
Gardier stole the weapon in March 1999 from his future wife, Angela
Freeman. He and Gales drove with the stolen weapon from Cleveland
to Long Island, where they sold it for $250.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects' parents, who were in court, said the two men were
aspiring rappers who headed to New York in hopes of landing a
record contract.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, who purchased the gun in March 1999, reported it stolen
shortly after it disappeared from her home. She later married
Gardier; Freeman was also in court for the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint did not specify if the murder suspects purchased
the gun directly from Gardier and Gales. Assistant U.S. Attorney
Jodi Avergun said the investigation into who purchased the gun was
still continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Gales also faces a charge of turnstile jumping in Queens and a
misdemeanor count of criminal behavior in Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, were charged with
shooting seven people, five of them fatally, during a robbery gone
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor charged in court previously that they
systematically bound and gagged their victims, then forced them to
their knees and shot them one by one.
</P>
<P>
   They were charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two
counts of second-degree murder for each of the five victims,
attempted murder for the two men who survived, robbery and weapon
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Police said at the time that they recovered a .380-caliber
handgun in Taylor's possession that they believed was used in the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The slain workers were Ramon Nazario, 44; Anita C. Smith, 23;
Jeremy Ryan Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, and Jean
Auguste, 27, the night manager. Seriously injured were Patrick
Castro, 23, who was shot through both cheeks, freed himself and
called 911; and JaQuione Johnson, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Queens District Attorney Richard Brown is weighing whether to
seek a death penalty or life without parole prosecution in the
cases of Taylor and Godineaux.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Blackthorne issued death threats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - The sister of slaying victim Sheila Bellush
told a jury Wednesday that South Texas millionaire Allen
Blackthorne twice threatened Bellush with death.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Bladorn of Turner, Oregon, was the last scheduled
prosecution witness in the federal trial. Court will not be
conducted Thursday. The trial will resume Friday, when prosecutors
are expected to rest their case against Blackthorne, who is accused
of arranging his ex-wife's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Bladorn testified about a 1985 ski trip in which she said
Blackthorne told his then-wife that if she left him, he would take
the children and kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Bladorn said another threat came in Easter 1990, when she
visited her sister in San Antonio. Bladorn said discussions turned
to a friend of Bellush's who'd been murdered, and the husband, who
was a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Bladorn said Blackthorne talked of the slain woman getting what
she deserved, and then said to Bellush that she shouldn't make him
angry, or ''the same thing will happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed Nov. 7, 1997, shortly after moving with her
second husband, Jamie Bellush, and six kids to Sarasota. Her
2-year-old quadruplets from her second marriage were discovered
unharmed in the house, two of them crawling in their mother's
blood. Jamie Bellush and the children now live in Sussex County,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Her ex-husband is charged with interstate conspiracy to commit
murder for hire and interstate domestic violence. Blackthorne faces
a mandatory life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic photos of a Florida woman's bloody body were also shown
to jurors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator for the Sarasota County, Fla., Sheriff's
Department said Bellush was shot and stabbed to death in the
utility room of her Sarasota home.
</P>
<P>
   But drops of blood were found on a kitchen sink, indicating the
killer stood there after the slaying, said crime scene technician
Lisa Lanham.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Blackthorne asked his golfing buddy
Daniel Rocha to find a hit man to bludgeon Bellush. Rocha testified
he contacted his friend Sammy Gonzales, who hired his cousin, Jose
Luis Del Toro, the alleged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gonzales and Rocha are serving prison terms in Florida for
solicitation of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, a former high school football star in Uvalde, is
scheduled for trial next month in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the prosecution presented several witnesses who
placed Del Toro in Bellush's Sarasota neighborhood at the time of
the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Herman, a neighbor who later identified Del Toro in a
police photo, said she saw him walking down the street in
camouflaged clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't look like he belonged there in the neighborhood,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Mast, was mowing lawns in the neighborhood when he said he
saw a car driven by Del Toro enter the subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't have thought anything about it but he (the driver)
was wearing a camouflaged hat and a long-sleeved camouflaged coat.
I was very compelled to take the license plate number.''
</P>
<P>
   Mast said he memorized the car's license plate number, which
investigators introduced into evidence as belonging to a vehicle
registered to Del Toro.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the trial that began last week also has centered on
the bitter custody battle between Blackthorne and Bellush, who had
two daughters and divorced in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Breaking Actors' Strike  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Famous athletes who moonlight as commercial
pitchmen are proving a thorn in the side of actors on strike
against the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the union rank-and-file has been holding the line
during the nearly 2-month-old strike, sports stars including
Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Johnson have filmed commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're getting very bad advice from their management
people,'' Screen Actors Guild spokesman Greg Krizman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An advertising industry representative downplayed the importance
of the athletes' role in the labor dispute involving SAG and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, it's something people see as symbolically
important,'' said Dan Jaffe, executive vice president of the
Association of National Advertisers. ''But far more important is
the fact the advertising community has great solidarity'' in the
face of union demands.
</P>
<P>
   Not all sports stars have ignored the strike. Top golfer Tiger
Woods declined to film a Nike commercial the day after the walkout
began May 1, and Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said no
to a Dunkin' Donuts spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't a big decision for me because I respect what the SAG
members are doing,'' Garciaparra commented on athletes.com, a Web
site for sports figures.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes offer different reasons for ignoring the strike.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal agreed to film an ''I'm going to Disneyland!'' commercial
after the Los Angeles Lakers clinched the National Basketball
Association championship Monday because the fee went to his charity
for disadvantaged children, said his agent Leonard Armato.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney spot was a public-service opportunity more than an
ad, Armato said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's agent, Brad Hunt, said the 1996 Olympic gold
medalist's decision to make the Nike commercial was a ''very easy
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael has a contractual commitment to Nike and, this being
an Olympic year, the opportunity to be effectively utilized by one
of his primary sponsors in advertising is even more important,''
Hunt said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Titans running back Eddie George said on the Internet
that when he filmed an Adidas commercial May 9 he ''wasn't too
aware of the SAG situation at that particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot was made one day before the National Football League
Players Association notified player representatives that it was
honoring the SAG strike. The unions representing basketball and
baseball players also are supporting the actors.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and AFTRA, which represent about 135,000 actors, want to
change the ad industry's compensation structure to give actors
''pay-per-play'' residuals for both network and cable TV
commercials. Advertisers want to pay flat fees for both.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas (AP) -- Richard Dufallo, a conductor known for his
energetic performances of contemporary music, died Friday of
stomach cancer. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Dufallo conducted more than 80 major orchestras and festivals in
the United States, Canada, and Europe, premiering numerous works by
American and European composers, including Karlheinz Stockhausen,
Jacob Druckman, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and Krzystof Penderecki.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former assistant conductor of the New York
Philharmonic, and worked closely with Leonard Bernstein from 1965
to 1975. He also served as associate conductor of the Buffalo
Philharmonic and as artistic director of contemporary music at the
Aspen Festival in Colorado.
David Figge:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Dr. David Figge, a pioneering scientist in the
field of gynecologic cancer on such problems as false negative
results on Pap smears, died Friday after a stroke. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Figge, an obstetrics and gynecology professor, developed the
division of gynecologic oncology at the University of Washington
and served as its director.
</P>
<P>
   His specialty, on which he wrote dozens of landmark papers, was
the development, detection and treatment of vulvar cancer. In one
critical finding, he verified that the human papilloma virus,
sometimes undetected, can play a role in the development of certain
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   He served as chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Harborview
Hospital from 1963 to 1969, director of gynecology at the
University Medical Center from 1969 to 1977 and director of the
division of gynecologic oncology from 1977 to 1989.
Carol Ely Harper:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Literary publisher Carol Ely Harper, a force in
the local arts community for decades who arrived in the Northwest
as a child in a covered wagon, died Tuesday in a fire at her home.
She was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Harper founded The Experiment Press in the late 1940s and led
the way for poetry and literary publishing in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Publications devoted only to poetry were rare then. The magazine
ceased publication in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A poet herself, Harper's books of collected poems included ''To
a Faulty Lover'' in 1946 and ''Big Bend of Columbia River'' in
1974.

<HEADLINE> Gore Speaks Out on Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Al Gore interjected himself Wednesday into
the death-penalty maelstrom surrounding Republican rival George W.
Bush, saying a moratorium on executions is the right thing for
states where criminal-justice errors abound.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was careful to add, ''I do not know the record in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he used the example of Illinois, where Republican Gov.
George Ryan has temporarily halted executions, citing 13 death row
inmates in his state who were cleared since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any state that has that kind of horrible record ought to have
a moratorium,'' Gore told reporters on his campaign plane. ''I do
not have detailed knowledge of what the actual record is in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Gore, a death penalty supporter, has
discussed the issue in such stark terms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, while campaigning in Des Moines, Gore criticized Bush's
tax-cut and Social Security plans as only good for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, he was spending time with Gov. Jesse Ventura, a
populist politician who has become chummy with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Minnesota, under a volley of questions from
reporters, Gore said the goal of all sides in the death penalty
debate should be getting the error rate ''down to the virtual zero
point.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are honest about the debate you have got to acknowledge
there are always going to be some small number of errors,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. Bush has been dogged by protesters over the last
several days while campaigning in California and as his state
prepares to execute Gary Graham on Thursday. Graham, convicted
largely on the testimony of one eye witness, has become a rallying
point for death penalty opponents who say many murder defendants
don't get fair trials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended his state's legal system as ''fair and just'' on
Wednesday and said he saw no need for a moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned there has not been one innocent person
executed since I've become governor,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office 5&AMP;frac12; years ago, 134 inmates have been
executed in Texas. The governor said he analyzed each capital case
that reached his desk to ensure fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Because Graham already received a temporary reprieve from Bush's
predecessor, the governor has no power to spare his life unless the
Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends a pardon, a reprieve
or commutation of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   At a Des Moines union hall, Gore appealed to blue-collar workers
by saying only the wealthy would gain from Bush's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the choice in this election,'' Gore said. ''Are you
for working people?''
</P>
<P>
   Making his arguments with charts and testimonials, Gore said
Bush's tax cut and retirement plans would bankrupt Social Security
and harm middle-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, instead, proposes savings accounts to augment Social
Security. He warned that ''Governor Bush has proposed a plan that's
very different'' and ''doesn't work very well for working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Bush defended his Social Security plan, saying it
would allow younger workers to divert some of their Social Security
taxes to private investments for a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's really important to make sure the system survives,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the plan was better for
low-income workers, who wouldn't be able to put away the savings
needed to receive government matching funds under Gore's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed a targeted estate tax cut, aimed at small
businesses and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, farms and businesses valued at $2.6 million or less
aren't subject to inheritance taxes. Gore would raise that
threshold to $5 million, and said 90 percent of the nation's
farmers and 70 percent of small businesses would be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and other Republicans have called for elimination of
the inheritance tax, Gore said that would be little more than a
gift to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Gore and wife Tipper attended a horse show with
Ventura and his wife Terry to watch a performance by Ventura's
16-year-old daughter, Jade, who is learning disabled. Gore was
focusing on special education during a school event Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The couples, who munched popcorn and talked animatedly as
Ventura's father-in-law videotaped the performance, were among
about 100 people in a cavernous auditorium who watched the formally
attired riders prance about the stage on well-groomed horses.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Gore, often labeled stiff, and Ventura,
one of the country's most colorful and unpredictable politicians,
started earlier this year with a breakfast, followed by dinner and
socializing between the two couples. Ventura says they simply hit
it off, and it doesn't bother him if Gore benefits from their
association.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just find Al and Tipper very nice,'' Ventura told the
Minneapolis Star Tribune in an interview published Wednesday. ''If
he is using whatever relationship we have for something in the
campaign, that's his prerogative. He's out to become the president.
He's going to do what it takes to win.''

<HEADLINE> NYPD officer found dead in Staten Island home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An off-duty city police officer was found dead
in his home in Staten Island on Wednesday with a gunshot wound to
his head, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer was declared dead at the scene from a self-inflicted
shot, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo. The officer, who was not
immediately identified, was the fifth city police officer to commit
suicide so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old officer had been on the police force for six
years and had been working in a Staten Island precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded to the officer's home on Wednesday around 8:30
p.m. after receiving a 911 call about a man with a gunshot wound.

<HEADLINE> Group: Window Guards Save Lives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission urged
parents Wednesday to install guards on home windows to prevent
children from falling. The agency announced standards for window
guards, which can be screwed onto the outside of single-family
homes and apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether you live in a high rise or a single-family home, a
window guard can help prevent a tragedy,'' said Ann Brown,
chairwoman of the CPSC. ''Don't depend on a screen alone to keep
children safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC estimates that about 12 children 10 years and younger
die each year, and more than 4,000 are treated in emergency rooms,
due to falls from windows. The group cites at least 120 children
killed from window-fall deaths since 1990, and most occur to
children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   Window guards are priced between $10 and $30. Window stops,
which keep the window from opening more than 4 inches, cost about
$2.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 6, Tigers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Kelvim Escobar pitched a four-hitter for his
first shutout in 55 career starts, leading the Toronto Blue Jays
over the Detroit Tigers 6-0 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado hit his AL-leading 25th homer and Shannon Stewart
hit a three-run homer to back Escobar (6-8), who pitched his third
complete game of the season. He struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was shut out for the ninth time this season, the most in
the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler (4-4) allowed five runs and nine hits in 6 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing the first two batters of the game to reach,
Escobar struck out Bobby Higginson, then got Juan Gonzalez to hit
into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar worked out of bases-loaded jam in the third inning by
inducing a popup from Higginson and a groundout from Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   After Higginson doubled and advanced on a wild pitch in the
sixth, Escobar got Gonzalez on a groundout and Tony Clark on a
flyout. Escobar then retired his final nine batters.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler balked in a run in the fourth, and Stewart homered in
the fifth following singles by Tony Batista and Homer Bush. Toronto
has homered in a club-record 19 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi's sacrifice fly in the seventh made it 5-0 and
Delgado homered off Matt Anderson in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Delgado extended his hitting streak to 15 games. ...
Gonzalez, who entered with four homers in his previous six games,
went 0-for-4. ... Toronto rookie Matt Dewitt gave up a home run on
his first pitch in the majors on Tuesday night. ''It was an
eye-opener. It was like, 'Welcome to the big leagues,' '' Dewitt
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Debbie Black's 10-foot jumper with one second
remaining gave the Miami Sol a 57-55 victory over the Washington
Mystics on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Sam scored 18 points to lead Miami (4-6), which trailed
most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw had 20 points and eight rebounds for
Washington (5-4), which led by as many as nine points in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol took their first lead since early in the game when
Shantia Owens' short jumper with 35 seconds put them ahead 55-54.
Andrea Nagy of the Mystics was fouled as she drove to the basket
and made one of two free throws to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Black brought the ball up court and passed it into Owens who was
double-teamed. Owens passed it back out to Black who took two
dribbles then let go the game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   Washington used a 12-3 run to build a 30-18 lead with 4:52
remaining in the first half. But the Sol closed the half with a 9-0
run to get within three points.
</P>
<P>
   After Miami cut Washington's lead to 37-36, the Mystics went on
an 8-0 run. The Sol quickly scored six consecutive points to get
within 45-43.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Vicky Bullett recorded her 200th career steal in
the first minute of the game when she picked off an errant pass by
Katrina Colleton.

<HEADLINE> S.C. sets rates to dispose of nuclear waste  </HEADLINE>
By DAN LEWERENZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - States outside the Atlantic Compact will
be allowed to continue shipping low-level nuclear waste to a
Barnwell County landfill, but they'll pay more for some of it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that South Carolina is part of the Atlantic Compact with New
Jersey and Connecticut, the state Budget and Control Board went
about the business Wednesday of setting new rates.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges, who pushed the Legislature to approve joining
the compact, wants to eliminate most waste shipments to Barnwell.
Waste from other than Connecticut and New Jersey will be gradually
eliminated during the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The object is to leave room in the landfill for waste that will
be created with South Carolina's nuclear plants are decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, all states pay the same based on the weight
and density of their waste. The rates start at $7.70 per pound for
waste with a density less than 45 pounds per cubic foot and
decrease as the density goes up.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that is a surcharge for how radioactive the waste is,
and it will be higher for states outside the Atlantic Compact.
</P>
<P>
   Budget and Control Board spokesman Mike Sponhour said the rates
were similar to those currently charged by Chem-Nuclear Systems,
which runs the Barnwell site for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The rate charged to Atlantic Compact states would be adjusted
annually based on cost-of-living increases. The rates for other
states can be changed by the Budget and Control Board at any time,
Sponhour said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Ride in Victory Parade  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Where stores were looted and police cars
burned two days earlier, a quarter-million Los Angeles Lakers fans
hailed the new NBA champions Wednesday in an adoring sea of purple
and gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for that parade and for that warm outburst of love
from you to us. That was wonderful. That just shows what you can do
in two days, right?'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson told the throng
gathered at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The fans, joyously celebrating the city's first pro title of any
kind in 12 years, heard speeches from the mayor, promises of more
titles and a pledge from the biggest star of the day in every way,
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-1, 330-pound Lakers center promised another title --
and two new police cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other night after the game, a couple of bad things
happened, a couple of people trashed two police cars. So on behalf
of the Lakers and Phil Jackson, we're going to get them two new
police cars,'' O'Neal said after winning the first championship
ring of his eight NBA seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to say that when we get one (championship) next year,
we just want to be safe, we want everybody to be safe and do the
right thing because we're going to get one next year, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few minor incidents after the parade, police
officer Dan Cox said. A group of young men, many wearing Lakers'
jerseys, pounded on a bus and stole food from a catering truck 12
blocks south of the arena before police rounded them up.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Horace Frank, a police spokesman, said early reports for the
day indicated a man was arrested for investigation of sexual
battery, and approximately a dozen other arrests were made for
offenses including possession of narcotics and knives.
</P>
<P>
   Fans along the parade route, however, felt safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no reservations at all about coming out today,'' said
Dorothy Rhan, in the crowd that stretched nine blocks to the
Lakers' home at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it. It's wonderful,'' Rhan said. ''L.A. has its unity
now and it's all due to the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   A mob looted stores, smashed windows and torched police cars and
news vans outside the arena after the Lakers defeated the Indiana
Pacers 116-111 for the NBA crown. Eleven people were arrested and
four police officers were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Police vowed zero tolerance for parade violence and a highly
visible force of more than 300 officers, many in riot gear, was
stationed along Figueroa Street. Nearby reinforcements were brought
in when the crowd closed in on the parade and temporarily halted
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a veteran of six NBA championship parades when he
coached Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s, said:
''We appreciate this a lot. This is for the city of L.A. We are
starting a new millennium right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs in the crowd called it a ''new Phillennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, booed during his brief appearance with
the Lakers at Staples, declared it Laker Day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it was time for O'Neal, who swept Most Valuable Player
honors in the regular season, the All-Star Game and the NBA Finals,
to make his brief speech.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a balcony at Staples to the thousands gathered in a
parking lot across from the arena, O'Neal said, ''Can you dig it?''
and the crowd responded with cheers and chants of ''MVP! MVP!''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal earlier declared that his era as ''The Big Aristotle,''
spouting philosophy, was over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be known as 'The Big Shakespeare,''' he said.
''Because it was Shakespeare that said, 'Some men are born great,
some achieve greatness, some have greatness thrust upon them,' and
it was great doing it this year for the city and for everybody
else. And we're going to try to get one next year. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans had staked out prime spots along the parade route during
the night and several thousand were on hand by dawn. By the 11:15
a.m. start, people squeezed 20 and 30 people deep on Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine bathed the jubilant crowd on the first full day of
summer. Many wore purple-and-gold Lakers colors and hoisted signs
reading ''Honk for Kobe Bryant,'' ''Lakers rule 2000,'' ''AC Green,
Will you marry me?'' and ''Bling Bling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bling Bling'' was O'Neal's explanation for the sound made when
light bounces off a diamond NBA championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   Five open-air, double-deck buses carried the team, politicians,
family members and the Laker Girls down Figueroa through a blizzard
of purple and gold confetti. Players blew kisses, fans blew horns.
Everyone waved, smiled and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   One sign spanning a bridge read, ''It's only the beginning!''

<HEADLINE> Chile OKs Plan To Find Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALPARAISO, Chile (AP) -- The Senate gave final approval
Wednesday to a plan aimed at discovering what happened to people
who disappeared during the past dictatorship, capping a chaotic day
of debate and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage came on a 43-1 vote amid evening protests just
hours after relatives of the disappeared burst into the lower House
of Deputies to interrupt the debate going on there.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outbursts, Chile's House of Deputies approved the
plan 104-0 earlier Wednesday before forwarding it to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a proposal that would let former and current
military officers come forward with information about the victims
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship -- without fear of
punishment. According to an official report, 3,190 people were
killed under Pinochet's regime and more than 1,000 remain
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the plan, including President Ricardo Lagos, say
it may help shed light on the fate of the missing, many of whom are
believed to have been detained by Pinochet's security forces. But
opponents say it would simply provide immunity to those behind the
disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   Alvaro Garcia, a government spokesman, lauded the measure's
passage and exhorted those with knowledge of past human rights
abuses to make that information public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I invite all those with information to come forward,''
said Garcia, saying the proposal opens the way for healing of a
nation still coming to grips with the former right-wing military
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's lower house vote in this Pacific port city,
chaos ensued when some 100 chanting demonstrators burst into the
House chamber. ''We want truth and justice!'' dozens of protesters
shouted as police carried them away.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, representatives of the police and the
military would comb the military ranks and gather information on
what happened to the disappeared -- how they were killed and, if
possible, where they are buried. The representatives would have six
months to present their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has said determining the whereabouts of the victims is a
big step toward healing a nation still sorely divided by the
dictatorship that ended a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing we are doing is what I have always said: first
I would like for the detained-disappeared to be located,'' said
Lagos. He said it would then be up to the courts to decide what to
do with the information.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Diaz, a leader of relatives of the victims, said the
president needs to take a closer look at the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned that he is thinking more about the column of
truth than the column of justice,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes as Pinochet, 84, awaits a decision on
whether his immunity should be stripped so he can be tried for
human rights violations. A lower court took away the immunity, and
Pinochet has appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned home in March after being detained for 16
months in Britain, where he successfully avoided extradition to
Spain. A Spanish judge had wanted to put Pinochet on trial for
alleged abuses committed under his rule, but he was judged too sick
to stand trial.

<HEADLINE> Vandals Strike Lakers Parade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Groups of youths leaving the Los Angeles
Lakers victory celebration Wednesday overturned barriers, pounded
on a transit bus, vandalized a catering truck and reportedly tried
to attack a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Police in riot gear rounded up several dozen youths south of
downtown, lining them up against a building, hands bound behind
their backs. It was not immediately known how many of those youths
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Horace Frank, a police spokesman, said early reports for the
day indicated a man was arrested for investigation of sexual
battery, and about a dozen other arrests were made for offenses
including possession of narcotics and knives.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents occurred as a huge crowd dispersed from the area
around Staples Center. A quarter-million people had lined a parade
route through downtown and jammed in the stadium parking lot to see
the National Basketball Association champions.
</P>
<P>
   Police had promised a zero-tolerance policy toward troublemakers
after Monday night's deciding game, when several hundred members of
a huge crowd outside the stadium burned four vehicles and
extensively damaged some area businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The post-rally incidents, not as serious as Monday night's
violence, drew an immediate response by large numbers of officers.
The trouble mostly was reported on streets well south of Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   KABC-TV reported that its helicopter pilot witnessed what
appeared to be a crowd attempting to strip a woman, but that a
bystander rescued her.
</P>
<P>
   KCBS-TV reported that its news van at the Staples Center rally
was mobbed by people who vandalized it with graffiti, but 911 calls
did not immediately bring help. Cmdr. Dave Kalish told KCBS that
all police resources were apparently busy then.
</P>
<P>
   TV news helicopters also spotted incidents of youths throwing
objects at officers.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Diego Serna scored three goals and added an
assist as the Miami Fusion beat the Tampa Bay Mutiny 4-1 on
Wednesday night in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Serna opened the scoring 45 seconds into the game -- the fastest
goal from the start of a game in Miami history and the quickest
allowed by Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Serna made it 2-0 in the 19th minute and added his seventh goal
of the season in second-half injury time.
</P>
<P>
   Welton, who set up Serna's first two goals, gave the Fusion a
3-0 lead in the 56th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mutiny star Mamadou Diallo scored his league-leading 13th goal
in the 64th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion goalkeeper Nick Rimando made a diving save on Carlos
Valderrama's penalty-kick in the 62nd minute. The Mutiny have
converted just two of six penalty kicks this season.
</P>
<P>
   Miami snapped a three-game road losing streak to improve to
6-7-4, while Tampa Bay dropped to 8-8-0.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pirates 8, Expos 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- John Vander Wal homered twice, including a grand
slam in Pittsburgh's season-high seven-run third inning, as the
Pirates beat the Montreal Expos 8-3 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Cordova (5-5) allowed seven hits and two runs in six
innings as the Pirates won their second straight following a
four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Peters pitched the last three innings for his first save
this season, and second of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Lee Stevens hit two home runs for his eighth career
multi-homer game.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Tony Armas Jr. (2-5) set down six of the first
seven batters he faced before allowing Pat Meares' double leading
off the third. He struck out Cordova and then walked Warren Morris
and Jason Kendall to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Armas threw three straight balls to Vander Wal -- making it 11 in
a row overall -- before a called strike made the count 3-1. Vander
Wal drove Armas' next pitch 400 feet over the wall just to the
right of center to give Pittsburgh a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vander Wal's second career grand slam and his career-best
seventh homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh added three more runs in the inning on Bruce Aven's
RBI single and Aramis Ramirez's two-run single, with both hits
coming off reliever Brad Rigby.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal hit a solo shot off left-hander Scott Forster with
one out in the seventh, giving him a career-high five RBIs. He
added a double in the ninth to complete a 3-for-5 performance.
</P>
<P>
   Armas allowed six runs and four hits in just 2 1-3 innings, his
shortest outing in the majors in nine career starts. He went just 3
1-3 innings in his last start, against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens homered leading off the fourth and came home from third
on Young's fielding error at first in the sixth to make it 7-2.
Stevens added another solo shot in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vander Wal, who made his major league debut with Montreal
and played for the Expos from 1991-93, hit six homers last season
for San Diego. ... Pittsburgh had three six-run innings this
season, the most recent on May 6 when they scored six in the ninth
at Chicago's Wrigley Field. ... Stevens also homered twice on June
2 against Baltimore.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Mark Kotsay hit a grand slam to help the Florida
Marlins rally past the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay was 4-for-4 with three singles and his second career
grand slam for the Marlins, who have won five of their last six.
</P>
<P>
   Braden Looper (2-1) got two outs in the seventh for the win, and
Antonio Alfonseca pitched out of a jam in the ninth for his 21st
save in 24 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-1, Florida loaded the bases against Milwaukee starter
Jimmy Haynes (7-6).
</P>
<P>
   Derrek Lee hit a leadoff infield single. After Alex Gonzalez
grounded into a fielder's choice, Paul Bako fouled out to the
shortstop. Mark Smith drew a pinch-hit walk, and Luis Castillo hit
an infield single to load the bases. Kotsay then hit a 1-1 pitch
from Valerio De Los Santos, who came on in relief of Haynes, to
give Florida a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonseca allowed one run in the bottom of the ninth when Jose
Hernandez drove in Charlie Hayes with a single. Alfonseca then gave
up a single to Raul Casanova before getting pinch-hitter Lyle
Mouton to pop out to second with runners on first and third to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who entered the game in next-to-last place in the
National League with 71 home runs, got solo shots from Jeromy
Burnitz, Marquis Grissom and Tyler Houston. The three homers tied
the team's single-game season high.
</P>
<P>
   All three Brewers home runs came off Florida starter Reid
Cornelius, who lasted 6 1-3 innings and allowed seven hits.
Cornelius had allowed only two home runs all season.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom's homer in the sixth gave the Brewers a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins tied it 1-1 in the sixth on Preston Wilson's
groundout. Castillo led off with a single and took third on
Kotsay's bloop single to right. With one out, Wilson hit a grounder
to shortstop, scoring Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins threatened in the fifth, when Mike Lowell hit a
double that Grissom allowed to drop in front of him in center
field. Lowell moved to third on Lee's groundout, but Gonzalez
grounded out and Cornelius struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz and Houston each homered in the seventh to chase
Cornelius, who was 2-0 with a 2.03 ERA in his previous four starts,
and give the Brewers a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes gave up four runs on eight hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burnitz is one hit from reaching the 500-hit plateau with
Milwaukee. ... Burnitz's home run was his first since May 28, a
span of 73 at-bats. ... 2B Ron Belliard has hit safely in eight of
his last 10 road games. ... The Marlins' 30-year-old rookie Chuck
Smith has been impressive in his two starts, including Monday's 11
strikeouts in 7 2-3 innings against Milwaukee. ... The game drew
8,070, putting it among the lowest of the year for the Marlins. The
first two games of the series drew 7,612 and 7,743.

<P>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Chris Albright and Jaime Moreno
scored second-half goals Wednesday to give D.C. United a 2-2 Major
League Soccer tie with the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's goal on a header tied the match in the 86th minute and
sent it into overtime. Neither team was able to score in the extra
time.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars record is now 7-7-1 for 22 points. United, the
defending MLS champion, is now 3-10-4 and in last place in the
Eastern Division with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars opened the scoring in the 18th minute after
United midfielder Richie Williams received a yellow card for
fouling Ramiro Corrales just outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos' free kick curved into the box and onto the head of Clint
Mathis who nodded the ball just under the bar for his seventh goal
of the season and fourth in six games since joining the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey made it 2-0 five minutes later when Mathis
made a run down the right side and cut the ball back to Adolfo
Valencia on the left. Valencia was unable to get a shot off, but
sent the ball back to Ramos just outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos measured the shot and rolled it just inside the right post
from 22 yards away. It was the first goal for the oft-injured
midfielder since August 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. got on the scoreboard in the 51st minute when Moreno
carried the ball into the box and deflected a shot off a MetroStars
defender. Albright was able to get his foot on the deflected shot
and redirect it past MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann.
</P>
<P>
   After several near misses, D.C. United tied the match on
Moreno's header. United almost won the match a minute later when
Wood's header hit the cross bar.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Stay in WTO  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has emphatically rejected a move to
end U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization, but sent a
message Wednesday that improvements are needed in the ways the body
governs world trade.
</P>
<P>
   In a 363-56 vote lawmakers defeated a motion that would have
withdrawn the approval of Congress from the agreement establishing
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   There is no acceptable alternative to having a global
rules-based trading system, said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich. ''The
alternative is anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 legislation authorizing U.S. entry in the newly created
WTO required the administration to submit a report on the costs and
benefits of membership. After the report is filed, any single
member of Congress can sponsor a resolution to withdraw from the
trade body.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution was offered by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, a vocal
opponent of U.S. involvement in international organizations. U.S.
entry in the WTO is illegal and unconstitutional, Paul said. ''It
is the U.S. Congress that has the authority to regulate foreign
commerce. Nobody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a matter of trade, this isn't a matter of
exclusion, this is a matter of American sovereignty,'' said Rep.
Jim Traficant, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing view was reflected by Rep. Tim Roemer,
D-Ind., who said, ''We don't want to blow up the WTO. ... We want
to improve it, not remove it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky hailed the vote as
''a clear validation of the benefits of our membership in the
WTO.'' She added that it ''sends a strong signal to our trading
partners that they can count on the United States' continued
leadership in the global trading system.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, many lawmakers accused the 137-nation,
Geneva-based trade group of ignoring worker rights and
environmental issues, echoing themes from last December, when the
WTO was the target of violent protests in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The WTO is in need of significant reform,'' said Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif. ''Workers' rights and environmental protection are
competitiveness issues and should play a stronger role in the
WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., a member of the Ways and Means
Committee, noted that the panel, which oversees trade policy,
earlier voted 35-0 against the resolution. The consensus, he said,
was that it would be ''unthinkable and illogical for the United
States to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane, responding to criticisms that the WTO infringes on U.S.
sovereignty, said the organization has brought prosperity to
Americans by lowering trade tariffs and opening foreign markets and
has been consistently pro-American, ruling for the United States in
25 of the 27 trade disputes this country has filed to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said they recognized the need for the WTO but
were casting a protest vote in favor of withdrawal. Rep. Marcy
Kaptur, D-Ohio, said she was protesting the decision of a company
in her district to move 1,500 jobs to Mexico. Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis., said he was voting yes ''out of frustration'' because ''now
only the voices of the economic elites are heard at the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's five-year report submitted to Congress last
March said the WTO had been instrumental in expanding market
access, protecting intellectual property rights, developing a
system for settling disputes and expanding the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   It said that future issues the WTO must address include
biotechnology, electronic commerce and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-trade vote came a month after the House approved by
237-197 legislation putting normal trade relations with China on a
permanent basis. The vote was part of the process to admit China
into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.J. Res. 90.

<HEADLINE> Court upholds $27 million judgment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) - A federal appeals court has upheld a
$27.2 million judgment to a Las Cruces man who lost his leg in an
asphalt milling machine accident seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Denver, in a ruling June 7, upheld the 1997 jury verdict against
industrial equipment manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand Co.
</P>
<P>
   There was no answer Wednesday at three separate telephone
listings given for the Woodcliff Lake, N.J., company.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dickard, the company's director of public relations, said
Ingersoll-Rand considers the issue to still be in litigation and
does not comment on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court jury in Santa Fe awarded nearly $10 million in
compensatory damages to Ron Smith and his wife, Lucy, and more than
$17 million in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors amputated Smith's leg above the knee after it was
crushed in April 1993 by an asphalt milling machine made by the
company. At the time, Smith was working for a contractor on a
repaving project in Las Cruces.
</P>
<P>
   The milling machine is a huge piece of equipment that uses a
revolving drum with big teeth to chew up asphalt. The right front
wheel had backed over Smith's right foot and leg, and he alleged
design defects were responsible for his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in his appeal, argued it deserved a new trial
because the judge let the jury continue to deliberate after
discovering they inadvertently got a pad of notes from Smith's
attorneys and a plaintiffs' expert. Ingersoll-Rand also argued the
court should not have allowed testimony from some plaintiffs'
experts and should have excluded evidence of six other milling
machine accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The company also contended the jury got incorrect instructions
about punitive damages and that the damages awarded were excessive.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel said U.S. District Judge Martha Vazquez was
well within the legal bounds to allow the trial to continue after
discovering the notes and in admitting evidence. The court said she
made no errors in jury instructions or in the constitutionality and
amount of the damages.

<HEADLINE> Another Arrest in UK Truck Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By MAUREEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police on Wednesday arrested the owner of the
trucking company that carried 58 illegal Chinese immigrants to
their deaths in an unventilated truck. An attorney said the vehicle
was so full that eight other stowaways were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Arie van der Spek, 24, surrendered to police in the Dutch port
of Rotterdam on Tuesday night, the third person in custody in the
suffocation deaths of the immigrants, who were found Sunday by
inspectors in the English port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
   The 58 victims, along with two survivors, were discovered when
customs officials opened a truck arriving by ferry from the Belgian
port of Zeebrugge. The immigrants, all in their 20s, were stowed
with a cargo of tomatoes. They died of respiratory failure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wah-Piow Tan, a London lawyer who represents Chinese
asylum-seekers, said one of the eight would-be stowaways called his
family in China to let them know he had not made the disastrous
trip.

   ''Sixty-eight people were supposed to board that truck, but
eight were bumped off because it was so full,'' Tan said. ''One of
them called his family when he heard of the deaths to let them know
that he was all right. He'd been swearing and cursing when he
wasn't allowed on the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The disaster has prompted an international police operation to
hunt down immigrant-smuggling racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium and British police began checking fingerprints of a
group of Chinese migrants who were detained in April at two
villages, Bornem and Puurs. The migrants fit the description of
those found on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After fingerprinting the group, Belgian authorities ordered them
to leave, and placed them unescorted on a train to Antwerp. The
migrants disappeared, and some may have ended up among the victims
at Dover.
</P>
<P>
   Film shot by Belgian television when the group departed from a
village station showed fit-looking young Chinese dressed in smart
casual clothes, and smiling and waving at the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Spek is the third Dutchman to be arrested in the case. A
55-year-old man is also under arrest in the Netherlands, and police
are interrogating the truck's Dutch driver.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Dover said they were holding two London-based Chinese
suspected of being involved in the smuggling operation. The pair, a
man and a woman, were not believed to have played a senior role.
</P>
<P>
   Kent County police said Wednesday that authorities are still
trying to identify the victims. The two survivors remained
hospitalized under guard.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers told Yang Chen, an asylum-seeker who is convinced his
cousin Chen Lin perished, to let mortuary staff examine a
photograph of the 19-year-old. Relatives faxed the picture
Wednesday from their hometown of Changle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lin was his cousin, but in China that means brother,'' said
Beng Lan Chew, an interpreter at Tan's offices. ''When they last
saw each other they talked of meeting up in London.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin, whose family raised $21,000 to pay for his trip, called
home regularly during a four-month journey through China, Russia,
Czechoslovakia to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium said it did not detain or forcibly deport the illegal
immigrants to China because they were in transit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It emphasizes yet again the need to take action at an
international and, in particular, at a European level,'' Prime
Minister Tony Blair told Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 6, Reds 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Neifi Perez and Darren Bragg singled home runs
and Ken Griffey Jr.'s throwing error let in another as the Colorado
Rockies rallied in the eighth inning for a 6-4 victory Wednesday
over the slumping Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado got its eighth victory in 11 games by taking advantage
of another wild performance by reliever Scott Williamson (2-4),
who's failing to duplicate his NL rookie of the year season.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have lost 12 of 14, failing to win consecutive games
since June 3-4. The tailspin has dropped them a distant second in
the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Tavarez (5-2) pitched one perfect inning in relief of
Rolando Arrojo, who gave up four runs -- three earned -- in six
innings. Gabe White pitched another scoreless inning, stretching
his streak to 20 2-3 innings, one shy of the franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Jiminez got the final three outs for his 12th save in 14
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle turned a 4-3 lead over to the bullpen, but was
victimized by a blown save for the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson walked Jeff Cirillo to open the eighth, threw his
NL-leading 13th wild pitch and walked Brent Mayne with two outs.
Perez singled to left to tie it and Bragg hit a pinch single up the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who made a diving catch to start a pivotal double play
in the series opener, dropped the ball as he tried to field it for
a play at the plate. He then threw wildly to third for an error
that sent Perez home.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Walker had a single, double and triple to pace the
Rockies, who have scored 41 runs in their last four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds were only 2-for-12 with runners in scoring position and
were hurt by a big mistake by Neagle, who gave up a bases-loaded
single to Arrojo with two outs in the fourth that put the Rockies
up 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Brian Hunter's fielding error helped the Reds tie
it in the bottom of the inning, and Sean Casey's RBI double put the
Reds up 4-3 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette, the Reds' hottest hitter in June, went 2-for-3
with a two-run double. He's batting .361 in the month.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Walker tripled in the first inning, giving the Rockies 33
triples this season, most in the majors. They've tripled in eight
of their last nine games. ... Helton was 1-for-4, dropping his
NL-leading average to .393. ... RHP Pete Harnisch will make a
rehabilitation start Sunday for Triple-A Louisville. The Reds plan
to activate him to pitch a week from Friday to start in Arizona.
... Barry Larkin moved ahead of Johnny Bench for second place on
the Reds' list of runs scored with 1,092. Pete Rose is first with
1,741 runs scored. ... Griffey is hitting .196 with runners in
scoring position.

<HEADLINE> MetroStars 2, United 2, Tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Chris Albright and Jaime Moreno
scored second-half goals Wednesday night to lift D.C. United into a
2-2 tie with the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's goal on a header in the 86th minute brought United, the
defending MLS champion, into the tie but they remain in last place
in the Eastern Division with a 3-10-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars (7-7-1) opened the scoring in the 18th minute
after United midfielder Richie Williams received a yellow card for
fouling Ramiro Corrales just outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   Tab Ramos' free kick curved into the box and Clint Mathis headed
the ball just under the bar for his seventh goal of the season and
fourth in six games since joining the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey made it 2-0 five minutes later when Mathis
made a run down the right side and cut the ball back to Adolfo
Valencia on the left. Valencia was unable to get a shot off, but
sent the ball back to Ramos just outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos measured the shot and rolled it just inside the right post
from 22 yards away. It was the first goal for the oft-injured
midfielder since Aug. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. got on the scoreboard in the 51st minute when Moreno
carried the ball into the box and deflected a shot off a MetroStars
defender. Albright was able to get his foot on the deflected shot
and redirect it past MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann.
</P>
<P>
   After United tied the match, they almost scored a minute later
but A.J. Wood's header hit the cross bar.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Teen-Ager Kills Mother  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A 17-year-old student allegedly beat his mother to
death with a baseball bat after attacking four schoolmates in an
argument reportedly over the length of his hair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the students suffered a fractured skull and was being
treated at a local hospital, said Okayama prefectural (state)
police in western Japan. The three others were slightly injured on
their legs and backs.
</P>
<P>
   The four were attacked with a metal bat during baseball practice
Wednesday. About an hour later, the boy's father found his wife at
home on the floor and bleeding from the head, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuko Oka, 42, was taken to a hospital where she was confirmed
dead. A blood-stained baseball bat was found near the body.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks occurred in Oku-gun, about 350 miles, west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 policemen searched through the night for the attacker,
but his whereabouts were not known Thursday morning, national
broadcaster NHK television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kyodo News agency said the teen-ager had quarreled with the four
teammates over the length of his hair. Police, however, said they
were still investigating the alleged motive.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, known as a relatively crime-free country, has been
plagued recently by high-profile violence involving teen-agers.

House Vote Affects Gun Agreement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to the landmark agreement among the nation's
largest gun maker, the Clinton administration and hundreds of communities, the
House voted Wednesday to bar the federal government from helping to attract more
muncipalities to the pact. By a 218-207 vote, the House voted to prevent the
government from spending any money for the Communities for Safer Guns Coalition.
In return for Smith &AMP; Wesson's promise to use gun-safety devices and sales
practices, the 411 localities that have so far joined the coalition have agreed
to make the company's firearms the preferred gun for their law enforcement
agencies.

Bush Supports Oil Price Probe

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George W. Bush voiced support for an investigation of
soaring gasoline prices, but he put most of the blame on the Clinton
administration's failure to convince foreign crude producers to ''open the
spigots.'' ''I do think it's fair to have the FTC (Federal Trade Commission)
investigate,'' Bush told reporters today, adding that the results would be
''healthy'' for the debate about prices that have climbed above $2 per gallon in
Chicago and Milwaukee. His Democratic rival for the presidency, Al Gore,

increase the group's daily quota by 708,000 barrels beginning July 1. ''Gas will

<HEADLINE> New Air Quality Standards Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Wednesday to block enforcement
of strict new air quality standards, erasing for now a long list of
cities and counties that stood to lose funds because they didn't
measure up.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was approved 226-199 as an amendment to an
appropriations bill. The Senate has not yet taken up a companion
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on whether the
Environmental Protection Agency must consider the costs of
compliance -- not just health effects -- when it imposes new
environmental standards. A lower court shot down the 1997 standards
last year, contending they were arbitrary numbers based on
questionable science.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure cited environmental concerns, arguing
nobody would be penalized until after the high court rules. But
Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La., who voted for the amendment, said the mere
cost of preparing for the tests could approach $10 million
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have we walked through the looking glass with Alice?'' said
Tauzin. ''Have we now entered Wonderland?''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said erasing the
noncomplaince list would send a bad message ''by enabling
communities to contend they don't have an air quality problem when
the data indicate they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was also met with steep resistance from
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution,
they ought to know about that,'' said Ed Hopkins, spokesman for the
Sierra Club. ''Essentially what this amendment does is keep them in
the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mac Collins, R-Ga., one of the sponsors of the amendment,
said the Georgia city of Columbus has already spent $66,000 in
anticipation of a new study, even though he contends 98 percent of
the pollutants come from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the standards, a three-judge panel of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the EPA
had interpreted the 1990 Clean Air Act ''so loosely'' that it
unlawfully usurped Congress' legislative power.
</P>
<P>
   The revised air standards limited the allowable level of ozone,
an essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of
the 0.12 parts per million under the old requirement. And states
for the first time were required to regulate microscopic
particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and other sources
down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the width of a human
hair.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate follows suit and votes to delay enforcement of the
new levels, the 1990 standards would still be enforced.

<HEADLINE> Bush Supports Oil Price Probe  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George W. Bush voiced support for an
investigation of soaring gasoline prices, but put most of the blame
on what he said was the Clinton administration's failure to
convince foreign crude producers to ''open the spigots.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think it's fair to have the FTC (Federal Trade
Commission) investigate,'' Bush told reporters Wednesday, adding
that the results would be ''healthy'' for the debate about prices
that have climbed above $2 per gallon in Chicago and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic presidential rival, Al Gore, countered that Bush
has come late to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big oil may have gotten too big. The competitive pressures may
not be what they used to be,'' Gore said aboard Air Force Two
between campaign stops. The vice president quickly added he was not
calling for a break up of any oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a former oilman who has built strong political ties to oil
companies as Texas' GOP governor, said the ''main reason'' gasoline
prices are up is the administration's inability to spur the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase crude oil
production.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope the administration could convince our friends at
OPEC to open up the spigots,'' said Bush. ''That's what diplomacy
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gore said he agrees the administration should
toughen its negotiations with OPEC. But Gore, campaigning in Iowa,
continued to focus on ''what may be big oil's price gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to keep challenging big oil until America gets some
straight answers and affordable gas prices they deserve,'' Gore
said as he opened a round-table at a Des Moines union hall.
</P>
<P>
   Later, asked about Bush's support of the FTC probe, Gore told
The Associated Press, ''I welcome Governor Bush coming around to
the point of what he belatedly said today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to keep the focus on education during a three-day
campaign swing through electoral vote-rich California, where he
hopes to dent Gore's lead.
</P>
<P>
   But he was dogged by protesters opposing the Texas death penalty
and Thursday's scheduled execution of Gary Graham.
</P>
<P>
   After protesters appeared outside a nonprofit learning center,
where Bush proposed help for such centers to acquire computers, the
governor defended criminal justice in Texas, where 134 inmates have
been executed during his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned there has not been one innocent person
executed since I've become governor,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also faced demonstrators after returning to Texas to
address the National Association of Hispanic Journalists' meeting
in Houston. Outside the hotel, about 10 people chanted, ''Bush says
death, we say hell no. The Klan says death, we say hell on. Gore
says death, we say hell no.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the group he would defer to the Board of Pardons and
Paroles. Bush has no power to spare Graham unless the board
recommends a pardon, reprieve or commutation of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll treat this case no different than any other case that has
come across my desk,'' he said. ''I'll ask two questions: Innocence
or guilt and whether this person has had full access to the courts
of law.''
</P>
<P>
   In the White House race, a new poll shows Bush gaining
popularity among voters, while support for Gore remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday found Bush
was favored by 49 percent and Gore by 41 percent of registered
voters. Last April, the same poll had Bush ahead, 46 percent to 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Support decreased for both candidates when Green Party candidate
and consumer activist Ralph Nader and Reform Party contender Pat
Buchanan entered the picture. In a four-way matchup, Bush polled at
43 percent, Gore 38 percent, Nader 7 percent and Buchanan 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was based on interviews with 1,740 registered voters
from June 14-16, and had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal for more federal spending to bring computers to
nonprofit and faith-based learning programs was part of a package
of education initiatives he has promoted in California ''to change
the perception that our party is anti-education.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The great challenge facing America is whether or not all
people have access to the new technology,'' Bush told students of
the PUENTE Learning Center, a privately funded center that teaches
mostly Hispanic children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would provide $80 million a year to match current
federal grants for more than 2,000 such facilities, campaign
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The all-Hispanic audience included several adult students who
said they wouldn't vote for Bush because he is a member of the
Republican Party that pushed the now-defunct Proposition 187, which
cut off government services to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of my daughter's friends were kept from school because of
Prop 187,'' said Aurora Moreno, 63, an adult English and computer
student. ''He says he's against it, but you never know. They say a
lot of nice things, the politicians.''

<HEADLINE> Haiti Government Urged To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A Haitian opposition alliance
called on the government to resign Wednesday, disputing legislative
elections that gave former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party
a hefty victory.
</P>
<P>
   The call came the same day the president of the electoral
council sent a message to Haitians saying he fled to the United
States in fear of his life because he refused to submit to
government orders to endorse incorrect election results.
</P>
<P>
   ''My security was endangered seriously,'' 78-year-old Leon Manus
said in letter. ''I received unequivocal messages concerning the
consequences of my refusing to publish the so-called final
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Manus also made a recording of his letter, which radio stations
played late Wednesday, apparently to assure Haitians the message
came from him. Manus has not disclosed his whereabouts in the
United States.

   The United States, United Nations and Organization of American
States all have challenged the vote count, with OAS
Secretary-General Cesaria Gavira warning Wednesday that ''the
consolidation of democracy in Haiti'' is at stake. So is $500
million in desperately needed foreign aid that has been frozen.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition says balloting and the count from last month's
legislative and municipal elections was fixed to institute a
dictatorship under President Rene Preval's predecessor and mentor,
Aristide, who is favored to win November presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   But a new ''Convergence'' alliance grouping 17 of Haiti's 33
opposition parties called for Premier Jacques-Edouard Alexis to
resign, citing pre-election violence in which at least 15 people
were killed, intimidation of opposition candidates and an illegal
vote count.
</P>
<P>
   Manus said in his letter that opposition criticism was ''often
legitimate'' and that police played an active role in ''certain
fraudulent acts, theft of ballot boxes, and falsification of tally
sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when Manus went into hiding, Aristide militants
blocked downtown Port-au-Prince with flaming tire barricades and
stoned passing vehicles to demand the immediate publication of
results. On Monday, they completely paralyzed Haiti's three biggest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide's party blamed the riots on the electoral council's
delay in publishing results, but sought to calm opposition fears
Wednesday. ''We want to reassure all opposition political parties
and everybody who didn't vote for us: We need your criticism and
recommendations to advance democracy,'' Sen.-elect Yvon Neptune
said.
</P>
<P>
   The elections council this week gave Aristide candidates 16 of
17 Senate seats contested May 21, a majority in the 27-seat
chamber; and all 26 seats in the first round of voting for the
83-member Chamber of Deputies. Results from another 11 seats were
still being tabulated. No one won a majority for the remaining 46
seats, so runoffs will be held. Lavalas candidates were favored to
win most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Under Haitian law, candidates must win a majority -- 50 percent
plus one vote -- to avoid a second round. But officials counted the
votes of only the top four contenders in each race, creating
erroneous winning percentages that observers say gave first-round
victories to several Lavalas candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence also demanded the election council's resignation.
Two members resigned last week, and this week's results were signed
by the six remaining members -- minus their president who fled Haiti
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The council has postponed indefinitely the second round of
balloting that was scheduled Sunday, while the opposition is
insisting on new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The same charges of fraud about 1997 elections led to a
prolonged power struggle that ended when Preval locked legislators
out of Parliament in January 1999 and named a new government by
decree.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was elected president in 1990 and was ousted by the
army in 1991. The army ruled until a U.S.-led invasion restored the
former Catholic priest to power in 1994.

<HEADLINE> House Pushes GOP Medicare Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tending to a vital election-year issue, House
Republicans forced committee approval for their Medicare
prescription drug legislation Wednesday night over the implacable
opposition of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-14 vote was strictly along party lines on the bill, which
envisions a blend of free-market insurance plans and government
subsidies to spread coverage nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The vote set the stage for what is likely to be a tough struggle
next week on the House floor on a measure Republicans have been
warned by a GOP pollster is a ''political imperative'' for the
coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before final passage, Republicans held ranks and
rejected a Democratic alternative calling for a uniform
government-defined prescription drug benefit, also to be available
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, now is the time to add prescription drug coverage to
Medicare,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, as he gaveled the House
Ways and Means Committee into session.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no public office or election that is more important
than the safety and well-being of senior citizens,'' he added,
stressing the bill offered special help for those with low incomes
or facing catastrophic costs.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, armed with their own alternative plan to provide
drug coverage, criticized the Republican measure as a rerun of old
GOP attacks on the giant health care program for the elderly.
''It's not Medicare,'' said Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., of the GOP
proposal, which relies on private insurance companies, aided by
government subsidies, to offer coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, the lobbyists are heaping money on us hoping we'll
vote one way or another,'' he said. ''This bill heaps money on the
lobbyists' clients, hoping they might write an insurance policy
that might provide some Medicare members'' with insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Passage was a certainty in the committee, although Democrats
spent hours pressing amendments and their own alternative. Approval
would set the stage for what is likely to be a tougher struggle
next week on the House floor on the measure, which one Republican
pollster has warned the GOP is a ''political imperative'' for the
coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sought to blunt one Democratic charge -- that private
insurance companies would not offer policies for sale. Rep. Bill
Thomas, R-Calif., the chief architect of the bill, circulated a
letter from a top official at Merck-Medco, a provider of
pharmaceutical benefits to health plans. ''We would work to develop
a prescription drug-only plan ... nationwide in competition with
others in what we expect will be a highly competitive market,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican demonstrated firm control of the committee
proceedings, rejecting Democratic attempts to make fundamental
changes in the bill. Among them was a proposal by Rep. Ban Cardin,
D-Md., to give the government authority to offer an insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP measure, insurance companies -- subsidized by the
government -- would offer approved prescription drug plans, with all
seniors guaranteed a choice of at least two. The government ''would
be the insurer of last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Deductibles, co-payments and other out of pocket charges would
vary. Under a draft standard policy, officials estimated monthly
premiums of $35 to $40 and a $250 annual deductible. Policyholders
would pay half the cost of each prescription, until they reach a
$1,050 annual benefit limit. Coverage would then stop, but any
costs over $6,000 would be covered in full.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidies would be available for those with low incomes,
eliminating or defraying premiums and deductibles. Their
co-payments would also be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a Democratic alternative envisions a standard
prescription drug benefit, including monthly premiums starting at
$26, no deductibles and a 50 percent co-payment for each
prescription. Policyholders would pay half the cost of each
prescription, with an annual benefit limit of $1,000. Democrats
also would provide financial assistance to those with low incomes.
They have promised to add catastrophic coverage, but are still
working on details.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel met while a quiet struggle unfolded outside the
committee room, fueled by President Clinton's proposal to add $21
billion over five years in Medicare payments to hospitals and other
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, too, were making plans to allocate more money to
Medicare providers.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said White House officials had been on the phone with
provider organizations, urging them not to back the GOP
prescription drug plan and pledging the additional payments later
in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, too, were on the phone, these sources added, urging
the same groups not to attack their plan, and offering a similar
incentive.
