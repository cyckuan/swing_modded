<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Raise Funds for Chinese Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A fund-raising initiative was
officially launched here today to help further improve the health,
education and environmental conditions for Chinese children,
</P>
<P>
"Partners for Children", jointly sponsored by the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, started to solicit
donations at a celebration to mark the 50th anniversary of UNICEF
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Initiative is expected to attract donations from some
transnational corporations, which are currently active in
China. The donations will be used in cooperative scheme to be
implemented between 1996 and 2000 by UNICEF and the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the UNICEF has promised to allocate 160
million US dollars of funds to conduct bilateral cooperation with
China over the next five years. UNICEF hopes to raise 48 million
US dollars through the "Partners" initiative.
</P>

Some one million US dollars has already been donated to
"Partners" by foreign companies. Some of the money is expected to
be used to launch a comprehensive project in northwestern Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region's Qiemo County, one of the poorest and
least developed counties in China, to help improve the health,
education, water-supply and environmental conditions there.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Getting Down in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
successfully brought inflation near the projected mark
of 10-20 percent for fiscal 1996, with the rate getting down from 53.5
percent at mid year to 34.7 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS), Nigeria has enjoyed a non-stop decrease in
inflation since the second half of this year though the tempo became
slow month by month.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate stood at 44.7 percent in July, 40.0 percent in
August, 37.4 percent in September and 34.7 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The composite consumer price index in both urban and rural areas
was 2770 in October, a moderate drop from 2843.9 in September. The FOS
attributed the drop in the index to decrease in the prices of food
items and some personal household goods.
</P>
<P>
However, with Christmas and the new year approaching, the prices of
food items are expected to grow, which might bring up the price index.

<HEADLINE> Former Zimbabwean Education Minister Urged to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Opposition United Parties (UP) of
Zimbabwe today said former Education Minister Edmund Garwe, who
resigned from cabinet last week following the leak of the country's
junior certificate (ZJC) examination papers by his daughter, should
step down from his parliamentary seat.
</P>
<P>
UP Spokesman Issac Manyemba said although his party welcomed the
decision by Garwe to resign, it was concerned that Garwe was
still a member in parliament.
</P>
<P>
''We feel that Garwe has not gone far enough and are concerned
that in parliament we have someone like him,'' Manyemba said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government continued to be made up of ministers who
had been implicated in several cases of corruption, but had not
resigned or been forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Garwe resigned as the education minister after
heading the ministry for six months.
</P>
<P>
He had to resign after his 14-year-old daughter and a friend were
found in possession of three ZJC examination papers at Harare
Dominican Convent School. enditem

<HEADLINE> White House Weighing Intervention on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has granted the Justice Department more time to decide whether to
enter the legal fray over Proposition 209, the California law that
would ban race-and gender-based affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said Wednesday that
the presumption is that the administration will intervene, but the
Justice Department asked for one or two weeks to consider
complicated legal issues.
</P>
<P>
The delay "does not preclude the government from entering the
case in the future," McCurry said. Clinton opposed the measure
during the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Proposition 209 prohibits preferences based on race and gender
in public hiring, contracting and education. It was approved by 54
percent of California voters in last month's election.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco
issued a temporary restraining order late last month temporarily
barring enforcement of the measure, saying it might be
unconstitutional.

STOCKHOLM, December 11 (Xinhua)-- Sweden is willing to
cooperate with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as the
military alliance becomes more open and broadly political,
Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local publication, Svenska Dagbladet, the
Prime Minister said although Sweden's policy was to stay outside
pacts and alliances, the "democratization" of NATO and its
involvement in political events should be properly considered by
the Swedish government.
</P>

He said the shift in NATO's role might enable Sweden to cooperate

<P>
HARARE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President today
spelled out an agenda for the forthcoming national convention of
the ruling ZANU (PF) which will highlight the thorny issues of
land, black economic empowerment, the AIDS pandemic and problems
of divisions within the party.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the on-going party Central Committee meeting to
made preparation for the national conference which will begin on
Friday in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city, President
Robert Mugabe said the party's political bureau has prepared a
report on various national and party issues to be presented to
the Central Committee and the national convention.
</P>
<P>
"The report will naturally throw into focus the organizational
situation of the party following the yet-to-be-completed
restructuring exercise, the evaluation of primary elections, the
existence of factionalism, citing the situations of Manicaland
and Masvingo Provinces," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Political apathy, a situation in which voters turn-out in
national elections can be consistently falling, will also be on
the agenda for the second yearly convention, as will be the issue
of commercialization of public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The central committee meeting also heard of the tortuous
negotiations with the British government over redressing
imbalances in land ownership between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "the view of the British government was that they
were prepared to support financially the land acquisition and
resettlement program on condition that the land involved was
acquired on the basis of willing buyer-willing seller."

<HEADLINE> Indicted Karadzic Enjoys Travel and Armed Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Radovan Karadzic, the former
Bosnian Serb leader indicted for war crimes, has been spotted
travelling in the Serb capital with an escort of Serb armed
police, a United Nations spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers of the International Police Task Force (IPTF)
encountered Karadzic on Tuesday morning at a road juncture near
Pale, the capital of the Serb republic, Alexander Ivanko, a
spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force, said.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, who were on a foot patrol, saw a convoy of four
cars pass the crossroad after Serb policemen stopped traffic for
them. One of the vehicles was carrying members of Serb special
police units armed with AK-47s.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic was sitting in the back of the third car and "enjoying
the view" with windows open, Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
The patrol radioed the encounter to their superiors, but it
took several hours to relay the message to the NATO-led
Implementation Force (IFOR), the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic tops the list of about 70 persons wanted by the Hague
tribunal for "war atrocities" carried out in the 3 1/2-year war in
the former Yugoslavia. Most of them still live at large in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led peacekeeping forces have resisted hunting down the
indicted for fear of endangering their soldiers, despite
increasing calls for taking immediate action from recent
international conferences on Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> US Wholesale inflation Up Quickly in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. inflation at the
wholesale level jumped by 0.4 percent in November because of the
biggest increase of energy prices in seven months, the Labor
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the Producer Price Index (PPI), designed to
measure inflationary pressures before they reach the consumer,
followed an identical 0.4 percent gain in October.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said that energy prices in the U.S. jumped
by 2.3 percent in November, the biggest one-month gain since a 2.7
percent rise in April.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices were up 2.8 percent last month while natural
gas was up 3.8 percent. Home heating oil prices edged down a
slight 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food costs, which had shot up 0.8 percent in October, declined
by a small 0.1 percent in the month, the first time in seven
months.
</P>
<P>
However, excluding the volatile food and energy sectors,
wholesale prices in the country edged up only by 0.1 percent in
November following a 0.3 percent drop in October.
</P>
<P>
The 0.1 percent increase in the so-called core rate of
inflation after a big drop the previous month reflected in large
part a turnaround in car prices, which had been down in October.
</P>
<P>
Prices also rose for cosmetics, household furniture and drugs.
But prices declined for women's clothing, newspapers and household
appliances.
</P>
<P>
With inflation remaining well-behaved and the overall economy
slowing down in the second half of this year, many local analysts
believed the U.S. Federal Reserve would not feel the need to raise
interest rates in its policy-making meeting next week, the last
one in this year.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices in the U.S. have been rising
at an annual rate of 2.6 percent while inflation at the consumer
level has been rising only slightly faster at an annual rate of
3.3 percent.

BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A book on the impact and
effectiveness of the Single Market is to be published by the
European Union (EU) with a number of independent co-publishers in
its member states.
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled The Single Market and Tomorrow's Europe,
features a global assessment of the Single Market's effects on the
EU economy and discusses the role of the Economic and Monetary
Union in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We would like this book to ensure that as many people as
possible are aware of the Single Market's achievements and its
potential," said EC Commissioner Mario Monti.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the book would encourage people to make the
best use of the current potential of the Single Market since
creating the market is "a historical process, not a one-off
event."
</P>
<P>
The first version of the book, in English, will be published on
December 13, with other language versions following in the New
Year.

<HEADLINE> Report: Cities Step up Pressure on Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- More and more cities in the
United States are cracking down on panhandling and "camping" in
public parks, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It's a dangerous trend, said the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty, an advocacy group for the homeless,
whose report focused on the nation's 50 largest cities.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is people are being punished for being
homeless," said Maria Foscarinis, the center's executive director.
"It's cruel, and it won't achieve the goal."
</P>
<P>
Three out of four cities have anti-panhandling laws, up from 62
percent in the center's last survey two years ago, the report
says. Fifteen cities have passed new laws over the last four
years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also found thirty-eight percent of cities initiated
crackdowns on homeless people in the past several years, and more
than half recently conducted police sweeps, rounding up homeless
people.
</P>
<P>
Half the cities prohibit sleeping or camping in some or all
public places, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, virtually every city has more homeless people
than emergency shelter and transitional housing spaces, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Foscarinis said she understood why cities want to clean up
public places, but she said simply kicking the homeless out won't
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The center's report praised several cities for developing
constructive alternatives.
</P>
<P>
"As opposed to attacking homeless people," the report argues,
"cities should attack homelessness."

WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO took the first formal step on Tuesday to expand its
alliance to include Eastern European countries and then moved
quickly to ease Russia's apprehensions by offering to negotiate a
special charter with Russia and to promote military cooperation
and contacts.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Saudi Arabian government has given the Clinton
administration detailed data meant to support the Saudis' belief
that the June bombing of a U.S. military housing complex in the
kingdom was carried out by Saudi Shiite extremists who were
trained in Lebanon and acted with the support of the Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. current account deficit widened to a record 47.96
billion U.S. dollars in the third quarter from the previous
quarter, but there are signs that the trend may be reversed in the
current three-month period.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Israel's Housing Plan in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat today condemned Israel's plan to build
homes in an Arab neighborhood in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Arafat denounced the move as a
"serious breach" of the Israeli-Palestinian accords. "This is a
very serious breach of what has been agreed upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's accusation came after the Jerusalem District Planning
Commission approved Tuesday the plan to build 132 homes at the
heart of the Ras al-Amud Arab neighborhood. The new Jewish
neighborhood will be surrounded by a 1.8 meter high security
fence when completed.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher today
also expressed concern about Israeli settlement expansion
policies.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference held after his talks with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy, Muasher said that the settlement
expansion, whether in eastern Jerusalem or elsewhere on the
Palestinian territories, would threaten the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials and Israeli opposition figures have
warned that the plan could provoke Palestinian violence similar
to the September unrest that killed over 70 people. The
bloodshed was sparked by Israel's opening of an exit to an
underground tunnel near the Al-Aksa Mosque in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, the PA minister in charge of Jerusalem
affairs, said today that there would be violent response to the
start of construction in Ras al-Amud.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli said they were surprised of the reaction after
the opening of the tunnel. I am telling them now that there will
be the same reaction if they do this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's opposition Labor party's former interior minister Uzi
Baram criticized the housing plan, terming it "a prescription for
trouble."
</P>
<P>
He said the plan would not only spark new Israeli-Palestinian
conflicts, but also create an international problem for the
government. Baram blocked the plan, which was initialed in the
mid-1980s, when he was in office in the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute. The Israeli hardline Likud government has claimed
Jerusalem as its only eternal capital, while the PA wants the
eastern Jerusalem, which was occupied by Israel in the 1967 War,
to be the capital of a future Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns GCC's Stance on Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry
Tuesday severely condemned the stance taken by the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) toward Iran at the Doha summit held on
December 7-9, local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government said the "Doha summit has served the
Israeli regime and alien forces to attain their goals in the
Persian Gulf region," according to today's English-language daily
Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
The GCC's final statement expressed concern over Iran's
deployment of missiles in the region, saying "it poses a threat
to the security and stability of neighboring states."
</P>
<P>
In response, Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that
it is the legitimate right of Iran to guarantee security in the
Persian Gulf as an important international waterway.
</P>
<P>
The daily claims "Iran is the main source of stability in the
region. If there is no security for Iran, there cannot be
security for any other state in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iranian Navy Commander Ali Shamkhani admitted at a
press conference that the Iranian army has already deployed
missile bases on some islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in the statement said that Iran is
not only a signatory to international conventions on
non-production and non-proliferation of the weapons of mass
destruction, but also a pioneer for eradication of such weapons
in the region.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iran strongly supports the non-proliferation and
total elimination of weapons of mass destruction from the
region.
</P>
<P>
The statement also accused Gulf states of triggering an arms
race in the region by contracting huge weapons deals with the
western powers and by building military bases on their
soil.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1981, the GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain boycotted the summit due to its long-standing dispute
with host Qatar over the Hawar islands and sandbanks in the
area.

<HEADLINE> Iran Exports 2 Billion Dollar Non-Oil Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Customs Office
announced here today that Iran exported 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of non-oil goods in the first seven months of this fiscal
year starting from March 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Hussein Vahhaji, head of Iran's Customs Office, said
that the exports of non-oil products from October 22 to November
20 this year showed an increase of 10.5 percent in value and
10.3 percent in weight compared with those of the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Commerce Minister Yahya Al-Oshaq, some 10,000
tons of carpets worth 322 million dollars were exported in the
past seven months.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has tried hard to reduce its reliance
on oil export revenue by boosting export of non-oil goods. The
share of oil export revenue is gradually dropping year by year.
</P>
<P>
Iran planned to earn 5 billion dollars in hard currency from
non-oil exports, but it could export only about 3 billion dollars
worth of non-oil products in the year.
</P>
<P>
Iran plans to earn 5 billion dollars of hard currency from
non-oil product export this year, while the oil export revenue is
expected to reach 18 billion dollars this year.

ATHENS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Taxi drivers in northern Greek
port city of Salonika today went back to "school" to improve the
way they treat customers.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on the matter began today in the city to urge taxi
drivers to learn a smattering foreign languages and how to
administer basic first aid so that they can better meet their
obligations next year when the city becomes cultural capital of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers, who attend the seminars organized by the cultural
capital of Europe organization, will also be instructed on the
history and monuments of the city.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the seminars said taxi drivers will be encouraged
at the seminars to behave in a more "civilized" manner, since they
are among the first to come into direct contact with foreign
visitors and they to some degree reflect the city as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Wants Massive Funds From Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon pins high hopes on
obtaining massive development funds from a "Lebanon's Friends"
conference in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese delegation will table 31 projects with a total
cost of 5 billion U.S. dollars at the donors' conference, Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz told reporters here today. These projects
are "considerably profitable," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the forum indicates "an international responsibility
for helping Lebanon's reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited some 30 countries and
leading international monetary institutions to attend the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced that the Lebanese government has finished
preparations for the conference.
</P>
<P>
He urged Arab countries to take part in the conference, which
was called for by the United States after a 17-day Israeli blitz
in south Lebanon in April, which caused great damage to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Richard Jones, U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, said earlier that
his country is unlikely to offer funding for large-scale
reconstruction projects at the conference will instead focus on
smaller proposals that have social benefits.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the projects are big-massive projects which will
require a donor like the World Bank to look at," the U.S. envoy
told reporters at the end of a Monday meeting with the Lebanese
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the report the Lebanese government prepared for
the Washington conference, the 31 proposed projects range from a
1.2 billion-dollar road rehabilitation project to a 5
million-dollar project to upgrade agricultural schools.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese delegation headed by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,
is due to leave for Washington Friday to participate in the
"Conference of Lebanon's Friends" on December 16. It includes the
foreign, financial and trade ministers and the Central Bank
governor.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM to Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy will visit Jordan in the near future, in an effort to
repair the frayed ties between the two countries and to advance
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first visit by the Israeli foreign minister
to Jordan since the new Israeli government, headed by Likud
chairman Binyamin Netanyahu, assumed power last June.
</P>
<P>
The invitation, from Jordanian Prime Minister Karim Abdul
Kabariti, was extended to Levy this morning by visiting
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher during a meeting
between them in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference following the meeting,
both Levy and Muasher described their meeting as "fruitful and
constructive." The two men pledged to continue the dialogue
between the two countries and work together to get the peace
process out of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Muasher, former Jordanian Ambassador to Israel, said that
Levy's visit to Jordan would be a continuation of the effort "to
strengthen the bilateral contacts, and to push the peace process
forward."
</P>
<P>
He also said that during the meeting he expressed Jordan's
concern over the Israeli government's settlement expansion policy,
which, in his word, would endanger the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Muasher denied any crisis in the bilateral
relations, saying "the crisis is in the Middle East peace
process."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Muasher is also scheduled to hold separate
talks with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Prime
Minister Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Jordan and Israel have strained
since the opening of the Western Wall Tunnel exit by Israel in
September, and Jordan's King Hussein has refused to see
Netanyahu and other Israeli ministers ever since.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Called on Syria to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai Tuesday reiterated his call to Syrian President
Hafez Assad to return to the negotiation table as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister made the remarks during a visit
to the Israeli self-declared security zone in south Lebanon, in
a gesture of support for South Lebanon Army commander Antonie
Lahad.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Lebanese military court sentenced Lahad, whose
army is cooperating with the Israeli troops in the "security
zone," in absentia to death for treason.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai stressed that Israel had no intention of launching
a war against Syria, and on the contrary, was anxious to resume
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to be in a situation where we are
talking about a war," Mordechai said, "We are in a situation
where we are asking and calling on President Assad and the
Syrian government to come and continue the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Matan Vilna'i, Israeli deputy chief of general
staff, said Tuesday that the Israeli army is well prepared for
war.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i's comment was the Israeli army top brass's first
public response to a report in Time magazine, which cited unnamed
senior military sources as saying Israel was not ready for war and
had let its stocks run down and training slacken.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i, one of the key army commanders responsible for
planning Israel's defense, said the army prefers a policy of
long-range planning in which more is invested in building units
rather than stockpiling ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of rehabilitation trainers in
Jerusalem Tuesday, Vilna'i said that the Israeli army brass was
intensively dealing with war preparations.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Egypt Sticks to Mideast Peace Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today stressed the continuation of the indispensable Egyptian role
in the peace process and said it is never biased against Israel.
</P>
<P>
"No one can marginalize the Egyptian role in the region as
without Egypt, the peace process would not have been initiated in
Madrid in 1991," said the president at a press conference at the
Presidential Palace here.
</P>
<P>
Refuting Israeli claims that peace with Egypt was an armed
peace, Mubarak said that it was Israel that spoke of armed peace
and war.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone claims that Egypt does not want peace, it is he who
does not want peace, because the war climate is more beneficial to
him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Late Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat made a historical visit
to Israel in 1977 and two years later diplomatic ties were
established between Israel and Egypt. For the ensuing 10 years,
Arab countries boycotted Egypt, the first Arab country ever to
make peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Calling Egypt "the key to the peace process," Mubarak said it
has paid a high price for peace.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Israel would understand that Egypt
sought regional stability and peace between Palestinians and
Israelis because they are neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no peace and stability, there will be no
development, nor a rise in the living standards, but rather a
return to the vicious circle," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak dismissed charges by Israel that the Egyptian role in
the peace process is unbalanced and unequalized.
</P>
<P>
"This is not true as they want us to pressure Arafat into
accepting their proposals whether the Palestinian public opinion
accept them or not and if Arafat considers them suitable or not,"
said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
In a recent publicity campaign to exclude Egypt from the peace
process in the region, the Israeli Hatsofeh paper has accused
Egypt of lining up with the Palestinians and encouraging a
hardline Palestinian stand towards Israel. It called for the
continuation of the U.S. mediation between the Palestinians and
Israelis and renounced the Egyptian role.
</P>
<P>
Advisor of the Israeli prime minister Dor Gold is due here
today for discussions on major issues of contention, the president
told the news conference.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue is Hebron," he said, adding that the official
was not carrying new proposals.
</P>
<P>
Brushing away the Israeli claim that "only 2 percent" of the
issue left to be finished, the president said the problem
virtually remains unsolved as fundamental points such as hot
pursuit of "terrorists" into Palestinian self-rule areas and joint
patrols have not yet been settled.
</P>
<P>
"More than 80 percent of the problem is still pending and
inconclusive," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak advocated a shuttle tour between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to
make a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu agreed to meet again after a
two-hour discussion on the sidelines of the European security
conference in Lisbon last week.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he accepted the proposal by Israeli prime
minister that preparations be made for Moussa's visit to Israel,
when they conferred over telephone Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the widely-rumored Israeli rejection of such a
mission by Egypt as merely "meant for (Israeli) local
consumption."

<HEADLINE> Food Poisoning Outbreak Claims 11th Victim in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A 70-year-old man has become
the 11th victim in the food poisoning outbreak in Lanarkshire,
Scotland, and an expert has warned that the crisis could result in
up to 100 deaths.
</P>
<P>
BBC television said today that the Lanarkshire old man had been
in hospital suffering the food poisoning caused by the E coli
bacteria since November 30.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that E coli is a common gut bacteria that is
normally harmless, but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be
passed to human via manure or improper slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
Two butcher's shops which were linked to the crisis have been
closed.
</P>
<P>
Professor Richard Lacey, a long-standing critic of the food
industry, said kidney failure could occur months after infection
with the E coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Lacey added that the factory which supplied the butcher at the
center of the crisis should be closed, and other outlets served by
the factory should also be shut down.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of the possible creation of a "super bug" in
which the E coli toxin combined with another bacterium.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM, Iraq Fail to Solve Missile Issue Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, Chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq said here
today that Iraq failed again to permit the remains of its
destroyed missiles to leave the country for analysis.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure at the end of his four-day visit to Iraq,
Ekeus told reporters that "we could not agree on the removal (of
missile remains), as Iraq is not prepared to do it. so we agreed
to remain disagreed and keep the issue frozen for the time being
to address it again at our next political level meeting."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that his talks with the Iraqi side "were very
good spirited and constructive" despite of many difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that some political decision is needed by Iraq to
allow the transfer of its missile remains.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. resolutions after the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq is
not allowed to keep long-range missiles. The UNSCOM wants the
missile remains to be taken out of Baghdad to the United States
for laboratorial test to determine whether Iraq still conceals
some prohibited missiles.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus said that the U.N. believes that Iraq has destroyed 85
long-range missiles in secrecy and is now concerned that some
missiles may have been taken away and hidden in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arms inspector arrived here Sunday with a
seven-member team and is due to leave today. During his visit
here, he held six rounds of talks with Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq
Aziz, which focused on the issue of missing missiles.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his routine visit to Baghdad two months ago,
Ekeus failed for the first time to solve the missile issue with
the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sees the resumption of its limited oil sale Tuesday for
humanitarian purposes as a prelude to a total lifting of
U.N. sanctions imposed on the country for its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council could consider removing the
crippling sanctions against Iraq only after the UNSCOM convinces
that Iraq no longer has weapons of mass destruction, including
long-range missiles banned by the U.N..

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Minister To Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy would visit Jordan in the near future to repair the
frayed Israel-Jordan ties.
</P>
<P>
The invitation, from Jordanian Prime Minister Karim Abdul
Kabariti, was extended to Levy this morning by visiting Jordanian
Information Minister Marwan Muasher during a meeting between them
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first visit by the Israeli foreign minister to
Jordan since the new Israeli government, headed by Likud Chairman
Binyamin Netanyahu, assumed power last July.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Jordan and Israel have become strained
since the opening of the Western Wall Tunnel exit in September,
and Jordanian King Hussein has refused to meet Netanyahu and other
Israeli ministers since.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference following the meeting,
both Levy and Muasher described their meeting as "fruitful and
constructive," pledging to continue dialog between the two
countries, and work together to get the peace process out of the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Muasher, former Jordanian Ambassador to Israel, said that
Levy's visit to Jordan would be a continuation of the effort
"to strengthen the bilateral contacts, and to push the peace
process forward."
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that during the meeting he expressed
Jordan's concern over the Israeli government's settlement policy,
which, in his word, would oppose the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Muasher denied any crisis in the bilateral
relations between Jordan and Israel, saying "the crisis is in the
Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Muasher is also scheduled to hold separate
talks with Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Problems With Oil Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today rejected as
"intentional rumors" the allegations that the just-allowed flow of
Iraqi oil to the Turkish port Ceyhan has been stopped by political
or technical obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid was quoted by the Iraqi
News Agency as saying that the United Nations has made no decision
or instructions to stop the pumping of Iraqi oil. Neither have
there been technical problems in pumping the oil, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said some people might have created the rumors to harm
Iraq. He did not specify.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Iraqi President Saddam Hussein personally opened
the oil pumping pipeline in the northern city of Kirkuk, thus
marking the reflowing of Iraqi oil to the world market after a
six-year halt.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed stringent sanctions on Iraq in 1991 following
the end of the Gulf War to drive Iraqi troops out of its neighbor
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the oil-for-food deal signed by Iraq and
the U.N. in May, Iraq is permitted to sell oil worth 2 billion
U.S. dollars every six months in renewable basis to pay for food,
medicine, and other humanitarian supplies for its sanctions-hit
population.
</P>
<P>
The 986-kilometer-long Iraqi-Turkish twin oil pipeline
connects the Kirkuk fields in Iraq with the Turkish Mediterranean
terminal of Ceyhan.

<HEADLINE> Aleutian Volcano Erupts Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A volcano at the tip of the
Alaska Peninsula erupted Tuesday, shooting ash above 4,500
meters, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Pavlof Volcano is located about 990 kilometers southwest of
Anchorage in the Aleutian volcanic arc. The increase in activity
prompted the Alaska Volcano Observatory to increase its concern
level to red, the top of its scale, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
Pavlof lies along the air route for flights to Asia and its
eruptions can throw ash into the path of passing airliners. But no
flight operations had been affected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pavlof is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian
volcanic arc, with nearly 40 eruptions since record-keeping
start in 1790. Some lasted one to two days and others continued
sporadically for months.
</P>
<P>
The volcano last eruption began in mid-September, sending ash
cloud to 9,000 meters. Ash has drifted over the nearby towns of
Cold Bay, King Cove and Sand Point during the past few months.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Observes Tajikistan Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's special envoy Yuri
Baturin arrived in Tajikistan earlier today to observe a
newly-reached truce between the Tajik government and the
opposition, and prepare for their talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Baturin, who is the Russian Defense Council Secretary and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's aide, is playing the role of
mediator between the Tajik sides.
</P>
<P>
Tajik president Emomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Sayid
Abdullo Nuri signed a ceasefire agreement on Wednesday after two
days of United Nations-sponsored meetings in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The truce, which took effect between Wednesday and Thursday
midnights, followed a recent bout of fighting which claimed scores
of lives in Tajikistan's eastern Garm and Tavil Dara regions.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the two sides agreed to withdraw troops from
the Garm region, northeast of the Tajik capital of Dushanbe, with
only units of the interior ministry left in the towns of Garm and
Labidzhar to police peace.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also undertook to remove their check-points from
the motorway linking Dushanbe and Dzargotal.
</P>
<P>
The truce accord allows the opposition to go from Tavil Dara, a
town on the Tajik-Afghan border, to the villages of Dashtisher and
Saridash.
</P>
<P>
The rival parties also agreed to set up a joint check-point on
the Tajik-Kirghiz border to bar the traffic of arms, drugs and
smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
A government-opposition commission will be set up to oversee
the truce.
</P>
<P>
The Dushanbe-based U.N. mission in Tajikistan hailed the truce
accord and said U.N. observers would go to the disengagement areas.
</P>
<P>
As agreed on, the Tajik sides are expected to hold
negotiations, with the participation of Russia as mediator, in
Moscow on December 19 to seek a final solution to the Tajik
conflict which began with a 1992-93 civil war.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Sees No Progress in Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. envoy for Cyprus Han Sung
Joo wound up his two-day mediation between the Greek and Turkish
communities on the island today, yielding no progress in solving
their rancor.
</P>
<P>
Han, U.N. Secretary-General's special representative for
Cyprus, left here today for Athens to continue his consultations
on the Cyprus problem with Greek officials.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Han had separate meetings with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Wednesday, Han said he
came here as part of U.N. continuing search for progress and
a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he could not claim to have narrowed the gap
between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Han said "I will return before long" for a hopefully improved
situation.
</P>
<P>
"The important point is to create and foster the environment
and conditions for such talks (between the two communities) to
take place," Han added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the two sides have
been held on and off in the past 22 years, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Egypt's Peace Role Helpful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel today praised Egypt for
its assistance to help the parties involved in the Mideast peace
process reach better understanding.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian-Israeli consultations on the peace process will
continue," Dore Gold, advisor for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, said following his talks here with Egyptian Assistant
Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Nabil Fahmi.
</P>
<P>
Following the two-hour talks, Gold said it is beneficial for
Egypt and Israel to exchange views on ways to ensure progress in
the Arab-Israeli negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
"Israel appreciates Egypt's assistance to reach understanding
between the parties concerned," said the Israeli official, who
arrived here Wednesday night on a 24-hour visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Gold discussed with the Egyptian senior Foreign Ministry
officials the latest developments of Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations and major issues of contention, the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The visit came at a time of deepening distrust between
Netanyahu's hardline government and Egypt, which are engaged in
a tit-for-tat verbal warfare on the Hebron issue as well as the
Egyptian role in the regional peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank town of Hebron are
delayed over Netanyahu's demands for better safety of the 500
Jewish settlers who live amid 100,000 Arab in Hebron. Two months
of talks have failed to clear the most contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Israeli claim that "only 2 percent" of the issue
left to be finished, Egypt said the problem virtually remains
unsolved as fundamental points such as hot pursuit of "terrorists"
into Palestinian self-rule areas and joint patrols have not yet
been settled.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa planned to make a shuttle
tour between the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a settlement on
the issue. But Israel put off the visit citing inadequate
preparation time.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has disavowed the accusation that it is biased against
the Jewish state and condemned Israel's attempts to reject its
more active involvement in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> TU Leader on Workers' Right to Democratic Deliberation, Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Trade Union leader
reaffirmed today that workers have the right to deliberate issues
related to their factories and supervise their officials in a
democratic way.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, president of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, said that as the masters of the country and factories in a
socialist society, workers require not only the protection of
their economic interests, but political rights and cultural
fulfilment as well.
</P>
<P>
The workers' political rights can only be achieved through
democratic deliberation and supervision of their enterprise
officials, said Wei, who is also a member of the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
at an ACFTU executive committee meeting which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
He said democratic deliberation and supervision of enterprise
officials represents a major aspect as well as an important form
to display the CPC's guideline of relying on the working class
wholeheartedly. It is also an important embodiment of workers
being the masters politically, and trade unions at various level
should effectively implement their basic avenues in protecting
their workers.
</P>
<P>
Democratic deliberation and supervision should be practised in
all businesses, for enterprises which are in a difficult situation
should make still greater efforts to strengthen supervision by the
workers.
</P>
<P>
Wei asked all the state-owned enterprises, collectively-owned
enterprises, and enterprises whose property rights are dominated
by the state or collectives, to set up and further improve the
system of congresses of workers' representatives. The congress, on
behalf of their workers, should in turn supervise factory leaders
and evaluate their work annually.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU chairman said, "All the 100 enterprises appointed to
experiment with the modern enterprise system should take the lead
in introducing the system."

<HEADLINE> Ramos Concerned Over Raging Debate on Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today expressed concern over the raging debate on whether to
amend the constitution to extend his term beyond 1998, saying that
will divide the society.
</P>
<P>
"The debate, let me say now, is not helping our country any,"
Ramos said at a meeting with businessmen. "It is dividing us at a
time when we should be working together even more closely -- given
the more favorable environment for teamwork and achievement."
</P>
<P>
The president added that he was "troubled" by the confrontation
between supporters and opponents of the charter changes.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest reaction by Ramos to the heated debate over
whether to amend the country's 1987 constitution to lift the term
limit for the president. Under the constitution, the president can
serve only a single six-year term.
</P>
<P>
The campaign for charter changes unfolded last Friday when a
self-styled private group, the People's Initiative for Reform,
Modernization and Action (PIRMA), was established by Ramos'
supporters.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA asked the Commission on Elections to declare a
plebiscite between January 11 and June 11 next year to decide
whether to amend the constitution. It also asked the commission to
allow it to collect some 5 million signatures needed to stage a
plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
The group gained allies one day later when another private
group, the Demokratikong Pagsulong ng Ekonomiya at Nasyonalismo
(DEPENSA), surfaced and supported the PIRMA's charter change
drive.
</P>
<P>
But their calls for charter changes were strongly opposed by
some congressmen, who said they will start a rival
signature-collecting campaign at the grassroots level to oppose
the constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who has repeatedly said in public that he will step down
when his six-year term ends on June 30, 1998, said he has nothing
to do with the charter change drive and will not support it. But
he also said he will not stop the drive.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he rejected calls by his political opponents to
write a vow promising not to seek reelection.

<HEADLINE> China out of Running in Asian Cup Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AL AIN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The last-minute goal by Japan's
Naoki Soma ruined China's slim hope of qualifying for the top
eight at the Asian Cup here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Japan, who had already entered the quarter-final as Group C
leader with two straight wins, took the match as an exercies, but
China, who badly need a draw to advance, looked like a dead
meat through out.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Japan prefered China to get through. A
Draw with China meaned that Asian No. 1 South Korea would be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Both sides focused on defence and it seemed that a draw came
for sure, but one minute from the end, Soma found a leak in
the box and blasted a low drive.
</P>
<P>
With one win and two losses, China, Asian Games runner-up in
1994, has been knocked out of running. It is the worst result for
China in the Cup history.
</P>
<P>
So far, Japan, the Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Iran, Iraq
and South Korea have entered the top eight. The last berth will be
decided after the battle between Uzbekistan and Syria later
today. Uzbekistan, who has one win and one loss, is likely to take
the last spot.

<HEADLINE> 7th PC Plenary Session Issues Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Preparatory Committee for
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) issued a
communique here today at the closing of its 7th plenary session.
The following is the full text of the communique:
</P>
<P>
The 7th plenary session of the Preparatory Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) for the HKSAR was held on
December 12, 1996 in Shenzhen. Vice-Chairman of the Preparatory
Committee Wang Hanbin chaired the meeting while Chairman Qian
Qichen made an important speech.
</P>
<P>
Before this session, the Selection Committee for the first
government of the HKSAR, presided over by the chairman and
vice-chairmen meeting of the Preparatory Committee in Hong Kong,
elected Tung Chee Hwa as the official candidate for the first
Chief Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The session listened to a report delivered by Lu Ping,
vice-chairman and secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee,
on the process of the election of the first Chief Executive
candidate of HKSAR. The session held that the principles of being
open, fair and just were carried out in the process of the
election. The official candidate for the Chief Executive elected
by the Selection Committee has met with general approval by the
Hong Kong society.
</P>
<P>
The session passed the "Report of the Preparatory Committee of
the NPC for the HKSAR on Asking for Appointment by the State
Council of the First Chief Executive of the HKSAR".
</P>
<P>
The session held that the election of the official candidate
for the first Chief Executive is a major event in Hong Kong's
history, marking the beginning of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The session pointed out that with the election of the official
candidate for the first Chief Executive, the preparatory work for
the HKSAR has entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
The chairman and vice-chairmen meeting held during the session
carried out qualification examinations on those who had applied to
join the election of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC),
and confirmed that 130 of them are qualified to be applicants for
membership of the PLC.
</P>
<P>
The session also passed "The Decision of the Preparatory
Committee of the NPC for the HKSAR on the Legislative Issue of
Article 23 in the Basic Law". The session held that drafting of
laws stipulated in Article 23 of the Basic Law should be the
responsibility of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago the British Hong Kong government unilaterally
announced that it would amend the first and second chapters of the
Crimes Ordinance. The session pointed out that this interference
in HKSAR's legislature by the British Hong Kong government openly
violates related regulations in the Basic Law and grossly
infringes upon the legislative power of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The Decision pointed out that should the British Hong Kong
government force through the above-mentioned amendments, the
Preparatory Committee suggests that the NPC Standing Committee, in
accordance with regulations in Article 160 of the Basic Law,
announce at appropriate time that the amendments made by the
British Hong Kong government to the first and second chapters of
the Crimes Ordinance go against Article 23 of the Basic Law, and
therefore will become invalid from July 1, 1997 and will not be
adopted as the law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The session decided that the 8th plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee will be held from January 31 to February 1,
1997 in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Chubb to Insure China's Electronics Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chubb Group, one of the
US's four-largest listed insurance companies, is to increase its
investment in China to develop the insurance market for China's
electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
Though it is a new concept for China to insure the electronics
sector, the booming electronics industry will give a greater boost
to the new business' emergence and development in the country,
said Ian Lancaster, regional manager of Chubb China, at a seminar
held here on risk insurance for the electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other industries, electronics industry runs
greater risks, owing to its greater investment and fierce
competition, said Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
If China gets its electronics industry insured it will develop
into one of the world's leaders in the sector, added Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period China's electronics industry is
expected to grow by an annual rate of 20 percent. The sector's
total industrial output value is expected to reach 300 billion
yuan this year, 700 billion yuan by the year 2000 and up to 5,000
billion yuan by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
China's electronics market capacity reached 320 billion yuan
this year, and will surpass 1,000 billion yuan by 2000, and 6,000
billion yuan by 2010.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the industry, China will give priority to
developing integrated circuits, new components, computers and
products for communications during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
In addition to insurance for electronics items, Chubb also
provides other insurance services in China, involving pillar
industries such as energy, finance, steel and food processing.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to become the world's second-largest market
for insurance business in the coming 10 years, with annual
insurance premiums estimated to be 10 times the present figure.
</P>
<P>
China's present life insurance market capacity is 1.5 billion
US dollars-worth, and the non-life insurance market capacity
reaches nearly 6.5 billion US dollars-worth.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Handle Chinese Currency Trial Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Some foreign financial
institutions in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai Municipality will
be given the green light to handle business in RMB yuan, the
chinese currency, soon, according to a circular issued by the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, today.
</P>
<P>
A set of provisional rules has just come out to guide the
central bank's selection work of the overseas financial
institutions, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
"China will choose only foreign financial institutions in the
Pudong New Area to conduct business in the local currency on a
trial basis, given the fact that the country's banking sector is
still lagging behind that of the developed countries and the
conditions for a full opening of renminbi business are not yet
ripe," said a central bank official.
</P>
<P>
Criteria were set out for foreign financial institutions to
deal with business in the local currency in the circular: They
must have had operational branches in China for at least three
years, have a clean business record and have made profits for the
past two consecutive years before they file applications.
</P>
<P>
A qualified foreign bank branch must have its average
outstanding loans in China stand at a minimum of 150 million US
dollars one year before its application, while the amount for
wholly-owned foreign financial companies, foreign-funded banks and
financial companies has to be kept above 100 million US dollars.
And the loans must account for at least 50 percent of the
institution's total assets in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The applicant is also required to abide by the central bank
regulations on Chinese banks, with its outstanding debt in the
local currency being less than 35 percent of its debt in foreign
hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
"To allow foreign financial businesses to become involved in
dealing in the Chinese currency is conducive to an overall
expansion of their business scopes. It will also sharpen the
competitive edge of domestic financial institutions and further
open up the banking sector of China," said the central bank
official.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, a total of 149 foreign financial
institutions had opened branches in China, including 137 overseas
banks.

An 18-member special force of the Interior Ministry used tear

<HEADLINE> Reception Marks 60th Anniversary of Xi'an Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A reception was held in the
Great Hall of the People here this evening to mark the 60th
anniversary of the Xi'an Incident.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and
head of the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, presided at the reception.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech, Wang cited the Xi'an Incident as a
significant event in China's contemporary history, and said that
it had an important role and impact on the Chinese revolution.
</P>
<P>
On this day 60 years ago Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang
Hucheng launched the Xi'an Incident, which shocked both China and
the world. As a result, a national united front was formed to
resist Japanese aggression. The incident also laid a foundation
for China's final victory in the War of Resistance against
Japanese Aggression, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang said it is of far-reaching significance for China's
revitalization and reunification to review the history and the
appraise the meritorious deeds of Generals Zhang and Yang, adding
that the patriotism of the two generals will inspire the people
for ever.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese nation must unite if it wants to be
prosperous and strong, and to stand tall in the family of nations.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Incident took place on December 12, 1936, when the
two patriotic Kuomintang generals, Zhang Xueliang and Yang
Hucheng, took Chiang Kai-shek hostage and demanded that he stop
the civil war and unite with the Communist Party to fight against
Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National
Committee, together with some relatives of Generals Zhang and
Yang, attended today's reception.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Urged to Play Key Role in Protecting Workers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade unions should
devote themselves next year to promoting ethical and cultural
progress among workers, protect workers' legal rights and
interests, and push forward the implementation of democratic
management in business.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), called on trade
unions at all levels to study the guidelines of the Sixth Plenary
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and to better protect
workers' material and cultural interests.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also the president of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU), made the remark when delivering a speech
here today at an annual meeting attended by ACFTU executive
committee members.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with more efforts being made to re-adjust the
economic structure and deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises,
trade unions are required to play a key role in regulating labor
relations according to the Labor Law, safeguarding workers' legal
rights and interests, and protecting and encouraging workers'
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
On the system of equal consultation and collective contracting,
Wei said that collective contract signing must be done under legal
procedures, and the contents of the contracts should focus on the
major issues related to labor relations of workplaces.
</P>
<P>
The draft of a collective contract must be submitted to and
adopted by the congress of workers' representatives. Labor
contracts signed by workers should be in accordance with the
standards set by the collective contract.
</P>
<P>
Legal inspections were necessary to implement collective
contracts. Once there is a problem, Wei said, quick action
should be taken to solve the problem. The congress of workers'
representatives is authorized to make a decision if a collective
contract needs to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
The equal consultation and collective contracting system, which
helps protect the legal rights and interests of the workers, will
be widely promoted by the trade unions next year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September this year 76,000 enterprises had signed
collective contracts with their employees.

<HEADLINE> Beef Shortage Worsening in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The general shortage of beef
in Zimbabwe is worsening with some cuts now impossible to obtain.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Butchers Association said in a statement today
that the situation is drastically pushing up the average
wholesale cost to the butcher.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the cold storage company increased the wholesale
price of various cuts of beef by between six and 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
''This situation is expected to worsen during the next few
months, as the rains fall and more grass is on the land, thereby
inducing the farmer to restock our already depleted national beef
herd,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Zimbabwe National Association of Master
Bakers today said it is facing a shortage of eggs, an essential
ingredient in the bakery industry.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Commercial Farmers' Union revealed eggs are in
short supply. ''There are no surplus stocks and prices are
increasing,'' the union said.

<HEADLINE> Normalization of Beijing-Pretoria Ties to Benefit Both: CPC Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) said here today that early
normalization of relations between China and South Africa is in
the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
The normalization of Sino-South African ties is the common
desire of the CPC and the African National Congress (ANC) of South
Africa, said Qiao Shi, a standing committee member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, also chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC), made the remark during a meeting
with an ANC delegation headed by Deputy Secretary General Cheryl
Carolus.
</P>
<P>
Qiao extended, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, a
welcome to the ANC delegation, which, he said, is the first to
visit China since the ANC came to power.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the visit would enhance the understanding
and friendship between the two parties and peoples, and
will bring the friendly relations and cooperation to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Carolus said it is the ANC's consistent stand to support the
"one China" policy, and the unification of China. She added the
ANC will continue to play an active role in helping normalize the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-South African ties, Qiao said the two countries are
both developing nations which share the same historical
experiences and are now trying to develop their economies and
shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and South Africa should give each other
support in the political arena and cooperate with each other in the
economic sphere so as to make contributions to world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
During the 1.5-hour meeting Qiao also briefed the visitors on
China's domestic situation.
</P>
<P>
Carolus said the friendship between the ANC and the CPC was
forged in long-term struggles.
</P>
<P>
She told Qiao that her country, which is now struggling to
eliminate hegemonism and racialism, needs to learn from China's
experiences in these aspects.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the current visit of the delegation
would be a fruitful one.
</P>
<P>
The ANC delegation arrived here Wednesday at the invitation of
the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today Li Shuzheng, head of the International Department
of the CPC Central Committee, held talks with Carolus and her
delegation. The delegation is also scheduled to visit Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> ADB Supports Agriculture Research on Regional Basis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) approved here today 5.2 million U.S. dollars in technical
assistance grant to support agriculture and natural resources
research at five international centers in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, however, is financing only half of the total cost of
the research, which is expected to reduce crop failure risks,
lower input costs and increase diversification of crops.
</P>
<P>
The research will be carried out by the International Rice
Research Institute and the International Center for Living Aquatic
Resources Management in the Philippines, the International Potato
Center and the International Center for Research in Agro-Forestry
in Indonesia and the International Crops Research Institute for
the Semi-Arid Tropics in India.
</P>
<P>
The centers will respectively focus on exploiting biodiversity
for sustainable rice pest management, genetic improvement of carp
species in Asia, field testing of true potato seed, policy
research for sustainable upland systems and legume-based
technologies for rice and wheat production systems in South and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
These studies will utilize genetic interventions through
breeding, develop systems that work in natural ecosystems and
promote diversity in cropping systems. The results will lead to
higher farm income and better nutrition for poor farmers.

<HEADLINE> World to Know China Better Through Cultural Exchanges: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The goal of cultural exchanges
with foreign countries is to let the rest of the world understand
China better, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuanchao, vice minister of culture, told a national
meeting on cultural exchanges which closed here today that many
foreigners know little about China, and the Western media has
often distorted and spoken ill of China's situation.
</P>
<P>
"Cultural exchanges with foreign countries are a part of China's
diplomatic work, which is aimed at changing some foreigners'
incorrect views about China by telling them about the positive and
progressive things in our culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
By doing this, a good international environment will be created
for managing China's internal affairs, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Li said that in the current world it is an important task for
China to resist the infiltration of decadent culture from abroad,
as many developed countries have been shipping their values to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
attached great importance to the four-day meeting, which discussed
China's strategy for expanding cultural exchanges with foreign
countries up to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng wrote a letter of congratulations to the
meeting, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and State Councillor Li
Tieying gave instructions for improving the work, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Cultural Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials unveiled a
policy to import more foreign cultural items here today.
</P>
<P>
They were holding a national meeting on cultural exchanges with
foreign countries which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The policy says that the Chinese government will further
encourage foreigners to give performances and hold exhibitions in
China, but it will firmly ban decadent cultural ideas and
practices from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Xue, deputy director of the External Relations Bureau of
the Ministry of Culture, told Xinhua that, based on the principles
of making foreign things serve China, enriching people's cultural
lives and developing the country's cultural sphere, China
encourages the import of the following items:
</P>
<P>
-- Performances and exhibitions given by top-rated foreign
artists and organizations, such as world-famous symphony
orchestras and musical conductors;
</P>
<P>
-- Outstanding artistic performances exhibiting a nation's
traditional and folk cultures;
</P>
<P>
-- Performances that are helpful for improving the Chinese
people's understanding of the arts, such as ballet, symphony and
opera; and
</P>
<P>
-- Cultural and artistic activities that are helpful for
improving relations between China and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Yuan, China bans the import of the
following:
</P>
<P>
-- Artistic activities with contents of opposing China's
socialist system;
</P>
<P>
-- Artistic activities with the goal of splitting China and its
nationalities;
</P>
<P>
-- Artistic activities aimed at interfering in China's internal
affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- Artistic activities that have decadent contents or vulgar
forms;
</P>
<P>
-- Artistic activities that advocate superstition, pornography,
violence or drug addiction; and
</P>
<P>
-- Artistic activities that may do harm to young people's
physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
Yuan added that, as to those arts that have developed unique
forms and are popular on the world scene, such as rock'n'roll,
China will import them in a selective manner, and let specialists
to observe and study them and use them for reference.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture is the only official department that is
authorized to examine and approve foreigners' applications to
carry out artistic activities in China.
</P>
<P>
China also has cultural departments at provincial and
city levels to manage such affairs, according to Yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is not only a big economic market, but
also a big cultural market. The Chinese government welcomes
artists from throughout the world to exhibit their talents in
China and bring top-rated arts to the Chinese people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
with Alexei Alexeyevich Bolshakov, first deputy prime minister of
Russia, at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Li extended a welcome to Bolshakov, adding
that he was looking forward to his working visit to Russia later
this month.
</P>
<P>
He said China is satisfied with Sino-Russian relations in all
fields in recent years, including politics, economics and trade,
science and technology, and culture, which have achieved healthy
and smooth development.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Russia announced this April the establishment
of a partnership of strategic coordination based on equality and
mutual trust and with a vision of the 21st century. This has been
echoed with positive response worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The building of a strategic partnership between China and
Russia is our correct and historical option in view of objective
requirements, and thus is in full conformity with the fundamental
interests of our two countries and peoples, and is conducive to
peace and development in the Far East and the world as a whole,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li said Sino-Russian cooperation has bright prospects and great
potential. The two countries' great reciprocal complementarity in
economics, science and technology has created favorable conditions
for long-term and mutually-beneficial cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he believed that the two sides, by joining
their efforts, can reached the target of 20 billion US dollars in
bilateral trade value by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized that the mutual understanding and close
cooperation between the two sides in international affairs have
significant impact on peace and stability in the region and the
world at large, and on the establishment of a fair and rational
international political and economic new order.
</P>
<P>
Bolshakov said his country is looking forward to Li's
working visit, which, it is believed, will be the official start
of a mechanism for regular meetings between the two countries'
prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
He said the first meeting, which is expected to review the
whole spectrum of bilateral relations and discuss fields and
measures for mutually-beneficial cooperation, will surely give a
new impetus to Russian-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been smooth progress in the establishment of
the Russia-China strategic partnership facing the 21st century,
and in the development of friendly and cooperative relations in
all fields.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthened cooperation is in the interests of the two
countries and their people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Bolshakov, who arrived here Monday on a six-day
visit, has held conscientious discussions on cooperation with the
Chinese side, giving the final touches to the successful
preparations for the meeting of the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides would adhere to the
principle of equality and mutual benefit, and continue their
exchanges of views.
</P>
<P>
Li's wife Zhu Lin also held candid talks with Mrs. Bolshakov,
wife of the Russian first deputy prime minister.

<HEADLINE> 186 Kinds of Energy-Saving Products to Be Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Seven Chinese ministries
today publicized a list of energy-saving machinery and electrical
products which are to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
On the list are 186 kinds of products which are energy-saving
and are believed to generate satisfactory social and economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
This is the 17th list of energy-saving machinery and electrical
products issued in the country since China began to promote such
products in 1982.
</P>
<P>
China has since then terminated the use of 609 kinds of
obsolete and high-energy-consuming machinery and electrical
products, and has developed new ones to replace them.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry
said that China has been giving top priority to energy saving, but
much still remains to be improved in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Many existing machinery and electrical products were
manufactured in the 1970s or even earlier. These products are big
energy consumers, the official added.
</P>
<P>
To maintain sustainable development of the country's economy,
China should make efforts to economize on the use of both energy
and raw materials, he continued.
</P>
<P>
To make more energy-saving machinery and electrical products
available to the general public, China has decided to hold an
international technology and equipment exhibition in November next
year, with the theme of comprehensive use of resources.

MOGADISHU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- At least six people have
been killed and nine others wounded when heavy factional fighting
broke out at Mugambo militia base in southern Somalia on
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses told reporters through VHF field radios that the
forces loyal to Osman Ali Atto attacked the base which they had
lost in October this year to militiamen of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
According to the eyewitnesses, the base has now been retaken
by Osman Atto's followers after engaging in a serious
hand-to-hand fight with the militiamen of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than 10 "technical" battle wagons
from both sides were involved in this latest round of clashes
between the two most contesting sides of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The armed clashes between the two sides began in early March
this year after a year long political misunderstanding between
late Gen. Aidid and his former finance backer, Osman Atto.
</P>
<P>
The clashes are said to have claimed the lives of more than
800 and inflicted wounds on over 2,000, according to statistics

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Basic Telecom Talks: Brittan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Sir Leon Brittan, vice
president of the European Union (EU) Commission, said today that
negotiators have met the challenge of ensuring the conclusion of a
basic telecommunications accord by February 15 next year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released at a press conference this afternoon,
Brittan described the basic telecommunications as "a strategic
industry and a generator of economic growth and employment."
</P>
<P>
"If we are successful in the WTO (World Trade Organization),
basic telecommunications liberalization will spear investment and
the use of new technologies across the globe," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the first WTO Ministerial Conference starting here on
Monday, the EU had plurilateral and multilateral meetings with
other negotiators in an attempt to ensure that the basic
telecommunications deal be clinched by the February 15, 1997
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Brittan pointed out that the meeting in Singapore "was not the
end of the telecom negotiations, but it was an important milestone
in the process."
</P>
<P>
Basic telecom negotiations are part of the unfinished subjects
in the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round.
</P>
<P>
After nearly two years of negotiations, some 50 countries
involved failed in April to meet a deadline to sign a pact in the
rapidly growing sector after the United States said it was
discontent with the offers made by many negotiators including some
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Basic telecom negotiations are aimed at opening the global
basic telecommunications markets worth an annual income of 500
billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Education Ministry will cut subsidy to Pretoria University by 43
million Rands (nearly 10 million U.S. dollars) next year, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government decision will probably reduce funds available
for bursaries and loans, affecting mostly disadvantaged students,
SAPA quoted University Spokesman Mike Smuts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria University received a 66 percent government subsidy
this year, Smuts said, adding, "the university prepared its
preliminary budget at a conservative 62 percent, yet only 59
percent was allocated.
</P>
<P>
"This effectively means the university will have to cut back
17 million Rands (about 3.7 million U.S. dollars) on it already
conservative budget, Smuts said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to government subsidy cut to Pretoria University,
an 8.9 million Rands (about 1.9 million U.S. dollars) subsidy cut
to Rhodes University was also announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Until the latest announcement on subsidy cut to Pretoria
University, the South African Education Ministry has been
declining to tell the reason for the reduction.

mutual assistance and dialogue in the fight against drug and
financial crimes.

production and trafficking cases of narcotics when compared with
the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>

other countries to wipe out these crimes.

against the crimes.
</P>
<P>

nation, adding that they have to deal with the narcotics and
crime situation at all cost.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Meeting Marks 60th Anniversary Of Xi'an Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
speech in Beijing on the 60th anniversary of the Xi'an Incident,
today urged people to unite and concentrate the nation's will,
wisdom, and efforts on rejuvenation, reunification, and
modernization of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was speaking at a meeting in commemoration of an incident
which took place on December 12, 1936, where the Kuomintang
generals, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, took Chiang Kai-shek
hostage and demanded that he stop the civil war and unite with the
Communist Party in a national war against Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is general secretary of the Central Committee of
Communist Party of China, recalled the incident of 60 years ago,
praising the two generals and all those who contributed to the
national cause of independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that reunification of the motherland and the
unity of the ethnic groups is the guarantee of a vigorous, powerful
and prosperous China and these should be the responsibility of
each Chinese person.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the nation has a glorious tradition of loving
freedom, pursuing progress, and maintaining the national dignity
and state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We should carry forward this great patriotic spirit, and
combine patriotism with socialism in building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, in order to make it a strong spiritual
support for national progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Taiwan has been part of China's sacred
territory since ancient times, and that no attempt to separate
Taiwan from the motherland will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that together with us Taiwan compatriots
will continue to develop the cross-straits economic exchanges and
cooperation, advance contacts in personnel and other fields, and
promote the materialization of direct mail, trade, shipping, and
air links between the two sides of the straits," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Taiwan authorities to return to the one China
stand, and to stop their attempts to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was held by the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the United
Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>

He suggested that the committee discuss new types of bilateral
economic and technological cooperation in agriculture, forestry,

China, which has experience in industrial use of scientific
research results, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Urged to Set Free Captured Lebanese in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) leader Foday Sankoh was urged today to release all Lebanese
nationals captured by the RUF since the rebel war began about
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Ambassador Mohamed el Dib made the call when paying a
courtesy call on Foreign Minister Mrs Shirley Gbujama here and
called on her to help appeal to Sankoh, making full use of the
peace accord signed recently between the government and the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
El Dib did not give figures but independent sources said they
could be as high as 15 or more. Most of them were rich Lebanese
businessmen, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
''Now that the peace agreement has been signed and there is
now goodwill on all sides, the RUF should be urged to set them
free,'' the Lebanese envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the Lebanese as rich businessmen were
captured at various parts of the country mainly in the south and
east.
</P>
<P>
Many of the captives are men with scores of women and
children. ''They were mainly diamond dealers and merchants in
agricultural produce,'' the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 Lebanese were killed between 1992 and 1994 when rebels
stormed towns in the south, east and north of the country. The
development led to an exodus of nearly 500 Lebanese in 1994 to
Beirut on charter flights brokered by the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said the whereabouts of the captives could be
traced to areas in the east, particularly in the Kailahun
district still under rebel influence pending disarmament.
</P>
<P>
One source said they are likely to be set free when encampment
of rebels gets underway in a month's time.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Water Accord Paves Way for Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India today
signed in New Delhi a long-cherished Ganges water-sharing accord,
which would remove a major irritant in bilateral relations and
pave the way for closer ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year agreement resolving the nagging issue of Ganges
water- sharing was signed by Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina and her Indian counterpart Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
The water accord could usher in a new era of bilateral
relations by resolving a host of other outstanding issues through
negotiations in a congenial political atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The Ganges dispute has cast a big shadow over relations between
the two countries ever since India built upstream the river its
Farakka barrier near Bangladesh's northern border in 1974,
restricting the river's flow.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka says India releases excess water during the monsoon
season while it diverts much of the river's water during the dry
season, causing severe drought in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Under the new treaty, Bangladesh can get its due share of the
common river. If the water flow at the barrage is below 70,000
cusecs, the two countries will share the water evenly.
</P>
<P>
If the flow is between 70,000 and 75,000 cusecs, then
Bangladesh will receive 35,000 cusecs. If above 75,000 cusecs,
India will be guaranteed 40,000 cusecs.
</P>
<P>
As there has been no water-sharing agreement since the last one
expired in 1988, the 30-year water accord is regarded as a big
triumph for Sheikh Hasina, who took office just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
Soon after coming to power, the Hasina government took the
initiative to resolve the long-standing Ganges problem and
received a positive response from Deve Gowda, who also took office
in June.
</P>
<P>
"The water accord would be a momentous occasion in bilateral
relations and a stepping stone for greater cooperation between
Bangladesh and India," said Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
To Bangladesh, relationship with its immediate big neighbor is
both important and sensitive. The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist party (BNP) has been accusing Hasina of being
pro-India.
</P>
<P>
Hasina has proposed to purchase electricity from India to meet
an increasing power demand, and the proposal was criticized by the
BNP as giving the "switch" to the giant neighbor to muzzle
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The other outstanding bilateral issues are transit rights for
the movement of Indian goods to the north-eastern states through
Bangladesh and tariff concessions for Bangladesh goods in a bid
to narrow the trade gap, which is now heavily in favor of India.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts said that Hasina's visit is bound
to generate a lot of goodwill for promoting bilateral relations
since the major irritant is successfully tackled.
</P>
<P>
"The water-sharing agreement now can be a prelude to other
important deals which both countries have wanted to negotiate but
could not do so in the past due to bitterness against each other,"
claimed an Indian diplomat.

<HEADLINE> French Mediator Arrives in Central African Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A retired French general,
Jeannou Lacaze, arrived today in Bangui, capital of the Central
African Republic, on a mediation mission between the government
and rebels.
</P>
<P>
Mutinous soldiers of the republic are still holding the
terminal of an oil pipeline and a radio-television transmission
center, after four African heads of state arranged a ceasefire
Sunday between the two warring sides of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a source close to the
ceasefire follow-up committee as saying that the arrival of
Lacaze, chief of staff of the French army under President Giscard
d'Estaing and Francois Mitterrand, was a "good thing". This was
because he knew the former president, Ander Kolingba, very well.
</P>
<P>
Kolingba is believed to be behind the mutiny which broke out on
November 15 among soldiers of the Yakoma tribe to which he belongs.
</P>
<P>
Lootings took place early this week in Bangui, but the
situation in the capital was described as calm Wednesday night and
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Mali, Burkina Faso, Gabon and Chad, make up
the ceasefire follow-up committee. They will start their mediation
today between the rebels and President Ange-Felix Patasse, who is
facing the third mutiny this year, all of which have had a tribal
background.
</P>
<P>
France has deployed 1,500 soldiers in Bangui to protect
European expatriates. But Paris has refrained from intervening
this time as it did in two earlier mutinies this year.

<HEADLINE> Health Conference Stresses Principles for Medical Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China should develop medical
care in accordance with its economic development and social
progress, said State Councillor Peng Peiyun here today.
</P>
<P>
She was addressing a national conference on public health,
which closed today.
</P>
<P>
The medical reform should be coordinated with the development
of the socialist market economy while observing the rules of its
own development and adhere to socialist characteristics, she
explained.
</P>
<P>
Peng urged the government and Communist Party officials at all
levels to implement the principle and put medical care on top of
their agendas.
</P>
<P>
She said that at the four-day meeting the important status and
function of medical care in China's economic and social
development had been pointed out, the character of medical care
defined, and the major principles of medical care and the goal for
the next 15 years worked out.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that medical organizations should pursue the
principle of "serving the people" and assume the right attitude
toward the social and economic impacts of their work.
</P>
<P>
She noted that a comprehensive medical insurance system should
be established step by step in urban areas. The pilot cities of
the reform should follow the key principle of introducing a basic
medical insurance system that suits the social development and the
financial capacity of both the people and enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Politics Blocking China's Entry Into WTO: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang expressed the hope today that all members
of the World Trade Organization will adopt a pragmatic approach
and consider economic and trade factors rather than political and
ideological factors with regard to China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The obstruction to China's entry into the WTO comes mainly from
certain countries and the interference to the reinstitution is
political and ideological consideration, although most countries
expect China to be reinstated, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial level WTO conference held recently in Singapore
failed to reach agreement on China's participation in the WTO, and
Shen reiterated China's belief that it can only join the
organization as a developing country, and will not sacrifice this
principle merely for membership's sake.
</P>
<P>
China qualifies for WTO membership completely as far as economy
and trade are concerned, since China's more than a decade of
reforms have brought many parts of its economic and trade
structure in line with international practices, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China would like to join the WTO, he said, and that that will
make the organization more complete. But, even if it is kept
outside the organization, China will continue its reform drive and
increase bilateral trade, and the WTO and certain countries will
suffer as a result.

presidential election, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"They have won," said Agyenim Boateng, The Secretary-General
of NPP on Wednesday, whose candidate John Kufuor won 41 percent

should we lose."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he made a speech in broadcast to the nation in

In the same vein, opposition leader Kufuor said: "the world

<HEADLINE> Leather Consumption Costs Heavily in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is losing about 160
million U.S. Dollars a year to consumption of leather, mainly as
cost for importing raw materials, and the situation has aroused
concern from leather experts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Investigations carried out by some leather experts in 1992
indicated that about 80 million Dollars was lost to leather
consumers in Lagos, the commercial center of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The consumption level has been doubled according to recent
investigations, said Ben Dashe, Provost of the Federal College of
Chemical and Leather Technology.
</P>
<P>
Although the nation has abundant livestocks, hides and skins
are still being imported by tanneries from Burkina Faso and Niger
Republic, he said, quoted by local press reports.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on the federal government to come out with
a strong policy on leather with a view to regulating its
consumption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Any delay in controlling the consumption level of the
commodity might lead to the collapse of the leather industry, he
warned, adding that five enterprises have already closed down due
to increase in production cost.

TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran denied once again any
involvement in bombing a U.S. military complex in Dharan, Saudi
Arabia, last June, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
A senior Iranian official to the U.N. reportedly issued a

sort in the bombing."
</P>
<P>
The truck explosion killed 19 U.S. soldiers and wounded
hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
"These press reports are invariably based on conjectures and
cynical speculations and deplete of any specific attribution and
or evidence," the statement said.

<P>
ABC television network of the United States last Friday
claimed in a report that six Saudis accused of involvement in
last June's bombing of the U.S. military complex in Dharan have

<P>
SEOUL, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The deal toll of Wednesday's
coal mine accident in Taebaek City, Kangwon Province, has risen to
four after another body was uncovered, reports reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
However, 11 mine workers are still trapped under rubble in a
pit of the Tongbo Coal Mine, some 200 kilometers east of Seoul,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place Wednesday morning when the roof of the
pit collapsed at a depth of 335 meters and about 3,000 meters from
the entrance of the mine due to a rush of underground water.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people, including miners, fire-fighters and
police, are trying to rescue the trapped miners, some of them
possibly still alive, but little progress has been made due to the
piles of watery coal at the entrance of the collapsed pit, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
In August 1993, a similar accident occurred at the mine,
killing five miners.
</P>
<P>
The mine, which has 950 employees, opened in March 1982 and
produces 37,500 tons of coal a month.

the four years' jail term imposed by Malaysia's High Court at Shah
Alam, near here today.
</P>
<P>
The convicted Mohammad Khalafi, 28, from Teheran, was jailed
for four years on each charge by judge Faiza Tamby Chik who
ordered the sentence to run concurrently from the day he was
arrested and detained on March 5, 1992, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad had pleaded guilty to the amended charges of
possessing 925 grams of cannabis resin (also known as resin Indian
hemp) and 539 grams of raw opium on March 5, 1992 at the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport in Subang.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad, who was represented by Karpal Singh, was originally
charged with trafficking under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drug
Act which carries the mandatory death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The court decided to amend the charges after considering the
chemist's evidence that there was no difference between raw opium
and cannabis resin as defined in Section 2 of the Dangerous Drugs
Act, Bernama quoted Justice Faiza as saying.
</P>
<P>
The judge said he considered Mohammad's young age when he
committed the crime and since it was his first offense the court
decided to impose a lesser sentence.
</P>
<P>
Karpal said Mohammad had no previous criminal record and urged
the court to be lenient.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad, who showed no outward emotion when the court passed
the sentence, said outside the court through an interpreter from
the Iranian embassy here that he wanted to return to Teheran as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Receive Military Equipment from US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will receive 100 million
U.S. dollars worth of U.S. military equipment Saturday as part of
Washington's defense security assistance program to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein and Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti were
likely to attend the hand-over ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The equipment, which includes tanks, personnel carriers and
other defense devices, would be formally handed over to the
Jordanian Armed Forces in a ceremony at the Jordanian port city of
Aqaba Saturday, U.S. Ambassador Wesley Egan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The equipment is already at Aqaba and is being unloaded at
the port," Egan said, adding that the only item missing in the
package is a C-130 Hercules transport plane, which will be flown
to Jordan soon.
</P>
<P>
The equipment comes in line with the assistance program signed
by U.S. President Clinton in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The most significant development in the U.S.-Jordanian military
relations came last month when Clinton granted Jordan the status
of a non-NATO ally of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
This entitled Jordan for "priority consideration" for its
requests for defense needs and to receive advanced U.S. military
equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was expected to present to the U.S. a list of equipment
and technology that it would like to have as part of the
Kingdom's program to modernize and upgrade its armed forces,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East has been the main area where the U.S. pours its
arms. It sold arms to Israel as well as the Arab countries to
form a military balance that might benefit the Americans.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Become Filling Station for China's Oil Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China has become a major contributor to the
country's economic growth, with its expected yield of 14.15
million tons of crude oil this year, up 12 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that Xinjiang is serving as a 'filling station'
in the country to guarantee the national economic development,"
said Yang Suming, a regional senior expert in macro-economic
studies.
</P>
<P>
The multi-ethnic region covers 1.6 million square kilometers,
about one-sixth of the country's total. Oil and natural gas
deposits are found in 784,000 square kilometers of the area,
mainly in its three basins of Tarim, Junggar and Turpan-Hami.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that Xinjiang possesses 30 percent of the
country's total oil resources and 34 percent of the gas resources.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corporation predicted that
Xinjiang's verified oil and natural gas reserves will reach three
billion tons and 510 billion cubic meters, respectively, by the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of Xinjiang's annual oil output will rise from
the present nine percent of the nation's total to 16 percent by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Zhongjian, deputy general manager of the corporation, is
optimistic about oil prospecting in the Tarim Basin, the largest
of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
"Tarim stands at the threshold of being proved," Qiu said. "Our
efforts to look for big oilfields are about to be repaid in the
coming harvest season."
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin, as large as the state of Texas in the United
States, experienced a surge of discoveries this year: of all the
wildcat wells, 11 were tested to have gushed high-yielding oil,
while another well showed good signs of oil.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Info-tech Action Plan Suitable to Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Information
Technology (IT) action plan will not be a "cut-and-paste" exercise
of other countries' IT policies, Permanent Secretary of the
Malaysian National Information Technology Council Tengku Azzman
Shariffadeen said today.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian IT plan expected to be drawn at next week's
National Info-tech '96 Conference here would take into account the
country's unique social, political and economic set-up, he said at
a news conference here in a run-up to the Info-tech conference.
</P>
<P>
"Ours will not be a cut-and-paste IT plan. We are aware of what
other countries are doing in terms of their IT development but
let's not be overly impressed with them," said Azzman, who is also
the Chief Executive Officer of the Malaysian Institute of
Microelectronics Systems Corporation.
</P>
<P>
He said steps must be taken to overcome the lingering fear of
Malaysians towards IT with all sectors of the society playing
their respective role.
</P>
<P>
He called upon info-tech companies to explore ways to make
IT-related products like computers more accessible to the public
by lowering down substantially their prohibitive prices or service
charges.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian opposition leader Lim Kit Siang, who will be one of
the panelists during Info-tech's discussion sessions, urged the
government to consider adding another objective to Vision 2020,
which sets the target for Malaysia to become an advanced country
by then, to aim for a Knowledge Society which would provide an
environment for lifelong learning for all Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Lim said such an environment was to enable Malaysians to have
access to the widest variety of learning opportunities and tools
to succeed in the new global economy of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The discussion sessions of the three-day Info-tech conference
are arranged to serve as a forum for Malaysians to contribute to
the process of formulating the national info-tech policies and
action plans.
</P>
<P>
The conference starting December 18 is scheduled to be opened
by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

<HEADLINE> 28 Drug Traffickers Arrested in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese police have arrested
28 persons including police officers alleged to be involved in an
international narcotics trafficking ring, according to the Hanoi
police department.
</P>
<P>
The department said among those arrested, five were police
officers, one border guard officer and one Lao national.
</P>
<P>
Vu Xuan Truong, a major colonel who was the former deputy chief
of the Anti-Drug Bureau of the Economic Police Department, and Vu
Huu Chinh, a senior lieutenant colonel who was former chief of the
Economic Crime Investigation Bureau of the Investigative Police
Department of the Interior Ministry were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
The ring was first exposed last year after a 37-year-old Lao
national Sieng Pheng was caught red handed carrying 15.5 kilos of
heroin from Laos to his contact in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Sieng Pheng's confession led to the arrests of other persons
involved. The investigation of the case which is one of the most
serous cases in Vietnam, is still unfolding, according to the
police department.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Become Filling Station for China's Oil Industry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The daily output of the highest-yielding well among the 12 has
reached 244 tons of oil and 240,000 cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Those wells further proved the Dawanqi, Jinan, Luntai and other
structures in the basin to be rich in oil resources, where some
large and medium-sized oilfields are taking shape, according to
Liang Digang, a petro-geologist with the Tarim Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Strategic prospecting achievements have been made in the
Junggar Basin north of Xinjiang. The three oilfields of Xiaoguai,
Shixi and Mahu are nearly ready for verification as a result, each
with a total of 100 million tons of controlled geological reserves.
</P>
<P>
Breakthroughs have also been made in the eastern part of
the basin. A rich oil-bearing area of 54 square kilometers is
already under control in Wucaiwan. And in Hutubi County, a large
gas field has been discovered with 35 billion cubic meters of gas
reserves in an area of 95 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Turpan-Hami Basin, along the famous Silk Road, is keeping
pace with the other two basins in oil resources discoveries.
</P>
<P>
The area of Lukeqin, located near Aydingkol Lake in the middle
of Turpan, has proved to be a new oilfield with more than 50
million tons of reserves, ranking among the eight important
discoveries of China's oil exploration in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Xinjiang has a total of 1.9 billion tons of proved oil
reserves and 356.7 billion cubic meters of gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Xinjiang obtained a net increase of 5.8
million tons of crude oil compared with 3.6 million tons reported
in the rest of China, making up for the gradual decline of the
national oil output caused by the outdated operation of oilfields
in the eastern areas.

<HEADLINE> A Crucial Year For A Greener China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China's forestry industry took
an exciting step forward in 1996, the first year of the Ninth Five
Year Plan, by planting 4.9 million hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
This brought the amount of forested area to more than 20
million hectares, an obvious improvement in the ecological
conditions. Part of this was the Three North Shelterbelt System,
the largest ecological project in the world, which finished its
second stage this year.
</P>
<P>
The 18,000-km Coastal Shelterbelt System contributed a great
deal to the fight against typhoons and has proven effective. And
four new large shelterbelt projects in seriously eroded,
ecologically unsound areas started this year, meaning that the ten
key ecology projects are under way, covering more than 60 percent
of the country's land surface, most of that in windy and dusty
areas.
</P>
<P>
There are 41 new forest parks established, bringing the total
figure to 790, and China began a nationwide wildlife survey for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
The number of nature reserves in China is 574, and they have
better conditions and a better understanding of
wildlife-protection. The improvement in the forestry sector mean
brighter prospects for the ecology and environment in the next
century, and a greener China will mean a better China.

Nigeria by the U. S. government, and is helpful to promote
cooperation between the two countries in the fight against the

exchange rates in the 1997 budget to reaffirm its commitment to
transparency. Under the dual exchange rate system, all government
business transactions are carried out at the official rate of 22
Naira to one U. S. Dollar while manufacturers and other foreign
exchange end-users have to have a one Dollar to about 80 Naira
rate at the swap market.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Both passenger and freight
volume at Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai, China's largest city, set
new records through November of this year.
</P>
<P>
There were 92,506 flights in and out of the city in the first
11 months, with 335 on the busiest day.
</P>
<P>
The airport handled 11.42 million passengers and 372,400 tons
of cargo during the period, an average increase of 15 percent
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's increased air traffic partly results from an
expansion project that was completed last month. The floor space
of the domestic terminal building at Hongqiao Airport has been
increased to 51,000 square meters, 2.4 times the old one, and a
new 80,000-sq-m apron project has also been completed.

<HEADLINE> Successful Enterprise Reforms in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Liuzhou city, an industrial
base of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has had some success
in reforming its medium-size and small enterprises by
incorporating them into big enterprise groups this year.
</P>
<P>
Liuzhou has given priority to developing large enterprises and
group companies as the backbone of the local economy, using a
contract, lease, trusteeship, merger, or incorporating system to
get smaller enterprises out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Of 19 money-losing companies, 14 began to show a profit,
according to officials from the city's Economy and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the municipal government, 25 medium-sized and
small companies in machinery, electronics, textiles, transport,
commerce, and light industry were selected as pilot share-issuing
or cooperative companies.
</P>
<P>
Liuzhou is a major light industrial, machinery, and textile
producer. It plans to complete its reforms in a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
Incorporating Medium-sized and small enterprises into big
enterprise groups and giving greater freedom to them are major
government measures for improving state-owned firms, which are
considered pillars of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Complaints on Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The China Consumers
Association says that complaints about consumer goods in the third
quarter of this year were up 20.6 percent over the same period of
1995, with daily-use items topping the list of 135,314 complaints.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that this shows the legal awareness of the
common people has been greatly enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Daily-use items accounted for 31 percent, with shoes making up
58 percent and clothing, 23 percent. Food was steady at 22.7
percent; 40.5 percent covered cigarettes, wine, and soft drinks;
and 35 percent, meat and fish.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, there were 415 reports of property and life
losses. Faulty consumer goods caused property damage worth 3.44
million yuan, 912 people injured, and seven people killed.
</P>
<P>
These included 218 exploding beer bottles that injured 162
people, seriously injured 18, and killed one. Vehicles were
responsible for nine injuries and three deaths.
</P>
<P>
There were also 11 food poisoning cases, affecting 688 persons,

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Control Plastics Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will soon put imports
of plastic products under control because they are contributing
to environmental degradation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Environment and Natural Resources Minister William Harrington
said here on Wednesday that his ministry will soon move
legislation to control the plastics import, according to today's
Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted him as saying that he will push for
high customs duty on imported plastic products to discourage
their importation.
</P>
<P>
He made the speech when launching the "operation war on
illegal waste dumping".
</P>
<P>
The minister asked the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ)

<HEADLINE> New Challenges for China's Medical Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The population growth, aging of the population, changes in the
disease distribution, and the upgrading of medical techniques and
medicine have resulted in the continuous increase of the medical
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the first case of HIV infection was
reported in 1985, the number of reported cases of HIV/AIDS in
China have increased to 4,305, including 131 patients with
full-blown AIDS. Scientists said that the actual number of AIDS
cases in China might be as high as 50,000 to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The reported cases of venereal disease have increased to 1.74
million, while estimates of the actual number stand at between 1.5
to three million.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that insufficient government funding
is a major problem facing the development of medical care. The
government's investment in the sector only accounted for a small
proportion of the gross national product, which is equal to the
middle or low level of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the distribution of the medical resources is
unbalanced; some resources are not fully utilized and many are
wasted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the government's total investment in
health care in 1994 was 14.7 billion yuan, or 2.02 percent of the
national financial expenditure; the investment in the capital
construction of health care was six billion, or 1.1 percent of the
total amount of capital construction fees.
</P>
<P>
He said the inappropriate funding system used for medical
facilities, the overuse of hi-tech and expensive medicine and
medical equipment, and unnecessary medicines and medical
examinations are the major causes for the large increases in
medical costs.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that another problem for the development of
medical care is the wide gap in medical standards between the
urban and rural areas, and between the developed and
underdeveloped regions. Many poor rural residents cannot receive
even the most basic medical services, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey on the 30 poverty-stricken counties, the
death rate of infants in the counties is 52 per thousand, and the
mortality rate of the pregnant women and new mothers is 217 per
100,000. Both figures are more than double the average level of
the country's rural areas.

<HEADLINE> US Hopes Lebanon's Friends Forum To Be Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Robert Pelletreau,
U.S. assistant secretary of state for Middle East affairs, has
expressed the hope that a forum of donor countries to be held in
Washington next Monday on economic assistance for Lebanon will
be "very successful," local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau was quoted by An-Nahar daily as saying that the
conference of Lebanon's friends will be a "positive and good
event at the right time."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the conference is held after President Bill
Clinton won a second term and Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri formed his new government.
</P>
<P>
"It is very suitable to hold the conference and focus on
Lebanon, where it is, what it has achieved and what its
future plans are," Pelletreau said in an interview with the
Beirut Arabic daily in Washington Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. official refused to link the conference with
a possible lift of a 10-year-old U.S. travel ban regarding
Lebanon, noting that the Clinton administration has not taken any
decision on the lift.
</P>
<P>
He stressed an "importance" to separate the issue of the
friends of Lebanon conference and the issue of the American
travel ban on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We are all looking forward the day when the limitations
on the travel can be eased. These limitations are basically
out of fears for security only. There is no political
reasons behind these limitations," the U.S. official noted.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials have hoped that during the December 16
conference, Washington will announce a decision to lift the
ban as a Christmas gift to the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban was imposed by the U.S. government in the 1980s
following a series of hijackings of passenger planes to Beirut
and terrorist attacks on U.S. interests in Lebanon and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, the mastermind of Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction
plans, is to leave for Washington Friday at head of a Lebanese
delegation, which includes several government ministers.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will present to the participants of the
conference a report of five-year plans, including 31
reconstruction and development projects estimated at a cost of 5
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Welfare Party Dissatisfied With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Islamist Welfare
Party deputies have expressed their strong dissatisfaction with
the decision by the Supreme Military Council (SMC) to sack 69
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News reported today that the
parliamentarians said the SMC move showed that as a country,
Turkey is far from a genuine democracy since the courts cannot
reverse a decision made by the highest military level.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a SMC meeting chaired by Turkish Islamic Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan, also chairman of the Welfare Party
(RP), removed 69 servicemen, including 58 Islamic
fundamentalists, from the army for being involved in Islamic
fundamentalist activities and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mehmet Sadik Atlay, a former Air Force colonel, said
no officer should be expelled from the army without legal
procedure, noting that it is unreasonable that a parliament
resolution could be reversed by the Constitutional Court but a
SMC decision is beyond judicial review.
</P>
<P>
According to article 125 of the Constitution, the decisions
made by the SMC are not appealable in courts.
</P>
<P>
If these officers were removed from the armed forces only
because of their religious belief, this would be totally
unacceptable and would reflect a "primitive mentality," a
deputy from Istanbul said.
</P>
<P>
Oguzhan Asilturk, deputy chairman of the RP parliamentary
group, suggested that to avoid such injustice, efforts should be
made by all parties represented in the parliament to amend the
Constitution to make the SMC decisions appealable.
</P>
<P>
Some RP deputies were reportedly drafting a motion to call
for cuts in the Defense Ministry's proposed 1997 budget, a
gesture to express their indignation.

provide debt relief for HIPC in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank news released reported that the bank's board of

The HIPCs are those countries that are eligible for assistance
only from the IDA and face an unsustainable debt situation even
after the full application of current debt relief mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary assessment of the debt burdens of 41 heavily
indebted poor countries determined that 20 countries have debt
levels that are an obstacle to growth and poverty reduction even
when countries pursue sound policies.
</P>

Heavily indebted countries include Bolivia, Burundi, Cameroun,

<HEADLINE> Mugabe on Zimbabwe's Economic Indigenization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe said
money raised from selling shares in privatized parastatals to the
Zimbabwean majority will be invested in new black-owned
businesses, the Daily Herald paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Herald, Mugabe said that
the government had implemented several stages of the new policy
on privatization set by the ruling ZANU (PF) party two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of parastatals, with the money raised being lent
to indigenous entrepreneurs at low rates of interest, is one of
the three plans of the indigenization program.
</P>
<P>
The other two are creating the necessary climate to allow
small and medium businesses to flourish and persuading targeted
multinationals to allow indigenous participation in management
and ownership, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the privatization leg of the triad, parastatals are first
being commercialized, to make them viable business enterprises.
This has already been done with three companies.
</P>
<P>
The next stage was for the government to sell shares,
retaining around 20 to 25 percent so as to be able to monitor the
vital concerns from the inside, he said.
</P>
<P>
Significant share-holdings will be sold to targeted indigenous
groups, such as small-scale producers and other producer groups
and strategic partners, such as outside investors who could bring
in further investment and modern technologies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said by targeting indigenous groups as buyers of
shares, the government will ensure greater participation in the
mainstream economy by the majority.
</P>
<P>
But the indigenization program will receive an extra boost
when the government places some of the money raised by share
sales with the National Investment Trust Fund, to be used to
empower blacks who want to start businesses in other areas, he
stressed.

clinched a historic deal on the sharing of Ganges water, which
will remove a major irritant in the bilateral relations in more
than two decades.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, valid for 30 years, was signed by Indian Prime
Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and visiting Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina on the third day of the latter's official visit to
India.
</P>
<P>
Gowda and Hasina signed the pact after two rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had argued over the sharing of the Ganges
water ever since 1970 when India constructed a dam at Farakka,
West Bengal, which is said to have caused water shortages in
Bangladesh, especially in the lean season between January and May.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral agreement was signed in 1977 on sharing the waters
in Farakka region for five years, which expired in 1988 after two
renewals.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for a new pact dragged on for years as India had
insisted that a solution to the dispute should be linked to
India's transit right through Bangladesh to its eastern states.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for a once-for-all solution brightened a few months
ago when new governments were installed in both countries in June.
</P>
<P>
In a significant gesture, India agreed to separate the
water-sharing problem from the transit issue, giving a major boost
to the negotiations on the prolonged dispute.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries and external affairs ministers of the two
countries exchanged several visits in the past few months and
paved the way for a summit to sign the landmark deal.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Improve Ties With Ethiopia: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is determined to
maintain and further enhance its relationship with the sister
country of Ethiopia, Kenyan ambassador to Ethiopia Geoffrey
Muriithi has said.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by the Kenyan ambassador in an interview
with "The Ethiopian Herald" on the occasion of the 33rd
anniversary of Kenya's Independence Day which falls on today.
</P>
<P>
Muriithi said, "after 33 years of independence, Kenya has
registered a high level of development in the political, economic
and social fields."
</P>
<P>
Kenya is also living in peace with itself and also with its
neighbors through the policy of good-neighborliness, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Talking on bilateral ties with Ethiopia, the ambassador said,
within a framework of good-neighborliness and mutual benefit and
trust, the two countries have signed agreements on trade, visa
abolition, road transport, air services and others on the basis
of regular ministerial consultative meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We also have a joint border commissioners and administrators
consultative committee which monitors and resolves day-to-day
matters in the border areas on behalf of the governments of our
two countries," the ambassador said, adding that "the two
governments are currently working on modalities for widening the
scope of cooperation to include many other areas as well."
</P>
<P>
Referring to trade between the two countries, the ambassador
said the trade between Ethiopia and Kenya has been growing
steadily in volume and in value, especially in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, in 1995 the volume of trade
between the two countries indicated that Ethiopia was Kenya's
number three partner in the whole of Africa and number six in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Kenya imports leather goods, textiles, cylinders, wines and
spirits, spices, marbles, works of art and other products from
Ethiopia. Kenya also exports various manufactured products to
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, our two governments are working jointly to up-date
the trade agreement in order to conform to the present day
realities and to boost further the level of exchange," the
ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
On December 12, 1963, Kenya disengaged from British colonial
administration and declared a republic. Today it marks the 33rd
anniversary of kenya's independence from British colonial rule.

<HEADLINE> Election of HKSAR Chief Regarded As a Model in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Local media and many celebrities in
Macao said the successful election of Tung Chee Hwa as the
candidate for the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) should be a model for Macao.
</P>
<P>
Almost all major Chinese newspapers frontpaged the news of
Tung's election today, and some praised the election in its
commentary as "just, open and fair", and should be a model in
selecting the first Chief Executive for the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) in the future.
</P>
<P>
A front-page editorial in the Macao Daily News said the first ever
election of a chief executive in Hong Kong by its own people is a
encouraging news to Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
"The unprecedented event is open, fair and just," said the
editorial. "Now that the HKSAR government has its 'head', a solid
foundation has been laid for the implementation of the policy of 'one
country, two systems,' 'Hong Kong governed by Hong Kong people,' and
'high autonomy'."
</P>
<P>
Another commentary in the "Tai Chung Pou" newspaper praised the
election as a first step of real democracy in Hong Kong, and "a
milestone of a new epoch in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The "Correio Sino-Macaense" newspaper said Tung's winning is not
only a glory for himself, but also a glory for the six million Hong
Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
"It offered a valuable experience for Macao residents to learn
from," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many celebrities in Macao have voiced support for
Tung, and said his winning is positive news for Macao.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, who sent a
congratulatory message to Tung on Wednesday, said that the successful
election of a chief executive shows that Macao could also follow suit
in selecting a future MSAR chief executive.
</P>
<P>
"Macao should select a chief executive for the MSAR according to
the spirits of the Macao basic law," said Ma, who is also
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). "But the experience in
Hong Kong is a handy model to follow."

<HEADLINE> New Challenges for China's Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China's health care system
will face historic new opportunities as well as rigorous
challenges during the growth of the socialist market economy,
according to a top health official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a four-day national public health conference, which
will close this afternoon in Beijing, Minister of Public Health
Chen Minzhang said that the Chinese government has listed the
development of medical care as one of the major tasks for the
beginning of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that society will reach a common understanding for the
need to improve people's health, and that individual health care
expenses will make up a larger proportion of people's incomes in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Lastest information from the ministry shows that the mortality
rate of infants went down to 36 per thousand from 250 per thousand
in 1949. And the mortality rate of pregnant women and new mothers
has dropped to 62 per 100,000 people, down from 1,500 per 100,000
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Various kinds of infectious and endemic diseases and
parasitosis have been brought under control, and the incidence and
death rates of the common illnesses have also dropped. The average
life expectancy has gone up to 70 years, double the figure before
the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, about 190,000 medical facilities had been
built across the country, with 5.37 million medical workers,
including 1.33 million rural medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that changes in the disease distribution will
bring new problems to the medical work.
</P>
<P>
Many chronic non-infectious diseases, such as cardio- and
cerebral vascular diseases and tumors have become the major
threats to people's health, now that the infectious and endemic
diseases are under control.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the incidence rate of diseases caused by
environmental pollution and poor nutrition, occupational diseases,
venereal diseases, and HIV/AIDS are on the rise, he said.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: U.S. Position as Alliance Chief Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1996 is marked
by two distinctive characteristics -- the tendency for
multipolarization becoming stronger and the United States position
as chief of the Western Alliance being challenged.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which poses as the world leader, has always
tried to impose its political will upon others and acted
arbitrarily in economic affairs, regardless of the interests of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
With its major rival for world hegemony collapsed at the end of
the Cold War, the U.S., the only superpower today, has become more
eager to practice power politics in the world.
</P>
<P>
The United States has tried more conspicuously to seek
hegemonism this year, but at the same time has aroused fiercer
resistance to its power politics. Even its allies have shown
increasing independence, and sometimes resistance to the U.S. in
international affairs, putting it in an embarrassing position.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, Mexico lodged a protest against
a U.S. decision to restrict the export of Mexican vegetables to
the U.S., and accused the U.S. of violating the North America Free
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Later, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that a U.S.
legislation which restricts Venezuela's oil exports to the United
States violates the principle of free trade and discriminates
against foreign products.
</P>
<P>
At the end of February, the U.S. intensified its sanctions
against Cuba for shooting down two U.S. planes that had violated
Cuba's territorial air space. In March, the U.S. congress passed
the Helms-Burton law extending the sanction to all countries that
have trade and economic relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In August, the U.S. congress passed the D'Amato law to
intensify sanctions against Iran and Libya. Under the law, the
U.S. would punish foreign companies investing in the oil and gas
industries of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two laws immediately caused strong opposition from allies
of the United States. Canada, in alliance with Latin American
countries, passed a resolution at the Ibero-American summit,
condemning the Helms-Burton law, the first time in the history of
the organization.
</P>
<P>
The bills were also strongly condemned by U.S. allies in West
Europe, such as Germany, Britain and France, which criticized the
sanctions as "absurd and unjustifiable." They warned that if the
U.S. continued to go this way, they would adopt "collective
retaliatory measures."
</P>
<P>
The European Union sued the U.S. in the WTO against the law in
early October. And after scrutiny of U.S. trade policies, the WTO
made it clear in mid-November that the two sets of legislation
were U.S. practised outside its territory, and hence decided to
set up an arbitration committee on the "Helms-Burton" law.
</P>
<P>
The United States has long had disputes and wrangles with its
allies over their respective economic interests. The dispute this
time, however, is different.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. passed the two laws not out of consideration of its
economic interests, but in an attempt to cut off the economic
relations of the three countries with the outside world so as to
attain its political and strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the United States wanted its allies to
sacrifice their economic interests to serve its own political
interests, a method that might work during the Cold War period
when the U.S. played the role as patron of Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Western countries nowadays, however, put their national and
regional interests first, and are unwilling to sacrifice their own
interests to serve the United States as before.
</P>
<P>
In modern world affairs, developing countries have made more
efforts to join forces in opposing hegemony, and more Western
countries have begun to make their own decisions independently. This
is particularly obvious in the United Nations affairs this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States announced in June its objection to the
re-election of incumbent Boutros Boutros-Ghali as
U.N. secretary-general. It has not only aroused criticism from
developing countries, but also from Britain and France, two
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States threatened time and again to resort
to its veto power on the issue, 14 members of the 15-member
U.N. Security Council voted in mid-November to support
Boutros-Ghali for a second term.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.N. General Assembly this year passed a
resolution by 137 to 3, demanding that the United States lift its
three-decade-long blockade against Cuba. Noteworthily, only the
U.S. and two other countries voted against the resolution, while
most of its allies stood on the side of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
That the U.S. was so isolated in the U.N. was something never
previously seen in the history of the world body.
</P>
<P>
Another example of the isolated position of the U.S. in
international affairs is its air attacks on Iraq in September.
The attacks prompted strong condemnation from other countries, in
particular, from Arabic countries, and received little support
from U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
It is an inevitable outcome of the development of post-Cold War
international affairs that U.S. allies challenge its position as
chief of the alliance and demonstrate more independence in
handling international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., in maintaining its interests worldwide, pursues
"monolateralism" and forces its will on others while pushing its
global hegemonic policy. This aggravates its disagreements with
developing countries and causes friction and clashes with its
allies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been isolated time and again in international
affairs this year, which demonstrates the tendency of faster
multipolarization throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Air Controllers Persist in Go-slow Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan air traffic
controllers have claimed that they would continue their go-slow
action unless their demands are met, the Daily Nation reported
today.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 air controllers, aeronautical engineers and
information officers met on Wednesday at Nairobi's arboretum and
insisted that they would not resume duty until their demands are
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the meeting said, "we will report to the
airport on Friday at 9 a.m. local time, where they should either
announce they have met our demands or give us our sacking."
</P>
<P>
The striking air controllers claimed that Permanent Secretary
Stanley Murage of the Ministry of Transport and Communication,
and Director of Civil Aviation J. Ayuga had refused to have a
dialogue with them.
</P>
<P>
More airlines have threatened to divert their operational
route from Kenya if the air traffic controllers' strike
continues.
</P>
<P>
Many airline operators complained of having lost a lot of
business, saying that hundreds of passengers had cancelled their
bookings while others had experienced difficulties in connecting
flights or reaching their destinations in time.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation said that there was a near-disaster when two
planes carrying 134 passengers almost collided mid-air over the
port city of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The 24 striking controllers based at the Moi International
Airport in Mombasa yesterday refused to resume work and did not
sign a form declaring their intention to return to work.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Directorate of Civil Aviation said that the
Kenya Airports Authority is contemplating closing down night
operations at the Mombasa airport as the two people redeployed
there could not cope with the 24-hour workload.
</P>
<P>
At the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, only
six controllers are on duty as four others have pulled out owing
to fatigue.

<HEADLINE> Differences Remain on WTO Agriculture, Labor Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) are still differing on controversial issues of
agriculture and labor standards though progress has been made in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
"There are words and concepts that some countries believe
should be included (in the declaration) and others do not," WTO
spokesman Keith Rockwell told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some Western nations want to link the
issue of labor standards with trade and include it in the
declaration of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries oppose the linkage and the inclusion of
the issue into the declaration, arguing that the issue could be
employed by the West as a disguised trade barrier.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the declaration, slated to be released Friday, has
not been ready yet, although it should have been finished on
Wednesday according to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the North and the South today remained as wide
as it was on Monday when the WTO opened its inaugural Ministerial
Conference in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Where the statement may go, it is a major issue to be
resolved," Rockwell said, adding that "very, very intensive
negotiations" were underway.
</P>
<P>
"Every effort has been made to try to revolve this in a way to
be acceptable to everyone, because as you know we need consensus
in order to get the declaration finished," he said.
</P>
<P>
Consensus has already been reached on the issues of
competition, investment and government procurement, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Roasted, Ground Coffee Exporters in Ethiopia to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Coffee and
Tea Authority said it is preparing to issue licenses to exporters
of roasted or ground coffee.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here by an official from the authority's
Coffee Test and Trade License Department.
</P>
<P>
He said roasted or ground coffee would enable the country to
earn additional foreign currency and the consumers to get the
right Ethiopian coffee.
</P>
<P>
The official said the authority has prepared directives,
criteria, license and identity cards for those who wish to engage
in the business and has also trained coffee testing workers.
</P>
<P>
The coffee roasting, grinding and packing machines employed by
the exporters should be modern equipment that would not affect
the taste of coffee, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of major coffee producing and exporting
countries in the world. Coffee shares 60 percent of its export
and 25 percent of the population are engaged in coffee
production, trade or related activities.
</P>
<P>
The decline of coffee price on the world market made the
country's foreign currency earning decreasing. To compensate
price fall on the world market, the nation has taken measures to
increase the export volume of coffee and check smuggled coffee to
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> WTO Should Adapt to Changes to Play Positive Role, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China today called on the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to adapt to changes and be ready to
meet the challenges brought about by the new international
economic and trade structure.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first WTO Ministerial Conference, which opened
here on Monday, Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese delegation, said
that in the past two years since its inception, the WTO has
encountered difficulties in a number of trade areas, which, he
pointed out, reflect the challenges facing the WTO.
</P>
<P>
These areas include the implementation of the Uruguay Round
Agreements, balance of the multilateral policy making process,
expansion of new areas of trade liberalization and coordination of
the development of regional groupings and the acceptance of new
members, said Long, who is also Assistant Minister of the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of China.
</P>
<P>
These challenges had arisen mainly because of the major change
in the Organization's membership composition, he said, observing
that when the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) was
provisionally applied almost 50 years ago, there were only eight
developing countries among the original 23 contracting parties,
accounting for one third of the total membership.
</P>
<P>
However, today, the number of developing countries has risen to
96, taking up four-fifths of the total membership of the WTO, Long
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This not only reflects a simple change of the composition of
the WTO membership, but also demonstrates the great changes of the
international economic structure," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We believe, if the WTO is to play a positive role, it must
adapt to such changes and be ready to meet the challenges brought
about by this new international economic and trade structure,"
said Long, the Chinese Chief Negotiator at talks on China's
accession into the WTO in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out with regret that despite the changes in
the global economic and trade structure, the implementation of
various agreements of the Uruguay Round was not balanced and there
has been little change in the situation where a few major players
dominate the multilateral decision making process.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in the implementation of the Uruguay Round
Agreements and in promoting trade and investment liberalization,
the reciprocal principle is unduly emphasized and the most favored
nations principle has often been neglected, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the accession of the applicants to the WTO has
been slowed down due to political consideration and the excessive
demand for immediate commercial benefits.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that should the WTO turn a closed eye to the
above abnormal phenomenon and fail to take effective measures to
curb and correct them, the enthusiasm of developing countries in
participating in the multilateral trading system will be dampened
and the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements will be
delayed, and as a result, the operation and authority of the WTO
will be jeopardized," he warned.

NEW DELHI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn has warned he will not tolerate any corruption in the
bank's projects in India and would cancel such projects without a
moment's hesitation at the slightest hint of graft, the Hindustan
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an internal briefing to senior bank executives on his recent
trip to India, Wolfensohn said "corruption is a key issue" and
"everywhere I went the issue of corruption came up."
</P>
<P>
According to a transcript of the closed-door talk obtained by

had made it clear in India that the World Bank will just kill a
project in the country if it finds evidence of corruption on the
project.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Djibouti Railway Company to Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethio-Djibouti
Railway Company said it will shortly import four additional
locomotives to speed the transport.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, General Manager of the
company Buh Hussien told employees of the company in Dire Dawa
that the purchase of the new locomotives and consignment of spare
parts would be undertaken with the 61.5 million Birr (about 9.6
million Dollars) grant obtained from France.
</P>
<P>
The railway will be in a position to cut by half the time it
took to reach from Addis Ababa to Dire Dawa and from Dire Dawa to
Djibouti upon the deployment of the new machines in these routes,
the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
He urged workers to keep up their diligence so as to render
better service to clients and enable the company to become profit
making.
</P>
<P>
The 781-kilometer Ethio-Djibouti railway, built at the
beginning of the century, is a deficit enterprise due to old
equipment and short of spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The railway, which used to carry about 80 percent of
Ethiopia's import-export commodities 30 years ago, handles only
seven percent of the country's import-export commodities now. So
the governments of Ethiopia and Djibouti have decided to renovate
the railway to improve the capacity.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong New Airport Plans Bird-scaring Device </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Managers of Hong Kong's new
airport in Chek Lap Kok are planning to play recordings of birds'
distress calls to scare them away.
</P>
<P>
Birdstrikes, which mean a bird that hits an aircraft is sucked
into the engine, pose a big worry for airports because they can
cause a plane to crash or cause millions of dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
Kites, gulls, shore birds and cormorants could pose problems at
Chek Lap Kok where the threat of birdstrikes is thought to be
greater than at the current Hong Kong airport at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak Airport's bird control unit dealt with 16 birdstrikes
this year. Two of them damaged plane engines and one forced an
aborted take-off.
</P>
<P>
Consultants have conducted a four million HK dollars (0.5 million
U.S. dollars) study on this since 1994 and World Wide Fund for
Nature (Hong Kong) executive director David Melville, who is a
consultant to the airport authority, said Chek Lap Kok's maritime
location would attract different species to Kai Tak, where the
main problem was kites scavenging on rubbish.
</P>
<P>
Poor weather during migration caused huge gull flocks to mass
at the entrance to Victoria Harbor and forced the Kai Tak Airport
to close in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Similar problems are predicted for the new airport, experts
said.

<HEADLINE> Career First for HK Men, Pollution Top Worry: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong men put their
career before family and people's top worry is air pollution,
according to the latest lifestyle survey.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong men tend to leave household chores to their wives,
said the survey, which was conducted by Bozel Hong Kong and Survey
Research Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
And the main worries keeping Hong Kong people awake is not
money, crime or death, but air pollution, local English-language
newspaper South China Morning Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
In terms of goals, the number one priority for men is their
career. Being a good husband and father rank in second and third,
according to the 1996 Hong Kong Male and Female Lifestyle Study.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,025 men and women aged between 15 and 54,
undertaken between August and October, finds women by comparison
prioritize their family.
</P>
<P>
And women rank AIDS as their third worry while men opt for
water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Career-mined wives account for 9 percent of women and they view
 marriage materialistically.
</P>
<P>
And the ideal man for them is wealthy, rather than intelligent,
 considerate or attractive.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent men think that women should stay at home and think
easy divorces are a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
Director of Survey Research, Helen Lok Suk-yee, is confident
men are becoming more domesticated. "The trend seems to be for
more equality in sharing family responsibility," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong women are getting more independent, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- All newspapers in Hong Kong
today highlight the selection of Tung Chee Hwa as the candidate
for the first Chief Executive of the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), saying that Tung has commanded
popular support of the six million local residents.
</P>
<P>

new era, and Hong Kong people are moving towards true democracy
through political participation.

<HEADLINE> !!China Calls for Speeding up Negotiation on WTO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Ministerial
Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) should help
accelerate the admission of new members into the world trade body,
a senior Chinese trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, assistant minister for international trade and
economic cooperation and head of the Chinese delegation, told a
plenary session of the WTO Ministerial Conference that China
welcomes the recent initiative taken by some major players of the
WTO, who expressed their readiness to accelerate the process of
China's accession into the multilateral trade body.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the positive attitude "will be translated into
actions in resolving specific issues" in the negotiation, Long
said.
</P>
<P>
"On our part, we shall take a flexible, pragmatic and
forward-looking attitude in the hope that other members will do
likewise," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to work together to accelerate the process of
negotiations and bring it to a successful conclusion as soon as
possible," Long added.
</P>
<P>
Ten years have passed since China applied for the resumption of
its contracting party status to the General Agreement on Tariff
and Trade (GATT) and started negotiations for joining the WTO, he
said, noting that the process has drawn attention from all
quarters of the world.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, China has taken economic reform and opening up to
the outside world as its basic policy. Long said that this policy
will not only be a boost for China's opening up to the outside
world, but also facilitate China's participation in the
rules-based multilateral trading system and its accession into the
WTO, which has more than 100 members, he said.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, Long said, "the Chinese government has overcome
many difficulties and obstacles in the past years, adhering firmly
to its goal ever since the negotiation started."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has consistently held a positive
attitude towards joining the WTO not because we believe the
membership will bring about miracles to our economy and foreign
trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rather, he pointed out, "this attitude shows the consistency
and perseverance of the Chinese government in pursuing the
policies of reform and opening to the outside world."
</P>
<P>
"It also reflects China's conviction in safeguarding the
integrity of the multilateral trade framework and its efforts to
avoid trade wars which are in nobody's interests," Long stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that recently, more and more countries realized that
China's participation in the multilateral trading system is not
only in China's own interest, but also to the benefit of the WTO
and its members as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The WTO members realized that as an increasingly growing
economy, China's participation in international economic affairs
will contribute to the rational allocation of global resources,
and provide a predictable huge market for international trade and
investment, Long said.
</P>
<P>
China participated in the whole process of the Uruguay Round
negotiation and signed the Final Act of the Uruguay Round
Agreements in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This represents the firm commitment of the Chinese government
to abiding by international economic and trade rules," Long said.
</P>
<P>
"In respect of market access, the Chinese government has taken
a series of substantial measures to reduce tariffs and non-tariff
barriers and expand the opening of markets including trade in
services, consistent with its own needs of reform and opening
policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Long emphasized, "We are ready to carry on the negotiations on
the Protocol and market access with all members on the basis of
the Uruguay Round Agreements and in consistence with China's own
economic development level and the principle of achieving balance
between rights and obligations."
</P>
<P>
"As a big developing country, China will make unremitting
efforts with a view to establishing an equitable, just and
rational international economic order and meeting the challenges
together with all of you, and bring a stable and prosperous world
into the 21st country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clash Erupts At Sri Lanka's Steel Corporation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 12 (Xinhua)-- A clash erupted at the Sri
Lankan Steel Corporation on Wednesday between police and workers,
and several workers were injured and five trade union leaders
arrested, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The clash began when workers in the corporation at Ooruwala in
Athurugiriya Town, North Central Province, disrupted the takeover
of the establishment by a new South Korean management for the
second time, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the shares of the Corporation was bought by
South Korea Heavy Industries and Construction Company for 15
million US dollars in September this year under the government's
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when the new South Korean managers first came to
take over the administration, the workers rose up in arms and held
them hostage in the Chairman's room for more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
The managers came again on Wednesday and the workers again
resisted them, resulting in the police having to intervene, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The workers said they will not allow the privatization at any
cost. The trade union of the corporation said, "We will not work
under the new management. We do not want their bonuses, incentives
or anything. We oppose privatization".
</P>
<P>
The workers have refused to hold talks with the South Koreans
and said they were prepared to talk only with the government, the
reports quoted union sources as saying.

</P>
<P>
Long, who is also China's assistant minister of foreign trade
and economic cooperation, said that China believes the expansion
of the scope of the WTO activities and the coverage of trade
liberalization should be based on consensus.
</P>
<P>
"Undue expansion is inappropriate. It will not only divert the
WTO from focusing its attention to deal with major substantial
issues, and thus affect the effectiveness of the newly established
WTO, but also over-burden its members especially the developing
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Long, China's chief negotiator in the Geneva-based WTO, also
said that all the subject matters, including the Investment
Agreement, should be fully discussed among all parties.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see something worked out behind closed doors
by a small group of people, and then impose decisions as fait
accompli on other members," he said. At the same time, "we should
define the role of the WTO in an objective and realistic way and
there should be a proper division of labor between the WTO and
other international organizations."
</P>
<P>
These international bodies can complement and reinforce each
other. But the WTO should not and can not substitute the roles
played by other international organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first WTO Ministerial Conference, attended by trade
ministers from the 128 WTO members and representatives from the
observers, started here Monday and will conclude Friday.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance To WTO: Senior Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade
official today spoke highly of the inaugural World Trade
Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference (WTO MC), saying that
the Chinese Government attaches great importance to it.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, Head of the Chinese delegation, made the remarks
at the WTO conference, which opened here on Monday.

<P>
He said that the subjects being discussed at the conference
will have a major bearing on the orientation of the multilateral
trading system in the coming years and will have an important
impact on the development of international trade and the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the set-up of the WTO, Long said, it "has made headway in
improving and implementing Uruguay Round Agreements, in
establishing a sound institutional set-up of the multilateral
trading system, and in improving the effectiveness of the trade
dispute settlement mechanism."
</P>
<P>
Long, also Assistant Minister of China's Ministry of Foreign

laid a solid foundation for further strengthening the multilateral
trading system and for formulating and improving international
trade disciplines in the future.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's consistent support for the multilateral
trading system as embodied in the WTO, saying that China endorses
its role in promoting healthy trade and economic relations among
countries.
</P>
<P>
"China believes that the WTO should make due contributions to
the establishment of a fair and rational international economic
order," Long said.

BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A Customs investigation of
banana smuggling in Shanghai may resulted in charges of tax
evasion against a local company.
</P>
<P>
The "China Youth Daily" reported today that a Shanghai-based
company has been accused of smuggling large quantities of bananas
in 22 cases into the country.

<HEADLINE> China Calls On WTO to Consider Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade
official stressed here today that the interests of the developing
nations should be taken into consideration in the multilateral
trading system.
</P>
<P>
This proceeds from the major change in the membership
composition of the World Trade Organization (WTO), said Long
Yongtu, head of the Chinese delegation, at the WTO first
Ministerial Conference.
</P>
<P>
"With the increasing interdependence between countries today,
the negligence of the interests of developing countries may end up
by damaging the interests of developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Over-emphasis on trade liberalization, in disregard
of the development of developing countries, may lead to a
situation where one finds open but non-existing market."
</P>
<P>
"If this is the case, it would be the biggest failure of trade
liberalization," Long commented.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese trade official called on the WTO to meet the
challenges brought about by the new international economic and
trade structure.
</P>
<P>
Long also said that the WTO should make due contributions to
the set-up of a fair and rational international economic order.
</P>

is being attended by some 2,300 delegates from the WTO's 128

<HEADLINE> EU Trade Ministers Council OKs ITA Deal with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Trade Ministers Council
of the 15-member European Union (EU) today endorsed a deal on the
Information Technology Agreement (ITA) with the United States, EU
Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The council held a meeting following an early morning briefing
by Brittan on his talks with Acting U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
Brittan told reporters after the meeting that there is "a clear
endorsement" by the ministers of the results of negotiations on
the ITA.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the European Council struck the deal after
intensive negotiations in the past three days at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference, which runs from Monday
to Friday in the city state.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that a lobbying process will start immediately to
seek broader support from more countries for eliminating tariffs
on a wide range of computer products as the implementation of the
agreement requires a considerable number of countries to join the
pact by March 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the draft declaration agreed by the U.S. and the
European Council, Brittan said that "participants will implement
the actions foreseen in the declaration providing the participants
representing approximately 90 percent of world trade in
information technology products have by then, that is by March 15,
1997, notified their acceptance."
</P>
<P>
"Both Europe an the United States made it clear that this is
not a bilateral agreement. It's meant to be an agreement covering
the countries in the world most involved in this whole area of
activity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that there is a provision for accelerating the
staging provisions which at the moment provide for the elimination
of tariffs by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the agreement is conditional upon
participants being satisfied with the outcome of the further
staging talks on accelerating the provisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization pact will affect the information technology
market with an estimated amount of 400 billion U.S. dollars in
trade.
</P>
<P>
Consumer electronic goods and audio materials are not covered
in the deal.
</P>
<P>
ITA negotiations had hit a snag earlier this year when the EU
refused to discuss the accord, complaining that its exclusion from
a U.S.-Japanese semiconductor deal signed in July would block
Europe's access to Japan's computer-chip market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Japan have eliminated tariffs on semiconductors
imports, while EU member states maintain an average tariff of
seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States imports about 100 billion U.S. dollars worth
of information technology equipment per year. Of that, 80 percent
comes from the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mexico's Economy On Road To Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's economy is now on
the road to recovery, after suffering an enormous setback in
December 1994 when the devaluation of its currency unleashed a
financial and economic crisis that affected several Latin American
countries.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made during the first 10 months of 1996 in
gross domestic product (GDP), the trade balance, employment,
inflation and the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, third quarter GDP grew 7.4
percent over the same period last year. Manufacturing and
construction stood out most with annual increases of 13.9 percent
and 24.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The country had a favorable balance of trade of 5.8 billion
U.S. dollars during the first 10 months of 1996, with exports up
20 percent to 79 billion dollars and imports up 22.4 percent to 73
billion dollars, over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation continued to drop. The latest report by the Central
Bank of Mexico showed prices rose only 1.25 percent in October
compared with September, the lowest monthly increase in the last
22 months.
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation for the first 10 months of this year stood at
21.9 percent, half the 43.6 percent reported during the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government has also made headway in reducing
unemployment and creating job opportunities, with the unemployment
rate in October at 5.2 percent, the lowest since August 1995, when
it stood at 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made in refinancing the government's external
debt and the government paid back ahead of schedule 7 billion of
the 20 billion dollars loaned by the United States to bail it out
of its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Public external debt in September 30, 1996 was 91.13 billion
dollars, accounting for 27.8 percent of GDP, a drop from 28.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has recovered, although its progress has been
erratic and volatile. At the November close, the Mexican Stock
Exchange index stood at 3291.69, an increase of 18.4 percent over
its 1995 close.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the peso to the U.S. dollar remained
relatively stable, although it fell from 7.3 pesos to the dollar
at the beginning of the year to 7.85 pesos last month.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in Mexico's economic and financial situation
has led to a return, albeit a slow one, of confidence by overseas
investors. Foreign investment had reached 11.7 billion dollars
by the end of the third quarter, an increase of 5.7 percent over
last year, of which direct investment accounted for 7 billion
dollars and investment in portfolios 4.67 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government is confident that the economy will
surpass the 3 percent growth target for 1996 set at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
It has set a growth target of 4 percent for 1997, along with
and inflation target of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government says 1997 will be a year of transition toward
sustainable growth. However, analysts point to many unfavorable
factors which could hamper the economy's progress - high corporate
debt, low savings levels, volatile foreign capital flows, a crisis
in the agricultural sector and weak domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> More Canadians Live in Poverty: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Family income in Canada showed
virtually no change in the past 15 years, while the number of
Canadians living below the poverty line continued to increase,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, average family income in Canada was an estimated
40,800 U.S. dollars, which was at almost the same level as in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about a quarter of one million more people were
reduced to poverty in the year.
</P>
<P>
Although 99,000 more people found jobs in 1995, most of them
were part-time. Full-time work actually declined by 22,000, the
federal fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
Further more, many workers received earnings that did not keep
pace with the inflation, and the average weekly earnings declined
1.2 percent in 1995 after adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime time, average government transfer payments
declined 3.8 percent, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 246,000 more Canadians slipped below the poverty
line in 1995, bringing the total number to 5.2 million, which
accounted for 17.8 percent of the whole population.
</P>
<P>
And the child poverty rate also increased from 19.5 percent in
1994 to 21.0 percent in 1995, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: France Revives Gaullist Foreign Policies in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Since his election as French
president in May 1995, Jacques Chirac has worked hard to build an
image of an independent France by adopting more aggressive and
clear-cut foreign policies often reminiscent of General Charles de
Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's neo-Gaullist policies include pushing forward reform
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) into a more
Europe-oriented trans-Atlantic military alliance, strengthening
inter-European defense and security cooperation, and constructing
a strong European economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Based on the political and economic potentials of Europe, these
strategic goals are aimed at counterbalancing the dominance of the
United States, the only remaining superpower on the world
political and economic stage in the wake of the collapse of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Unlike his predecessor Francois Mitterrand, who maintained a
close relationship with Washington, Chirac has visited the United
States only once since taking on France's top job, but has toured
the Middle East, Africa and Asia much more often.
</P>
<P>
Just as de Gaulle resolutely withdrew from U.S.-dominated
integrated military command structure of NATO in 1966, Chirac has
clashed head-on with the United States with equal courage this
year on all the main global issues -- the Middle East peace
process, NATO reform, U.S. unilateral trade sanctions, the
reelection of United Nations Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali and the recent crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
France's return to NATO's integrated military command structure
this year was not all good news for Washington, as Paris publicly
demanded that NATO's vital southern command based in Naples,
Italy, be placed under a European commander.
</P>
<P>
France was among the first to condemn the U.S. for imposing
unilateral economic sanctions on Cuba in March, and for taking
military action against Iraq in early September.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also rejected the U.S. dominance in the peace
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and has adopted
a much softer stance to NATO's eastward expansion than the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The 43-month ethnic war in the former Yugoslavia led Chirac to
the conclusion that European security depends too much upon
American protection, and that Europe must take over the
responsibility for its own security by building an inter-European
defense mechanism similar to the Western European Union.
</P>
<P>
The neo-Gaullist independent foreign policy adopted by Chirac
is closely associated with the changes taking place in the world's
political and economic spheres in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
As an important European power and the world's fourth largest
exporter, France needs to protect both its national security and
its economic interests amid a drastic change in the world's
balance of power and increasingly fierce economic competition
which has been accompanied by an information revolution.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: France Revives Gaullist Foreign Policies in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the economic side of his foreign policies, Chirac is
determined to follow Mitterrand's European policy by placing
France's future firmly in Europe through ensuring the construction
of European economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Soon after he took office, Chirac ordered Prime Minister Alain
Juppe to overhaul the national social welfare and economic systems
by adopting austerity measures to cut public deficits and keep a
parity between the French franc and the German deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
The measures, bitterly contested at home, are aimed at meeting
the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty of the European Union
(EU) for joining the European single currency in January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl share the belief that
Europe must construct a much stronger economic and monetary union
under the auspices of the EU if it ever hopes to be a match for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France is following a multi-dimensional policy on
economic and trade cooperation with other regions of the world,
the booming Asia-Pacific in particular.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made two trips to the Far East this year, one to Bangkok
in March to attend the Euro-Asia Summit, the other to Tokyo in
November to seek more Japanese investment in France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has also readjusted France's policies toward Africa and
taken a more active role in the continent. He called on the
Africans to improve their economic management and develop law and
order systems to attract more foreign investment and aid and keep
those aid agencies and foreign companies already in the continent
from pulling out.
</P>
<P>
The recent crisis in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa
gave France a clear message: to let Africans decide their own
political and economic affairs is the right way for the continent
to break the vicious circle of ethnic violence and political
conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
France is also seeking closer ties with Central and Eastern
European countries by promising to help some of them, such as
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, join the EU and a
Europe-oriented NATO by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
As for its ties with Moscow, France has been maintaining close
contact with Russia over global and European issues. Both
countries have called for the strengthening of the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as a forum for dialogue
between Russia and NATO over security issues.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has proposed that NATO invite Russia and all Central and
Eastern European states to take part in a summit early next year.
</P>
<P>
In readjusting its foreign policies to meet the rapidly
changing world, France has been trying all year to pursue a clear
and more independent identity for itself and for Europe on the
international stage.
</P>
<P>
To achieve its aim in an increasingly multi-polarized world,
France has tried to carry out a multi-dimensional foreign policy
with the backing of the EU. Under the leadership of Jacques
Chirac, the country is likely to continue in the same direction
for the foreseeable future.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The increase of the world
population slowed down unprecedentedly during the first five years
in the 1990s, the German World Population Foundation said today.
</P>
<P>
The world population witnessed an annual average growth of 81
million between 1990-1995, with the growth rate standing at 1.48
percent every year.
</P>
<P>
While in the 1980s, the population grew an average 87 million
every year.
</P>
<P>
The German Foundation noted that from 1990 to 1995 each woman
bore an average of 2.96 children, which was also unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
Foundation Authorities attributed the "surprising phenomenon"
to widespread adoption of contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of child birth was increasingly apparent in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in Bangladesh, the number of children in each
family decreased from the average of 6.2 to 3.4 at present. In
Kenya, the figure dropped from 7.5 to 5.4 in each household.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, the world population will continue to increase,
said the Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The global population will not surpass 8 billion until the year
2050, it added.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of the Foundation believed that the growth rate of
the world population will be able to drop another 20 percent, if
developing countries continue to implement family planning
policies.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation appealed to the German government for increased
allocation of funds to support the United Nations to carry out its
family planning program.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the slow growth of world population also
indicated the powerful support by most countries to the world
population plan of action adopted at the 1994 World Population
Summit in Cairo, Egypt.

million laboring children, can eliminate child labor following the
initiative of garments sector, UNICEF officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
There are some 10,500 child laborers in Bangladesh's garments
sector, of whom 8,000 are now attending schools following a joint
initiative of Bangladesh's leading garment organization and the

identify under-aged children working in the sector, remove them in
a phased manner, place those in appropriate educational programs
with a monthly stipend and offer the children's jobs to qualified
adult family members.

<P>
UNICEF representative Rolf Carriere said the pioneering MOU has
succeeded in bringing out a very good number of children from the
garments industry and placing them in schools.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the MOU has already sent a message to all other
sectors where children are employed, particularly the informal
sector," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Calls for Flexibility on Info-tech Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand urges members of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to be flexible on eliminating
tariffs on information technology products and extend the deadline
to 2003 or 2005, instead of 2000 proposed by the United States,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials attending the WTO ministerial meeting in
Singapore said on Wednesday that more time is needed to complete a
final list of products to be included in a free trade agreement on
information technology products.
</P>
<P>
The draft of such an agreement should also leave room for each
participant to interpret flexibly in terms of eliminating tariff
rates and product coverage, they said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the European Union, Japan and Canada have proposed a
draft of the agreement to the WTO meeting, which requires all
participants to provide a list of products subject to tariff cuts
as of March next year.
</P>
<P>
The four parties are pushing for the inclusion of the draft
agreement in a final document of the WTO ministerial meeting, that
runs from Monday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials said that it is impossible for Thailand to
complete the work within the proposed time-span because the
country needs more time to study the issue.

KATHMANDU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of Nepal's Lower
House have registered a no-confidence motion against the
three-party coalition government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the
Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion was filed Wednesday by 102 Lower House
MPs including those of the main opposition Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) and former ruling partner
the National Democratic Party (RPP), which withdrew from the
coalition early this week.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the present government of being directionless despite
the largest 47-member cabinet in the country's history, the motion
claimed that "the House has no confidence in the prime minister."
</P>
<P>
King Birendra has already called a special House session on
December 16 to discuss the no-confidence motion as requested by
the 102 MPs.
</P>
<P>
Voting on the motion will probably be held on December 20,
sources of the Parliament Secretariat said.

The Nepali Lower House has 205 seats and a no-confidence motion
could be passed with a single majority of 103.

HANGZHOU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province has worked out a plan for the 1998 grain production, in
the wake of this year's good harvest.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the province will retain the preferential
policies for grain production and the same grain crop area as this
year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Zhejiang will produce 15 million tons of
grain in 1996. To ensure that farmers have a good income after a
good harvest, the province has asked grain purchasing departments
to prevent any difficulties from arising in grain sales.
</P>
<P>
In addition, to ward off the downward trend of grain production
following a successful harvest, a situation that has occured in
the past few years, agricultural departments have been urged to
remain clear-minded and work hard to safeguard the farmers'
enthusiasm for grain production.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the province took in 16.4 million tons of grain, and
the figure continually dropped down to 1994's 14 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Sugar Industry Begins Recovery in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 marked the
beginning of a recovery in Cuba's sugar industry, with sugar cane
output expected to reach 4.46 million tons by the end of the year,
an increase of more than one third over 1995.
</P>
<P>
But that's still just over half the level achieved in 1989,
when annual production hit a peak of 8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Sugar was the backbone of the Cuban economy and accounted for
73 percent of export earnings. A healthy market had allowed the
country to develop a strong sugar cane by-products industry. By
1989, there were more than 200 factories on the island making such
goods.
</P>
<P>
But the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 had a devastating
effect on the sugar industry of this Caribbean island and,
inevitably, on the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
Cuba had depended on the Soviet Union for most of its farming
inputs, such as machinery and fertilizer, and for its market - in
1989, 60 percent of sugar exports went to the bloc.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Soviet Union hit both production and
exports and led to an economic crisis, which translated into a
34.8 percent drop in its gross domestic product between 1990 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
Sugar output reached a 40-year record low in 1993 at only 3.3
million tons.
</P>
<P>
After several years of recession, the government began to take
measures to reform and rebuild the industry.
</P>
<P>
Farmers were provided with the necessary equipment and were
allowed to keep a certain share of the profits. Cuba started
manufacturing its own farming equipment and inputs and the
government began to finance the sugar industry with foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
But it's early days yet. Sugar cane production is still too low
to satisfy demand and lead to a major improvement in export
earnings and growth. Annual sugar output needs to reach some 6
million tons to earn enough hard currency for the government to
boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
The country has planned to increase output by a further 800,000
tons in 1997 to about 5.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
But experts are not optimistic in the short term. The planting
program for the 1996-97 season could not be completed, as
Hurricane Lili struck the island in October and affected 42,000
562,800 hectares of cane-growing land.
</P>
<P>
Delays in repairing equipment and plant at the country's 156
sugar mills due to lack of money has also hit processing
capacity.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Reach Agreement on ITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and the
United States have reached agreement on the Information Technology
Agreement (ITA) after days of intensive negotiations at the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference here.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan at a
press conference here this morning.
</P>
<P>
"There is a clear endorsement" by the EU ministers of the
results of negotiations on ITA, which he and U.S. Acting Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky undertook during the last three
days, Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the lobbying process will start immediately to
include as many Asian countries as possible into the ITA.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-proposed agreement, all tariffs on a range of
electronic products will be eliminated by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization pact will affect the information technology
market with an estimated 400 billion US dollars in trade.
</P>
<P>
ITA negotiations had hit a snag earlier this year when the EU
refused to discuss the accord, complaining that its exclusion from
a U.S.-Japanese semiconductor deal signed in July would block
European access to Japan's computer-chip market.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan have eliminated tariffs on
semiconductors imports, while EU member states maintain an average
tariff of seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States imports about 100 billion dollars worth of
information technology equipment per year. Of that, 80 percent
comes from the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Eastern Region Attracts Most Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's eastern region has
attracted the largest amount of investments in the country and
will remain favored in the next five years, local daily the
Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The region covers eight provinces -- Chachoengsao, Chanthaburi,
Trat, Rayong, Chon Buri, Nakhon Nayok, Prachin Buri and Sa Kaew.
</P>
<P>
According to the Board of Investment (BOI) of Thailand, a total
of 5,076 projects won BOI privileges between 1991 and October this
year, with 1,506 of them, or 29.67 percent, in the eastern region.
</P>
<P>
The projects in this region, mostly involving large-scale and
basic industries, cost almost 1.1 billion baht (44 billion U.S.
dollars), or 58.4 percent, of the total 1.9 trillion baht (76
billion U.S. dollars) incurred by all the projects in the period.
</P>
<P>
The BOI predicted that the eastern region will become the
country's largest base for future industrial ventures, the report

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Seek Diplomatic Means to Ease Trade Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyodh has said that the government will make efforts to
solve Thailand's trade disputes with the European Union (EU)
through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
If the efforts fail, the government will seek other
alternatives, Chavalit told representatives of the Thai Frozen
Food Association who gathered outside the parliament on Wednesday
to urge Thais and the government to boycott EU products.
</P>
<P>
The association is leading a campaign in Thailand to boycott EU
products ranging from whisky, wine and milk to aircraft and
electric trains to retaliate the EU's reduction of its tariff
privileges on Thai products, especially shrimps and other food
goods, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU's new generalized system of preferences (GSP)
program which will take effect on January 1 next year, tariff
privileges on some Thai products, including shrimps, fresh fruit
and vegetables, canned food and fisheries will be reduced
significantly.
</P>
<P>
The EU insisted that Thailand's economy be too developed to
receive full assistance.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai
Akraseni said that Thailand could not take counter-measures like
banning of imports from the EU, because this would only hurt Thai
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The privilege reduction would not affect export figures because
new markets would be sought, the minister was quoted as saying by
local newspapers.

</P>
<P>
They include the Qingqi Group, one of the six largest producers

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Run High Risk of Developing Atherosclerosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Scientific research on
hundreds of human heart specimens shows that the capital city has
a high rate of atherosclerosis, a degenerative disease that can
lead to hardening of the arteries.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Fuwai Cardio-Vascular Hospital under the Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences came to the conclusion based on a
study of heart samples from 327 people, ranging in age from 15 to
39, who died of accidental death in the cities of Beijing, Nanjing
and the fishing area of Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
Atherosclerosis causes a narrowing of the blood vessels, which
ultimately harden and lose their elasticity. In its advanced
stage, it can cause arteriosclerosis, or hardened arteries.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing study reveals that the city's incidence rate of
atherosclerosis stands at 75.8 percent, about eight percent higher
than the average of all the specimens in the three cities,
according to "Health News," a Beijing-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that symptoms of the ailment began to appear in
some Beijing residents as young as 20 years old, while in some
areas with low incidence rate, the youngest group with the
symptoms is five to ten years older.
</P>
<P>
Studies also found that 70 percent of the diseased heart
specimens from Beijing have a type of atherosclerosis which can
develop easily and can cause fatal heart attacks in patients of
any age.
</P>
<P>
Scientists suggested that unhealthy habits, including heavy
smoking, drinking alcohol, and some mental disorders such as
anxiety or depression, might be responsible for the high numbers
of heart problems in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the symptoms of atherosclerosis can occur in
young people and develop gradually as they grow older. Therefore,
healthy habits adopted in youth may help prevent or slow down the
development of the disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investors will pour in
some 300 billion pesos (11.5 billion U.S. dollars) of investments
for new and expansion projects in the Philippines between 1996 and
2001, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a recent survey conducted by the American Chamber of
Commerce of the Philippines (Amcham), the reports said that U.S.
companies operating in the country are planning to invest 47
billion pesos (1.8 billion dollars) to expand their capacities
between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This clearly demonstrates the confidence of American investors
in the Philippines," Amcham President Carlos Contreras was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey -- the 1996 Corporate Audit -- covered 83
respondents, including 60 U.S. multinational companies who went
through a similar survey last year.
</P>
<P>
The 60 companies contributed a combined total of 103 billion
pesos (3.9 billion dollars) to the Philippine economy last year in
the form of tax payments, export earnings, payroll, local
purchases, dividends, donations and reinvestments.
</P>
<P>

Philippines late last month.
</P>
<P>
The planned new investments span sectors of energy, power,
communications, transportation and automotive.
</P>
<P>
Major projects include a 1.3-billion-dollar hydro and
geothermal power plant by California Energy Resources and a
4.5-billion-dollar natural gas development complex in the
CXamago-Malampaya field by Occidental Petroleum.

Berisha said that the higher inflation rate this year was
related to the freeing of prices for bread and fuel, the adoption
of value-added tax and the cancellation of foreign food aid.
</P>
<P>
He added that the growing government budget deficit, which was
caused by the failure to achieve taxation reforms, was also
harming the economy.
</P>
<P>
Berisha said that next year, Albania will aim to maintain a
high economic growth rate and reduce inflation to under 10
percent.

MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are business news
in brief in the Philippines:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines will import some 53,000 tons of frozen pork
in 1997 compared with 2,500 tons this year, Agriculture Secretary
Salvador Escudero III said on Wednesday. He said the United States
is particularly interested in pork exports to the Philippines.
According to Escudero, the country's beef imports would rise to
47,000 tons in 1997 from an estimated 42,000 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine National Power Corp. (Napocor) said on
Wednesday that it distributed its inaugural Yankee bond float in
New York for a far larger amount of 360 million U.S. dollars
instead of only 200 million dollars as originally planned. As
offered to investors in the United States, the Napocor bonds come
in two tranches -- one for a 10-year note worth 200 million
dollars and the other for a 20-year note worth 160 million
dollars, the Napocor said.
</P>
<P>
-- Donor countries meeting in Tokyo Wednesday pledged a total
of 2.9 billion U.S. dollars in aid for the Philippines in 1997, a
slight increase from the 2.8 billion dollars in 1996. Javad K.
Shirazi, leader of the Consultative Group Meeting for the
Philippines, said that 1.1 billion dollars of the pledges came
from multilateral sources, and 1.8 billion dollars from bilateral
donors, of which Japan pledged 1.4 billion dollars.

<P>
QINHUANGDAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Four economic development
zones in Qinhuangdao, one of China's 14 open coastal cities in
Hebei Province, have become favorite places for overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that these zones had approved 79 foreign-funded
projects involving 454 million US dollars in the first ten months
of this year, serving as a showcase of the city in the reform and
opening wider to outside world.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1984, the Qinhuangdao Economic and Technology
Development Zone is home to 118 industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the zone, covering only one square
kilometer, has developed into a rising industrial district, and
its second phase, where construction of infrastructural facilities
were just completed, is attracting more Chinese and overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
In the Shanhaiguan zone, buildings and workshops are being
erected to accommodate the planned 80,000 to 100,000 people who
will be moving in. Meanwhile, large-scale construction is well
underway in the other two zones.
</P>
<P>
The city of Qinhuangdao, which borders Beijing and has the
largest energy export harbor in China, enjoys every advantage to
achieve rapid economic development. It has now ratified 364 joint
ventures with a total investment of 1.594 billion US dollars.

<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is expected to
buy between 30,000 to 50,000 tons of rice and some 50,000 tons of
corn in 1997 despite a projected higher rice yield, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero was quoted as saying
that the unmilled rice output in the country next year will reach
12 million tons, but still lag the demand boosted by the growth of
population and the poultry and livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
The country's rice imports this year reached more than 80,000
tons, with corn imports at 250,000 tons, an increase of 370.3
percent and 159.9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has to import more rice and corn this year
because its corps were seriously damaged last year by natural
calamities like typhoon which brought a rice shortage crisis to
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian Olympic Committee chief
Mario Pescante said on Wednesday that he was afraid of European
countries voting against Rome's bid for the 2004 Olympic Games,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
He added Rome was facing strong competition from Greece's
Athens and other European cities.
</P>
<P>
But he said he was confident that Rome, which hosted the 1960
Olympics, would make the final shortlist.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 candidates for the 2004 Olympics, seven are European
cities. They are Stockholm, Athens, France's Lille, Rome,
Seville, Istanbul and St Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
Pescante said if the European cities except Italy were
eliminated before the shortlist, they could turn to back a
non-European bid.
</P>
<P>
He said at that time they would be considering their hopes for
2008, since an Olympics staged in Europe would be unlikely to be
followed by a Games on the same continent.
</P>
<P>
A shortlist of four or five cities will be selected at the end
of March and the winner announced in September.

<P>
LISBON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona striker Ronaldo, Alan
Shearer of Newcastle or AC Milan's George Weah will win FIFA's
world player award.
</P>
<P>
The three players gained the greatest number of votes in a
poll of more than 100 national team coaches, soccer's world
governing body FIFA announced at a news conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If Weah wins, it will be the second year running he has taken
the award, and he would receive it together with a FIFA trophy for
fair play at a ceremony in Lisbon on January 20.
</P>
<P>
FIFA chairman Joao Havelange said on Friday the Liberian
striker would still receive the fair play award despite his
attack on Porto captain Jorge Costa after a European Champions'
League match last month.
</P>
<P>
Havelange said Weah had been provoked into the assault which
left Costa with a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian faces stiff competition from dazzling Brazilian
Ronaldo, who has scored some spectacular goals for Barcelona this
season, and England striker Alan Shearer, who was top scorer in
June's European championship.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona are reported to have doubled Ronaldo's salary
recently in a deal to keep the young striker at the club until
2006 while Shearer remains the world's most expensive player
following his 23.3 million U.S. dollar move to Newcastle in the
summer.

-- Advocates and opponents of constitutional changes calling
for the lifting of term limits of all elective officials, will
confront each other at 10 a.m. today when the Commission on
Elections hears a petition for a people's initiative to amend the
Constitution.
</P>

"are a continuation of a highly successful investigation."
</P>

"These cases have already revealed the ease and frequency with
which criminals have used modern technology to cause grave harm to
children," Freeh said. "These crimes, preying on innocent
children, represent every parent's worst nightmare."

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Fully Resume Operations in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced here today that its
operations in the Afghan capital of Kabul would be fully resumed
after four UNHCR staff were released without charge.
</P>
<P>
The last of the four arrested local staff was released from
jail Tuesday, according to a UNHCR press release.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan driver was abducted by a group of armed Taliban on
October 26. The other three were seized by armed Taliban as they
left the UNHCR Kabul office on November 12. They were released
without charge 10 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
Since Taliban forces took over Kabul in September, the UNHCR
said, its seven female Afghan staff have not been allowed to work,
in addition to the four arrested male staff.
</P>
<P>
Acting chief of the UNHCR's Afghanistan operation Sri Wijeratne
hopes that the release of the four without charge "marks a new
beginning."
</P>
<P>
"We have now received firm assurances from the Taliban
authorities that we all cooperate to alleviate the miserable
conditions under which so many of Kabul's inhabitants are living,"
said Wijeratne.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that it had received encouraging indications
that some of its female staff may shortly be authorized to begin
vitally needed work in the field. Many of the agency's programs
are aimed at widows and families headed by women, who cannot be
properly served without the help of women staff.
</P>
<P>
At least 80,000 people have been displaced since late
September. Of these, 30,000 have gone to neighboring Pakistan,
according to the UNHCR.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 4 million children
under the age of 12 in the United States suffer from hunger and
20.8 percent of American children under 18 live in poverty, a
research group reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Food Research and Action Center, which works for policy
changes to eradicate hunger and malnutrition in the United States,
found that 8.3 percent of youngsters under 12 were hungry.
</P>
<P>
The group took its poverty statistics from the U.S. Census
Bureau, which puts families of four living on 15,569 U.S. dollars
a year or less in 1995 under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
According to another new study of child poverty, some 6.1
million American children under six were living in poverty and 4.8
million young children lived near the poverty line in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The study was carried out by Columbia University's National
Center for Children in Poverty and a report was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that although the data was older, it still
puts a face on impoverished children.
</P>
<P>
It found that 30 percent of young black children were living in
families which had incomes below 50 percent of the federal poverty
line, compared with 6 percent of young white children who were
in extremely poor families in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate among Hispanic children grew fastest, rising
43 percent since 1979, compared with a 38 percent rise among white
children and 19 percent among black children.
</P>
<P>
Also childhood poverty grew 59 percent in the suburbs compared
with 34 percent in urban areas.

LUANDA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) announced here today that
all its fighters have been encamped and their weapons surrendered.
</P>
<P>
In a statement presented to UN Special Envoy
Blondin Beye, UNITA said almost all of its 500 policemen have
also been encamped and the remaining 463 policemen will enter
the assembly points in a few days.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said the guardsmen of UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi have not yet been assembled. Their encampment will
be decided by the position of Savimbi in the government of
national unity, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement does not reveal how many former rebels have
been assembled so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission,
UNITA has encamped altogether 45,676 fighters and another
14,399 have defected. A total of 5,011 UNITA policemen have
also been assembled and 244 others defected.
</P>
<P>
Under the Angola Peace Accord, 63,000 UNITA men should be

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Egyptian Minister's Visit Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel today defended its
move to postpone the visit by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, saying careful preparation is needed to ensure it a
success.
</P>
<P>
Israel's move to put off Moussa's visit is widely regarded
as an attempt to reject Egypt's more active involvement in
the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Moussa's visit is aimed at
brokering a deal on the long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment
in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today dismissed Israel's claim
about its bias toward the Palestinian side in mediating the peace
talks. He added that Egypt as the co-initiator of the peace
process with Israel can not be excluded from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also denounced Israel for changing its stand after
agreeing to Moussa's visit in the talks held between Moussa and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in Lisbon, Portugal,
last week.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Mubarak's remarks, Israel's Prime Minister
Office issued a statement stressing that Netanyahu does not
object Moussa's visit, but only thinks it needs careful
preparation to make it a success.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Netanyahu told Mubarak, who made a phon
call Monday night, that he would send his diplomatic adviser
Dore Gold to Cairo today to discuss the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Privately, Israeli senior officials expressed concern about
so-called Egypt's bias toward the Palestinian Authority (PA) in
its mediation.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also angered by the tough position toward Israel
taken by Moussa, a strong critic of Israeli Likud government's
hardline policies. Officials said that Egypt's intervention in the
 Hebron talks at this stage could only further toughen the PA's
position and complicate the problem.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that another reason for Israel's snub to
Egypt is that it does not want Egypt to replace the U.S. as the
leading mediator in the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> UK's Tax Burden Higher Than in 1970s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The tax burden in Britain is
not only higher than it was when Labor left office in 1979, but
also exceeds the figure for 1974, when Labor had a minority
government, according to a Treasury brief on the Budget released
today.
</P>
<P>
The brief says: "UK burden of tax and public spending is lower
than almost any other EU country, including Germany, France and
Italy."
</P>
<P>
But a table shows that on the basis of provisional OECD data
for 1995, while the domestic tax burden - at 35.2 percent of
national income - is indeed lower than that of Germany (39.1
percent), France (44.5 percent), and Italy (41.8 percent), it is
still higher than it was 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the OECD, the UK tax burden was 34.9 percent in
1974, compared with 32.6 percent in 1979, 34.1 percent in 1994,
and 35.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the Government tax record, the brief said: "Highest
marginal rate is now 40 percent compared with 98 percent before
1978-79. Since 1978-79 marginal tax rates on earnings have fallen
but marginal tax rates on spending have risen."
</P>
<P>
"Real take-home pay for a family on average earnings should be
370 pounds (592 U.S. dollars) higher next year than this, after
tax, inflation and earnings growth, over 1,100 pounds (1,760 U.S
dollars) higher than 1991-92," the brief forecasts.

<HEADLINE> S .Africa's Telephone Charges to be Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
state-owned Telecommunication Company (TELKOM), suffering from
financial constraint, will raise telephone fee by 28 percent as
of January 14 next year.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) today quoted a TELKOM
statement as saying that while the cost of standard time local
telephone call is increased, the charges for long-distance calls
-- over 400 kilometers -- and international calls will go down.
</P>
<P>
TELKOM claimed that the overall increase for its basket of
tariffs for 1997 is seven percent -- two percent below the
expected rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reason for cutting down long-distance call
charges, TELKOM said it has traditionally heavily subsidized its
local call tariffs by charging higher rates for its long distance
and international calls, but now the long-distance calls only
accounted for 22 percent of the total calls.
</P>
<P>
TELKOM said the reduction of long-distance and international
call tariffs is an global tendency, adding, "new technology is
leading to 'the death of distance'."
</P>
<P>
Local observers have noticed that TELKOM made the decision to
adjust phone call charges just at the time of transition period,
in which state-owned big companies for the sake of existence is
likely to become private-owned.
</P>
<P>
In addition to public telecommunication departments, the
state-owned industrial giants in South Africa also include Postal
services, the national airline and transportation network.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Partner Countries Pledge to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The foreign minister and
representatives of the member countries of the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council(NACC) and the Partnership for Peace(PfP) ended
their one-day meeting here today, pledging to further strengthen
the cooperation between NATO and its partner countries.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, attended by 42 countries, coincided with the
the fifth anniversary of the inauguration of the NACC, in
December, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed the achievements of the NACC in five
years since its inception and of the PfP.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that further enhancement of transparency and
confidence in security matters among member states must remain a
central aim of future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Views were also exchanged on the initiative to establish an
Atlantic Partnership Council(APC) as a single new cooperative
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The plan to set up the APC was initialed at NATO foreign
ministers' meeting on Tuesday, and was aimed to replace the NACC
and form the framework for enhanced efforts in both practical
cooperation under PfP and an expanded political dimention of
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
However, some NACC members voiced their reservation on this
idea, fearing that it would undermine the role played by the OSCE
(Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) in the
context of security building in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and welcomed the completion of the planning process for the new
force, which was called Stabilization Force and to replace the
current peacekeeping force IFOR in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR mission, of an 18-month duration, will start on
December 20, the time when IFOR's one-year mandate runs out.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also exchanged views on the prospects for
regional cooperation now that the conflict in Bosnia has ceased
and underlined the importance of such cooperation for
strengthening security and stability in the region.

BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland today became the
27th member of NATO's Partnership for Peace(PfP) Program with
Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti's signing the accession
document at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
When announcing its intention to sign up, on 30 October, the
Swiss Government said that it considered that this decision was
compatible with its neutrality(like other neutral countries:
Austria, Finland and Sweden).
</P>
<P>
The PfP is a major initiative introduced by NATO at the
January 1994 Brussels Summit.
</P>
<P>
NATO offered this Program to European countries not members of
the Alliance with the aim to develop practical, defense-related
and military cooperation activities between NATO and PfP member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Two years after the launch of the Program, 27 countries
including Russia and Ukraine had joined. However, the Maltese
Government to have emerged from the October elections immediately
decided to pull out of the PfP, saying that it could not be
reconciled with the concept of neutrality as set out in the
Maltese constitution.

<HEADLINE> S.African Minister Calls for End to Child Labour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Ye Xingzeng
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Commercial exploitation
of children, such as prostitution or bonded labour, is the most
intolerable forms of child labour, and global action is needed to
tackle the issue, South African Welfare and Population
Development Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi noted here today.
</P>
<P>
Launching the 1997 State of the World's Children Report at the
Children's Museum in downtown Johannesburg, Fraser-Moleketi
stressed the need for children protection, saying no child should
labour in hazardous or exploitative conditions, just as no child
should die of preventable illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Demanding an immediate end to the child labour, especially the
commercial sexual exploitation of children, he said: "The
physical and psychological damage inflicted by this horrendous
practice makes it one of the most hazardous forms of child
labour."
</P>
<P>
The State of the World's Children 1997 Report, which focused
on child labour, is also launched worldwide today on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
According to the Report, at least one quarter of the children
in the developing world are working, an estimated 250 million
between the age of 5 to 14 years.
</P>
<P>
The Report also suggests that some immediate steps be needed
to address the root causes of child labour and to ease the plight
of the working children.
</P>
<P>
These steps include the immediate elimination of hazardous and
exploitative child labour, free and compulsory education for
every child, available stringent child labour laws and their
vigorous enforcement, and codes of conduct and procurement
policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, Scholastica Kimaryo, the
UNICEF Representative to South Africa, congratulated the
government for the newly-signed Constitution that contained
strong provisions against hazardous child labour.
</P>
<P>
Kimstyo stressed that children are the future of the world,
therefore, ensuring children's survival, protection,
participation and development is " not only a moral obligation of
humankind, but also a fundamental economic imperative of each
country".

<P>
Johannesburg, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition party of
South Africa today expressed concern over reports that Iran is
involved in the training of the mainly Moslem vigilante group, the
People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, the National Party is demanding
clarification of the speculation from PAGAD and from the government
of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling party said if the reports from London that Iran
is involved in training members of PAGAD is true, South Africans are
entitled to know the truth.
</P>
<P>
The National Party said the time has come for PAGAD to clear its
name, and for President Nelson Mandela and Justice Minister Dullah
Omar to take action. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite the continuing
separatist trend among the former Soviet republics, a "powerful
breakthrough" in the economic integration within the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) should be expected in 1997, Russian
Minister for CIS Affairs Aman Tuleyev said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Tuleyev said: "A dramatic
adjustment of Russia's policy for cooperation with the former
Soviet republics is needed, because the situation has changed over
the five years of the existence of the CIS."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, "today real political integration is
possible only with Belarus." "It would be absurd to talk about it
with other countries."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tuleyev said the main objective of his ministry
was to "create conditions for a new association of the former
Soviet republics."
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry has chosen as its strategy to facilitate
creation of trans-national cooperation which can "cement the
Commonwealth (CIS)."

<HEADLINE> One Shot Dead in Attack in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A 12-year-old boy was
killed, five others wounded, one of them seriously, in a
drive-by shooting attack this afternoon near the West Bank
town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the incident occurred when gunmen
in a passing Subaru car opened fire and shot at an
Israeli vehicle, just outside the Jewish settlement of Beit
El, north of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The report said that "three terrorists were in the Subaru
used in the attack. Two of the three opened fire, probably
with automatic weapons, and the third was driving."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli driver managed to drive to a nearby Israeli
army position, from where the wounded, one of them was woman
and four others were children, were rushed to the Hadassah
Hospital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the car used by the gunmen did
escape into Palestinian-controlled Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has sealed off the area where the
incident occurred and has started intensive manhunt around the
Ramallah area.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu said this evening that the attack occurred in the
West Bank today will not pass without an Israeli response.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu has issued a very
strong statement to Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat, saying he viewed the attack as a most serious
and unfortunate incident and expected a swift and appropriate
response from Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was taking a break together with his family
in Mitzpe Ramon in southern Israel, is reportedly returning
to Jerusalem at this hour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is
expected to announce steps that will be taken immediately as a
result of this evening's attack.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Internal Security Avigdor Kahalani said the
Jewish residents of Judea, Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza
must move about cautiously, specially after dark.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani also stated that although Israel has the right to
enter into Palestinian-controlled Ramallah in "hot pursuit,"
it is unlikely that this will be done.

<HEADLINE> Keeping EMU Options Open Essential, CBI Chief Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's policy of keeping
open the option of entering EMU and of participating fully in the
negotiations is right for it's national interest, Adair Turner,
Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI),
said here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Annual Gathering of the Society of Business
Economists in London, Turner said,"Britain must be fully involved
in the discussions, because it might make sense for us to join,
and also because we have an interest in EMU's success even if we
don't join."
</P>
<P>
Outlining the key potential advantages of EMU, Turner
highlighted two areas:
</P>
<P>
First, the creation of a truly complete single market, in which
competition between companies will be more intense, benefiting
consumers and creating stronger European companies able to compete
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Second, the elimination of the disruptive effect of large
exchange rate oscillations unrelated to changes in costs and
competitiveness, which make real economies more volatile and
hinger long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
Turner stressed: "These advantages are not trivial and created
a significant economic case for an EMU achieved at the appropriate
time and under the appropriate conditions."
</P>
<P>
However, Turner said that a successful EMU required the
development of more flexible labor markets in Europe, and that
without that flexibility EMU carried clear risks.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Britain must play its part fully, urging on its
partners the changes required to make it a success, and keeping
open Britain's option to participate in a successful project, he
added.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu, in denouncing a drive-by shooting attack, said
this evening that Israel would not let the incident pass without
response.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu has issued a very strong
statement to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat, saying he viewed the attack as a most serious and
unfortunate incident and expected a swift and appropriate
response from Arafat.
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old boy was killed and five others injured, one of
them seriously, in a drive-by shooting attack this afternoon near
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred on the road north of Ramallah, when some
gunmen in a passing car opened fire and shot at an Israeli
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli driver managed to get to an Israeli army position,
from where the wounded, one woman and four children, were rushed
to the Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem, while the gunmen were seen
speeding up in the direction of Ramallah, which is out of reach
for Israeli security forces under the Israeli-PLO autonomy
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The attack came at a time of tense relations between Israeli
hardline government and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have tried unsuccessfully for the past two
months to negotiate the terms of an Israeli troop pullout in
Hebron, the last West Bank city still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has sealed off the area where the accident
occurred and has started intensive manhunt around the Ramallah
area.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM: Mideast Peace Is Primary Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri reiterated today that Egypt is primarily concerned
with the achievement of peace in the region in addition to its
Arab responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a pivotal country in the Middle East, does not need
an invitation to shoulder its Arab, regional and international
responsibilities, Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif quoted the
prime minister as saying after the cabinet meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is proceeding with its policy to establish fair and
all-out peace in the region, said the information minister.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting also reiterated the indispensable role of
Egypt in the peace process, as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
told a news conference earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak stressed the continuation of the Egyptian peace efforts
and said it is never biased against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He was dismissing charges by Israel that the Egyptian role
in the peace process is unbalanced and unequalized.
</P>
<P>
"No one can marginalize the Egyptian role in the region as
without Egypt, the peace process would not have been initiated in
Madrid in 1991," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"This is not true as they want us to pressure Arafat into
accepting their proposals whether the Palestinian public opinion
accept them or not and if Arafat considers them suitable or not,"
said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
In a recent publicity campaign to exclude Egypt from the peace
process in the region, the Israeli Hatsofeh paper has accused
Egypt of lining up with the Palestinians and encouraging a
hardline Palestinian stand towards Israel.

"special case and pump in more material aid to them," said ECOMOG
Commander Victor Malu in Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
"An increased welfare package, particularly in the provision of
food assistance, would help further boost the response of the fighers
in the on-going disarmament exercise," Malu told a visiting United
Nations electoral technical team on Tuesday at the ECOMOG headquarters
in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
He said Liberia could not be compared with other countries, because
many fighters "are extremely young and grew up with the gun."
</P>
<P>
According to the peace accord signed in Abuja, capital of Nigeria,
last August, the disarmament exercise in Liberia is aimed at
recovering weapons from the estimated 60,000 factional fighters,
including some 15,000 child fighters.
</P>
<P>
The three-month disarmament program began on November 22, but by
Monday only about 4,000 fighers, including 800 child soldiers, had
handed in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slow progress, the force commander said, ECOMOG is
determined to "ensure that the timetable of the revised schedule of
implementation of the Abuja accord is adhered to."
</P>
<P>
The retrieval of most of the weapons in Liberia during the on-going
disarmament exercise would "further enhance free movement for all
citizens and further ensure an unhindered electioneering campaign when
the time comes."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the supplementary welfare package being provided
by the lcoal non-govenmental organization Susukuu "has helped enhance
the turn-out of fighters at the disarmament centers in Monrovia as
compared to those in the hinderland where no additional relief
materials have been provided."
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Susukuu awarded scholarships to 1,000 fighters to
begin its promised rehabilitation of 10,000 of the fighters.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.N.team is in Liberia to assess the general situation
in the country so that planning for the next presidential and general
elections in May "could commence in earnest."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Defense Officer Charged with Internet Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A high-level civilian scientist
in Canada's Department of National Defense has been charged with
making and distributing child pornography using his office
computer hooked to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Blair Evans, 46, a father of two and a civilian employee in the
department for almost 20 years, is to appear in court on January
2, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Evans, who has PhD in physics and worked in a unit enhancing
radar images for surveillance purposes, has been suspended without
pay.
</P>
<P>
The physicist was arrested on November 29 when police raided
his office at the National Defense Research Establishment.
</P>
<P>
A computer and about 300 diskes containing more than 20,000
pictures and short video clips of children -- some still in
diapers -- engaged in sex acts were seized as a result.
</P>
<P>
"I find it absolutely disgusting and abhorrent that anyone can
get any kind of sexual gratification out of children who are that
young," a police officer involved in the investigation was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The child porn came from a variety of sources from all over the
world, and the investigation is continuing and more people could
be charged, he added.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Douglas Young has ordered his department "to
take every possible measure to find out as much as possible about
this problem" and to determine how to control access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that it is difficult to prevent anyone
from gaining access to pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Possession of child pornography carries a maximum five year
penalty in Canada. A conviction for distributing, selling or
making child pornography carries a maximum 10-year sentence.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Continues Voting on Top UN Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council held on Wednesday another round of poll for the post of
secretary-general, but still could not reach any decision after
three straw votes.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that like the result of voting
yesterday all of the four current candidates for the post failed
to escape negative votes from the permanent members of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The result of the third straw vote are 11 to four votes for
Kofi Annan of Ghana; six to four for Amara Essy of Cote d'Ivoire;
two to ten for Hamid Algabid of Niger and three to nine for
Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah of Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
Exactly like the result of voting on Tuesday afternoon, Kofi
Annan received one negative vote from the permanent members of the
Security Council, Amara Essay two, Hamid Algabid two and Ahmedou
Ould-Abdallah of Mauritania two.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the Security Council are China,
France, Russia, Britain and the United States. Any candidate
running for secretary-general has to receive at least nine votes
in favor and no negative vote of the five permanent members.
</P>
<P>
It means that if happened in a formal meeting, no one of the
four can be recommended by the council to the General Assembly for
the top U.N. post.
</P>
<P>
Council President Francesco Paolo Fulci told press that since
there is no decision reached in the meeting, the council will
continue have straw votes on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 19, the United States cast the lone negative vote
against the incumbent Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for
a second five-year term, saying that he was slow in reforming the
world organization.
</P>
<P>
On December 4, Boutros-Ghali told the Security Council that he
intended to suspend his candidacy for the time being, which opened
door for the nomination of other candidates.
</P>
<P>
But Boutros-Ghali insisted that he remained a candidate for the
top U.N. post and that he would join in the contest when situation
is clarified in the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Vows to Solve Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of

sisal and coffee plantations where they are exposed to inhalation
of pesticides harmful to their health.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Tanzania, which is a signatory of the
Covention on the Rights of the Child, would be committed to
implementing UNICEF's report fundamental demand of elimination of
exploitative and hazardous child labour.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Greek Woman Jailed for Annoying Neighbors with Cats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- An elderly lady was sentenced
to 10 days in jail today by a local court for keeping 30 cats in
her home and turning the lives of complaining neighbors into
hell.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the verdict, Sofia Nathanailidou, 65, stunned the
court in northern Greek town of Salonika by telling judges she
could not afford to pay off her sentence, amounting to 1,500
drachmas (about 6.5 U.S. dollars) per day, and preferred to go to
prison. A man present in court offered to pay the amount and the
woman was released.
</P>
<P>
One of her neighbors, fed up with the noise caused by the
cats, found a law allowing for the possession of only two pets in
an apartment and took her to court.
</P>
<P>
Nathanailidou, who turned up in court with a white cat for
company, said in her plea "these animals are a secret consolation
for me. They are my entire life".
</P>
<P>
The court cautioned her that she will have to remove 28 of her
cats to be in line with the law, but the defiant woman said "this
cannot be done. Wherever we go, even into the woods, all 31 of us
will be together."

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 4 Wounded in Shooting Attack in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed,
four others wounded in a drive-by shooting attack this afternoon
near the West Bank town of Ramallah, according to the latest
Israel Television report.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when gunmen in a passing Subaru car
opened fire, and shot at an Israeli vehicle, just outside the
Jewish settlement of Beit El, north of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The report said that "three terrorists were in the Subaru
used in the attack, and two of the three opened fire, probably
with automatic weapons, and the third was driving."
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old boy was shot dead at the scene before the
Israeli driver managed to drive to a nearby Israeli army
position for help.
</P>
<P>
The wounded, one woman and four children, were immediately
rushed to the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where the seriously
wounded woman was announced dead.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said that the car used by the gunmen did
escape into Palestinian-controlled Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu said this evening that the attack occurred in the West
Bank today will not pass without an Israeli response.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu has issued a very strong
statement to Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat, saying he viewed the attack as a most serious and
unfortunate incident and expected a swift and appropriate
response from Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was taking a Hanukka holiday break with his
familn in southern Israel, is reportedly returning to Jerusalem
at this hour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has
instructed the Israeli security forces to take all necessary
measures to locate and catch the gunmen who carried out the
attack.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered a closure imposed on the city and outskirts of
Ramallah, and demanded the PNA to locate the gunmen and
repatriate them to Israel if they are within the
Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Internal Security Avigdor Kahalani said that the
Jewish residents of Judea, Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza must
move about cautiously, specially after dark.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani also stated that although Israel has the right to
enter into Palestinian-controlled Ramallah in "hot pursuit," it
is unlikely that this will be done.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Meets Envoys From Paris Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 11 (Xinhua) --Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today held discussions with ambassadors from 11
Paris club member states.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the State House, the
discussions centered on the need to expedite the process leading
to an early meeting to consider cancellation and rescheduling of
Tanzania's debts owed to the Paris club members.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told the envoys that the delay of a Paris Club meeting
for Tanzania would joepardise the country's implimentation of the
economic reform program, particularly in regards with estimated
resource flows indicated in the 1996/97 budget.
</P>
<P>
It was made clear at the discussions that the postponement had
been made to facilitate more consultations among the Paris club
member states, while Tanzania had actually completed its
obligations in preparation for the Paris meeting. Therefore, the
postponment had nothing to do with any fault on the Tanzanian
side.
</P>
<P>
The envoys were unanimous in their expression of hopes for a
new date for a Paris meeting on Tanzania probably to be
held next month.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chretien to Lead 3rd Team Canada Mission to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien announced today that he will lead the third Team Canada
mission to Asia from January 8 to 20.
</P>
<P>
The mission to three Asian countries -- South Korea, the
Philippines and Thailand -- will help to "generate new business
for Canadian companies" and "increase exports and create jobs for
Canadians," Chretien said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Chretien has led two Team Canada trade missions to Asia: one to
China in November 1994 and the other to India, Pakistan, Indonesia
and Malaysia early this year. He also led a trade mission to
Chile, Argentina and Brazil in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
These missions have led to an estimated 15 billion U.S. dollars
in business deals and helped Canadian businesses gain access to
new markets.
</P>
<P>
Provincial premiers and territorial leaders, as well as a group
of more than 400 business people, heads of educational
institutions and municipalities and young entrepreneurs, are
expected to accompany the prime minister on the third trade
mission to Asia.
</P>
<P>
This mission will focus on eight important Canadian sectors:
agri-food, financial services, education and culture, environment,
transportation, energy and natural resources, telecommunications
and information technology, and building products and
construction, Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian firms excel in the building of sound and sustainable
economic infrastructure. They specialize in providing goods and
services that help economies grow," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"These are areas of terrific growth in Asia. Sharing this
know-how will ultimately benefit both ourselves and our
Asia-Pacific partners," he added.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Canadian business group are expected to
"complete and sign numerous contracts and agreements," according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Last year, two-way trade of goods and services between Canada
and the three Asian countries totaled over 6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The potential for more business with each country is
considerable, since they are among the fastest growing economies
in the Asia-Pacific region, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Team Canada mission will also kick off Canada's Year of
Asia Pacific in 1997, which is aimed at building on Canada's
strong ties with the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Chretien is expected to discuss ways of
expanding political and economic relations with the region,
including the evolution of regional institutions such as the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rodionov Turned into Russia's First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decree, which entered into force as of the date of
signature, said that Rodionov was dismissed from the army upon
reaching "the age limit for military service."
</P>
<P>
Rodionov, who headed the Academy of the Russian Army General
Staff, was appointed Defense Minister in July 1996 to replace
Pavel Grachev. In October, he was promoted to army general.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the move, presidential spokesman Serge
Yastrzhembsky told reporters that Rodionov will retain the
position of the Defense Minister, but as a civilian, not a
military person. He explained that there were no plans for
appointing another person to the post.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from reporters, Yeltsin said that a
civilian person will henceforth head the Russian Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In his new civilian capacity, Rodionov "will continue to
tackle the most complex aspects of reform of the armed forces
and the strengthening of the army and the navy," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, Rodionov "combines the
experience of a military leader with common sense and political
wisdom," and is well known in the armed forces and has raised a
constellation of military leaders who will reliably support him
in his work.
</P>
<P>
The idea of making a civilian defense minister had long been
discussed in and outside the Kremlin, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who chaired
today's meeting of the Defense Council, confirmed that the idea
of giving civilian status to the leader of the war ministry had
long been discussed "at all levels."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the appointment of Rodionov as a civilian
minister of defense "enhances the role of the military
department."
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Defense Ministry is "a political figure,"
Chernomyrdin went on to say, "especially now that the Ministry of
Defense has to interact with many power structures ad regional
leaders." "It (such interaction) is more efficient when the war
minister is a civilian person," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is by no means a demotion. It enhances the role of the
person as defense minister in the state," the premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in Russian history, the war ministry
will be headed by a civilian person. Rodionov will certainly be
able to form worthy traditions in this respect," Chernomyrdin
said, adding that "the armed forces also have great respect for
Rodionov as a military leader."
</P>
<P>
Major General Valentin Marionov, Who has served in the
Academy of the General Staff for many years, said that a new
historic environment in Russia necessitates structural reform
in the army management and Rodionov fits the role of a civilian
defense minister better than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
This will stimulate the responsibility of the presidential
team and ensure that military reform and national security
issues are not dependent on the personal views and political
orientation of the defense minister, he believes.

<HEADLINE> Canada Supports UNICEF Efforts to Educate Girls in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced today that it
is supporting three major initiatives of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) to enable African girls to attend school.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came from Minister for International
Cooperation Don Boudria at the Canadian launch of the UNICEF's
annual State of the World's Children report.
</P>
<P>
The report focused on child labor, outlining its root causes
and proposing ways to combat this phenomenon. It identified
education as one of the most effective strategies to fight child
labor.
</P>
<P>
"Child labor is a tragic injustice that prevents millions of
young people from receiving the education to which they are
entitled," Boudria said, adding that over 200 million children in
developing countries, the majority of them girls, are affected.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is
supporting three new initiatives with the UNICEF in Africa,
Boudria said.
</P>
<P>
In Malawi, the CIDA is supporting a 1.48-million-U.S.-dollar
UNICEF project to provide educational materials in six school
districts, to build about 25 school shelters and to provide
training for teachers.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, the agency is contributing the same amount to the
Program for the Advancement of Girls Education to help establish
20 pilot schools in two of the country's provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, it is providing some 2.2 million dollars over
three years to support the UNICEF's program to reduce the gender
gap in primary education by giving girls the same access to school
as boys.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Arrives at Turkish Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi crude oil arrived today
at the Turkish Mediterranean terminal of Yumurtalik from the
Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that around 350,000 barrels of crude oil
would be pumped daily throught the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik twin
petroleum pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Tuesday ceremoniously pressed
the button which put the 986-kilometer-long Iraqi-Turkish
pipline back in operation after it remained shut for over six
years in line with the U.N. sanctions against Iraq for its
invasion of nieghboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Before returning from a NATO meeting in Brussels, Turkish
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller hailed
the completion of the final steps for the resumption of oil flow,
saying the deal, signed by Turkey and Iraq for the import of 3.6
million tons of crude for a year and approved by the U.N., would
not only revive the economy of southeastern Turkey, but also
address the energy needs of the country in general.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. approval arrived just a while ago. I attach great
importance to it (opening of the pipeline)," Ciller told
reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement between the U.N. and Iraq allows
Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six month
to buy food and medicine for its sanctions-hit people.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reportedly preparing to hold a ceremony next Monday
to mark the start of oil flow through the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik

<HEADLINE> Liberian Warlord Apologies to ECOMOG for Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Liberian warlord Charles Taylor
has "apologied" to the commander of the African Peace-Keeping
Force ECOMOG, Victor Malu for skirmishes between his fighters and
ECOMOG troops in northeastern Liberia, report reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
A broadcast from Taylor's private radio station said today
that the leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL)
made the apology in a telephone conversation with Malu on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the skirmishes took place "recently"
between ECOMOG troops deployed in Tappita, 215 kilometers east of
Monrovia and NPFL fighters on the Tappita-Zwedru Highway but did
not say wheather there were casualties.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Taylor as saying that two NPFL generals
involved in the skirmishes with the peace-keepers "acted out of
ignorance and have been withdrwan from the area."
</P>
<P>
But the ECOMOG authorities declined to comment on the apology.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG a fortnight ago deployed troops in Tappita to create a
buffer between the NPFL and the rival Liberia Peace Council (LPC)
militia. But ECOMOG sources said sporadic factional skirmishes in
the area prevented the peace-keepers from creating the buffer.
</P>
<P>
In further efforts to stop the factional clashes, ECOMOG on
November 30 airlifted LPC Leader George Boley to Zwedru, about
290 kilometers east of Monrovia, to help quell the clashes.
Zwedru is the stronghold of the LPC.
</P>
<P>
The 90-kilometer highway between Zwedru and Tappita has been
the scene of factional clashes for weeks, forcing the closure of
the road, according to United Nations sources.
</P>
<P>
LPC fighters controlled most of the southeast until April.
</P>
<P>
However, a LPC commander who identified himself as "general
follow me" told reporters in Monrovia that the NPFL forces have
been attacking their positions in the area since April. But the
NPFL denied the charges, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Former PM Believed Fleeing Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Sudanese prime
minister Sadeq Al Mahdi has disappeared since Monday and is
believed to have fled the country, the Ministry of Interior
announced today.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said Al Mahdi, a prominent leader of the
Opposition, is apparently already outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Well informed sources said the former prime minister is most
likely in Eritrea, a base of Sudan's Opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Al Mahdi had enjoyed the freedom of movement
and that he had taken part in all activities without restrictions
when he was in the country.
</P>
<P>
Al Mahdi assumed the premiership in 1986 but was overthrown in
1989 in a bloodless coup staged by armymen deployed around the
capital. Coup leader Omar Hassan Ahmed al Bashir named himself
Prime minister after the coup.
</P>
<P>
Al Mahdi has consistently criticized the current government.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Charge Airline Bombing Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Canadian Mounted
Police (RCMP) expect to charge several suspects in the 1985
Air-India bombing within a few months, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very confident in saying we will be laying charges in that
Air-India investigation some time in the new year," RCMP officer
Doug Henderson was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"By the early spring or late winter, we'll be laying charges,"
said Henderson, who is head of the RCMP Air-India task force.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are residents of British Columbia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On June 23, 1985, Air-India Flight 182 from Montreal to New
Delhi via London was blew up off the coast of Ireland, killing all
329 people on board, including 278 Canadians. It is believed that
a bomb exploded in the cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
The police are targeting multiple suspects, but also believe
"there was one mastermind," Henderson added.
</P>
<P>
The prime suspect was a Sikh militant who fled Canada and died
in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Stymied by the case, the RCMP offered a 1-million-dollar reward
in May 1995 for information leading to criminal charges. So far,
the reward has generated about 100 leads.
</P>
<P>
Last month, police extended the scope of the reward. They
repeated the offer in Southeast Asia in an attempt to reach ethnic
Indian populations in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The investigators are hoping the money will push people on the
fringes of the plot to come forward.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Get 12 Projects from MENA Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is negotiating 12
projects valued at 7 billion U.S. dollars with international
partners exactly a month after the third Middle East and North
Africa economic conference opened here.
</P>
<P>
The projects include a steel sheets factory valued at 1.2
billion dollars, urea fertilizers production facilities at 346
million dollars and 10 other projects to produce steel, cement,
newsprint, fertilizers and petrochemicals at a total cost of 5.35
billion dollars, according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI) issued a report
today on the spin-offs of the Cairo conference which came up with
17 giant projects with capital investment of about 11.7 billion
dollars, said FEI Chairman Mohammed Farid Khamis.
</P>
<P>
One contracted project is to build facilities for the
liquefication of natural gas to be exported to Turkey at a cost
of 4 billion dollars, Khamis said, adding that the annual export
capacity will reach 10 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has also signed a 110-million-dollar contract with the
American Philips company on producing polyethylene at 150,000
tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has won three deals from Kuwait on the production of
nitrogenous and phosphate fertilizers at a cost of 745 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since the conclusion of the conference on November 14, Khamis
said, Egypt has signed protocols on investment cooperation with
Canada, and with France on 461 million French francs soft loans.
</P>
<P>
He added that Egypt and Canada reached a 30-million-dollar
deal on building a state-of-art hospital for critical cases and
accidents victims at the Nasr city, a northeastern area of the
Egyptian capital of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Under another agreement, Kuwaiti Fund for Economic Development
will offer a loan of 18 million Kuwaiti dinars (about 61.2
million dollars) as a contribution to the overhaul of the
sanitary drainage network in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Tory Paymaster General Resigns Over Cash-for-Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Paymaster General
David Willetts resigned after being criticized in a Commons
Committee report on his role in a so-called "sleaze" inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Willetts quitted as the Commons Standards Committee published
a report accusing him of concealing information in its
cash-for-question inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The report said, "We cannot accept much of the memorandum
submitted to the committee by Mr Willetts, nor much of his oral
evidence, as being accurate."
</P>
<P>
The inaccuracy of Willetts' evidence had "substantially
aggravated the original offense," the report added.
</P>
<P>
Willetts said he was very sorry his integrity had been called
into question. However, he said he would stand by his evidence to
the committee.
</P>
<P>
The Tories have technically lost their parliamentary majority
since MP John Gorst's quit last week, which would make it hard for
the Tories to push through some legislation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Willetts' departure as paymaster
general is another severe blow for Prime Minister John Major.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Willetts' resignation, Labor deputy leader John
Prescott said, "This is another massive embarrassment for John
Major, yet another example of the government disintegrating before
our eyes."
</P>
<P>
"This is another example of a minister whose word cannot be
trusted," Prescott added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Political Advisor Arrives in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Advisor to the Israeli prime
minister Dore Gold arrived here tonight on a 24-hour visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Gold will discuss with senior Egyptian Foreign Ministry
officials the latest developments of Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations and major issues of mutual concern, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told a news conference this
afternoon that during Gold's visit, "the main issue is Hebron." But
Gold was not carrying new proposals, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official's visit came at a time when Egypt and
Israel are increasingly engaged in tit-for-tat verbal warfare on
the Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Two months of talks on Hebron between Israel and Palestine has
stalled over Israeli demands for better security guards for the
450 Jewish settlers among the 10,000 Arabs in the West Bank city
still occupied by Israel.
