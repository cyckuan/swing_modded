DHAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (
BNP)led four-party opposition alliance Tuesday called for a
country-wide dawn to dusk general strike on August 6 as part of
its on-going movement to force the government to step down.
</P>
<P>
The call for the general strike was announced from separate
rallies held in the capital Tuesday by the four parties-- the BNP,
the Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islamic Oikya Jote (
Islamic Solidarity Front).
</P>
<P>
Apart from the general strike, the opposition will carry out
mass campaign across the country from Tuesday to August 4 and
bring out torch processions on August 5 to drum up support in
favor of the general strike.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally held at the Paltan Maidan, BNP chief and
former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia said the Awami League
government has lost all its credibility to stay in power as it
failed to run the country with sincerity and honesty.
</P>
<P>
"The government-sponsored terrorism and the killings of the
opposition activists have pushed the country towards destruction
and nobody's life is safe under this government," she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent Chittagong killing, in which eight
persons including six leaders of the Student League, the student
wing of the ruling party, were killed when miscreants opened brush
fire on them,Khaleda Zia said this killing is the result of inter-
party conflicts of the Awami League. But the ruling party blamed
the Jamaat's student wing Islamic Student Front for the killing,
she added.
</P>
<P>
She accused the ruling party of doing it to divert the
attention of people from the opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
The BNP chairperson said the four-party alliance will remain
united in the anti-government movement.

<HEADLINE> Bush Picks Former Defense Secretary Cheney as Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush called former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney on Tuesday morning and asked him to be his running mate, AP
quoted a highly placed Republican official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The former defense secretary has accepted the offer, the
official said. Texas governor Bush planned a news conference for
later Tuesday and a trip to Cheney's home state of Wyoming on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his two decades of public service, Cheney served as
President Ford's chief of staff, six terms in Congress from
Wyoming. He served as Pentagon chief under former President George
Bush and masterminded the Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, currently director of the Morgan Stanley Co., will
bring the ticket a wealth of foreign policy experience, which
Texas Governor Bush lacks himself, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, 59, suffered three heart attacks by age 48, but a
doctor commissioned by the Bush campaign stated that his health "
should not interfere with a strenuous political campaign."
</P>
<P>
Cheney was chosen by Bush to head his search for a running mate,
but he emerged as the top candidate himself Friday after he
switched his voter registration from Texas back to his home state
of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
Bush will be officially nominated as Republican presidential
candidate at the party's national convention scheduled to be held
in Philadelphia from July 31 to August 3.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hold Israel Responsible for Summit Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials on Tuesday
evening held Israel responsible for the failure of the Camp David
summit, but reiterated their willingness to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in Gaza on Tuesday, Palestinian
President's Secretary General Tayeb Abdul Rahim voiced his extreme
regret at the summit fiasco which, according to Rahim, was caused
by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
However, Rahim maintained that the peace process can not
collapse and the Palestinians, on their part, are willing to pursue
efforts to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as baseless that the progress might be triggered in
the final status issues, reiterating that the next steps will be
devoted to carrying on peace and declaring the Palestinian
statehood before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He added that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will tour several
Arab countries soon to keep their leaders posted on the outcomes of
the Camp David summit, trying to formulate a united Arab position
on the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Palestine Liberation Organization's representative in Washington
Hassan Abdel Rahman also held Israel responsible for the failure to
reach a peace pact at Camp David following 15-day negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Rahman ascribed the fiasco to Barak's recalcitrance regarding
all issues especially Jerusalem and insistence on shrugging off the
Palestinian position, which runs counter to the international
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his entourage are expected to leave Washington
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Barak held Arafat responsible for the failure of
the summit, saying that Arafat's position on Jerusalem resulted in
reaching no framework agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Kurdish Opposition leader Asks Help From Ankara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Jalal Talabani, leader of Iraqi
Patriotic Union for Kurdistan (PUK), said on Wednesday that they
considered Turkey a major power in the region and will act
accordingly with Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Ankara Iraqi opposition leader paid a three-day visit to
Turkey starting on Monday. Turkish governmental sources said that
he has asked for help from Turkey, Turkish Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
But the sources did not specify what kind of supports he asked
during his visit. The PUK has denied press reports that Talabani
asked for military equipment during his meeting with Turkish
officials.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. presidential race gears up, the U.S. seems to be
restarting the ever-diminished momentum to overthrow Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein, the efforts not echoed by Turkey which is afraid of
a Kurdish state in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al Gore, the U.S. vice president and Democratic presidential
candidate, met early this month in Washington with Iraqi
oppositions, showing the U.S. government has not given up its
policy of overthrowing Saddam.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Gore told Iraqi opposition leaders that
Saddam stands in the way of Middle East peace and "must be removed
from power".
</P>
<P>
He promised the oppositions that the U.S. would sustain the "no-
fly zones" over northern and southern Iraq that the U.S. and its
allies patrol to prevent Saddam from "threatening citizens" in
these regions.
</P>
<P>
Differing from the U.S., Turkey gives the priority of its Iraq
policy to secure stability and territorial integrity of Iraq rather
than toppling Saddam, which might cause aftershocks in chains,
including instability and a Kurdish state in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since last year's capture of Abdullah Ocalan, chieftain of the
outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Turkey has made its
remarkable success in suppressing the PKK, which waged a 15-year
armed campaign for self-rule in the Kurdish-populated southeast,
bordering northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ankara, however, has been uneasy and vigilant over developments
in Kurdish-inhabited northern Iraq, particularly those concerning
the possible establishment of a Kurdish state in the region.
</P>
<P>
On numerous occasions, Turkey has stated that it would not
permit the founding of an independent Kurdish state in the region
and urging Baghdad to reinforce its administration over its
Kurdish-populated area.
</P>
<P>
The common concerns over an independent Kurdish state in
northern Iraq prompted the two countries to warm their ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is even considering upgrading the status of its
diplomatic representation in Baghdad from the level of charge
d'affaires at present to that of ambassador in order to step up
their efforts to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Baghdad early this month, Turkish Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu said that it is up to Baghdad
to solve its all problems in the region, calling on the regime to
adopt an all-embracing policy for its citizens in northern Iraq
and realize reconciliation with the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Huseyin Dirioz, deputy spokesman of Turkish Foreign Ministry,
said on Wednesday that the policies of the PUK on the PKK "are more
positive and effective."
</P>
<P>
He urged the PUK to keep its policies towards the anti-Ankara
separatist PKK.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Talabani's visit, the spokesman said,"
territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq are important for
Turkey. Within this framework, we are in contact with everybody.
Positive contacts have been held."

<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Latin American banana
exporters will get together in Panama City next month to create a
common front against the discriminatory proposal of the European
Union (EU) against the regional product.
</P>
<P>
A joint policy of the Latin American banana producers against
the EU discriminatory policies will be discussed at the meeting
called by Panama, according to Panamanian Vice Foreign Trade
Minister Roberto Henriquez, the local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the tariff the Latin American countries
would have to pay and the one applied to the former European
colonies in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific (ACP),
according to the EU proposal, is so big that Latin American
bananas could not compete with those of the ACP in Europe, said
Henriquez.
</P>
<P>
Latin American banana producing countries have insisted that
the EU fruit import rule is discriminatory against them and
benefits the ACP countries, and that the European bloc has not
abided by the World Trade Organization (WTO) resolutions on the
matter.

<HEADLINE> 51,000 EU Citizens Register for Belgian Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 51,000 EU citizens have
put down their names to vote in Belgium's local elections in
October, the local media said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The provisional figure was announced by the Belgian Interior
Ministry. More than half of the people who registered for the vote
are Italian nationals.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that EU citizens have the right to take
part in the Belgian local elections if they registered before July
31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In fact, EU citizens of other EU member states living in the
country have no duties to vote, but they will be seen as law
violator if they did not go to vote after being registered for the
local elections.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Interior Minister Antoine Duquesne said he
expected around 45,000 EU citizens living in Belgium to register
for the elections on October 8. Registration is open until next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to data, a total of 498,315 EU citizens living in the
country have the right to vote in Belgian local elections. So far,
Italians made the largest effort, with 28,330 registrations,
followed by France with 8,954 and the Netherlands with 5,410.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the list are Finland with 51 registrations, two-
thirds of them women, Austria with 100 and Sweden with 104.

</P>
<P>
The Turkish Highway General Director Dincer Yigit said Tuesday
that the three bidders -- AJTC, IBKO and BV -- will be granted 45
days to submit their proposals.

</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Cyprus Communications and Works
Minister Averof Neophytou and visiting Greek Minister of Transport
and Communications Christos Verelis.
</P>
<P>
The committees will convene every two months and the two
ministers will attend the meetings every six months to discuss
developments.
</P>
<P>
Greece has prepared the legal framework to open its
telecommunications market, said the Greek minister, adding that by

BEIRUT -- Thirty donor countries and six regional and
international financial institutions have agreed to attend the
donors
meeting to be held here on Thursday and Friday, said Lebanese
Minister
of Economy, Trade and Industry Nasser Saidi.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will work out the frameworks of 100 development and
construction projects in the recently-liberated areas in south
Lebanon, Saidi was quoted Wednesday by the al-Alam al-Youm
newspaper as saying.
</P>

<P>
BEIRUT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah asserted on Tuesday that
its guerrillas will not confront or resist United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) after they are deployed in the liberated

</P>
<P>
"Hezbollah is prepared to take whatever measures are necessary
to ensure a smooth UNIFIL deployment once the Lebanese government
confirms that all Israeli border encroachments have been
corrected", An Nahar newspaper quoted an unnamed Hezbollah official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
As for weapons, "the arms of the resistance will remain readily
within reach in the equation, but they will be kept invisible", he
added.
</P>
<P>
Ad Diyar newspaper also quoted a Hezbollah official as saying
the group's guerrillas will remove all fortified positions and
observation posts they had set up along the border with Israel in
the last two months in advance of UNIFIL's deployment.
</P>
<P>
"These positions were erected on temporary basis to monitor
enemy movements, pending the arrival of U.N. troops and Lebanese
forces at the region", the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added the border positions will not be needed when the U.N.
forces are in place to take charge of border security affairs and
there will be no problem or friction between Hezbollah and UNIFIL
or Lebanese regular forces.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Disappointed with G-8 Stance on Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
expressed disappointment over the refusal of the group of eight
industrialized countries (G-8) to relieve the debt burden of poor
nations, the Nigerian press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister of State Reuben Onyia was quoted as
saying in the capital Abuja Tuesday that Nigeria could not
understand why the G-8 could not have written off even a fraction
of the debts owed by the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC),
while deciding to spend hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars on
other areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister maintained that the much expected democratic
dividend might be a dream if the developed countries continued to
be non-committal to alleviating debt burdens of the poor ones.
</P>
<P>
At the G-8 summit in Okinawa, Japan, last week, Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is also the chairman of the G-77,
an organization mainly composed of developing countries,
vigorously canvassed debt cancellation for developing countries so
they could be unfettered in pursuing economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We had expected something positive from the G-8. The
communique (of the just concluded G-8 summit) fell short of this,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which owes a total external debt of some 30 billion
dollars, is currently Africa' s most indebted country.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Armed Rebel Group Wants Democracy Before Talks With Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Pang Yong
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A major Burundian armed Hutu
rebel group has reiterated its demand to restore democracy in the
central African country before it holds direct talks with the
current government over cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Jerome Ndiho, spokesman of the National Council for the Defense
of Democracy - Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD),
told a press conference here on Wednesday that as long as the
draft peace deal talked about by the other 19 warring parties
refuse to take into consideration the 1992 Constitution, his
movement will not be involved with the negotiations aimed at
ending the seven-year civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ndiho described the 1992 Constitution as "the basic fundamental
document expressing the will of the people".
</P>
<P>
"Our movement is ready to negotiate, but we have to respect the
will of the people when we negotiate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "we have to respect the security of the people, it is
impossible to have peace in Burundi by military way. Peace in
Burundi must be achieved by a political settlement."
</P>
<P>
"The target of our movement," he explained, "is fighting for
security for everybody in Burundi."
</P>
<P>
"As long as political prisoners and concentration camps are not
free, as long as the constitution is not respected, our movement
will never lay down weapons," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said his movement will accelerate direct
negotiations with the government after the issues he mentioned are
solved.
</P>
<P>
"If we want peace, we have to negotiate, it is the better way
to stop the war," he said. "But we only agree to talk with the
enemy party."
</P>
<P>
According to Ndiho, "not all 19 parties and groups negotiating
in Arusha are our enemies. One of them is our enemy, that is the
Tutsi-dominated army led by (President Pierre) Buyoya."
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming deadline of August 28 of the signing of the
final peace agreement under the mediation of former South African
President Nelson Mandela, Ndiho said they will attend the signing
if invited, but "to be there is one thing, to sign is another."
</P>
<P>
He further explained that if his movement sign an agreement, in
which the will of the people is not included, it will be
impossible to implement it on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot take a responsibility of a document which we are not
sure whether it is accepted by the people. But when our movement
signs it, it will respect the signature and we will implement what
we agree."
</P>
<P>
"We want peace, but we are realistic," he said. "How can they
ask us to sign while we were not involved in Arusha negotiations
over the past two years? What they are doing is a good thing,
please go ahead, finalize the document and sign the agreement. It
will be a step forward to peace. What is important to us is to go
ahead with direct negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye, leader of the CNDD-FDD, attended
for the first time a round of peace talks held in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha last week.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft accord being negotiated by 19 Burundian parties
and groups, the Tutsi minority, which has dominated Burundi's
political and economic life since independence, will have to hand
over power to a democratically elected government in three years'
time.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Burundians, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the ethnic civil war between majority Hutus and minority
Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Cervix Cancer Awareness Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare
Minister Timothy Stamps launched the first of its kind cancer of
the cervix awareness campaign in Harare on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, spearheaded by the Health and Child Welfare
Ministry, is expected to be an annual event to make Zimbabweans
aware of the dangers of the disease which is killing millions of
women each year in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the ministry, cervix cancer
accounted for 30.7 percent of all cancers in black women and 24
percent for all races. In Zimbabwe, cancer of the cervix was
responsible for one third of all deaths due to cancer.
</P>
<P>
The disease affects any women who is sexually active but women
aged between 30 and 59 years are more at risk.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has put in place about 1 million U.S.
dollars to purchase cancer drugs, Stamps said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Youth Development,
Gender and Employment Creation Shuvai Mahofa said there is need to
establish a policy for screening women to prevent and control
cancer of the cervix.
</P>
<P>
If women are educated about risk factors of the disease, it
would result in them having lifestyles that decrease exposure.
</P>
<P>
She recommended that screening be done at no cost as the needy
patients, most of them in rural areas, can not afford to attend
antenatal, postnatal or family planning clinics.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Launches Aviation Security Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania launched on
Wednesday a national civil aviation security program to boost the
confidence of air operators and passengers using the country's
airports and airspace.
</P>
<P>
Salim Msoma, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Communications and Transport, told a press conference here that
the new system will promote Tanzania's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
The national economy will benefit from a more safe air
transport which plays a very significant role in tourism and mail
and cargo transportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Msoma, "the move demonstrates Tanzania's
commitment to fulfilling her obligations to the international
civil aviation conventions." He hailed the program a very
important milestone in the history of civil aviation in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Air safety and security must be strictly maintained due to the
fact that aviation accidents are usually fatal although the
percentage of fatalities in air accidents is lower than that of
road, railway or marine vessel accidents, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that those charged with the responsibility to
ensure aviation safety must ensure that their knowledge,
experience and capability of fighting crime are always more
advanced than those of criminals if aviation security is to be
sustained.
</P>
<P>
"The speed, reliability and convenience of air transport is
ideal not only to ordinary passengers but also to smugglers and
drug dealers," he said, noting that "aircraft have remained
tempting baits for hijackers."
</P>
<P>
On the legal aspect, Msoma said his ministry will accord
special consideration to proposals to amend legislation which is
out of date or introduce provisions which will cater for the
changing security environment.

<HEADLINE> High-Level Meeting of Global Compact Concludes at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-sponsored high-
level meeting of the Global Compact concluded here Wednesday with
the promise from the participants to work together to build a more
inclusive global market.
</P>
<P>
The Global Compact is a U.N.-sponsored platform for encouraging
and promoting good corporate practices and learning experiences in
the areas of human rights, labor and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Global Compact was initiated in Davos in 1999 by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brought together leaders from global business, the
international labor movement and civil society organizations.
</P>
<P>
Participants from nearly 50 transnational companies pledged to
promote broadly shared values and practices that reflect global
and social needs and make globalization work for all people.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to translate the principles of the compact into
corporate practices by advocating the compact in their mission
statements, annual reports and similar venues, and joining with
the United Nations in partnership projects, either at the policy
level or at the operational level in developing countries, such as
helping villagers link up to the Internet, or strengthening small
and medium-sized firms.
</P>
<P>
The labor and civil society partners will help to build and
deepen the compact, and lend their expertise and support to
designing and implementing its undertakings.
</P>
<P>
All participants agreed to help involve additional actors and
to meet the goal of adding to the compact coalition 100 large
transnational corporations and 1,000 companies overall from across
the world's regions within a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reiterated his personal
commitment to the initiative. He asked all participants to
finalize a priority plan for collaborative action within the next
five months and announced that he would establish a Global Compact
Office to help make this happen.
</P>
<P>
The Global Compact sets a frame of reference for industry
initiatives as well as regional and governmental-led efforts. In
the months since the world trade talks in Seattle, more and more
businesses and organizational leaders are recognizing the
importance of the Global Compact as a means to address social
problems and to keep world markets open.

<HEADLINE> 1 Million Cubans March Against Trade Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 1 million Cubans marched
Wednesday along the main streets of Havana, led by President Fidel
Castro, to protest against the United States' anti-Cuban policy.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration is the biggest ever in the history of the
Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
Those taking part in the march carried small Cuban flags and
flags of the July 26 Movement that started the armed rebellion to
topple President Fulgencio Batista (1952-1958).
</P>
<P>
The marchers demanded the elimination of the Cuban Adjustment
Act, the Helms-Burton and the Torricelli laws as well as the
lifting of the U.S. blockade.
</P>
<P>
Cuban official estimates say that the U.S. sanctions have
caused the island economic losses amounting to more than 67
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The march came amid the most significant efforts by Congress in
nearly two generations to ease sanctions imposed by the Kennedy
administration against the island at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The event coincided with the 47th anniversary of the July 26,
1953, attack by Castro and his followers on an army barracks who
launched the Cuban Revolution against the dictatorship of the then
President Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives last week voted to stop
enforcing provisions that ban American food exports and limit
sales of U.S. medicine to Cuba and four other nations --Iran,
Libya, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Sudan. The U.
S. Senate passed a bill on the same day to permit food and medical
sales to the five countries
</P>
<P>
While Cuba welcomed the moves, it said they do not go far
enough and continued to demand a total lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has been under a total trade embargo since February 1962,
longer than any other country except the DPRK. The sanctions were
tightened in July 1963, and most travels by Americans to the
island then were made illegal.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Terrorist Allowed to Stay in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's Council of State has
quashed a decision by Belgian Interior Minister Antoine Duquesne
relating to Fehrye Erdal, a suspect terrorist who is seeking
political asylum in the country.
</P>
<P>
Erdal is a Turkish national currently in Belgian prison. She is
wanted in her own country on suspicion of involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The move of the Council of State, Belgium's highest advisory
body, means that the woman prisoner has been allowed to stay in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government originally decided not to extradite
Erdal who is wanted in Turkey in connection with the slaying of a
top industrialist because she has applied for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
However, the interior minister said the Turkish had to leave
the country since she had posed a possible threat to public order
and could not qualify for the country's asylum procedure.
</P>
<P>
Erdal, who was on hunger strike for 10 days in prison, can now
stay in Belgium while her application for political asylum is
examined after the rule by the Council of State.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Hopes to Deploy Peacekeepers in Southern Lebanon Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eckhard told the press that U.N. Special Envoy on the Middle
East Terje Roed-Larsen conducted a new air and ground inspection
Wednesday of the line of withdrawal set by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said that after Roed-Larsen's latest inspection, he
held a meeting for more than two hours with the commander of the
Israeli army's northern command.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen said afterward that "he has received a strong
commitment from the Israeli side that they would immediately begin
rectifying any violations that had been found today," according to
Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, they agreed to fix any future violations reported
to them by the U.N. force," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Roed-Larsen remains cautious, but he still hopes to be in
a position to report back tonight to Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud that all the outstanding violations have been resolved,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, deployment of the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon as well as Lebanese government security forces
can begin either late tonight or tomorrow, he added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations several times confirmed that the Israeli
withdrawal had been complete, but this was followed each time by
complaints of the new border violations.
</P>
<P>
The most recent complaints were on Tuesday, which delayed the
scheduled deployment of U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council endorsed Tuesday the
deployment of U.N. and Lebanese troops in southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM: Peace Hope Still Alive EDS-Updates with Barak's remarks at airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said on Wednesday that there is still hope for the Israelis and
Palestinians to make peace despite the failure of the Camp David
summit talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv,
Barak expressed disappointment at the collapse of the talks but
insisted that hope is still alive for the two sides to strike a
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks would resume although there might be setbacks
and
reversions on the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
Barak blamed the Palestinians, saying "we have as
yet not succeeded because we have not found a partner who is
prepared to make decisions on all topics" and that "the
Palestinians have not given up part of their dreams."
</P>
<P>
He said he had tried every possibility to make peace with the
Palestinians in order to end the century-long hostility with the
Palestinian neighbors and left no stone unturned at the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, the terms raised by the Palestinians, he said, were
unacceptable. He made no mention of when and how the stalled peace
talks would be resumed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has just returned empty-handed from the 15-
day U.S.-brokered Camp David summit talks which were aimed to
strike a peace deal on the final status issues such as the status
of Jerusalem, border, water resources, the future of Jewish
settlements and the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The just-ended historic summit was reported to have achieved
significant progress on other core issues but collapsed over the
insurmountable gaps between the two sides on the status of
Jerusalem, holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been demanding full sovereignty over east
Jerusalem, which was grabbed by the Israelis during the 1967 Middle
East War, and have vowed to declare a statehood with this part of
the holy city as its capital. The Israelis are determined to keep
a united and undivided Jerusalem under its control.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was almost politically crippled with the successive
resignation of his coalition partners prior to his departure for
the summit, fought a hard battle on his way to Camp David, wishing
to bring back a peace deal to fulfill his election promise.
</P>
<P>
He is now back home empty-handed and is faced with the uphill
task of handling the political crisis. It is hard to predict how
long it will take him to settle the political dust and be able to
spare the energy to put the peace talks back on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israelis and the Palestinians are trying to exercise
restraint over the failure of the summit talks, which might incur a
new round of violence.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Kuwait Deny Dispute on Marine Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The oil ministers of Iran and Kuwait
on Wednesday denied that there was any dispute between the two
countries concerning the demarcation of their marine borders in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference here on Wednesday, Iranian
Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and his Kuwaiti counterpart
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said that Iran and Kuwait would hold
talks in September on determining the boundaries of a continental
shelf in the Gulf, which is rich in gas and oil.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Kuwait see no differences over demarcating the
continental shelf, and problems should be solved on the basis of
brotherly and good neighborly relations, Zanganeh was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the minister expressed hope that the two countries
would reach an understanding on the issue during Sabah's three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
The continental shelf, in northern Gulf, covers the Dorra gas
field, estimated to hold three to five percent of the world's known
gas reserves. But the area is claimed by three regional countries -
Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iran staged drilling operations in the offshore gas field in
May, which reportedly invited protests from Kuwait. But Tehran
announced later that it had stopped the operations, insisting,
however, that it was drilling in its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia signed a final maritime border accord
involving the continental shelf on July 2, which is considered as a
crucial step toward reaching a similar agreement with non-Arab Iran
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Sabah, who arrived here on Monday, said determination of the
Iranian-Kuwaiti marine borders in the Gulf depends on talks between
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the determination of their marine
borders, while Kuwait and Riyadh have reached an agreement on the
issue. He said Iran and Kuwait are following international
regulations concerning the issue, and the two sides have reached
agreements on certain principles of the subject.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of any extra increase in Kuwait's oil output,
Sabah said that his country does not plan to raise its oil
production beyond what was agreed upon by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and is still adhering to the
OPEC protocols.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Saudi Arabia's plan to unilaterally increase
oil production, Sabah said it was just media speculation.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe this because it has not yet been confirmed by
officials of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh and Sabah also issued a joint communique on Wednesday,
which stressed the importance of preserving and protecting oil
market stability in line with long-term interests of oil producers
and consumer countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers, in the communique, called for maintaining
unity among members of the oil cartel.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining stability in the oil market is a duty of all the
OPEC member countries and any measure to this end should be adopted
through consensus, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that developments in the oil market should be
investigated continuously so as to adopt necessary and proper
measures on time to maintain balance between supply and demand.

<HEADLINE> Israel Only Offers Palestinians 88 Percent of West Bank, Gaza: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
only agreed to hand over 88 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
land to the Palestinians during the Camp David talks, a senior
member accompanying Barak back home from the U.S. said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is much lower than what was speculated by early
Israeli media reports, such as 95 percent or even 98 percent,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are asking for the handover of the whole West
Bank and Gaza Strip territories and they want to establish an
independent state on the land in September.
</P>
<P>
After going through 15-day-long exhausting talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David, Barak arrived at
Ben Gurion International Airport, Tel Aviv, shortly before 6 p.m.
(1500 GMT) Wednesday, without an Israeli-Palestinian agreement in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
The summit, under the guidance of U.S. President Bill Clinton,
tried but failed to resolve all of the core issues between the two
sides, especially the future status of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Due to the U.S.-exercised successful media blackout during the
talks, only limited, and often conflicting, information was leaked
from Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Israel Radio report, quoting the unnamed senior
source, revealed the first batch of official details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The source, a senior member of Barak's staff on the prime
minister's Air Force One plane, added that Barak also agreed to
absorb thousands of Palestinian refugees on the basis of "family
reunification."
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 3.5 million Palestinian refugees, who were
forced to flee their homes in the territories because of the
establishment of Israel and the subsequent Israeli-Arab war in
1948, currently living in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and other Middle
East Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are urging Israel to allow all these refugees
back to the homes they left behind decades ago, which the source
claimed as one of the major reasons for the summit failure.
</P>
<P>
As of another intractable issue, the status of Jerusalem, the
source said the Palestinians rejected an Israeli proposal, in which
they could establish a capital for their future state adjacent to
the Jerusalem municipality and named the capital Al-Quds, or the
name for Jerusalem in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also rejected an U.S. bridging proposal, which
suggested postponing the final status of the Temple Mount and the
Old City of Jerusalem for several years to future talks, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Israel proposed a "multi-sovereignty"
arrangement over the stone-walled Old City, which is swarmed with
famous religious sites of the three world religions, Christianity,
Islam, and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement will guarantee persons of all faiths free access
to the holy sites inside the confines of the Old City.
</P>
<P>
Israel also agreed to permit the Palestinians autonomous rule
over the Al-Aqsa and other Temple Mount mosques, and offer the
Palestinians access to the Temple Mount via a series of bridges and
special access roads.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue was reportedly the major stumbling block in
the talks. Israel regards the city as its "eternal and undivided
capital," while the Palestinians want to see at least the eastern
part of the city, which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East
war, as the capital of their own future state.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Khatami to Run for Re-election in 2001 EDS-Adds remarks by Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
announced here Wednesday that he will seek re-election in the next
presidential race in May, 2001.
</P>
<P>
"I will participate in the elections," the president told a
gathering of university chancellors and heads of research centers,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Khatami pledged that he will stick to his reform
programs, as he had promised during the 1997 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I will work hard to my last breath to fulfill my promised
programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on those programs, Khatami stressed that Iran's
reforms should be multilateral, which should be implemented in
every sector of the society.
</P>
<P>
"If we go ahead with a multilateral and sustainable
development, ... we have defined reform accurately and we will
succeed in reaching the goals for different aspects," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Reform-minded Khatami won a landslide victory in the
presidential election in 1997, defeating his conservative rival,
then Majlis (parliament) speaker Netaq Nuri.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's triumph initiated a reformist campaign in the country,
which has become so strong in recent years that it ended the long-
time conservative dominance of the Majlis in February's
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives have stepped up efforts in recent months to
undermine the reformist movement. Using their control of the
judiciary, they have ordered the closure of some 19 reformist
papers and journals, putting a number of journalists and activists
in prison.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, too, are making preparations for next year's
presidential election, hoping that someone from their camp can take
over the important post.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati would be the conservative candidate to compete with
Khatami next year.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in 1997, Khatami has been trying to ease the
restrictions on people's life. He encourages political
participation by the people and advocates press freedom.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, Khatami's policy of detente and dialog achieved
success. Many people believe that Khatami still has a high
supporting
rate if he competes in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
But Khatami has yet to find effective solutions to the country's
economic problems, such as high inflation and unemployment. The
conservatives are likely to use his economic shortcomings to gain
votes.

<HEADLINE> Eight Egyptians Referred to Court for Neglect of Radioactive Object </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Eight Egyptians were referred to
court Wednesday on charges of neglect in the case of a radioactive
object that fatally poisoned two people last month, the country's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Salim Sayyed Ahmed, 48, owner of a pipe welding firm, and seven
others who worked for him, face up to 15 years of hard labour if
convicted, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of using radioactive objects without a license
and failing to take proper precautions, which led to the death
of Fadl Hassan Fadl, a farmer, and his son Hassan Fadl Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The accused have also been charged with failing to inform the
authorities that the object had been lost.
</P>
<P>
Fadl, 61, found the piece of iridium, which was used to check
the fastness of gas pipe joints, on his land in the village of Mit
Halfa north of Cairo and took it home, thinking it was a precious
metal.
</P>
<P>
The farmer and his son died in June from exposure to the object,
while five more members of the family were treated in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Atomic Energy Authority, in a report issued earlier this
month, said it suspected the object had been dumped illegally to
avoid paying the fees charged to dispose of radioactive waste at
its site.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Human Skeletons Unearthed in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Human skeletons dating back to 1,200
B.C. were unearthed in excavations underway in Kortik Hills in
Bismil township of southeastern Diyarbakir province on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vecihi Ozkaya, a lecturer of Dicle University, said they expect
to uncover more unique artifacts from the Kortik Hills, reported
the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
What they had found in their excavations so far include human
skeletons, stone vases, cutting tools and ornaments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ozkaya, who heads a 23-member team including eight lecturers,
have been engaged in the archaeological excavations in the region
for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
The cutting tools, ornaments and vases depict the life style of
the people who lived there before metal tools were invented, said
Ozkaya.
</P>
<P>
"The graves that we have found indicate a burial tradition which
is very different from that of Islam and Christianity," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The battle tools which were made of flint, reveal the existence
of Chalcolithic age. The burial tradition in the region resembles
the local tradition of Trans-Caucasus, Upper Mesopotamia and
partial Central Anatolia," Ozkaya said.
</P>
<P>
"The region was a bridge between eastern and western culture.
The ceramics and skeletons we have unearthed till today, bring
forward a new approach to the political and cultural relations that
existed three thousand years ago," Ozkaya added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Yugoslavia to Establish Strategic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Yugoslavia have agreed to
establish "strategic relations" between the two countries, Iraqi
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of both Iraq and Yugoslavia came to this agreement
due to "joint aims and principles" in their struggle against the
aggressive policy of the United States, Ramadan said.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan made the remarks when he met visiting Yugoslav Foreign
Trade Minister Borislav Vukovic on Wednesday, the official Iraqi
News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Vukovic expressed keenness to strengthen bilateral
relations, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav minister, heading a 60-member delegation, arrived
in the Iraqi capital Baghdad late Monday for a four-day visit of
the country.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with his Iraqi counterpart Mohammad Mehdi Salah on
Tuesday and discussed ways of expanding bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Yugoslavia have been intensifying relations by
frequently exchanging visits of senior officials.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting Yugoslav Vice President Dragan
Tomichi in early March, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Iraq
stands firmly by the Yugoslav people in their struggle against the
aggressions of the U.S. and its allies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is the first in the Arab world to condemn the aggressions
by the U.S.-led Western air war against Yugoslavia last year,
Saddam said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has also voiced support to Iraq's confrontation with
the U.S. and called for the lifting of the sanctions on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel Meguid blamed Israel on Wednesday for the failure of peace
negotiations at Camp David, hailing Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat for not backing down on his demands.
</P>
<P>
Israel's stubbornness and the fact that it imposed five "nos" on
the summit before it began were the main reasons for the failure of
the negotiations, Abdel Meguid said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sparked Arab and Palestinian
anger by laying down a series of "red lines" which he said he would
not cross in negotiating the status of East Jerusalem, the return
of Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, borders and the Jordan
Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based pan-Arab forum spoke highly of the Palestinians'
position in the negotiations and their insistence on the commitment
to implementing the relevant international resolutions, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid also urged the U.S. to continue its efforts to make
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations succeed.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day Camp David summit between Arafat and Barak, which was
aimed at resolving the 52-year conflict, ended Tuesday without
agreement, largely as a result of differences over the status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat demands full sovereignty over East Jerusalem, which was
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War. The Palestinians want
this part of the city as the capital of their future independent
state. But Israel insists Jerusalem, holy to Muslims, Jews and
Christians, is its "eternal and indivisible capital," a claim not
internationally recognized.

<HEADLINE> JMC Condemns Massive Cease-fire Violations in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Military Commission (JMC)
for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) strongly condemned
the massive cease-fire violations in the war-torn country on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 8th JMC plenary session in Lusaka, JMC Chairman
Timothy Kazembe said the violations is a regrettable development
because it undermines the peace process and may disrupt the
implementation of the disengagement plan in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of its 7th plenary session held here last month,
Kazembe said, the JMC has been concentrated on developing and
completing sub-plans for the disengagement and extensive
consultations have been carried out with fruitful results.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to inform you that all the necessary information
has been obtained and the JMC will in the next two days complete
the sub-plans and be ready to submit the final text to the
Political Committee for adoption to allow implementation," he told
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the JMC has worked out elaborate
procedures geared at further streamlining the internal
administration of the JMC.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the JMC has reviewed the Administration, Logistic
and Financial Guidelines and also prepared a draft code of conduct
for its members, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the JMC has not been able to carry out the
necessary investigation of cease-fire violations as it continues
to face financial and logistical problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same meeting, Zambian Minister for Presidential
Affairs Eric Silwamba appealed to countries which have not honored
their pledges to expeditiously do so.
</P>
<P>
It is a pity that the JMC have not completed the deployment of
representatives of all the parties to the regional Joint Military
Commissions due to logistical reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is to this end, I hope, that this session will address and
resolve this issue in order to ensure effective monitoring of all
the cease-fire violations," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said further efforts will be made to solicit for additional
material and financial resources towards the smooth operations of
the JMC.
</P>
<P>
The JMC, which consists of representatives of all belligerents
involved in the DRC conflict, is an organization set up to monitor
the implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement signed in
July and August last year.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Launch 2020 Vision Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will soon launch a 2020
vision program under the Ministry of Health to boost the number of
eye cataract operations.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of this vision program is to try and increase the rate
of operation in terms of the number of patients that can be
operated on each year," said Zambia Flying Doctor Service
executive director Davison Kwendakwema on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia, with a population of 10 million, has 100,000
blind and about 60,000 infected with eye cataract.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the number of operations in the
country did not meet the number of people infected with the
disease, hence the need to introduce the 2020 vision program.
</P>
<P>
The program will be launched soon because the World Health
Organization has recently launched a similar program in South
Africa, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Faces Great Challenge of Protecting Children in Armed Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- To protect children in
armed conflict "is one of the most disturbing human security
issues facing the international community," and "it is also a
great challenge to the United Nations," a U.N. leader said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise
Frechette opened an open Security Council debate on children and
armed conflict, which has involved 300,000 child soldiers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to reflect on the progress we have made and to
examine how best to move forward with the protection of children
in war-torn nations," she said.
</P>
<P>
The progress included the U.N. deployment of child protection
advisors in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Another example is that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on
the Rights of the Child, which focuses on the Involvement of
Children in Armed Conflict, has finally been adopted and is now
open for signature and ratification by Member States.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these positive developments, the task ahead is still
enormous," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Children in many corners of the world -- in Sierra Leone, in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Angola, in Sri Lanka, or in
East Timor, to name but a few -- continue to be killed, maimed,
sexually abused, recruited into armed forces and deprived of life-
saving humanitarian assistance," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The abuse of children in armed conflict -- as everywhere --
is unacceptable," she said. "We can and we must do much more to
make our world safer for all of them."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council began an open debate on a report by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on children and armed conflict,
which was presented in accordance with a Security Council
resolution adopted almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"This resolution has strengthened the advocacy work of the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and
Armed Conflict, and of UNICEF (the U.N. Children's Fund)," she
said. "It has also enhanced the U.N.'s ability to implement
programs on the ground in affected countries."
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan said, "In the internecine conflicts of
recent years, children have increasingly been victimized as both
the targets and the perpetrators of violence."
</P>
<P>
Almost one half of the world's 21 million refugees are
children, while it is estimated that another 13 million children
have been displaced within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
Each year, between 8,000 and 10,000 children are the victims
of landmines. The World Education Forum held in April 2000
recognized that the number and extent of conflicts in the last
decade have constituted major obstacles to the goal of providing
education for all by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF data indicate that during the decade between 1986 and
1996, armed conflicts killed 2 million children, injured 6 million,
traumatized more than 10 million and left more than 1 million
orphaned.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Global Market Must Be Embedded in Broadly Shared Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday stressed that the global market must be embedded
in broadly shared values and practices that reflect global social
needs, and that all the world's people share the benefits of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Opening the high-level meeting of the Global Compact, which
brought together leaders from global business, the international
labor movement and civil society, Annan said, "Eighteen months
ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos, I warned international
business leaders that globalization might be far more fragile than
they realized. Since then, events in Seattle and elsewhere have
reinforced my warnings."
</P>
<P>
 "But it would be tragic if local or national communities
react to the challenges and shortcomings of globalization by
repeating the mistakes of history, and turning it on themselves,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he proposed the Global Compact in Davos in 1999 as
one step to deal with globalization's challenges.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the compact was based on nine key principles drawn
from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International
Labor Organization's fundamental principles on rights at work, and
the Rio principles in the environment and development.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the corporate leaders signaled that they were
ready to embrace the compact, and translate its principles into
corporate practice, demonstrate their leadership and exercise
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed the hope that the meeting would send
out a clarion call for others to join and to gain a critical mass
among leading companies and in their supply chains, so that the
compact can truly be called globally.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that priorities and mechanisms for translating
good intentions into actions that make a real difference to people
's lives can be decided at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Global Compact is a U.N.-sponsored platform for
encouraging and promoting good corporate practices and learning
experiences in the areas of human rights, labor and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
It is an entry point for the business community to work in
partnership with U.N. organizations in support of the principles
and broader goals of the United Nations, and provides a basis for
structured dialogue between the U.N., business, labor and civil
society on improving corporate practices in the social arena.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Attends Mourning Ceremony for Victims of Concorde Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,July 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
his wife Bernadette Chirac attended Wednesday afternoon a
religious mourning ceremony for the 113 dead in Tuesday's crash of
the Air France Concorde in the presence of some family members of
the victims.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held in a hall in the town of Gonesse, Val d'
Oise north of Paris, where the crash took place.
</P>
<P>
Most of the family members came from Germany and some of them
came from southern France, where they were spending their summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
So far 55 bodies of the 113 victims have been brought to a
medical-legal institute of Paris where they are being examined for
identification, while the rest of the bodies are still on the site
of the crash because they are difficult to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six of the victims of the catastrophe were German
tourists going to Ecuador via New York.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet meeting chaired by Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin Wednesday morning, the French government expressed
its "collective mourning" for the victims.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Asks Supreme Court to Send Antitrust Case to Appeals Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. Wednesday filed
a Supreme Court appeal asking the justices to send the antitrust
case to a federal appeals court and to reject a government request
that the high court hear the case.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft believes that the Supreme Court would benefit from
allowing the normal appellate process to move head with an initial
review of this case by the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District
of Columbia," the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In its 30-page appeal, the software giant urged the justices to
avoid "the onerous task of sifting through a large and complex
record and forgoing the many benefits of intermediate appellate
review."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the number and nature of the errors below militate
strongly in favor of review by the court of appeals," the appeal
said.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft contends U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
wrongly concluded that it engaged in illegally anti-competitive
conduct.
</P>
<P>
Jackson in late June granted a government request that
Microsoft's appeal against his findings be sent directly to the
Supreme Court, bypassing the appellate body.
</P>
<P>
The judge in April upheld government charges that Microsoft had
abused the monopoly it enjoys in the operating systems market
thanks to Windows to harm competitors.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, he ordered that the company be split into two
separate entities, one to develop personal computer operating
systems and the other to specialize in software applications.
</P>
<P>
He also imposed tough restrictions on some of Microsoft's
business practices that would remain in effect until the breakup
is complete. But Jackson later suspended the implementation of
both the breakup plan and sanctions on the company's conduct,
pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
Under an expediting agreement between the Justice Department
and Microsoft, the government will formally respond to Microsoft's
appeal by August 14.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court is not expected to say whether it will grant
direct review or send the case to the appeals court until sometime
in September at the earliest.

<HEADLINE> WHO Criticizes Wealthy Countries for Not Responding to Emergency Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Five out of 21 appeals to
international donors to support life-saving programs for peoples
hit by war, population displacement and natural disaster have
produced a resounding zero response so far this year, according to
a review by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
A further four appeals have achieved less than 10 percent of
the money needed to restore any semblance of basic health care,
WHO said in the review released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit are Burundi, the Republic of Congo, Uganda, Sudan
and the Indonesian islands of Maluku where, despite enormous
health needs due to continued conflict or its aftermath, donors
have so far offered no cash for WHO's emergency health program.
</P>
<P>
Overall, WHO has received less than 18 million U.S. dollars of
the 68 million dollars it has asked for through the U.N.
consolidated appeal process.
</P>
<P>
And WHO is not the only agency to suffer. In the recent Appeal
for the Drought in the Horn of Africa, the dearth of funding for
non-food items was a disturbing pattern across the board,
according to Dr Xavier Leus, director of WHO's Department of
Emergency and Humanitarian Action.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to understand why the response is so poor. We are
seeing people, especially women and children, who have shown great
courage, surviving war, escape, drought, and extreme food shortage,
now finding their lives threatened by illness and diseases that
could be prevented by the most basic health interventions. Yet
despite the U.N. system adopting the favored approach of single
consolidated appeals, funders appear not to be able to respond,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
WHO has been using its "regular" budget, funds which come from
the pool of membership fees countries pay to maintain WHO offices
globally, to bridge the chasm and implement urgent emergency
programs, such as epidemic early warning and control systems,
essential drug supply, training in safe motherhood and the
management of common childhood illnesses. Maternal mortality and
childhood illnesses are both major killers in unstable situations.
</P>
<P>
But a crisis can swallow this allocation, designed to last two
years, in just one month, leaving health services critically under-
resourced when people are at their most vulnerable unless extra
money can be found immediately, said Dr Leus.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the politics of emergencies discourages wealthy
countries from responding or perhaps they sense that little can be
done even if funds are provided," he said. "But evidence suggests
otherwise."
</P>
<P>
He took the case in the Democratic Republic of Congo as an
example. A recent study by the International Rescue Committee in
the Democratic Republic of Congo showed only 13 percent of the
over 1 million deaths in this war-torn country were caused by "a
man with a weapon." The rest were caused by lack of services,
extreme vulnerability and common diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience in these countries of conflict is that well
designed health programs have a significant impact on people's
lives and well-being even if the situation remains unstable. We
urge donors to back us in doing this," he added.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Demands Specific Words from U.N. on War-Affected Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy, executive
director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Wednesday
asked the U.N. Security Council to use its influence to translate
words into deeds in a bid to promote the protection of children in
armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy told an open Security Council debate, "The corridors
of the United Nations are littered with unfulfilled promises --
promises that were made in good faith to ease suffering and end
exploitation -- and to protect children from the loss of the
childhood, from rape and mutilation and recruitment as child
soldiers."
</P>
<P>
"What UNICEF asks today -- on behalf of the war-affected
children -- is that Council members do everything in their power
to ensure that the words of the Secretary-General's Report, and
the words of the Council Resolutions, become deeds -- and that
these deeds make a difference to the lives of children," she said.
</P>
<P>
"All those who violate children's rights or collude in such
violation -- whether governments or rebel groups, manufacturers of,
or dealers in, weapons of war, unscrupulous businessmen -- must be
made to feel the power of your words," she told the 15-nation
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"They must be shamed, disgraced and held accountable for their
actions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she voiced her hope to see any future relevant
Security Council resolution to underline the need for education
programs in war-torn areas and the need to receive the required
funds.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, hospitals, schools and other sites where children
are most likely to be found must be protected from attacks and
violence as set out in international humanitarian law," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge Council Members to use their influence to ensure that
we receive the funding required -- and that it is sustained and
consistent, so that we can plan not just for the short term, but
to ensure that children are supported in their long-term needs for
rehabilitation, reintegration and return to childhood and
normality," she added.

<HEADLINE> French Justice Minister Promises Rapid Investigation into Concorde Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Justice Elisabeth
Guigou said Wednesday that the judicial authorities will work with
"rigor and speed" in investigating the cause of the crash of the
Air France Concorde aircraft Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutor of Pontoise, a city northwest of Paris,
has launched a judicial inquiry for "involuntary homicides and
involuntary injuries" in the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Three French judges have been designated by the prosecutor to
be in charge of the case.
</P>
<P>
Guigou said that although she hopes the investigation will come
to an end quickly, the technical difficulties could make it "too
long."
</P>
<P>
"We are collectively determined that it would go as quickly as
possible with the guarantee for a very great rigor," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to primary results of investigation, the crash of the
Concorde could be caused by the failure of one of the engines.
</P>
<P>
The engine was repaired soon before the plane took off, but
caught fire less than one minute after it was started, according
to French officials.

<HEADLINE> Commission Warns of Danger of Eating Great Lakes Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A scientific board of Canada and
the United States is warning of danger of eating fish in North
America's Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
In its 10th biennial report on the state of the lakes made
known here Wednesday, the International Joint Commission said
eating contaminated Great Lakes fish before and during pregnancy
is associated with low birth weight and loss of intelligence in
infants.
</P>
<P>
"Great Lakes fish contain many neurotoxins," warned the joint
commission of the two neighboring countries. "These substances
accumulate in the fetus during pregnancy and to infants during
breast-feeding."
</P>
<P>
Provincial and state governments around the Great Lakes of
Canada and the United States have long issued fish consumption
advisories, but this is the first time an established scientific
group has stated categorically that chemical contaminants are in
the food chain in the lakes.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have already isolated chemical residue from the
tissues of Great Lakes fish and birds, of which carp caught in
Saginaw Bay have about 65 times the toxins of a hot dog, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
The commission also pointed out limitations on the 22-year
effort to clean up the world's largest fresh-water lake system.
</P>
<P>
Only 0.2 percent of the estimated 34.2 million cubic meters of
contaminated sediment in Canada is being cleaned up, while on the
side of the United States, the work covers less than 2.4 percent
of 59.3 million cubic meters, the report disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The commission is calling on provincial and state governments
to issue strong advisories against eating the contaminated fish.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes was reported to have a fishing industry worth 4
billion U.S. dollars in revenue each year, with nearly 40 million
people living in the basin that feeds into the lakes.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Conflict Prevention as Fundamental Way to Protect War-Affected Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China said here Wednesday
that a fundamental approach to protect children in armed conflict
is to effectively prevent, check and eliminate armed conflict and
the U.N. Security Council should concentrate its efforts on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
Security Council debate on children and armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
"A fundamental approach to protect children in conflict is to
effectively prevent, check and eliminate armed conflict," Shen
said. "The Security Council, which has the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security, should
make more efforts to concentrate its energy on this aspect."
</P>
<P>
"Only when conflicts are resolved at an early date and crisis
are addressed promptly, can the issue of the protection of
children be truly settled," he said. "This is the contribution
that the Security Council should make towards the resolution of
the issue of children and armed conflict."
</P>
<P>
"The protection of children in armed conflict calls for the
joint efforts by the international community, and the collective
efforts by various U.N. agencies in particular," he said. "In this
regard, we have some good experience, but there is still room for
further improvement."
</P>
<P>
"Protecting children in armed conflict demands a good
international environment, especially a good legal framework," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation welcomes the adoption of the Optional
Protocol to the Conventions of the Rights the of Child by the
General Assembly in May, and regards such an adoption as "an
important step forward by the international community in recent
years to promote the protection of children," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are actively considering signing the Optional Protocol,"
he said. "And we hope that the minimum age to join the armed
forces can be observed as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The Optional Protocol strengthens the convention in a number
of significant ways, including the setting of the minimum age for
compulsory recruitment or direct participation in hostilities at
18, and calling on States or parties to raise the age for
voluntary recruitment and to provide special protection and
safeguards for those under 18.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao, Lukashenko Discuss Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MINSK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao and
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko held talks here
Wednesday to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of
mutual concern, and reached agreement on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko told Hu that Belarus sees it as one of its foreign
policy's priorities to further develop friendly and cooperative
relations with China. The Belarusian government and people will
make all their efforts to enhance the Belarusian-Chinese
friendship and expand cooperation between the two countries in all
fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Belarusian leader noted that Belarus and China have been
always supporting each other and cooperating in the international
arena, and share identical views on upholding strategic stability
and safety in the world.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that Belarus continues adherence to the one-
China policy and never establish official ties with Taiwan in any
forms.
</P>
<P>
Hu, in his turn, said that since the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and Belarus in 1992, the two
countries have always trusted and supported each other because of
the following main reasons:
</P>
<P>
-- the two sides obey the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence and other international norms;
</P>
<P>
-- the two sides make efforts to establish sincerely friendly
and cooperative ties in many fields;
</P>
<P>
-- the two sides share common or similar positions and
interests over many international problems and practise effective
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president reiterated that China supports
Belarus in its efforts to vindicate the state sovereignty and
national dignity.
</P>
<P>
China also respects the policy and the road of development
pursued by Belarus, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that China is ready, together with Belarus, to
expand and deepen the bilateral friendly and mutually beneficial
cooperation and to push the Sino-Belarusian ties to a new high.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, the two leaders attended a signing ceremony,
at which the two sides signed an economic cooperation accord and
an education cooperation document.
</P>
<P>
Hu arrived here Tuesday night for a three-day official visit.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Cheney, a Risk-Free Choice for Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- After a three-month search, U.S.
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has finally
selected former Defense Secretary Richard Bruce Cheney as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's three electoral
votes," said Bush Tuesday as he introduced Cheney. "I picked him
because he is, without a doubt, fully capable of being the
president of the United States. And I picked him because he will
be a valuable partner in a Bush administration."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that by picking Cheney, a rock-solid
conservative who poses little or no political risk to him, Texas
Governor Bush takes the least adventurous and least sensational
course possible in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
"This would go down in my book as arguably the safest vice-
presidential choice of the last 50 years. I can't think of any one
that is solid, this noncontroversial," said Paul Light, a
political analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, 59, served as defense secretary under Bush's father,
former President George Bush. He masterminded the famous Operation
Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
During his two decades of public service, Cheney also served as
President Ford's chief of staff, six terms in Congress from
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's vast experience in Congress, in the White House and in
national security issues will help counter critiques from the
Democrats that Bush is not ready for the White House.
</P>
<P>
Leaders in both parties feel the choice of Cheney will
underscore Bush's strong support from the base of his own party.
On the other hand, most agree that it is not the sort of
aggressive selection that would demand a defensive response from
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Bush's Democratic rival for presidency Al Gore and his campaign
felt relieved at Bush's choice of Cheney which might give Gore a
freer hand in picking his running mate.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very traditional Republican pick and kind of
reinforces a view of George W. Bush as a very traditional kind of
Republican," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
Those close to the Gore campaign are of the opinion that the
choice of an older white man, who brings little charisma to the
ticket and whose home state of Wyoming was already in the
Republican column, means that Gore does not have to match a
particular quality or region or find a political superstar.
</P>
<P>
While the Republicans applauded Bush's choice and hailed Cheney
's rich experience, critics claim that Bush's choice of Cheney, an
old friend of Bush's family, underscores his inexperience and
reliance on his father for counsel and support.
</P>
<P>
"Bush has to be careful about going back to the past. He doesn'
t want to remind people that his father's administration couldn't
win re-election," a political scientist said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Introduces Cheney as Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush formally introduced former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney as his running mate at a press conference at
Texas University in Austin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I picked him because he is fully capable of being president of
the United States and I picked him because he will be a valuable
partner," Texas Governor Bush said.
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed by his thoughtfulness and the way he
approached his mission and, gradually, I realized the person who
was best qualified to be my vice president was working by my side,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheney headed a three-month search for a running mate for Bush,
but he himself finally emerged as the top candidate for the slot.
</P>
<P>
Bush announced Cheney as his running mate one week before the
Republican national convention in Philadelphia. Republican
delegates will formally nominate the Bush-Cheney ticket at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
"I enthusiastically accept the challenge for this reason: I
believe you have the vision and the courage to be a great
president," Cheney said of Bush at the press conference. Cheney's
wife, Lynne, and Bush's wife, Laura, also appeared at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Cheney suffered three heart attacks by age 48, and has
undergone coronary bypass surgery. But a doctor commissioned by
the Bush campaign issued a statement saying his health "should not
interfere with a strenuous political campaign."
</P>
<P>
Bush called Cheney from the governor's mansion in Austin at 6:
22 a.m. to offer Cheney the job, and Cheney accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
Last week Cheney switched his voter registration from Texas to
Wyoming as the U.S. Constitution stipulates that presidential and
vice presidential candidates cannot come from the same state.
</P>
<P>
Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore has not made his
decision yet for the running mate, he is considering a number of
candidates, including former Senator George Mitchell of Maine,
Florida Senator Bob Graham and Massachusetts Senator John Kerry.

JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak

<HEADLINE> DPRK Leader Kim Jong Il to Visit Russia: Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The top leader of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Kim Jong Il, will visit Russia
and the date and form of his visit are being determined through
diplomatic channels, the Kremlin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his first trip to Pyongyang last week, Russian President
Vladimir Putin officially invited Kim Jong Il to visit Russia. The
DPRK leader accepted the invitation, the Russian president's press
service told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian Foreign Ministry cannot confirm to the
press that Kim Jong Il intends to visit Russia in September as it
was reported by media.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also disclosed that Putin
had invited Kim Jong Il during his stay in Pyongyang to visit
Russia and this invitation had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
However, "Moscow and Pyongyang have not made a decision over
the date for this visit yet," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the New York Times, the invitation to visit Russia
in September was made to Kim by Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of
the Russian Far East region of Primorye, who accompanied Putin
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Kim will arrive in Russia by train and make his
first stop in the Far East city of Vladivostok to take part in the
55th anniversary of the end of World War II. After the stay in the
Far East, Kim will travel to Moscow for meetings with Russian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Interfax cited the press service of the Primorye administration
as saying that Nazdratenko invited Kim Jong Il to visit
Vladivostok on September 1-4 when the city will celebrate the "
Days of Peace in the Pacific Ocean."
</P>
<P>
The invitation was made in Pyongyang on the evening of July 20
at a banquet in honor of the Russian delegation headed by Putin.
Kim accepted the invitation, said the press service.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president's press service said that the official
invitation to visit Russia was made to Kim Jong Il by Putin and
the date and form of the visit are now being discussed through
diplomatic channels.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Begins Debate on Children and Armed Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday began an open debate on how to protect children in armed
conflict, which has involved 300,000 child soldiers across the
world.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette, Olara Otunnu,
the U.N. special representative on children and armed conflict,
Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund (
UNICEF), and Sylvie Junod, head of the delegation of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, are expected to speak at
the debate.
</P>
<P>
Also taking the floor will be representatives of 32 countries,
including China, Russia, Bangladesh, Iraq, Ukraine, South Africa
and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation council began a debate on a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said, "The number of children
under the age of 18 who have been coerced or induced to take up
arms as child soldiers is generally thought to be in the range of
300,000." The report was presented in accordance with a Security
Council resolution adopted last year.
</P>
<P>
"In the internecine conflicts of recent years, children have
increasingly been victimized as both the targets and the
perpetrators of violence," the report said. "Almost one half of
the world's 21 million refugees are children, while it is
estimated that another 13 million children have been displaced
within the borders of their own countries."
</P>
<P>
Most modern conflicts are taking place within countries, and
most of the victims are innocent civilians. Over the past decade,
some 5 million civilians were killed in the intrastate armed
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Each year, between 8,000 and 10,000 children are the victims
of landmines," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on Member States to hammer out specific measures
to protect children in armed conflicts, including setting the
minimum age for compulsory recruitment or direct participation in
hostilities at 18.
</P>
<P>
"From its earliest days, the United Nations has sought more
effective means of influencing the policies and behavior of
parties to conflict," Annan said in the report. "Far too often,
children have been the innocent victims of persistent gap between
law and practice, and between commitments and performance."
</P>
<P>
"In the end, the perpetrators of these affronts to
international human rights and humanitarian standards need to be
convinced that the costs of their behavior outweigh any perceived
benefits," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations will continue to seek closer cooperation
and more regular consultations with regional and subregional
organizations and arrangements concerning the protection of
children affected by armed conflict," the report said. "Their
potential role in developing policies, mechanisms and peer
pressure for the protection of children is very significant and
should be fully encouraged."

<HEADLINE> English FA Draw up Strict Measures to Protect Referees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Stringent new punishment guidelines
drawn up by the English Football Association Wednesday could see
players who jostle or hold referees this season hit with a 12-
match suspension -- and a year-long ban if they ever repeat the
offence.
</P>
<P>
And those who actually push referees will be dealt with even
more severely.
</P>
<P>
The detailed measures, of which increased protection for
referees are just one part, are designed to clamp down upon
offenders and to ensure openness and consistency in punishments
being meted out to players, clubs and officials.
</P>
<P>
Offences missed by officials during a game, such as elbowing an
opponent, will now be reviewed by a new advisory panel of former
professionals, referees and managers who will consider video
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The revamped disciplinary system, which will heavily punish any
form of discrimination such as racial abuse, will be speeded up
when it comes into force at the start of the coming season with
the aim for the whole game to unite to improve standards on and
off the pitch.
</P>
<P>
FA chief executive Adam Crozier explained: "The new
disciplinary system provides the clarity, consistency and
transparency that everyone in the game demands.
</P>
<P>
"It is designed to be hard but fair in the way that it treats
every player, club and manager in the same way."

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smuggling Operations Help Raise Customs Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior official said here
today that China's effective anti-smuggling operations have led to
a great increase in customs revenue.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months this year, the total customs revenue
reached a record high of 101 billion yuan (12 billion U.S. dollars)
, according to Ge Liancheng, deputy head of the state anti-
smuggling and comprehensive management office.
</P>
<P>
He said only in the January-June period, customs and public
security departments ferreted out more than 10,000 smuggling cases
with goods valued at 2.89 billion yuan. More than 2,000 people
were arrested for involvement in smuggling.
</P>
<P>
He said the seized goods included motor vehicles, steel
products, refined oil products, cigarettes, edible oil, cultural
relics and drugs.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved great success in cracking down on smuggling
since 1998. A number of corrupt customs officers involved in major
smuggling cases have been dealt with according to law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Bingquan, vice-governor of Guangdong Province where
smuggling once went rampant, said at today's meeting that his
province will make further efforts to fight against smuggling,
especially that from the sea and that of illegal assembled motor
vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Says Views Come Close Between Palestinians, Israelis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
on Wednesday in Alexandria that the views came close between the
Palestinians and Israelis at the Camp David summit, although the
two sides were unable to reach a peace agreement on issues
including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew into the Egyptian Mediterranean port city earlier in
the day from the summit in the United States. He received a hero's
welcome by thousands of cheering people who waved to him as he was
driven to Ras el-Teen presidential palace at seafront.
</P>
<P>
During an hour-long meeting, he briefed Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on details of the Camp David summit and discussed with him
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks in the coming period.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Arafat said he held
difficult negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
issues like the status of Jerusalem and the right to return of the
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two sides did not reach any agreement on the thorniest
issues, which also included the borders of a future Palestinian
state and the fate of Jewish settlements, but their stances have
come close, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will continue talks
at least before the September 13 deadline when the interim period
enshrined in the 1993 Oslo accords expires.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Barak may return to the U.S. to hold another
summit next month.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have planned to seek a final peace
deal by September 13 for settlement of their 52-year conflict. The
Palestinians have vowed to declare an independent state that day,
with or without the projected deal.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen days of tough and intensive negotiations came to a close
on Tuesday after Arafat and Barak failed to compromise over the
control of Jerusalem while they have agreed on most of the other
issues.

<HEADLINE> Manila Transport Strike Enters Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The paralyzing strike of the
employees of the Light Rail Transport (LRT) system in Manila
entered its second day on Wednesday with no immediate solution in
sight.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the on-going strike has affected the mobility
of the commuting public, especially workers and students, as well
as the company's 1,200 rank and file employees whose source of
livelihood for their families is dependent on LRT operations.
</P>
<P>
To ease the passenger load of jeepneys and taxis along the
route, some 160 alternate vehicles were utilized, said the
Presidential Task Force on Transport Strikes and Mass Actions (
TRASMA) in a report.
</P>
<P>
The TRASMA said that strikers continue to occupy the elevated
railway stations on Wednesday, adding that their actual number
could not be determined as most of them are inside the coaches and
thus could not be seen from the ground level.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma assumed
Wednesday jurisdiction over the labor dispute at the LRT,
directing all striking employees of the firm to return to work
immediately upon receipt of his order.
</P>
<P>
The LRT union cited deadlock in collective bargaining
negotiation as the cause of its strike which began on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Thirteen People Arrested for Involving in Bomb Threat to Bangladeshi PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KOTALIPARA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi police so far has
arrested thirteen people who are suspected of being involved in
bomb planting in Kotalipara apparently to kill Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, a high official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen in Kotalipara of Gopalgonj district, 230
kilometers southwest of Dhaka, District Deputy Commissioner Egbal
Mahmood said that among the arrested persons, some are members of
a local Islamic organization -- the Harkatul Jehad ( the Movement
for Holy War), who have taken military training in Afghanistan and
have links with some international terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
A powerful bomb was foiled on July 21, which was planted in the
ground only 50 yards from the rostrum from where Sheikh Hasina was
due to address a public rally on July 22 during her two-day visit
to her home town Kotalipara.
</P>
<P>
Another powerful bomb was found near Kotalipara helipad on July
23, which was also for the killing of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A team of army experts Wednesday successfully retrieved the
second bomb which is also going to be examined by experts in an
army cantonment.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami League has blamed the Jamaat-e-Islami and it's
student wing the Islami Chattra Shibir (the Islami Student Front)
for the bomb planting. The ruling party as well as different pro-
government organizations have demanded for banning of the politics
of Jamaat-Shibir.
</P>
<P>
However, the Gopalgonj district police head Mohammed
Jusmudding told newsmen Wednesday in Kotalipara that the police so
far has not found any evidence to prove that the local Harkatul
Jehad has any link with Jamaat.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Meets EU Great Lakes Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Wednesday met European Union envoy for the Great Lakes region Aldo
Ajello to discuss ways of pushing the peace process in the war
ravaged Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy told reporters after the meeting that he sought
from Mugabe an update on the crisis in the DRC and what could be
done to hasten the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue is an essential component in bringing about peace
among the rival groups in the DRC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the United Nations dragging its feet in deploying a
5,500-strong peacekeeping force in the DRC, Ajello said it is
important for the U.N. to be sure that the warring parties in the
DRC want peace first before deploying the troops.
</P>
<P>
Early this year the U.N. Security Council approved the
deployment of 5,500 soldiers and observers to enforce Lusaka peace
accord signed last July.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. faced a barrage of criticism for this proposal as
many felt the force is too small for a country as vast as the DRC,
Africa's third largest nation.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, 11,000 troops have been deployed in Sierra Leone,
a country one-thirtieth of the size of the DRC and 42,000 in tiny
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The DRC conflict began in August 1998 when DRC President
Laurent Kabila's government came under attack from rebels
supported by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to fight alongside
Kabila's government force.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Promises to Make Clear Causes of Concorde Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
on Wednesday that all things necessary will be done to make clear
the circumstances about the crash of the Air France Concorde
supersonic aircraft on Tuesday, which killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
"All things necessary are to be done so that the circumstances
of the accident would be known," said Chirac during an emergency
cabinet meeting with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and his
ministers, according to presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who first
did not exclude the hypothesis of a terrorist attack, said on
Wednesday that it is up to the investigators to do their job.
</P>
<P>
"When you present a hypothesis, you should have at least the
small argument to support. There isn't. So I think we should keep
calm for the time being and let the investigation commission to do
its job," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the 100 passengers on board the Concorde were German
nationals going to Ecuador via New York.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Francois Brousse, a spokesman of
Air France at the Roissy airport, as saying that a technical team
made an intervention on one of the motors of the Concorde just
before it took off, resulting in the delay of a dozen minutes of
its departure.
</P>
<P>
But he said that it is not known yet whether the intervention
had something to do with the crash.
</P>
<P>
"Our rules of security are that if the team has the least doubt
they call in the team of intervention," he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Funds for Danube Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Wednesday said that it had approved special funds to cover the
cost of clearing the Danube within the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, where navigation are blocked by debris of NATO bombed
bridges.
</P>
<P>
The commission decided to implement an European Council's
decision made on July 17 to contribute up to 85 percent of the
cost of the Danube clearance project, or around 22 million euro (
20 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to clear the three bridges bombed and
damaged by last year's NATO air strikes. The debris of the bridges,
located in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, have been blocking
navigation along the river.
</P>
<P>
"The debris of these bridges, together with unexploded ordnance
(missiles) are blocking navigation, causing severe economic
disruption to riparian states," said a written statement issued
after Wednesday's commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
The clearance project for the Danube, first proposed by the
Danube Commission at the end of January this year, involves the
removal of the debris and the unexploded ordnance so as to open a
navigable river channel and the restoration of the riverbed and
banks.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission proposed on May 24 this year a European
Union contribution toward the clearance project. The European
Council confirmed on the proposal on July 17.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to clear the Danube as soon as possible," said the
commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, of which
some member states took part in the 78-day air campaign along with
the United States against the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The clearance work is estimated to take several months and is
expected to start this winter while the target date to render the
Danube navigable is set for the spring of 2001. The restoration of
the riverbed and banks will start next summer.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Crash Could Be Caused by Failure of Engine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elisabeth Senot, premier assistant prosecutor of the Tribunal
of Investigation of Pontoise, a city near the airport, said that
the dialogue between the crew and the control tower talked about a
fire on one of the engines when the plane was gaining speed on the
track.
</P>
<P>
"The control tower gave the authorization of taking off at time
zero. 56 seconds later, the control tower noticed there was fire
in the back part of the plane. The commander of the crew answered:
failure of engine number two," said the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
But at that time it was impossible to stop the plane and the
crew planned to land the plane at the nearby military airport of
Bourget, but it crashed during the maneuver, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Air France said Wednesday that the engine number two
of the crashed Concorde underwent a reparation before taking off.
</P>
<P>
The reparation delayed the taking off of the plane for a dozen
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Air France said that after the plane returned from New York JFK
airport on July 24, the reverse of its number two engine could no
longer work and the lacking piece on the engine was replaced just
before the plane took off on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The reverse of the engine is used as a brake for both landing
the plane and stopping a take-off of the plane if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Niujie: A Well-Preserved Muslim Habitat in Downtown Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese ethnologist today hailed
the Beijing municipal government for its protection of Niujie, a
Muslim habitat in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Jin Chunzi, deputy secretary-general of the China Urban
Anthropology Association (CUAA), issued the praise in an interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the preservation of the Muslim culture in the
area to China's favorable policies for its ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 17 ethnic groups, Niujie has a population of
more than 54,000, of which some 13,000 are ethnic minority people.
And among Niujie's ethnic minorities, some 94 percent belong to
the ethnic Hui group.
</P>
<P>
Out of respect for the Hui customs, the Beijing Municipal
government has issued a notice explicitly prohibiting the trade of
certain foods which violate Muslim tradition.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames Israel for Failure of Camp David Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Wednesday blamed Israel for the failure of the Middle
East peace talks at Camp David under the mediation of U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the talks clearly showed that Israel is not ready
to accept even the minimum demands of the Palestinians, Kharrazi
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister, in a statement, accused Israel of following a
policy of expansionism and adopting delaying tactics in
negotiations in order to extract more concessions from the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He repeated Iran's support for the Palestinians to "liberate"
all occupied lands and establish an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite talks, attended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Clinton, lasted 15 days
and ended Tuesday without any agreement due to sharp differences
over the future status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President
Mohammad Khatami had both slammed the talks, saying they were
doomed to fail because the Palestinian resistance groups are
opposed to any concessions involving the occupied lands and the
status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiators should learn a lesson from the
recent round of talks and revise their attitude and behavior toward
Israel, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He warned Israel not to impose its wishes on the Palestinians
and other Muslims in the region, noting a new atmosphere has been
created in the Middle East since the Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Iran termed the Israeli withdrawal as a big victory of the
Lebanese resistance movement that has long been supported by
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Given the new situation in the Middle East, all Islamic
countries should extend support to the Palestinian people to resist
Israel's bullying and political pressures, Kharrazi said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, ROK Hail Significance of Inter-Korean Summit: ROK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the two
sides of the Korean Peninsula appreciated the smooth progress in
the follow-up measures to implement the South-North Joint
Declaration, according to a press release from the Republic of
Korea (ROK) received here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the first-ever formal meeting of foreign ministers in
over 50 years, Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and his counterpart Lee Joung-
binn from the Republic of Korea (ROK) hailed the significance of
the declaration, which was reached at the Inter-Korea summit in
June, it said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the historic summit between President Kim Dae-
jung of the ROK and Defense Committee Chairman Kim Jong-il of the
DPRK carries a great deal of significance as a milestone in
improving mutual understanding and trust, advancing inter-Korean
relations, and realizing peaceful unification on the Korea
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to cooperate on matters of
external relations and in the international arena so as to enhance
inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers are here to attend the 7th ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF), which is to be held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This will be DPRK's first presence at the forum since it was
accepted only recently.
</P>
<P>
The ARF is a multilateral forum tackling mainly security issues
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Paek is also expected to have bilateral
talks with a number of countries, some of which do not have
diplomatic relations with DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In June, leaders of the two Koreas met in Pyongyang, after
which, South Korea began supporting DPRK's bid for ARF membership.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 million people in
Central and South Asia are currently affected by a severe drought,
said a newsletter of the United Nations Information Center (UNIC)
available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The drought has led to a rapid deterioration of health
conditions, population displacements and loss of livestock and
crops, according to the UNIC newsletter.
</P>
<P>
The drought is particularly acute in Afghanistan, Tajikistan,
Pakistan, Iran and India, the newsletter quoted a statement from
the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) which brings
together the organizations dealing with children, refugees, health,
food security, agriculture and relief coordination.
</P>
<P>
Head of the UN World Food Program (WFP), Catherine Bertini said
that a drought task force has been formed to coordinate relief
efforts in the region and to call on the international community
to respond as rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan is the "worst hit," Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that 8 to 12 million people are affected by the
drought and perhaps a third of those are very severely affected
with almost no food," she said, adding that Tajikistan is
potentially the second hardest hit, with preliminary estimates
showing that wheat production will be 30 percent lower than last
year.
</P>
<P>
"In Pakistan, 2.2 million people and 16 million livestock have
been affected, while in Iran 18 out of the country's 28 provinces
are suffering from the drought," the UNIC newsletter says.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Industrial Output Up 11.4 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's industrial output
grew by 11.4 percent year-on-year in June 2000, lifted by the
strong growth in the electronics cluster and leading to the first
half 2000 growth of 13.4 percent, according to the monthly report
released by Singapore's Economic Development Board Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the three-month moving average basis, last month's
manufacturing figures were an improved 13.4 percent over the same
period last year. However, the growth rates contracted
significantly compared to the robust 20 percent rise in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output of the electronics cluster, which makes
up almost 44 percent of the manufacturing sector, shot up by 30.4
percent year-on-year in June with semiconductor and
telecommunications segments leading the charge on the back of
strong demand for chips and mobile phones as well as inkjet
printers and cartridges from the U.S. and Pacific markets. Overall,
the electronics cluster enjoyed a 22.9 percent cumulative year-on-
year growth in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The output of the chemical cluster declined by 14.1 percent in
June as a steep decline in the pharmaceuticals segment offset a
strong hike in the industrial/speciality chemicals segment. For
the first half of this year, the cumulative output growth in the
chemical cluster was 4.7 percent higher compared to the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceuticals segment was down a steep 31.4 percent in
June this year after May's 113.2 percent jump, eroding the robust
25.4 percent growth in the industrial/speciality chemicals segment.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry remained in the doldrums with a decline
of 12.6 percent in the month, sinking 23.9 percent for the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The output for the engineering cluster was up 7.6 percent in
June with precision engineering and process engineering each
recording a positive double-digit growth while transport
engineering contracted 17.5 percent. The engineering cluster rose
by 8.2 percent year-on-year in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Disappointed with G-8 Stance on Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
expressed disappointment over the refusal of the group of eight
industrialized countries (G-8) to relieve the debt burden of poor
nations, the Nigerian press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister of State Reuben Onyia was quoted as
saying in the capital Abuja Tuesday that Nigeria could not
understand why the G-8 could not have written off even a fraction
of the debts owed by the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC),
while deciding to spend hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars on
other areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister maintained that the much expected democratic
dividend might be a dream if the developed countries continued to
be non-committal to alleviating debt burdens of the poor ones.
</P>
<P>
At the G-8 summit in Okinawa, Japan, last week, Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is also the chairman of the G-77,
an organization mainly composed of developing countries,
vigorously canvassed debt cancellation for developing countries so
they could be unfettered in pursuing economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We had expected something positive from the G-8. The
communique (of the just concluded G-8 summit) fell short of this,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which owes a total external debt of some 30 billion
dollars, is currently Africa' s most indebted country.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players to Cut Pay-Checks by Ten Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The NBA players will have to
give back as much as 10 percent of their total pay beginning with
the 2001--02 season in accordance with the collective bargaining
agreement signed two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached between the league and its players
union, all players' pay will be reduced in the fourth year if
their salaries exceed 55 percent of the league's basketball-
related income. Projections show the players will receive 64
percent of such income during the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
Amounts will be withheld from the players' calculated share
based on each one's salary. Players agreed to the escrow tax to
end the 1998-99 lockout.
</P>
<P>
A dollar-for-dollar backup escrow tax on teams exceeding the
salary cap also will take effect in 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the players will be returning more than 150
million US dollars to the owners in 2001-02. The tax will stay in
effect for the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons under current
basketball-income projections, meaning the players will play close
to a half-billion dollars by the time the six-year agreement
expires.
</P>
<P>
Players received 1.38 billion US dollars in salaries and
benefits for the 1999-2000 season, and the median salary rose 19
percent to 2 million US dollars, a union official said.
</P>
<P>
The median salary has risen 40 percent in the two years since
the lockout, and 76 percent of the players are earning 1 million
US dollars or more a season.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Rights Better Protected in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Local administrations for industry
and commerce throughout China handled more than 139,500 cases
involving fake and shoddy products in the first half of this year,
preventing consumers from losses totaling 534 million yuan (64
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 60 cities above the prefecture level alone, the local
administrations uncovered 12,000-plus cases which involved
production or sales of shoddy goods during the January-June period,
according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (
SAIC).
</P>
<P>
The combined value of goods in these cases stood at 184 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than 90,000 consumer complaints were dealt with in the 60
cities in the six months, and a compensation of 52 million yuan
was given to consumers.
</P>
<P>
According to a SAIC official, consumers complained more about
services than shoddy goods -- usually it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the gripes, 5,400, were related to
inconvenient telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
Of all age groups, women, children and the elderly were most
likely to be the victims of cons, the official pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Forum on Sea Environmental Protection Opens in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- An international forum on maritime
environmental protection and management opened here today,
gathering delegates from 11 countries and a number of
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the 7th Program Steering Committee
of the GEF/UNDP/IMO Regional Program and Bohai Sea Environmental
Protection and Management Forum, an agreement on an experimental
project in Bohai Sea, northern China, was signed.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly sponsored by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), the United Nations Developing Program (UNDP), the
International Maritime Organization and some east Asian countries
which border oceans, including China.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai project involves China's State Oceanic Administration
and the GEF/UNDP/IMO Regional Program. Cities included in the
program will work closely to reduce the waste discharge and
pollution to China's inland Bohai Sea, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Sea has a total area of more than 77,000 square
kilometers, and a coastline of 3,780 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The regional program aims to strengthen the partnership among
east Asian countries to effectively protect and manage their
coastal areas and ocean environment.
</P>
<P>
The first six-year phase of the program was completed last
October with three demonstration sites in China, the Philippines
and the Strait of Malacca. The second phase, from 1999 to 2004,
involves 11 countries and focuses on China's Bohai, the
Philippines' Manila Bay and Gulf of Thailand shared by Thailand,
Malaysia, Viet Nam and Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Eyes Mindanao Conflict Be Resolved by Yearend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Wednesday that the conflict in Mindanao can be resolved
before yearend as the government is pressing forward with its fast-
track, socio-economic development program for the region.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the Presidential Palace,
Estrada made this forecast to the media of the United States where
he is making a 10-day official working visit.
</P>
<P>
The president said his administration is going ahead for the
full development of Mindanao so it can end the "vicious circle" of
hostilities that has for long mired the island in poverty.
</P>
<P>
"These will be over. Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) members
have sent feelers to surrender to the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the major military offensive over in the
South, his government could now proceed with the more urgent task
ahead, which is to attack "the island's chronic poverty and
underdevelopment -- the root cause of the Muslim insurgency."
</P>
<P>
Estrada pointed out that he has ordered the military to respond
to the MILF's violations of its ceasefire pact with the government
"because of my sworn duty to defend and protect the country's
sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
The president said he was amenable to a ceasefire -- on
condition that the MILF members renounce their secession bid, stop
their terrorist or criminal acts, and lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
The MILF's acceptance of these conditions will prevent a repeat
of the previous experience, he said, wherein the government and
the MILF were talking peace even as the latter had committed over
200 ceasefire violations.

<HEADLINE> Australia Confirms Fiji Coup Leader Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Wednesday night confirmed the detention
of Fiji coup leader George Speight by Fijian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Speight was reportedly arrested Wednesday by the south Pacific
nation's military forces along with three others including his
media adviser Jo Nata.
</P>
<P>
Speight was arrested after a shoot-out with security forces as
he travelled to his base at Kalabu school on the outskirts of the
capital Suva, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The others arrested were his legal adviser and a bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
A DFAT spokesman said Speight may have been detained for
breaching the curfew in force on the troubled south Pacific island.
</P>
<P>
"What we have heard from Fiji government officials is that
Speight has been detained; we are not sure whether arrested or
detained," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It may have been related to a breach of the curfew regulations,
attempting to travel through a roadblock to his base outside Suva,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
DFAT was currently seeking more information and was unable to
confirm reports of an exchange of shots, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Australians in Fiji should take extra care,
with DFAT's travel warnings for the islands still in force.
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Phil Goff Wednesday
night welcomed the news of Speight's detention.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Goff welcomed the news of Mr. Speight's arrest on the
grounds that Mr. Speight had led the violent overthrow of a
democratically elected government," a spokesman for Goff told the
Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"As yet, it is premature to form a definite judgment on the
significance of the action (and will be so) until it becomes clear
whether the Fiji military and police are able to restore law and
order and ensure the restoration of democratic government in Fiji,
" the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's new government had initially been due to take office
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the swearing-in was canceled at the last minute after
Speight threatened civil unrest if the new government did not
include more of his supporters.

BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing recently issued
regulations to build facilities in public places for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulation, all public places, dwelling
areas, streets, subway stations and main scenic spots and resorts,
which are to be built, rebuilt or expanded after September 1, must
construct facilities for the disabled, such as slopes instead of
steps for those who in wheelchairs.

As a city with some 460,000 disabled people, or 4.5 percent of
the total population, Beijing built China's first pavement for the
blind in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Regulation also stipulates that any working units or
individuals who bring damage or occupy the facilities illegally
will be fined accordingly.
</P>
<P>
So far, 22 specially-paved avenues for the blind have been
built as well as 20 underpasses and pedestrian bridges for the

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Condemns Taiwan's Separatist Tsai Ying-wen (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua, China's official news
agency, today criticizes Tsai Ying-wen, head of Taiwan's "Mainland
Affairs Council," for her separatist words and activities since
she took office.
</P>
<P>
Publishing a signed article titled "Separatists Will Never
Succeed," Xinhua says Tsai has gradually exposed as a separatist.
</P>
<P>
Being one of the key figures in brewing Lee Teng-hui's "two-
states" advocacy, Tsai had been the brains behind Lee's separatist
words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
After Lee stepped down, Tsai was given the important position
by the new Taiwan leader known as the "most faithful executive of
the Lee Teng-hui line."
</P>
<P>
She has never recognized herself as a Chinese. Calling herself
a key official of Taiwan, she claimed, "I am not Chinese, if one
China means the People's Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
She also said being Chinese is a "a matter of personal choice."
</P>
<P>
"To be or not to be Chinese is not important. What's important
is to have a recognition for the land of Taiwan," said Tsai.
</P>
<P>
Tsai denies the one-China principle, though she, as Taiwan's
leading official in charge of "mainland affairs," must know that
recognizing the one-China principle is the basis for improving
and developing cross-Straits ties.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, Tsai supported "Taiwan independence" by stating, "
Taiwan independence is one of the options of Taiwan people on
cross-Straits relations."
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua article reiterates that "Taiwan independence" is a
major crime in an attempt to split the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Condemns Taiwan's Separatist Tsai Ying-wen (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It makes it clear that to put separatist people like Tsai in
charge of Taiwan's so-called mainland affairs is fruitless and
does nothing to improve or ease cross-Straits tensions.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the Taiwan leader's denial of a consensus reached by
the two sides across the Taiwan Straits on the one-China principle,
Tsai attempted to block exchanges between the people living on the
two banks of the straits, including the exchanges between the
cities of Xiamen on the mainland, and Kaohsiung in Taiwan, Xinhua'
s article said.
</P>
<P>
She has also tried hard to drum up "Taiwan's participation in
the United Nations" by openly advocating "to publicize that Taiwan
is a sovereign and independent state."
</P>
<P>
Tsai repeatedly expressed her hopes that the United States will
interfere in cross-Straits relations. She and Annette Lu have
echoed each other and are both called the "Meimei" (which means
pro-US) in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tsai's words and deeds mirror the true face of the new leader
of Taiwan, the article says, noting their so-called "goodwill" and
"sincerity" are coming apart with their separatist words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
To develop the cross-Straits relations under the one-China
principle has been an urgent demand of the whole Chinese people
including Taiwan compatriots and is an irreversible historical
trend as well, Xinhua says.
</P>
<P>
It warns that the Taiwan Authorities will inevitably fail if
they stubbornly adhere to the separatist stance of "Taiwan
independence" and move against the will of Taiwan compatriots, and
damage the interests of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
All those who have advocate Lee Teng-hui's separatists views
will come to no end, the article concludes.

CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The European Union (EU) has agreed that potatoes
cultivated in 14 more areas of Egypt can be exported to its member
states in the next season, raising to 24 the number of such areas.
</P>
<P>
The decision will increase to about 13,000 hectares the area of
land suitable for cultivation of potatoes that can be exported to
the EU in the new season from 4,455 hectares in the last season.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali received a report
on Tuesday from the EU, saying that the agreement came in light of
the successful eradication of brown rot.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exported 111,000 tons of potatoes to EU countries in the
last season, with Italy, Germany and Britain topping the list of
importers. Its exports to Arab countries stood at 36,000 tons
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Romanian commercial bank, Banca Turco Romana
(BTR), in which Turkish company Bayindir Holding has a majority
stake, will launch its 19th unit in line with its network expansion
plans.
</P>
<P>
BTR said in a statement that the new branch will be based in the
shopping center Prisma, some 20 kilometers northwest of the
Romanian capital of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
It said that it will raise its network to 30 branches by the end
of the year. Earlier this year, a joint bank was launched by BTR in
the former Soviet republic of Moldova.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish State Railways (TCDD) opened a tender
Wednesday for the purchase of 23 locomotives.
</P>
<P>
TCDD officials said the company will receive bids for the tender
until September 12, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The deal is planned to be financed by a foreign loan, which is
expected to total some 60 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
German and French companies are known to be interested in this
tender, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The new locomotives will be used on the lines in a railway
modernization program of the country.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- An economic report expected that Saudi Arabia's oil
revenues this year would exceed the budgeted 46.6 billion dollars
considering the current high oil price.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the Saudi-British Bank, said the current
average price of 25 dollar per barrel is in favor of the kingdom's
budget this year, which was based on the oil price of 19 dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that the total oil revenues this year would
reach 53.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Software Council has worked out a plan to
increase the revenues of Egypt's export of Arabic-enabled software
from 15 million dollars to 50 million dollars in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian software production is highly salable in the Gulf

<HEADLINE> Iran's Khatami to Run for Re-election in 2001 EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
announced here Wednesday that he will seek re-election in the next
presidential race in May, 2001.
</P>
<P>
"I will participate in the elections," Khatami told a gathering
of university chancellors and heads of research centers, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami further said that he would inform the public of his
views and also abide by the people's vote and will.
</P>
<P>
Reform-minded Khatami won a landslide victory in the
presidential election in 1997, defeating his conservative rival,
then Majlis (parliament) speaker Netaq Nuri.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's triumph initiated a reformist campaign in the country,
which has become so strong in recent years that it ended the long-
time conservative dominance of the Majlis in February's
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives have stepped up efforts in recent months to
undermine the reformist movement. Using their control of the
judiciary, they have ordered the closure of some 19 reformist
papers and journals, putting a number of journalists and activists
into prison.
</P>
<P>
They, too, are making preparations for the next year's
presidential election, hoping that someone from their camp can take
over the important post.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati would be the conservative candidate to compete with
Khatami next year.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in 1997, Khatami has been trying to ease the
restrictions on people's life. He encourages political
participation by the people and advocates press freedom.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, Khatami's policy of detente and dialog achieved
success. Many people believe that Khatami still has a high support
rate if he competes in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
But Khatami has yet to find effective solutions to the country's
economic problems, such as high inflation and unemployment. The
conservatives are likely to use his economic shortcomings to gain
votes.

<HEADLINE> Barak Phones Faction Leaders on Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
spoke to the heads of various political parties Wednesday from his
plane en route to Israel from Washington and briefed them on the
just concluded Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders Barak spoke to included Yossi Sarid of Meretz,
Eli Yishai of Shas and Yosef Lapid of Shinui, according to Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Barak is believed to have discussed with the party leaders about
the formation of a new government upon his return from the summit.
</P>
<P>
Yishai said that Barak had asked him to brief Shas mentor Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef on the failure of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Yishai also said that he will meet with Barak on Thursday to
discuss the formation of the new government, but adding that Shas
would not "automatically" return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shas, which has 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament),
left the coalition on the eve of Barak's departure for the summit
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit, attended by Barak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, failed to reach an
agreement on final-status issues after two weeks of intensive
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The key issues discussed at the summit included the fate of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, settlements, borders and water.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the failure of the summit on Tuesday, Clinton said
the two sides had made "significant progress" on all core issues
that had been discussed during the summit.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the summit is liable to result in a "controlled
escalation" of hostilities that could go as far as a "wide
conflict" between Israel and the Palestinians, Chief of General
Staff Lt.-Gen. Shaul Mofaz warned again on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has sent senior officers to the
field in an attempt to prevent an escalation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IDF is doing everything possible to prevent hostilities and
is keeping in touch with Palestinian officers to maintain quietness
and the IDF will do all in its power to protect settlers and
settlements, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh
went on Wednesday to Elon Moreh, northeast of the West Bank city of
Nablus, to discuss security matters with the leaders of Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
Sneh urged the settler leaders to do their utmost to avoid
provocations following the failure of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Manila Continues Negotiations for Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government negotiators
reassured the public Wednesday that they continue to work for the
safe release of three Malaysians and other hostages held by the
Abu Sayyaf in the country's southern province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado made this
assurance after the release of three Malaysian hostages hit
another snag.
</P>
<P>
According to Aventajado, he was told by one of the Abu Sayyaf
leaders, Ghalib Andang, alias Commander Robot, that the group
found the government emissary "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"He woke me up at 6 a.m., basically telling me the emissary
sent by my coordinator in Zamboanga was no longer acceptable to
him. Instead, he said we'll tap the one used for the release of
Wallert. So I am sending this person at the latest tomorrow,"
Aventajado told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
German female hostage Renate Wallert was freed by the Abu
Sayyaf more than a week ago. She is one of the 21 hostages
abducted by the extremist group from Malaysia on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said he would proceed to Zamboanga City on Thursday
to assess Commander Robot's messages through the new emissary,
whom he identified only as "Dragon."
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said he is hopeful that "we'll be able to find a
solution for the release of the three Malaysians" soon.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has released in the last few weeks five
Malaysian hostages. But of the European hostages, only Wallert has
been released.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aventajado said Commander Robot confirmed to him
that a "researcher" of local television network ABS-CBN and his
wife are now in the custody of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The couple were abducted Monday while returning from an
interview with foreign journalists at the Abu Sayyaf's hideout in
Sulu.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, ROK FMs Agree to Further Promote Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the two
sides of the Korean Peninsula held their first formal meeting in
more than 50 years here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After exchanges of greetings, Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said, since the
inter-Korean summit, relations between the two countries have been
clearly improved, and called for efforts to further push forward
the bilateral relations in the spirit of the documents reached at
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Paek continued that the inter-Korean summit is very important
and high officials of the two countries will meet by the end of
this month in Seoul to make further contribution to the peaceful
reunification of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Foreign Minister Lee Joung-binn of the Republic of
Korea, said he is very pleased to have this opportunity to talk
with his DPRK counterpart about issues of the two countries,
saying this kind of meeting is very important.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers are here to attend the 7th ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF), which is to be held tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
This will also be DPRK's first presence at the forum since it
was accepted by it only recently.
</P>
<P>
The ARF is a multilateral forum tackling mainly security issues
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Paek is expected to have bilateral talks
with a number of countries, some of which do not have diplomatic
relations with DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In June, leaders of the two Koreas held a summit in Pyongyang
to promote reconciliation and peace on the peninsula, after which,
South Korea began supporting DPRK's bid for ARF membership.

<HEADLINE> South African Firm Acquires Rights to Mine Tanzanite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local newspapers Wednesday quoted officials from Tanzania's
Energy and Minerals Ministry as saying that the mine has a
conservatively estimated life span of 19 years and is expected to
yield some 22 million carats of Tanzanite from about 800,000 tons
of ore.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary mining operations by the South African firm are
expected to begin in the second half of this year, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanite, a violet-blue variety of the mineral zoisite, was
discovered only in Tanzania in 1967. The country is also endowed
with other types of colorful gems including chrysoprase, ruby,
rhodolite, tourmaline, emerald, amethyst, peridot, and sapphire.
</P>
<P>
Records show gemstone production declined sharply from 106,537
kilograms in 1997 to 48,518 kilograms in 1998 due to reduced
participation of small-scale miners whose mining plots were leased
to large-scale miners.

forest industrial base, modern mining and mineral processing bases,
high-quality animal by-products processing centers, and a
transnational tourism zone.

<P>
These measures began to show effect in the first half of this
year as economic growth increased to 8.2 percent. Even higher
growth rates were recorded in industrial production, retail sales,
investment and exports. All major economic indicators have shown
vast improvement.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng told a national work
meeting on finance today that without implementing the pro-active
fiscal policy, China would not have had a healthy economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Chinese government greatly increased
government investment to invigorate an economy suffering from
deflation and the impact of the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Active Fiscal Policy Boosts Economic Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through increasing input in economic restructuring and advanced
technology, the government managed to combine short-term fiscal
policies with long-term economic goals. It also combined
preemptive measures against deflation with efforts to develop a
market-oriented macro-control system.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the fiscal revenue reached its the highest level
as the economy accelerated in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Increasing investment in infrastructure construction and key
projects have helped improve production and prices of energy and
raw materials in the first half of the year, providing a healthy
environment for long-term economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Through subsidizing enterprises that borrowed loans to upgrade
technology, the government has effectively directed corporate
investment to industrial restructuring and improved efficiency.
These measures, combined with government support for turning round
loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have seen profits of
industrial companies in China surged by 1.3 times over the same
period last year in the first five months of the year. The index
also improved 16.4 points to 107.3 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also boosted the growth of exports
and consumption by increasing tax returns, imposing tax on
interest of savings deposits and eliminating arbitrary charges
that government departments levied on consumer goods and services.
As a result, retail sales jumped 10.1 percent in the first half of
the year. Meanwhile, exports surged by 38.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Through increasing expenditure on social security, law
enforcement, science, technology, education and agriculture, the
Chinese government has continuously improved reforms within SOEs,
economic restructuring and development of a market system.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) predicts that the pro-
active fiscal policy will help push the economic growth to a
higher level this year than in the previous year.

<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
began talks on Wednesday in Alexandria with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, who received a hero's welcome from the Egyptian
people for his steadfastness in negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in the Egyptian Mediterranean port city earlier
from the United States, where he had held intensive and tough
negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for 15 days.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted by thousands of cheering people, lining up on the
streets and waving to him as he was driven to Ras al-Teen
presidential palace overlooking the sea.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was expected to present to Mubarak a comprehensive
evaluation of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks held at the Camp
David presidential retreat near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak ended their negotiations on Tuesday without
reaching a peace deal to resolve disputes over the thorniest issues
including Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa stressed late Tuesday night
that Egypt supports Arafat's stances on the sensitive issues,
especially on Jerusalem, saying that the rights of the Palestinian
people must be respected.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state. But Israel insists that Jerusalem
is its "eternal and undivided capital," a claim not internationally
recognized.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's MPR Gets Full Support From Military, Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), the highest law-making body in the
country, has obtained a full support from the Indonesian Military
(TNI) and the National Police (Polri) in staging its annual
session on August 7-18, MPR Speaker Amien Rais said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"During a special meeting of a special ad hoc committee, we
have reached agreement that the Polri which is backed up by the
TNI will give their commitment for the sake of the success of the
Assembly' annual session," Rais told a press conference at the
Assembly's building.
</P>
<P>
Rais also reiterated that the Assembly' session will not be
directed to unseat incumbent President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to worry about, as there is no single item in
our session agenda to impeach the president which has been elected
constitutionally last year. There is no agenda to unseat him. Just
take it easy," Rais said.
</P>
<P>
During the Assembly's annual session, President Abdurrahman
Wahid is scheduled to appear before the session to account for his
nine month in office.
</P>
<P>
There is a rising worry that the annual session of the Assembly
will turn to a special session during which incumbent Wahid may be
ousted by his political opponents in the Assembly by refusing his
speech.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of the Polri Gen. Rusdihardjo said that the
police will deploy at least 68,000 personnel across the country to
back up the session.
</P>
<P>
"In the capital itself, we will deploy 19,000 police personnel
and 4,000 military personnel to safeguard Jakarta in the course of
the session," Rusdihardjo said.
</P>
<P>
"God Willing, we will be able to make the session successful,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Rusdihardjo said that at least 28,270 security officers
will be deployed to safeguard Jakarta during the session.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is for a stage one security level. The number will
be doubled if the situation reaches an emergency level," he added.

<HEADLINE> Europe-Asia Ties Should be Further Strengthened: Solana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Europe and Asia should seek to
develop further ties in the current changing world, High
Representative for the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy
Javier Solana said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both the EU and Asia are in a process of profound change
against a backdrop of rapidly developing world, said the former
NATO chief while delivering the 4th Asia-Europe Lecture entitled "
Future Relations Between the European Union and Asia."
</P>
<P>
Integration is becoming an important factor in enabling
different regions to pursue the shared interests of groups of
nations in an increasingly global world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, individual nations are looking more than ever to
identify themselves with their local culture, language and
tradition, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Such developments do not mean that regions can retreat into
their shells," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, they are even more reason to develop and
strengthen the dialogue and cooperation between them," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the EU and Asia should cooperate with each
other in order to address common transnational issues such as drug
trafficking, organized crime, money laundering and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Much of Asia like the EU, he said, is a melting pot of peoples
of many backgrounds and cultures.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "we have to promote together the values of tolerance
which are essential if such societies are to operate successfully,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral contacts between the EU and individual countries
in Asia are becoming increasingly important, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said strong regional frameworks such as the ASEAN (the
Association of South East Asian Nations) are gaining ground as the
natural interlocutors for a more comprehensive and global dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in Singapore this morning for a one-day official
visit at the invitation of Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Chief Condoles on Death of NZ Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Indonesian Military
TNI) Adm Widodo has expressed here Wednesday his condolence to the
New Zealand soldiers over the death of their comrade when he was
on peacekeeping duties in East Timor, and asked all parties to
view the incident proportionally.
</P>
<P>
"Well, we express our condolence and sympathy for the death of
the U.N peacekeeping force in East Timor," Widodo told reporters
at the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the TNI along with its counterpart of the U.N.
Peacekeeping Force in East Timor will seek what he said a "
clarification of the incident".
</P>
<P>
Private Leonard William Manning, 24, was shot twice in Monday
morning when New Zealand troops tracking a group of unidentified
armed men in the rugged town of Fato Mean, about two kilometers
from the Indonesian border.
</P>
<P>
Manning was the first combat casualty since the U.N.-backed
peacekeeping force arrived in East Timor last September.
</P>
<P>
The incident came amidst a chorus of criticism against
Indonesia for failing to control pro-Indonesia armed East Timorese
militiamen who still roam freely in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, asked whether TNI soldiers were involved in the
gunfire, Widodo said no firmly.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a senior Indonesian military officer said two army
companies have been deployed to the East Timor border to hunt down
militiamen who murdered the New Zealand soldier.

CANBERRA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Marginally higher than expected
June inflation results pushed up the Australian dollar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At 1700 local time, the Australian dollar was at 58.76 US cents
from 58.54 at the end of previous day's local session.
</P>
<P>
The local currency hit a low of 58.36 US cents about a half

</P>
<P>
The CPI increased by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter,

Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It breached the upper limit
of the Reserve Bank's two to three percent target range.
</P>

</P>
<P>
They are here to attend the 7th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),

<HEADLINE> Romania to Promote Ecological Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government has
decided to promote the ecological agriculture, stressing the
country has remarkable opportunities in this area, an official
report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An emergency ordinance, which was recently approved by the
government, will set up a legal frame for the development of the
ecological agriculture. The act takes into account the pertinent
regulations of the Council of Europe, as well as those of the
International Federation for Organic Agriculture Movement, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The ecological production means, according to the ordinance,
growing plants without using chemical substances and breeding
animals with biological fodder.
</P>
<P>
A lasting and balanced agricultural system, required by the
ecological production, should ensure the protection of natural
resources and the consumers' health while organisms with their
gene altered are not admitted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the ecological agriculture could be an
alternative to the conventional agriculture for all Romanian
farmers.

<HEADLINE> French Press Lament End of Myth in Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The French press Wednesday lamented
the end of the myth of excellence in human aviation once
incarnated by the Concorde supersonic aircraft, describing the
crash of the Air France Concorde on Tuesday, which is the first
since its launching in 1969, as an event marking the end of the
century for Europe.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberation said that ever since its conception,
Concorde has lost to market-oriented planes like Boeing and Airbus,
but it remains the best plane in the world.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that what is tragically destroyed on Tuesday is
a beautiful dream, symbolized by the beautiful wings of a Concorde.
</P>
<P>
The daily Humanite said that "pain and shock" were the two
words which struck one upon hearing about the crash of Concorde.
</P>
<P>
It said that what made the disaster more unbelievable is that
all the experts agree that the plane, which can fly 2,200
kilometers an hour at an altitude of 15,000 meters, has not become
old.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said that more than 30 years after its
maiden flight, Concorde remained a plane arousing jealousy of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
"In 2000, this plane, whose technology goes back to the 1960s,
still incarnates modernity. It also represents genius of Europeans,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
The daily Paris-Normandie said that on Tuesday, it was a myth
which crashed.
</P>
<P>
"Symbol of triumphant technology, speed and luxury, European
know-how and competition with the United States, the plane
incarnates our end of the century," said the paper.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Banks to Extend Loans to Help Hyundai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's 12 banks on Wednesday
decided to extend their loans to the Hyundai Engineering and
Construction Co. which is suffering from a liquidity crisis.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting, presidents of the 12 South Korean
domestic banks reached an agreement not to call in their loans to
South Korean largest corporation Hyundai Group, and the
corporation's bonds and corporate papers will be extended when
they hit maturity.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to ask non-banking financial institutions
which supplied loans to the family-owned corporation to extend
their maturity periods.
</P>
<P>
The banks made the decision to help the Hyundai Group overcome
the current liquidity crisis at its subsidiary Hyundai Engineering
and Construction.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Hyundai Engineering and Construction announced
that it will raise 1.5 trillion won (about 1.34 billion U.S.
dollars) by selling assets at home and abroad as part of its own
self-rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
It is much more than the 600 billion won (about 538.8 million
dollars) the company originally sought in March 31 announcement.
</P>
<P>
It will gather extra funds in August by selling a cement plant
in Bangladesh, a fund entrusted to the Korea National Housing Corp.
, its Kwanghwamoon building, securities and unsold shopping
centers.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said that though a temporary deficiency of
capital is expected if creditors call their loans in at the same
time, it is possible to clear all the loans through profits and
the sale of assets.
</P>
<P>
Many Hyundai lenders have called in loans after the Korea
Management Consulting &AMP; Credit downgraded its credit appraisals
for a number of Hyundai affiliates Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Engineering and Construction presented with corporate
papers and company bonds totaling 139 billion won (about 124.8
million dollars) which had to be paid within the day as lending
banks, merchant banks and securities companies clamored for
repayment fearing the group may go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
The company diffused the emergency by selling off some of its
securities and acquiring loan extensions from the South Korean
Foreign Exchange Bank, its main creditor.
</P>
<P>
Concerns are mounting as the company will have to pay about 200
billion won (about 179.6 million dollars), including 100 billion
won (about 89.8 million dollars), to subcontractors this weekend.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the company's financial pinch will
continue unless the South Korean government and Hyundai Group come
up with special measures to address the flood of bonds and
corporate papers hitting maturity between now and the end of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Upper House Passes Bill on Its Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federation Council, the
upper house of the parliament, on Wednesday approved President
Vladimir Putin's bill on changing the way of the council's
formation to strengthen central authorities.
</P>
<P>
The bill was adopted by 119 votes for and 18 against with four
abstentions after a one-month-long deadlock between the two
chambers of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, regional and territorial leaders in the
Federation Council will be replaced by two permanently working
representatives from each territory -- one from the legislative
branch and the other from the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
All incumbent Federation Council members, also heads of
territorial legislatures and administrations, shall be replaced by
January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the legislative branch will be elected by
the territorial legislature, while that of the executive branch
will be appointed by the top executive official -- governor of a
territory or president of a federal republic in the Russian
Federation -- and will need to be agreed on by two thirds of
deputies of the territorial legislature.
</P>
<P>
The representatives, who must be no less than 30 years old, may
be dismissed in the same way as they are appointed or elected, and
the mandate of the senators will be extended from two to four
years.
</P>
<P>
Putin submitted the bill on reforming the Federation Council to
the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, on May 19, and the
Duma ratified the bill in the second and third readings on June 23.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council, however, vetoed the bill on June 28.
</P>
<P>
0n July 17, a trilateral conciliatory commission, consisting of
representatives from the two chambers of parliament and the
president, reached a compromise on amendments submitted by the
upper house to the Duma, which approved the amendatory bill two
days later.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's relevant laws, if the Federation Council fails
to agree with the bill, the State Duma will be entitled to cancel
the upper house's decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed deep regret
over the failure of the Camp David Summit, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fruitless summit between Palestine, Israel
and the United States, Zhu said, "We deeply regret that the
negotiations failed to reach an agreement." The failure again
reflects the complexity of the Mideast issue, and proves that
there are twists and turns in the path toward peace.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is in the fundamental interests of the
countries and peoples in the region to solve the Mideast issue
through peaceful negotiations so as to maintain regional peace and
stability and prevent turbulence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the current situation, the Chinese
government sincerely hopes that both Israel and Palestine would be
prudent and continue their peace talks, and that they would, based
on relevant UN resolutions and in accordance with the principle of
"land for peace", earnestly implement the agreements reached by
them, so as to settle the final status of Palestine at an early
date, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community should work harder to
promote peace and help the Israelis and Palestinians to overcome
the difficulties in their peace talks.
</P>
<P>
China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is
closely following the situation in the region, and will, as always,
work together with the international community for comprehensive,
equitable and lasting peace in the Middle East, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people are complaining
about the prices of medicine, a latest survey reveals.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics released by the Ministry of Health show that
Chinese have to spend 79 yuan (9.52 U.S. dollars) on average each
time they see a doctor while each inpatient must pay on average 2,
891 yuan. Patients pay more than 60 percent of all the medical
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Over half of those sick in Beijing are reluctant to see doctors,
"Wenhui Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the State Development Planning
Commission said that medicine supply greatly exceeds demand in
China.
</P>
<P>
China now has 6,000 pharmaceutical enterprises, with 1,500 Sino-
foreign joint ventures, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A sales manager with a pharmaceutical company said that a new
medicine is usually priced ten times of its production cost, the
Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission medicine department
said that a great number of medicine dealers are frequenting
hospitals selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has more than 10,000 such dealers who are busy inviting
pharmacy heads in hospitals to extravagant dinners, buying them
expensive household electrical appliances, paying their overseas
traveling bills, or even directly giving them money.
</P>
<P>
A medicine representative said that pharmaceutical companies
would naturally count additional expense into the cost of drugs,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Administrative authorities recently announced price cut for 57
kinds of medicines, mainly antibiotics, and are also trying to
separate pharmacies from hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Support for Advancing Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has reiterated its keenness on
helping push the Middle East peace process forward for a just and
comprehensive peace in the region, the Al-Ahram newspaper reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said late Tuesday night
that President Hosni Mubarak will discuss the peace process with
leaders of the concerned parties, especially Arab countries, in the
coming period, and seek ways of advancing the Arab-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will meet on Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, who is expected to present a comprehensive evaluation of
his summit meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp
David presidential retreat of the United States, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the blame put on Arafat for the failure to reach an
agreement aimed at ending the half-century Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak ended on Tuesday their 15 days of intensive and
tough negotiations without an agreement for a final settlement of
the thorniest issues including Jerusalem, Palestinian state,
Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton, who hosted the summit,
accused Arafat of failing to compromise on the most sensitive issue
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Peace should be just and balanced and the rights of the
Palestinian people must be respected, Moussa was quoted as saying
by Al-Ahram daily, which usually reflects government viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
Arafat insists that Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied
in the 1967 Mideast War, be the capital of the future Palestinian
state. But Israel says Jerusalem, which is holy to Islam, Judaism
and Christianity, is its "eternal and undivided capital," a claim
which is not internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
Moussa underlined the need for future Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations to be based on the United Nations Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338 and relevant resolutions on Jerusalem and
refugees.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance to establish a Palestinian state,
saying that Egypt's stance on the issue is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have vowed to declare an independent state on
September 13, when the interim period expires, with or without a
final peace treaty with Israel, a move which has won Egypt's
support.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Reform Top Policy-Making Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government has expressed
welcome to the powerful military's statement that it has no
objection to admitting more civilian members in the National
Security Council (MGK), the top policy-making organ of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of Turkish Armed Forces Huseyin
Kivrikoglu said on Monday that more civilians joining the MGK would
not damage its efficiency at all. "If the government wants, they
can have 100 civilian members. There will be no objections," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Ankara, Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said "Kivrikoglu has touched on a fact" that Turkey has to
reform the MGK's structure if it is to become a part of the
European Union (EU), Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The MGK currently comprises the president, prime minister,
defense minister, interior minister, foreign minister, as well as
chief of general staff, land, air and naval forces commanders and
the gendarmerie commander.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the numbers of members from the civilian
and military are equal, the EU requires Turkey, an EU candidate, to
subordinate the military to civilian political authority.
</P>
<P>
Broadening the composition of the MGK, set up in the aftermath
of the 1980 military coup, by including more civilian members is
seen by the EU as an important step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
However, Kivrikoglu said the MGK decisions are not taken by
voting but through a "consensus," indicating that more civilian
members would not mean a fundamental change in the way the
effectively military-controlled MGK works.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Turkish ministers expressed positive views on
Kivrikoglu's statement, saying that Turkey should do everything
necessary to join the EU, which includes promoting the idea of
broadening the MGK with more civilian members.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the deputy prime minister, finance minister
and justice minister would join the most powerful administration in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Key to Mideast Peace Process: Jordanian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
Khatib stressed on Wednesday that the status of Jerusalem is the
key to a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters after U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced on Tuesday that the two-week trilateral summit
between Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in the Camp David near Washington failed to
reach an agreement on Jerusalem, refugees, borders and security.
</P>
<P>
Khatib stressed the Palestinian issue is the corner stone in the
peace process, and only by restoring the rights of the
Palestinians, including the establishment of an independent state
on their own soil with Jerusalem as its capital, can peace and
stability prevail in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although the Camp David summit failed to reach any agreement on
the prickly issues, but the participants had reached some
understandings and narrowed their differences, Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
He said Jerusalem is a very sensitive and complicated issue, and
from a religious and historic point of view, any solutions to its
status must take into considerations the position of the holy city
in the heart of Arabs and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Israel sees the holy city as its "undivided and eternal capital"
while the Palestinians wants the Arab East Jerusalem captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war as capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Jordan will continue to keep a close
eye on the issue of Jerusalem, and the status of the city must be
decided upon in accordance with relevant resolutions by the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces New Rules for Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday announced
new rules on the Internet market structure and Internet-based
telephony to promote wider industry participation in the provision
of Internet access and to stimulate the growth of Internet service.
</P>
<P>
The public is free to use personal computer to personal
computer (PC to PC) Internet telephony which does not involve the
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), according to a statement
issued by the Ministry of Energy, Communications and Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) will however be subject to
the normal regulations since this facility involves the PSTN which
is a regulated service, the ministry said, adding that companies
intending to provide VOIP services are required under the
Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 to have an Applications
Service Individual License.
</P>
<P>
To encourage greater participation among industry players in
the Internet market, provider of Internet access service has been
redefined.
</P>
<P>
All companies and operators that provide access to the Internet
through existing infrastructure will now be known as Internet
Access Service Providers (IASPs) which provide basic Internet
access services including other standard services.
</P>
<P>
All of them need to register with the Communications and
Multimedia Commission as a Class License holder for the
Applications Service with a fixed annual registration fee, it said.
</P>
<P>
Network Service Providers or companies which provide bandwidth
requirements to support the connectivity of the various IASPs can
also provide Internet access if they register as Applications
Service Class License holder in addition to the individual network
service license to provide connectivity services, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Provision of Internet access is also given to Network
Facilities Providers which have been defined as parties owning and
operating the necessary infrastructure like leased lines and other
facilities to support network services.
</P>
<P>
They, in addition to Individual License to provide either each
or both Network Facilities and Services, are required to register
as an Applications Service Class License holder to provide
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Companies which provide other standard services through
existing Internet access such as e-mail, Internet content, mailing
addresses, transaction and portal services are exempted from
licensing, it said.
</P>
<P>
The policy change is expected to provide a clearer definition
of the roles and activities of the various industry participants
in the Internet market, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The new licensing requirements are also intended to promote
competition in the market through minimizing market-entry
requirements, the ministry said, hoping under the new environment,
the number of IASPs in the country will increase in tandem with
the growing demand for Internet access.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister Hopes for Closer Ties With Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
expressed the hope Wednesday that the first-ever meeting between
the foreign ministers of Japan and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in Bangkok, Thailand, will help the two
countries resume normalization talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The first consideration should be on an early resumption of the
suspended Japan-DPRK negotiations, Mori told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and DPRK Foreign Minister
Paek Nam Sun are scheduled to meet Wednesday evening in the Thai
capital on the sidelines of a meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate press conference, Japanese Cabinet
Secretary Hidenao Nakagawa also voiced the hope that it will be a
meeting in which the reduction of tension on the Korean Peninsula,
that was brought about by the inter-Korean summit in June, will be
promoted, and dialogue between Tokyo and Pyongyang will be pushed
forward.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from Japan and the DPRK met in April to resume
normalization talks that collapsed in 1992, but a second round of
talks, set for late May, was postponed.

<P>
PARIS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The future of the Concorde
supersonic aircraft is not doomed by the crash of one of such
planes in Paris Tuesday afternoon, French Minister of Transport
Jean-Claude Gayssot said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on the French television, he said that the
commercial flight of Concorde will be suspended until all
guarantees are ensured and the black boxes of the crashed Concorde
are studied.
</P>
<P>
"We will make decisions which should be made, but of course,
normally the perspective of Concorde is that it will fly again,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Two black boxes were found Tuesday night on the site of the
crash, which killed 113 people, most of them German tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's crash was the first of Concorde since its launching
in 1969 and its maiden commercial flight in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Both Air France and British Airways, the only two air companies
using the Concorde, have suspended the flight of such planes.

<HEADLINE> Pollution-haunted City Promotes Clean Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Taiyuan, the first trial city in
China designated by the United Nations to experiment with clean
production, has been stepping up efforts to spread the practice of
clean production to ease the pressure on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The city has so far invested a total of 1.5 billion yuan in 15
clean production projects. About 20 percent of the backbone
enterprises in the city are engaged in clean production, giving
new hope to the heavily polluted city.
</P>
<P>
The city was selected as the first trial city to enforce clean
production in China by the United Nations Environment Program and
the central government. Ten enterprises in the city have been
chosen to experiment with clean production.
</P>
<P>
The city has focused its clean production endeavor on full
utilization of coal powder and treatment of sewage water. The
Taiyuan Steel Group, for example, has banned the use of sulphur-
heavy coal, phased out six steel converters and moved five
converters to suburban areas, reducing the annual discharge of
solid garbage by 100,000 tons, saving about 70,000 tons of coal a
year.
</P>
<P>
To clean up its production, the city also closed down more than
200 small mines and revoked the licenses of over 300 small
enterprises that emit heavy pollution. High and new technologies
have also been introduced to upgrade traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
Taiyuan is expected to realize clean production in 50 percent
of its backbone enterprises by 2001 and build itself into a model
city for clean production by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Clean production has already been adopted in more than 200
enterprises in China.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B Share Market Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market index
surged 2.30 points, or 2.07 percent, to close at 113.30 points
Wednesday, nearing its high of 113.47 points.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover was 129.47 million HK dollars (about 137.24
million yuan), which was 30 million HK dollars or 30.16 percent
more than Tuesday's total, according to Homeway, China's largest
on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The bulls did get much, in large part, to the performance of
stocks in broad sectors that helped the index to the plus side on
another heavy dose of positive news.
</P>
<P>
On the B-share listings, Luthai Textile (2726.SZ) reported an
earning of 0.27 yuan per share during the first half of the year
from 0.23 yuan apiece a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental support for the market's most robust move in
two weeks derived from the policy side. The People's Bank of China,
the central bank, said foreign investors will be able to buy
stakes in domestic financial leasing firms. These financial
institutions will also be allowed to borrow hard currencies from
overseas and issue treasury bonds as well as to invest in
securities.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outperformed declining shares by 51 to four,
with one unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Fiyta Holdings (2003.SZ) added 7.30 percent to 2.50 HK dollars
per share, while Wuhan Boiler (2770.SZ) rose 5.52 percent to 1.53
HK dollars a share.
</P>
<P>
Konka Elect (2016.SZ) fell 2.70 percent to 6.12 HK dollars,
while Huaxin Pack (2986.SZ) shed 1.27 percent to 2.33 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predict that the market will hold steady at
modestly higher levels in fairly dynamic trading. Structural
fundamentals have been the main source of support for the broader
market. Blue chips will lead the gains on investors' selective
buying interest.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Treasuries Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries rallied broadly
led by Bond 009905, after yesterday's slump.
</P>
<P>
Though having recouped some losses, the fixed income T-bonds
kept inactive as the stock indices continued to climb, attracting
most investors' attention, according to Homeway, China's leading
on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Trade value totaled 1.28 billion yuan today, up 488 million
yuan from the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009905 jumped by 0.28 percent to 102.35 yuan, causing a 0.
05 percentage-point decline in the yield. The other bond listed in
1999, 009908, saw a tame rise of 0.08 percent to reach 102.16 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Bond 000896 stayed unchanged with a thin trading volume of six
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Due to the comparatively loose money supply on the market, the
combined turnover of three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day repo
transactions contracted to 1.33 billion yuan, shrinking more than
a half from yesterday's 2.73 billion yuan.

The Shenzhen Composite Index reached a new high again on
Wednesday and ended at a record high of 619.24 points.

Two new A shares made their debuts on the Shenzhen market.
Daqing Huake and Shanxi Xishan Coal and Electricity Power Co., Ltd.
were the top gainers with their prices increasing 168.35 percent

BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's securities investment fund
market continued to rise steadily today. Among 28 funds, 22 rose,
five remained unchanged, and one declined.

The only dropping fund today was fund Zhujiang, which was the
top gainer on the two stock markets. The fund, which is a

<HEADLINE> Reformist Weekly Ordered Closed in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary has
ordered the closure of the reformist Persian weekly Gounagoun
(Variety), bringing the total number of banned papers and journals
in the past few months to 20, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by Tehran's Justice Department, the
weekly was ordered to temporarily stop publication as of Tuesday
because it had employed staff members of previously banned dailies
such as Jameah, Tous and Asr-e Azadegan, a violation of the press
law.
</P>
<P>
The press law, amended by the conservative fifth Majlis
(parliament) in April, forbids a suspended publication from
reappearing under a new name. It also stipulates that no one is
allowed to publish a newspaper with exactly the same personnel of a
banned one.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale clampdown on newspapers, most of them reformist
ones, was a result of political struggles between the conservative
establishment and the reformist camp, which has taken control of
the parliament since May 27 after its overwhelming victory in
February's election.
</P>
<P>
The restrictive press law, passed by the former conservative
Majlis before the end of its term, strengthened the hand of the
conservative judiciary in controlling the independent media, a move
that left the reformist press vulnerable to political pressures.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the amended law, reformist journalist Emadeddin
Baqi was sentenced to five and a half years in jail for libel and "
religious treason" on July 17. A number of other journalists have
been accused of similar offenses and are waiting trial.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis, dominated by reformers, has made a decision to
hold a debate on the conservative amendments to the press law next
month.

LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- It seemed that Arsenal's Dutch

Overmars signed the deal three months ago with then Barcelona
coach Louis Van Gaal, newspapers said. The Spanish club is

Petit.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Tuesday that after 14
days of "intensive talks" at Camp David, he had "concluded with
regret" that Israel and the Palestinians "will not be able to reach
an agreement at this time."
</P>
<P>
Pale and clearly exhausted, Clinton said that the fate of
Jerusalem proved to be the most intractable issue and that the
sides had explored and rejected the possibility of a partial
agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said, "significant progress" had been made at
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced that a senior American envoy would visit the
Middle East in the weeks ahead to assess the possibility of
renewing the negotiations. He also called on Barak and Arafat to
avert violence and not to take unilateral steps.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A joint statement issued Tuesday by the sides said that
Israel and the Palestinians will "commit themselves to continue
their efforts to conclude an agreement on all permanent status
issues as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that talks should be based on U.N. Security
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and that the sides "undertake to
create an environment for negotiations free from pressure,
intimidation and threats of violence."
</P>
<P>
The statement also stated that "the two sides understand the
importance of avoiding unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome
of negotiations and that their differences will be resolved only by
good-faith negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- At a hastily called news conference before his departure,
Barak put the blame squarely on Arafat, saying he "was afraid to
take the necessary, historical responsibility at this moment to
bring about an end of the conflict. The positions of Arafat on
Jerusalem were those that prevented the achievement of an
agreement."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who departed Andrews Air Force Base four hours after the
summit's collapse, did not issued a statement about his stands. But
his aides lashed out at Barak for being intransigent, for not
understanding their leader's red lines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton said:" Prime Minister Barak showed particular
courage, vision, and an understandings of the historical importance
of this moment. Chairman Arafat made it clear that he too remains
committed to the path of peace."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanon Tuesday announced an immediate halt to Wednesday's
planned deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in south Lebanon, accusing
Israel of violating its frontier by building roads on Lebanese
soil.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Mideast envoy Terje Larsen blasted Israel for what he
called "unnecessary, counterproductive and totally unacceptable"
behavior in the apparent violations.
</P>
<P>
The new accusations came hours after Lebanese Prime Minister
Salim Hoss declared the Israeli pullout, which was carried out in
May, was complete and that there were no further obstacles to
deployment of U.N. forces into the south.

UNITED NATIONS -- U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Tuesday
that an Israeli border violation complained of earlier by Lebanon
had been cleared.
</P>

"We hope this issue can be cleared up as soon as possible so
that the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers along the border can

<HEADLINE> Russian Module Docks With International Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian service module Zvezda (
Star) successfully docked with the International Space Station (
ISS) Wednesday morning, the Mission Control Center in Korolyov
outside Moscow announced.
</P>
<P>
The Zvezda module, a Russian-built segment of the ISS, smoothly
docked with the station in an automated mode at 4:44 a.m. Moscow
time (0044 GMT) and now all systems of the two units are operating
normally, said the center.
</P>
<P>
Zvezda, 13 meters long and 30 meters wide, is equipped with an
advanced life-support system, an autonomous engine and a
communication system.
</P>
<P>
The ISS consists of three elements -- the Zarya functional unit
and Zvezda, both built in Russia, and the U.S.-made Unity module.
</P>
<P>
The 19-ton Zvezda module, the first fully Russian contribution
to the ISS, will supply the station with living quarters at the
initial stage and also life-support systems, power supplies, data
processing, flight control and a propelling installation.
</P>
<P>
The orbit of the ISS was adjusted on Tuesday for the docking
and was additionally adjusted twice in the early hours of
Wednesday. The module's orbit had been adjusted earlier, said an
official in the Mission Control Center.
</P>
<P>
Following the docking, Zvezda took over the control of the
station and the correction of its orbit.
</P>
<P>
The first crew, comprising Russian astronauts Yuri Gidzenko and
Sergei Krikalev, will leave for the ISS on October 30, according
to the center.
</P>
<P>
Zvezda was launched into orbit by Russia on July 12 from the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
It will take about 35 space missions before the ISS complex is
completed in 2005.

<P>
SEOUL, July 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday said it will
provide the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) with 100,
000 tons of fertilizer in assistance.
</P>
<P>
The National Unification Ministry said the government decided

The assistance, with an estimated worth of 32 billion won (30
million U.S. dollars), is expected to reach the DPRK next month to
be in time for use prior to harvest.
</P>
<P>
Seoul hopes the aid will help the DPRK increase its crop
harvest, said Hong Yang-ho, director-general for humanitarian aid
of the Unification Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK reportedly needs 2.62 million tons of fertilizer per
year but actually produces only some 770,000 tons.

<P>
South Korean civil groups have so far donated 6,500 tons of
fertilizer to the DPRK, excluding official assistance.

HANGZHOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Wei Baoguo, formerly political
commissar to the Zhejiang Provincial General Coast Guard Team, was
sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for committing three crimes.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was handed down by Hangzhou Intermediate People's
Court on Monday. Wei was found guilty of smuggling, embezzlement
and taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
In March 1995, Wei Baoguo, in collusion with three other
accomplices, helped Haiyan County Fodder Company in Zhejiang
Province smuggle 21,000 tons of rapeseed oil produced in Canada
into China, causing a loss of 35.41 million yuan in tariffs to the
state.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Wei, taking the advantage of his position,
illegally possessed a flat bought by Ningbo Coast Inspection
Station in November 1992, and embezzled 5,100 U.S. dollars
together with Wo Guoxing, in May 1995, taking bribes worth 123,946
yuan from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Three other accomplices including Wo Guoxing, were also
sentenced to imprisonment ranging from four to 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Two other organizations, including Zhexin Industrial Company,
were also given heavy fines for taking part in these smuggling
activities.

Sea water desalination is one of the world's most influential
burgeoning industrial sectors and China has been working in this
field for more than twenty years. The Chinese government along
with some coastal cities are now making greater efforts to
desalinate sea water which is an effective way of utilizing marine
resources and of great significance for alleviating China's
serious shortage of freshwater resources.

<HEADLINE> New Road Toll System Operates in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's largest and most
advanced traffic control system was recently put to use in
Chongqing, a leading metropolis in west China.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles passing through the city's three major bridges,
Yangtze, Jialingjiang and Shimen, do not have to stop to pay a
toll fee, but rather their number plate details are recorded and
the toll fee is deducted from their IC card. This increases the
volume of traffic fourfold.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the three bridges adopted a computerized traffic
system which handled only 500 motor vehicles per hour. Operation
of the new system raised the traffic flow to 1,800 per hour.
Moreover, it has helped reduce the number of traffic accidents and
alleviate pollution.
</P>
<P>
The system will soon be installed on other bridges and highway
roads, said a local communication official.

<HEADLINE> HK's Intellectual Property Protect Efforts Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing a seminar entitled "Benefiting from Intellectual
Property," Secretary for Commerce and Industry Chau Tak Hay said:
"Hong Kong must have an effective system for protecting
intellectual property rights," to encourage innovation as well as
investment on research and development.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
increasingly depends on innovative and knowledge-intensive
activities, which generate new ideas and processes that can be
copied and exploited by competitors.
</P>
<P>
To protect intellectual property rights effectively, Hong Kong,
in the last four years, has completely modernized the laws for
protecting patents, registered design, copyright and trade marks,
bringing them into line with the highest international standards,
Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's IP rights protection efforts had been recognized
worldwide, said Chau, referring to the fact that last month, after
a thorough view by the World Trade Organization (WTO), Hong Kong's
IP laws were highly regarded by other WTO members as being fully
consistent with the international standards laid down by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being complacent with current achievements, Hong
Kong has kept its laws under constant review to make sure they are
in line with the ever-changing situation, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
In June, Hong Kong enacted new legislation to clarify the
Copyright Ordinance to put it beyond doubt that anyone who
knowingly uses an infringing copy of copyrighted work in the
course of business commits a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to put the law into effect next year
after wide publicity, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
To further enforce the legal regime, Hong Kong has
substantially increased both the manpower for enforcement and the
penalties against the production and sale of infringing products,
Chau said.
</P>
<P>
The government has enacted tough legislation to control the
manufacture of optical discs, prevent bootlegging. It also has
classified certain piracy and counterfeiting acts as offenses
under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the government's strong enforcement efforts, in
1999 alone, Hong Kong seized some 16.5 million pirated optical
discs and 14 production lines, and arrested some 2,700 persons for
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
The government's action against copyright piracy at the retail
level has also been very successful. Last year, there were some 1,
000 retail outlets of pirated compact discs with some 5 million
pirated discs in the market place at any one time.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are fewer than 100 outlets with some 100,000
discs in the market place at any one time. The reduction in volume
is about 98 percent, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Although the piracy situation is well under control, the
government will keep up its efforts, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Noting enforcement action by the government alone will not be
sufficient, he said the government must enhance public education
and will spend some 17 million HK dollars (2.18 million U.S.
dollars) between 1999 and 2002 for this purpose.

<HEADLINE> China Actively Prepares for Huge Gas-piping Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's huge energy project to
pipe gas from west to east, expected to cost as much as the Three
Gorges Project, will be launched in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
The gas-piping project is designed to send gas from the country
's major gas production bases in the western parts to the
economically-developed Yangtze River Delta areas as well as the
eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Petroleum News, various oilfields
in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are stepping up efforts to
explore gas resources. A series of gas-bearing structures
including Kara-2 gas field, the country's largest complete gas
field, have been discovered.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that China New Star Oil Corporation has
invested 180 million yuan for the special purpose of exploring gas
resources in the Tarim Basin.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission and the local
authorities in the western regions have also worked on plans to
construct a group of gas projects.
</P>
<P>
The gas-piping project will not only tap the huge potential of
resources in the west, but will also help reform industries in
provinces and cities along the lengthy pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The gas-piping project will develop and promote petrochemical,
iron and steel and building materials sectors.

<HEADLINE> Indian Track Star P.T. Usha Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- India's well-known female star
P.T. Usha, who dominated Asian track and field in the eighties,
retired from the sport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Usha, 36, who won five golds at the Asian meet in 1985 in 100m,
200m, 400m, 400m hurdles and 4zx400m relay, wanted to devote more
time to her family, besides starting a track and field academy in
her home state of Kerala.
</P>
<P>
"I miss my family when I am away training, particularly my
young son. I want to give him more time and also train youngsters
so that they may bring a good name for the country," Usha said.
</P>
<P>
Usha wanted to make a final show at next month's Asian
championships in Jakarta, but felt she was not fit enough to give
it her best shot.
</P>
<P>
Usha landed four golds and a silver at the Asian Games in 1986
in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Usha's best and worst moments, ironically, came in a single
race at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles when she missed the
bronze in the 400m hurdles by 1/100th of a second.
</P>
<P>
She recorded her best time of 55.42secs in that race -- still
an Indian national record -- but lost the medal in a photo-finish.
</P>
<P>
Usha, who made her international debut at the Moscow Olympics
in 1980, had decided to retire after managing only a silver at the
Asian Games in Beijing in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But she returned four years later at the Hiroshima Asiad after
a painful separation with her long-time coach O.M. Nambiar and won
a silver in the longer relay.
</P>
<P>
In her last international appearance at the Asian meet in
Fukuoka, Japan in 1998, Usha surprised a young field to return
with a creditable haul of one gold in the 4x100m relay, a silver
in the longer relay and a bronze each in the 200m and 400m.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Global Habitat Forum Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Third Global Forum of
Parliamentarians on Habitat opened Wednesday in Manila where more
than 200 delegates representing about 50 countries will discuss
how to help solve the world's pressing habitat problem.
</P>
<P>
In her keynote speech on the opening session, Philippine Vice
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo called for collective actions to
provide "adequate shelter for all" and realize "sustainable human
settlements," two aims of the so-called Habitat Agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat Agenda was adopted by 171 governments at the second
United Nations Conference on Human Settlements held in Istanbul,
Turkey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Just as some 127 governments presented in Istanbul their
national action plans for housing and human settlement, in Manila
you will share information on you countries' most recent policies
and programs in response to the Habitat Agenda," said Arroyo.
</P>
<P>
"Your will also hear from the regional representatives of the
Global Parliamentarians on Habitat their respective collective
actions," she added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Oscar Lopez Velarde Vega, president of the Global
Parliamentarians on Habitat, challenged the delegates to promote
the institutionalization of those recommendations, principles,
commitments and the Global Plan of Action adopted in Istanbul in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1987 and boasting a membership of 177 countries, the
Global Parliamentarians on Habitat is an organization of
individuals committed to the Habitat Agenda adopted by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The delegates of the Third Global Forum of Parliamentarians on
Habitat will discuss ways to alter the state of homelessness of at
least 100 million people in the world.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which ends on July 28, will also address the issue
of providing adequate shelter, food, water, and decent employment
to more than 1 billion people in situation of abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
The first Global Forum of Parliamentarians on Habitat, as a
parallel event to the Second United Nations Conference on Human
Settlements, was held in Turkey on June 1996, in which 166
legislators from 34 countries of the five continents participated.
</P>
<P>
The second one, took place in Cancun, Mexico, in January 1998,
in which 266 parliamentarians and 166 observers from 58 countries
participated.

<TEXT>
<P>
Surin said Thailand and DPRK, which established diplomatic
relations 25 years ago, are seeking stronger cooperation in
economic, trade, culture and other fields. For this purpose, he
disclosed that Thailand will send a high-level delegation to DPRK
at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that DPRK could in the coming day use the upcoming
regional forum as much as possible to conduct wide-range contacts
and negotiations with all the concerned sides so as to make
contribution to the regional security.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the expected meeting between Paek and foreign
minister of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Lee Joung-binn, Surin said
the meeting is significant and will bring peace and stability to
the Korean Peninsula and the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Paek said he was very glad to be able to attend the
ARF, expressing his willingness to make contacts and exchanges
widely, in order to render positive contributions to the regional
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
ARF, initiated in 1993, serves as a multilateral security
consultative forum of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN)
with an aim to promote preventive diplomacy and confidence
building among the nations in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
DPRK was accepted by ARF earlier this year whose presence at
the meetings here itself, according to the foreign ministers of
ASEAN, is significant. In the Joint Communique issued Tuesday
after the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, foreign ministers from
the 10 member countries "reaffirmed that peace and stability in
the Korean Peninsula was crucial to the security of the region as
a whole."
</P>
<P>
The 7th ARF, on July 27, will be attended by the 10 ASEAN
members, Papua New Guinea, an observer, ASEAN's ten dialogue
partners, Mongolia, and DPRK, a new ARF member.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK foreign minister is expected to lead an 11-member
delegation to visit Cambodia on July 30 after the closing of the
ASEAN meetings here, according to diplomatic sources here.

<HEADLINE> Epidemic Kills Nearly 100 Livestock in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 97 livestock were
killed in a recent epidemic of anthrax in the Danube River delta,
east Romania, according the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Tuesday that the epidemic was found in Tulcea
County, where livestock are raised in the wild instead of in the
farm.
</P>
<P>
The disease has spread in five districts of Tulcea, it said,
adding 16 horses, 53 cows, 26 pigs and two sheep have died of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman, Gabriela Vranceanu Firea, said the
government had granted 5 billion lei (230,000 U.S. dollars) in
urgent financial aid to Tulcea to control further outbreak of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The local government of Tulcea and experts have called on
people to search for and burn animal bodies, disinfect the
pastureland where dead animals were found and vaccinate their
livestock against anthrax.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax is a quickly-spreading disease which could affect both
livestock and human beings.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic occurred in Romania's Danube River delta several
times in the last decade, in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1998.

MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Eight persons are confirmed dead
after a bomb explosion hit a coffee shop in Jolo in the southern
Philippine province of Sulu early Wednesday morning, the ABS-CBN

Local police blamed the Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf for
the explosion, which also wounded 17 others.

But Sulu governor Abdusakur Tan downplayed the incident saying
the newest bombing could be the handiwork of people who only want
to disrupt the peace in the province, according to the report.

The latest incident came about less than 24 hours after an

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Main Opposition not to Support Constitutional Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition United
National Party (UNP) has warned it will not support the
constitutional reforms if presented in the parliament before
August 24, The Island newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNP media spokesman Karunasena Kodituwakku was quoted as saying
that the whole country was in the dark about the reforms and the
time was inadequate to adopt a new constitution before the
dissolution of the parliament on August 24.
</P>
<P>
He said his party could not support the reforms under the
present situation.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance (PA) of President Kumaratunga has
proposed the constitutional reforms which aimed at ending the
bloody ethnic civil war between government troops and Tamil Tiger
rebels by granting a greater degree of autonomy to regional
councils, one of which will be governed by minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
However, an agreement on the constitutional reforms between the
PA and the UNP is considered vital before the government
negotiates with the Tamil Tiger rebels who are fighting for a
homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since
1983.
</P>
<P>
Government sources had indicated the reforms will be presented
in the parliament on August 3, and taken up for debate on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Kodituwakku said only the UNP and the PA agreeing on it could
not adopt a constitution. The other sections of the country should
also agree to it. However, both the Tamil parties and the Buddhist
clergy are among those who have rejected the proposals.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNP had participated in talks with the government
and presented proposals but had not agreed to a final draft. The
electoral reforms, which the government was trying to introduce
suddenly, had not even been discussed at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Kodituwakku said the UNP was for a political solution to the
ethnic problem, but with wider consensus with all sections of
society.

<HEADLINE> Software Company Set Up in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Tsinghua Tongfang Software Co.,
one of the capital's first high-tech enterprises to allow its
staff to buy shares of the company, has been formally launched in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The company's major share holder is Tsinghua Tongfang Co, a
Shanghai-listed high-tech company formed after the merge of
several enterprises owned by Qinghua University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Eight percent of the 50 million yuan (6.02 million US dollars)
of the software company's capital is controlled by the research
staff in the form of intangible assets. These assets are the new
technology that the company has developed. The staff contributed
their know-how to the development of the technology and they
therefore own a share of the intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Beijing that staffers have been given
this kind of a stake in their company, today's "China Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
The company will focus on the development and marketing of
software for e-commerce, education, enterprise information
management and digital appliances.
</P>
<P>
The new company is based at Qinghua University's software
technology center, China's first ever center to export software.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make it easier to translate research results
into products and profits," company chairman Sun Jiaguan was
quoted by the English language newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company intends to be listed on the as yet
unveiled high-tech dominated second domestic board within a year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Human Rights Body Welcomes May Riots Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Following the decision of the
Indonesia's Attorney General Office (AGO) to launch a
comprehensive investigation into the May riots 1998, the country's
human rights body (Komnas HAM) has welcomed such a plan, saying
the probe should not be postponed until the new law on human
rights trials is ratified by the House, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer daily quoted a member of the Komnas HAM,
Bambang W. Suharto as saying that the AGO has done the right thing
by asking the Komnas HAM to make a report on the government-
appointed of the Joint Fact-Finding Team (TGPF).
</P>
<P>
"We agree there is a need for a quick action from the AGO to
reinvestigate the May riots," Suharto said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman pledged his side
will launch a comprehensive investigation and set one week dead-
line for the Komnas HAM to submit the report for further legal
action.
</P>
<P>
On May 13-15, 1998, only a few days before former president
Soeharto stepped down, Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting
in decades in three main cities, namely Jakarta, Medan, Solo. It
was believed at least 1,300 people were killed in the riots, and
thousands of buildings and vehicles were damaged or set on fire. A
wide-spread rape and torture on ethnic Chinese women was also
believed to had been conducted by the rioters at that time.
</P>
<P>
The TGPF issued a report confirming that nearly 1,300 lives
were claimed and 52 women were raped with 14 more falling victim
to rape with violence, 10 to sexual attacks and nine to sexual
harassment. But until now, there are no exact figure on the
victims of rape which mostly were believed to be experienced by
ethnic Chinese women. The Indonesian Ethnic Chinese Reforms Party
put the number of rape victims at 300 including a nine years old
girl.
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear there were human right abuses and violence
conducted against ethnic Chinese during the riots," Bambang W.
Suharto said in a statement, adding that the Komnas HAM is seeking
more supporting evidence to bring the case to court.

<HEADLINE> New TV Lab in Los Angeles to Explore Future Value of Television </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. organizations
announced Tuesday that they are joining with advertisers and
programmers to create a lab designed to explore the future value
of television.
</P>
<P>
The first-of-its-kind project, said the National In-Home TV Lab,
will create an exclusive panel of 1,500 representative homes
across the United States, equipped with personal television
services provided by TiVo, one of the three partners.
</P>
<P>
The other two partners are televisual research firm ASI
Entertainment and television ratings company Nielsen Media
Research.
</P>
<P>
The lab, designed to forecast the future impact of personal
television on television programming and advertising, will provide
an experimental platform to challenge current advertising and
program paradigms and develop new ones.
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement announced Tuesday, Nielsen will
design a nationally representative sample and recruit the
households, TiVo will provide its services to the selected homes,
and ASI will manage the TV Lab and conduct and report the research
findings.
</P>
<P>
Based in Silicon Valley and founded in 1997, TiVo has developed
a technology that serves as a platform for delivering a variety of
home entertainment services. TiVo's Personal TV Service simplifies
the way viewers watch and enjoy television by digitally recording
television shows, without videotapes, so viewers can watch what
they want and when they want to watch it.
</P>
<P>
Even as they drain 18 billion U.S. dollars in ordinary TV
advertising revenues, "smarter TV" devices will create 25 billion
dollars in new revenues from viewers interacting with their TV
screens.
</P>
<P>
Smarter TV devices like personal video recorders and
interactive digital cable boxes will move viewers beyond the
passive viewing experience, allowing them to watch TV on their own
schedules, interact and connect to on-screen service.
</P>
<P>
Forrester predicted that by the end of this year, 34 million U.
S. households will use interactive program guides, five million
will interact with programs and commercials, and 750,000 will
record programming on personal video recorders like TiVo.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corp (CTGPC) issued three billion yuan (360
million US. dollars) in registered bonds Tuesday to help pay for
the Three Gorges hydropower project.
</P>
<P>
The ten-year enterprise bonds are priced at floating rate
annually, the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The coupon rate of the bonds is 1.75 percentage points higher
than the annual interest rate of a one-year bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
The floating rate pricing method, which is better suited for
investors to avoid the risk of interest, is a significant
innovation in China's enterprise bonds market, a CTGPC official
was quoted by today's "China Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bonds also offer good fluidity because they will soon be
traded on the Shanghai Securities Exchange, the official said.

<P>
The bonds are awarded an AAA rating, the country's highest bond
rating.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance recently approved the Three Gorges
Construction fund to provide guarantees for the bonds.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Three Gorges Construction Fund raised by the
Chinese Government annually, CTGPC has strong repayment and
guarantee capacity.
</P>
<P>
The bonds are expected to fill the investment gap for the
construction of the Three Gorges project this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, total capital demand for the project
in 2000 will reach 14.3 billion yuan (1.72 billion U.S. dollars).
The expected capital channels include the Three Gorges
Construction fund, loans from the State Development Bank and
domestic commercial banks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
CITIC (China International Trust Investment Corp) Securities Co
Ltd is the lead underwriter of the bonds. Six other financial
companies are also underwriters.
</P>
<P>
Before this bonds, CTGPC issued two rounds of bonds, one
billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 and two billion
yuan (240 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 and two billion yuan (240
million U.S. dollars) in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 203.9 billion yuan ( 24.57 billion U.
S. dollars), the Three Gorges hydropower plant is expected to
generate 84.7 billion kilowatts annually after its completion in
2009.

<HEADLINE> System Helps Boost Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's top securities regulator
said that the State is now considering establishing an unified
share registration, transaction and settlement system at the
domestic stock market.
</P>
<P>
The move is believed to be one of the biggest steps taken by
the authorities to help establish a more transparent, healthy and
market-oriented stock market in China.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's two bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen have
separate systems for transactions, settlement and information
transformation, which often results in higher costs and
inconvenience to the investors.
</P>
<P>
"And a unified index system would also be established in the
near future to help investors ward off trouble when selecting and
choosing shares in the two domestic markets," Tu Guangshao,
secretary-general of the China Securities Regulatory Commission,
was quoted by today's "China Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tu said that the commission is also considering allowing
commercial banks to provide extended securities services for
industry operators and fund management firms in a move to reduce
cost and improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"Reforms towards more market-oriented operating mechanism would
be the top priority of our schedule," said Tu.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Involvement in NMD Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian opposition said
Wednesday that the country's involvement in the controversial U.S.
National Missile Defense Plan (NMD) is in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press, Opposition
foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton told the Australian
Radio National that "We don't believe that Australia should be
involved in this. We believe it is going in exactly the wrong
direction."
</P>
<P>
He said that Foreign Minister Alexander Downer's argument was
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Downer had said that it was difficult for an ally to
block support or assistance with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Brereton pointed out that the Hawke government of the 1980s had
refused to help the U.S. in testing its Star Wars system.
</P>
<P>
"With this son of Star Wars system, we should adopt the same
position," he said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated the Labor party would rethink about the Australia'
s attitude towards the issue if won the next general election
scheduled at the end of the next year, stressing that "We should
review it on coming to office."
</P>
<P>
He accused Downer of being naive and inept. He said concerns
raised by China about Australia's position on the defense system
were predictable and in line with that country's concerns over
nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that when Alexander Downer said on national
television on the weekend that the issues for Beijing wasn't
Australia, he was being completely naive and certainly totally
inept," he was quoted by AAP as saying.
</P>
<P>
The daily of The Age released Monday that the cooperation
between Australia and the United States on testing NMD has in fact
begun and the U.S.-Australian joint Pine Gap electronic spy base
in the central Australian continent has been enlarged last year
and integrated the electronic spy mission with missile early
warning capability.
</P>
<P>
Two new satellite radomes and some associated buildings were
completed secretly to receive data from U.S. early warning
satellites. The paper said that by 2004, the base will be a
critical part of U.S. plans for war in space.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Made World's Earliest Water Closet: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A water closet built some 2,000
years ago is believed to be the world's earliest lavatory with
running water and seating.
</P>
<P>
The toilet, discovered in a stone tomb of a King of the West
Han Dynasty (206 BC to 24 AD), is about two sq. meters and is part
of the underground palace of its wealthy owner who believed that
his soul would need to enjoy the human life after death.
</P>
<P>
"This top-grade stool is the earliest of its kind ever
discovered in the world, meaning that the Chinese used the world's
earliest water closet which is quite like what we are using today,
" said a group of archaeologists in a recent report on the study
of the tomb.
</P>
<P>
Made out of stones, the stool even has a comfortable armrest.
</P>
<P>
"It was an great invention and a symbol of social civilization
of that time," said the experts.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is in the Mangdang Hill in Shangqiu of central China's
Henan province, where archaeologists discovered some 72 other
tombs of the West Han dynasty and a valuable jacket made of golden
thread and jade pieces.
</P>
<P>
The experts also announced that the tomb of a queen consort
there is the biggest stone tomb in the world, at a length of 210.5
meters and 1,600 sq. m. in total area and consisting of more than
30 rooms including corridors, bathroom, toilet, kitchen and an ice-
storing kiosk.

<HEADLINE> Early Rice Yield to Fall Seven Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The production of early rice, a
major Chinese grain that is grown from March to July, is expected
to fall seven percent from last year to reach 37.5 million tons,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials earlier predicted China's summer grain
output would plummet ten percent from 1999 to 105 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture attributed the lower production of
early rice to lesser acreage, plus efforts to maximize the crop-
growing mix.
</P>
<P>
On average, early rice contributes eight percent to the country
's total grain harvest each year, with production concentrated in
southern China, especially the lower and middle reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
With the central government having phased out protective
pricing for poor-quality or unmarketable grain, China's main rice-
producing provinces are using smaller areas to grow early rice,
especially lesser quality rice.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 66.6 million hectares were reserved for early rice,
a reduction of 12 percent from 1999, according to ministry
statistics.
</P>
<P>
With normal weather and an absence of natural disasters during
the five-month growing period, the ministry has predicted that the
per-hectare yield of early rice will edge up five percent from
last year to reach 5,685 kilograms.

<HEADLINE> Price War Looming Over China's Car Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A price war is looming over the
Chinese car market as a result of price cuts and the country's
imminent accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co Ltd based in Wuhan, capital
of Central China's Hubei Province, announced an unexpectedly sharp
cut in the price of its Fukang cars in west China's Sichuan
Province and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just days after the company reiterated
that it does not plan to follow Shanghai Volkswagen, which cut the
price of the Santana 2000 by more than 10,000 yuan (1,200 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Fukang and the Santana 2000 are widely seen as rivals on
China's car market.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from Dongfeng-Citroen, the company will
cut the prices of its three Fukang models by 6,000 yuan (722.9 US
dollars) to 15,200 (1,831.3 US dollars), today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The price cut will later be extended to Guangzhou and Nanjing
and will continue to the end of August, sources said.
</P>
<P>
A price war on the domestic car market is inevitable,
especially now that the country is gearing up to enter the WTO,
Jia Xinguang, an expert from China National Automotive Industry
Consulting and Development Corp, was quoted by China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
China will cut its tariffs on auto imports from between 80 and
100 percent to 25 percent by mid-2006.
</P>
<P>
Jia predicted that the price war will escalate next year.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission recently stated that
it does not oppose flexible price stratagems from domestic car
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts said that the statement indicates that the
central government will liberalize prices on the car market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Library of China (NLC)
will tap its huge information resources to better serve the
government in decision making, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The library has a solid foundation and sound conditions to
offer any data, information and references needed by government
officials, said Zhou Heping, library deputy director, at a seminar
for better performance of the library's government functions.
</P>
<P>
Located in western Beijing, the NLC is China's best-equipped
national library and also Asia's largest with 22 million books. It
offers prompt and comprehensive consulting services to help
address any questions State officials encounter in making
decisions or laws, the deputy director said.
</P>
<P>
The library's Internet services, which now contain five million
pieces of bibliographic data and up to 40 million pages of on-line
books, have been highly popular since the website (http://www.nlc.
gov.cn) opened in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Starting from March, 1999, a high-speed Internet connection has
linked the library with the General Office of the State Council,
putting a wide range of information at the fingertips of the
office, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The huge collection of books, Internet facilities, plus
knowledgeable librarians and researchers, have enabled the library
to aid senior State leaders, members of the National People's
Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, and departments under the State Council, Zhou added.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Doubtful to Run Individual Event in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINGSTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Jamaica track officials listed
sprinter Merlene Ottey in a 48-member Olympic squad, but they
remained undecided about whether Ottey will compete in the
individual 100-meter event.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaica squad has five veterans who competed at the Atlanta
Games in 1996, including Deon Hemmings, champion in the 400 meter
hurdles and long jumper James Beckford, runner-up in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Ottey, battling to return after a one-year ban
on international competition, only placed fourth at trials Friday
in her bid to contend for a historic sixth time at the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
She finished in 11.21 seconds, behind national champion Peta-
Gaye Dowdie, 23, who retained her title with a time of 11.19
seconds, as well as Beverley McDonald and Tanya Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
The four will compete in the 4x100 meters relay.
</P>
<P>
But officials who announced the squad Monday night said they
have yet decide whether Ottey, who has won seven medals including
two silver ones at the 1996 Atlanta Games, can nevertheless
compete in the individual event.
</P>
<P>
Ottey quit last summer from the World Championships in Seville,
Spain, after she was tested positive for the steroid Nandrolone in

cleared Ottey within months. But the International Amateur
Athletic Federation sent Ottey's case to arbitrators who on July 3
lifted the ban after concluding that the Swiss laboratory had
improperly tested Ottey's urine sample.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- British Culture Secretary Chris
Smith said on Tuesday he was doubling government funding for
sports over three years to get the country's sport back on its
feet.
</P>
<P>
Smith, explaining how his department would allocate funds set
out in Chancellor Gordon Brown's spending review last week, said
annual sports funding will rise to 102 million pounds ($154.6
million) by 2003/4.
</P>
<P>
"The increase, which is almost 100 percent over three years, is
to give our children a sporting chance," Smith told parliament.
</P>
<P>
He promised the money would help revive sports at local and
national levels, as well as providing a bonanza for schools.
</P>
<P>
Smith said he was also providing an additional 10.5 million
pounds for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking a few hours after Prime Minister Tony Blair and
England's national team manager Kevin Keegan launched a scheme to
develop soccer in England, funded by premier league television
revenues.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Never to Yield Their Legitimate Rights: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
Wednesday that the Palestinians will never yield their legitimate
rights and that Jerusalem does not only belong to the Palestinians
but also to all Arabs, Muslims and Christians worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks upon his return to the Gaza
International Airport Wednesday afternoon from the Camp David
summit that failed to reach an agreement between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian Independent State
willy-nilly," Arafat noted.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and the delegation that accompanied him to Camp David
summit received warm welcome from the Palestinian public who
gathered along the road from the airport to the presidential office
here to show solidarity with the Palestinian negotiators who held
the steadfast position regarding the issues of Jerusalem and
refugees.
</P>
<P>
About ten thousand Palestinian people flocked to the airport
and set up two large tents to protect themselves against the Sun
heat.
</P>
<P>
They hoisted the Palestinian flags and Arafat's photos as well
as banners to express support to the Palestinian leader and
denunciation to the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
Arafat exchanged hugs and kisses with his supporters who
received him in cheerful tears at the guest house beside his
private
plane. The crowds blocked Arafat's short way from the plane to the
guest house for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
Anwar Fyadh, a citizen of the West Bank province of Khan Yunis
said, "Arafat's position defends our legitimate right to Jerusalem
and
refugees' right to return to their homes."
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for us to give up Jerusalem," said Soad Um-
Hiba from Rafah province. "None of the Palestinians, Arabs or
Muslims could yield an inch of the Holy City that will be the
capital of the future Palestinian Independent State," she added.
</P>
<P>
After 14 days of hard talks, the Camp David Summit attended by
Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton failed to reach a peace deal due to the huge gap between
the Palestinians and Israelis on sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak held Arafat fully responsible for the failure of the
summit to reach a framework agreement on the final status issues
especially Jerusalem. The Palestinian side insisted on regaining
full control on the eastern side of the Holy City while the Israeli
side insisted on maintaining the city as a unified capital of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, member of the Palestinian Legislative Council
and spokesperson of the Palestinian negotiators at Camp David
Summit, said "Arafat headed for the summit with clear determination
and was fully aware of the significance of the fateful issues and
responsibilities of this stage."
</P>
<P>
"Barak's so-called 'Nos' which the Israeli leader deemed the
reference of the peace process are the reason for the failure of
the summit," she added.
</P>
<P>
On his way home from Camp David, Arafat visited Alexandria,
Egypt, where he briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on results
of the trilateral summit. Despite the failure of the summit, the
Palestinian-Israeli talks will go on till September 13 when the
Palestinian independent state will be declared, Arafat revealed.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Globetrotter Ends African Trip by Bicycle by Bian Zhuodan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A 44-year-old man from China bid
farewell to the vast African continent on Wednesday and rode on
his bicycle with self-confidence to continue his ambitious round-
the-world journey despite unimaginable twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
As part of his "marathon" tour, bicyclist Li Yuezhong visited
a total of 25 African countries, making it almost half-way round
the continent in one year and a half, with Angola as the last leg
of his African tour. Now he is gearing up his efforts to head
straight for Brazil, the first stop of his new journey to Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
"I love the African continent. It's attractive for any
globetrotter," Li said at the end of his African tour which also
took him to such countries as mauritania, Nigeria, Cameroon,
Zambia, Malawi, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Lesotho and
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"I was greatly moved by the picturesque scenery and the simple
and traditional customs of the native African peoples.
</P>
<P>
"The African people, either in Morocco and Mali, or in Tanzania
and Angola, are very amiable," said Li, who has received generous
help from various people in his some 30,000-kilometer journey by
bicycle cross the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Wherever he went, he showed the people the photos he had taken
during his African tour, including the Masais in Kenya and the
Kimbundo and Ovimbundo people living in Angola, saying that "all
of them smiled to me and helped me whenever I was in hot water."
</P>
<P>
During the journey, Li went through all kinds of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He suffered from malaria for six times, which trapped him for
several days in a hospital in Cameroon. In Tanzania, he was
attacked by the tse-tse fly, which is considered as the main cause
of the sleeping disease. "They were flying around me, staying in
my hands, forehead and neck," Li recalled, adding that "for many
times, I thought I would be put to sleep and never wake up, but
finally I carried through the difficulties".
</P>
<P>
In some places where he could not get gas as fuel for his mini-
stove, Li had to do chumping and light a fire for cooking. But he
said that it's "true life" for a man with an ambition to know and
conquer the world.
</P>
<P>
Li also crossed some warring areas, including some in Angola
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"War has destroyed everything," said the bicyclist, adding that
in the DRC, "the war has hindered the maintenance and
reconstruction of the roads. On some roads, a truck can only run
at a speed of some 50 kilometers a day."
</P>
<P>
Li Yuezhong, a native of Tangshan city in China's Hebei
Province, was fond of travel in his twenties. He traveled on foot
from his hometown Tangshan in northern China to Hangzhou in
eastern part of the country in 1980s. Moreover, He also traveled
by bike some 25,000 kilometers through 19 Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
He began his round-the-world journey in March, 1997 from
Bulgaria, where he had operated a Chinese restaurant, which was
sold in the year.
</P>
<P>
The globetrotter said: "I managed the restaurant only for
raising funds for realizing my dream of traveling around the world.
"
</P>
<P>
From March, 1997 to January, 1999, he bicycled cross 26
European countries and three Asian countries. On January 16, 1999,
he left Spain for Morocco, starting his one-year-and-a-half
journey to Africa.
</P>
<P>
During the journey, the changeable weather, disease threats,
varied conditions in different countries and some other
difficulties made him look tired. But, he was still in high
spirits and determined to attain his final goal.
</P>
<P>
As for his future journey, Li said that it will continue to be
fantastic. According to his plan, Li will spend one year or so in
Latin America, where he will visit Cape Froward, the southernmost
point of the South American continent.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Caribbean countries and the North American
continent, Li plans to return to his motherland China.
</P>
<P>
"I set China as the destination of my round-the-world trip
because I miss and love my hometown," he said with certainty.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reassesses DRC Strategy Over "Obstacles" to Peacekeeper Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
reassessing its strategy in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
due to "repeated obstacles" caused by the government preventing
the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers, a U.N. spokesman said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We're reassessing our positions in the DRC." U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said, adding that "The planned U.N. mission for the
Democratic Republic of Congo has met repeated obstacles to its
deployment from the beginning."
</P>
<P>
The DRC government has "denied us the right to deploy armed
peacekeepers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations suspended the deployment of a Tunisian unit
meant to be the first sent to the DRC. after President Laurent
Kabila publicly stated that U.N. soldiers should not be sent to
the northwestern cities of Kinshasa and Mbandaka.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan discussed the situation with
advisors this week and will report to the U.N. Security Council
shortly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said earlier this week, "The deployment of the
Tunisian unit cannot take place unless the government provides the
necessary guarantees of cooperation required by it."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on February 24 authorized an
increase of the U.N. force to 500 military observers and some 5,
000 troops to protect them and provide logistics.
</P>
<P>
The deployment is conditional on the fighting subsiding, as
called for in peace accord signed in Lusaka, capital of Zambia,
last summer, which also included requests for a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The force was to set up operations at four bases -- at Kindu
and Kisangani in rebel-held territory and Mbuji-Mayi and Mbandaka
in government-controlled regions. The Tunisian group was to set up
a headquarters in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission comprises some 228 military observers and
military liaison officers in and around the DRC, including 200 in
the central African country itself.
</P>
<P>
In DRC's many-sided war, Rwanda and Uganda are backing rival
rebel groups fighting against the Kabila government, supported by
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wireless Subscribers Reach 100 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 26 (Xinhua) -- There are 100 million wireless
subscribers in the United States, 36 percent of the U.S.
population, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (
CTIA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Cell phones have changed the way Americans live, providing
them with convenience, productivity and a sense of security," said
the international association for the wireless telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry continues to grow at the rate of more than 67,000
new wireless subscribers every day, said the association, adding
that the American customers have choices with 86 percent of them
choosing between three or more wireless carriers.
</P>
<P>
The rate at which cell phones have penetrated the U.S. market
is nearly unrivaled, according to CTIA. The first cell phone
became commercially available in 1983. Yet it took 91 years for
landlines to reach 100 million customers and 54 years for
televisions to reach 100 million households. Automobiles,
meanwhile, took 68 years to 100 million homes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cell phones have also served as an added boost to the U.S.
economy. Business people can now be in touch anytime, anywhere --
increasing productivity. In addition, CTIA said, the wireless
industry is responsible for more than a million full- and par-time
jobs. But wireless phones' most important contribution may be to
the safety of everyday Americans. According to the association,
cell phones are used to make emergency calls 118,000 times a day,
CTIA said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Urges Children's Rights Violators to Be Held Accountable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The head of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Carol Bellamy, Wednesday called
on the U.N. Security Council to ensure that all those who violate
children's rights in times of war -- whether governments, rebel
groups or corporations -- are held accountable.
</P>
<P>
"We have far too often said that we will not permit children
to be raped, mutilated, hurt and forced to lose their childhood,"
Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet time and time again we have stood and watched helplessly -
- in Rwanda, in Sierra Leone, in Sudan, in Afghanistan, in Kosovo
and East Timor -- while cruelty and indifference prevailed," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy made the statement at an open Security Council debate
on children and armed conflict, which is prompted by a report by U.
N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last Friday. The 15-nation Council
is expected to pass a new resolution on the issue next week.
</P>
<P>
"Where warring parties or others violate the provisions of any
resolution, UNICEF urges Council Members to speak out,
collectively and individually, to make it clear that violators are
overstepping the bounds of acceptable behavior," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy asked that the resolution include a range of critical
interventions to assist and protect children, such as the rapid
restart of education programs to help restore and a sense of
normality for traumatized children, as well as to reduce the
chance of recruitment of child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she also urged the Council to stress the need for
special demobilization programs for child soldiers, landmines
awareness programs, and the protection of hospitals, schools and
other sites where children are likely to be found.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimates that more than two million children have died
as a result of war in the last decade and another 12 million have
been left homeless. Landmines kill or injure as many as 500
children each month.
</P>
<P>
At least 300,000 children under 18 are involved in more than
30 armed conflicts worldwide. All children in affected societies
suffer from the direct and indirect consequences of war.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said she was encouraged by progress since the Security
Council adopted its first resolution on children in conflict
almost a year ago. She applauded the Optional Protocol to the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the General
Assembly in May, which raises the minimum age for compulsory
recruitment into the armed forces from 15 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
She urged governments to ratify the Optional Protocol as
quickly as possible, and noted that the U.N. Millennium Summit, to
be convened in September in the U.N. headquarters in New York,
offered an opportunity to do so.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is helping in more than 25 war-affected countries to
restart schools, supply drugs and vaccines, reunite children with
their families, operate clinics and hospitals, support traumatized
children, dig wells, campaign against child recruitment, and
promote demobilization and disarmament.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The British Airways Wednesday
resumed flights of its Concorde passenger jets following thorough
safety checks of its fleet.
</P>
<P>
An Air France Concorde crashed on Tuesday near Paris, killing
113 people.
</P>
<P>
Passengers traveling on a BA flight from Heathrow to New York
on Wednesday were offered a refund and transfer to a Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
But the majority were happy to travel on the BA flight, with
only 29 of the 78 people due to fly opting to swap, the BBC
reported.
</P>
<P>
BA ran comprehensive checks on its Concorde fleet focusing on
the planes engines, ahead of its decision to resume flights.
</P>
<P>
Air France Concorde flights remain suspended following the
crash.
</P>
<P>
Officials from BA spent Tuesday night liaison with Air France
technical experts before deciding to resume BA Concorde services.
</P>
<P>
Senior BA managers canceled two Concorde services - the BA003
from Heathrow to New York and the BA004 return journey -two hours
after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Air France vice president Christopher Korenke said its five
remaining planes would be grounded until further notice.
</P>
<P>
Three British air accident investigators have traveled to
France to help French authorities investigate the crash.
</P>
<P>
A Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman said it was "
inappropriate" to take any action over UK Concordes until the
French authorities reveal the findings of their investigations.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Warns To Grant Concessions in Esequibo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel explained that
Guyana has granted concessions for oil and timber exploitation
that violate the Geneva Convention that regulates the relations
between both countries, conditioned by the territorial reclamation.
</P>
<P>
"If they insist in that policy, we are going to grant oil
concessions," said the foreign minister before reaffirming that
Venezuela will ask the U.S. government to stop the construction
of a satellite launching base in the Esequibo.
</P>
<P>
"We will recur to the U.S. authorities because the perfecting
of the contract depends on them," said the Venezuelan foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has been claiming sovereignty over the Esequibo since
the end of the 19th century, a strip of 156,000 square kilometers
that runs along its northeastern border, and that represents 70
percents of the Guyana territory.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister complained that the Venezuelan governments
of the last 10 years had put aside the Guyana problem, and
announced its "reactivation" to try to find "a formula of

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said on Wednesday that he believed the European Union(
EU) would be ready for its enlargement in 2003, the Czech News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his Czech counterpart Jan Kavan, Cook said
setting EU enlargement date would be a strong motivating factor
for both the EU and the candidate countries. However, he didn't
expect the target date to be set in the coming Summit, where
candidates had hoped they would be given a concrete date of
completion of the accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that accession talks mainly depended on how
quickly the candidates managed to take on European legislation. He
said that each candidate for EU membership should be assessed
separately according to its progress.
</P>
<P>
Kavan said his opinions were fully identical with Cook's idea
of a scenario of EU enlargement. He added that the British-Czech
Action Plan, which was presented by the two ministers today, would
help the Czech Republic in its integration into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cook also held talks with Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman
today.Zeman said that Cook's visit would be a good signal not only
for EU enlargement, but also for increasing British investments
here.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, together with Poland, Hungary, Slovenia,
Estonia and Cyprus, are members of fast-track candidates for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
Cook arrived here today on a daylong visit to the Czech
Republic.He last visited the nation in November 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Harrods boss Mohamed al-Fayed
Wednesday failed in his latest court battle for a British passport.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday that Home Secretary Jack
Straw was not being unreasonable when he decided al-Fayed had a "
general defect in his character" and refused him UK citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fayed had argued that Straw had been biased when he refused
him a passport in May last year and said that his decision should
be quashed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fayed, 66, was first refused citizenship by then Home
Secretary Michael Howard in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He lost the last round of his battle with Straw last October,
when a High Court judge declared that the home secretary did not
act unfairly or with bias in deciding not to grant him a UK
passport.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fayed's four children are all UK citizens and his brother,
Ali has been granted naturalization.
</P>
<P>
His business interests include the world-famous London store
and Fulham Football Club, in which he has invested millions of
pounds in the hope of getting the west London club into the
English Premiership.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin Urges Lift of Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Wednesday urged an earliest lift of the U.N. economic sanctions
against Iraq, reaffirming Russia's opposition to the continuing U.
S. and British bomb attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has always opposed military strikes against Iraq and
has always supported Iraq, including at the United Nations," Putin
told reporters before a meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, who arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Russia will make further efforts to get sanctions on Iraq
lifted in an early day, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Putin, Aziz expressed the hope that Iraq
and Russia "will be together." He handed Putin a message from
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, which mentioned the actuality of
bilateral cooperation and the situation in Iraq, Sergei Prikhodko,
chief of the Kremlin staff, told the press after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both sides vowed to improve Russian-Iraqi economic cooperation
from current standstill, Prikhodko said, adding that a new leader
of the Russian-Iraqi intergovernmental commission will be
appointed to expand the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Aziz also discussed the need for convening an
international conference on settling the situation surrounding
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the political dialogue on Iraq must be
intensified and Russia's role in the Middle East settlement should
be stepped up. This will help to settle the problems in the region,
said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and
Aziz discussed the issues of bilateral economic cooperation,
especially the cooperation in the spheres of oil, natural gas and
electric power.
</P>
<P>
Russia intends to further expand its cooperation with Iraq and
is doing all it can to enhance cooperation with Iraq under
existing agreements, Kasyanov told Aziz.

<P>
LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) - Business confidence among
manufacturers in Britain is falling at the fastest rate for 18
months, according to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
In its quarterly survey of industrial trends released Wednesday,
the CBI said both business confidence and optimism over exports
were plummeting.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 percent of manufacturers were less optimistic
than four months ago, and only 11 percent more confident. This
gave an overall figure of -10 percent, as opposed to -2 percent in
April.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said manufacturers expected orders to keep on falling
over the next four months, with expectations at their lowest since
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the survey, CBI spokesman Nick Reilly said: "
Manufacturing is faltering and risks slipping back into a downturn.
Orders, output and confidence have all fallen for the second
survey in a row."

LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Some African leaders Thursday, at a
mini-summit of the Economic Community of West African States in
the Liberian capital Moronvia, called on intensified efforts for a
peaceful solution to the crisis in northern Liberia and Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by leaders including current Chairman
Gnassingbe Eyadema of the Organization of African Unity, host
President Charles Taylor, Gambian President Yaya Jameh and
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, focused on situation in
northern Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Moronvia said the leaders were
unanimous in their position that peace was crucial in this region
and beyond, if Africa wanted to have any meaningful development.
</P>
<P>
But the reports also quoted a Liberian official as expressing
regret at the meeting for the absence of Guinea leader.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the Guinea leader was not able to
attend the meeting, which would have afforded us a great
opportunity to discuss one-by-one the problems of insurgency
elements along our borders," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has been accusing Guinea of backing dissidents
currently fighting government troops in the north of the country,
a charge that the Guinea government repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
With the advance of rebel forces, the Liberian government has
recently declared a state of emergency in the northern Lofa county
along its border with Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Condoms Save 500,000 Ugandans From AIDS Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Over half a million Ugandans are
protected from HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
every year by using condoms, the Monitor daily reported here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 70 million condoms are distributed in Uganda annually and
a new female condom will soon be launched, according to Judith
Butagira, a health official in the country.
</P>
<P>
Half a million female condoms will be distributed, first
through pharmaceutical companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was one of the three African countries hailed for
successfully combating AIDS. Commonly using condoms is believed
to be one of the major factors to curb the AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the number of people infected
with HIV/AIDS in the country has dropped sharply from over 30
percent of the total population in the 1980s and early 1990s to
the current 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the number of people using contraceptives
is still very low in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has led to the
rapid population increase and the wide spread of the AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Only 18 percent of couples in the region use contraceptives
compared with about 70 percent in the western world.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's External Debt at Around 4.7 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's external debt currently
stands at 348.6 billion shillings (about 4.7 billion U.S. dollars),
the state-run Kenya Times newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The debt is 28.6 billion shillings (about 38.6 million dollars)
more than the approved amount of 320 billion shillings (about 4.32
billion dollars), according to the External Loans and Credit Act
of the Laws of Kenya, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo Wednesday disclosed the
figure to the parliament when he initiated debate that sought the
parliament's approval to increase the total indebtedness for the
time being from 320 billion shillings to 500 billion shillings (
about 6.77 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Okemo explained that the increase of debt ceiling was a result
of the continued fluctuation of the Kenya shilling against the
hard currencies in which Kenyan loans are borrowed.
</P>
<P>
He said most loans are borrowed in form of dollars and Japanese
yen, adding that in future, Kenya may be required to borrow in one
dominant foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling on loans to be increased is to accommodate new
loans intended to be borrowed from Kenya's development partners,
for giving priorities to development programs in the country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tourism Suffers Great Loss in Ticket Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)
loses 100 million shillings (about 1.33 million U.S. dollars)
annually in entrance fees due to cheating on tickets at its
national parks, the country's major newspaper Daily Nation
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drivers of tour companies and game rangers who charged at
park gates colluded to defraud the KWS, Uhuru Kenyatta, chairman
of the Kenya Tourist Board, said on Wednesday at the Lake Nakuru
Park when launching the KWS SmartCard ticketing system.
</P>
<P>
Stealing entry fees, tickets recycling, undercharging were some
methods used in the ticket scam, according to Kenyatta.
</P>
<P>
The new computerized system, which costs the KWS 105 million
shillings (about 1.4 million dollars), is expected to stop the
theft of KWS revenue, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collection at the Nairobi National Park had increased
by 40 percent since the new ticketing system was introduced a
month ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
The KWS began to implement the SmartCard electronic system in
late June. Six major parks out of 56 national parks are included
for the new ticketing program.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Output Drops by 12 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea production in June
stood at 17.28 million kilograms, down 12.12 percent from the 19.
68 million kg harvested over a year ago, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The output for the first half of this year also dropped to 108.
65 million kg, representing a decrease of 7.95 percent as against
the same period in 1999, according to the Tea Board of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to the continued drought and frost during the last six
months of this year it is likely that the earlier total crop
output forecast of 260 million kg might not be realized," said
Stephen Nkanta, managing director of the board.
</P>
<P>
The drought in Kericho in the Rift Valley and frost in other
major tea-growing areas in central Kenya had hampered the
production.
</P>
<P>
Prices had remained strong due to the shortage of tea, with the
average price for the month standing at 2.10 U.S. dollars per kg,
compared with the 1.83 dollars per kg posted last year.

movements will present on August 2 to the Supreme Electoral Court
(TSE) more than 500,000 signatures requesting that organization to

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Pays 12 Million US Dollars to Close Tax Fraud Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The tax problems of Luciano Pavarotti
appeared to be at an end Wednesday, after the world renowned opera
singer handed over 25 billion lire (about 12.5 million U.S.
dollars)in evaded taxes to the Italian Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The costly finale came after forty days of plea-bargaining and
avoided the prospect of the star having to stand trial on tax
fraud charges, Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
In April, Bologna prosecutors asked for Pavarotti's indictment,
charging that he evaded Italian taxes by falsely claiming to be
resident in Montecarlo. They also ordered him to pay a fine of 10
billion lire (about 5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Pavarotti will meet with Finance Minister
Ottaviano Del Turco to discuss the details of his mega-payment.
</P>
<P>
Pavarotti said in a television interview afterwards that he was
pleased that "a legal case which has made me very bitter" had
finally come to an end but was unhappy about having to "open up my
purse strings to the tune of billions."

<HEADLINE> Annan Says First "Global Compact" Initiative Off to Good Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Wednesday that first high-level meeting of the "
Global Compact" had been very stimulating and that the
participants had agreed to a number of steps to take the "Global
Compact" further.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the conclusion of the meeting,
Annan said "We are off to a good start," noting that the progress
made at the meeting would help make the Compact truly global and
operational.
</P>
<P>
First initiated by the Secretary-General at the World Economic
Forum in Davos in January 1999, the "Global Compact" challenges
world business leaders to promote and apply nine widely accepted
principles drawn from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the International Labor Organization's Fundamental Principles on
Rights at Work and the Rio Principles on environment and
development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brought together nearly 50 leaders from global
business, international movement and civil society.
</P>
<P>
Annan said "Companies have great influence, great reach and
they can set very good examples."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the United Nations was trying to implement
values that already have been negotiated and agreed to by business.
</P>
<P>
"We are not trying to create anew code of conduct, but to put
teeth into existing standards," he added.

ROME, July 26 (Xinhua) -- As many as 222,000 new jobs may be
created in Italy next twelve months, with a real employment boom
in the widely jobless south, a study of company job needs by the
Italian Union of Chambers of Commerce said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rapidly improving employment already seems likely to enable the
center-left government to achieve its pledge of a million jobs in
the five years of the present legislature.
</P>
<P>
Now the report said companies expect jobs to rise by 2.3
percent and by 3.9 percent in the south, whereas over 70,000 may
succeed in
finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the last twelve months, the rise in employment for the whole
country totaled 86,547 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast employment growth of 2.6 percent in the
Italian northeast, 2 percent in central Italy, and 1.4 percent in
the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Medium and large companies are expected to go on losing jobs,
but very small companies with less than 10 employees are expected
to rise by 5 percent (132,000 jobs).

BRUSSELS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Rail has said that the
Brussels international airport will not be linked to the European
high-speed train network before the year of 2008, local press said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Rail, the state-owned railway company, explained that
linking the airport to the network is technically feasible now,
but would mean that a dozen domestic services would have to be
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
The railway company intends to wait until a new link is built
between the Brussels airport and the Brussels-Antwerp line, which
could take a further eight years, according to railway officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the airport authorities and Belgian flag carrier
Sabena set great store by a link to the high-speed train metwork,
which they say is vital for competitive position of the country's
largest airport.
</P>
<P>
Currently, airports in Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London
already have or will soon have links to the European high-speed
network.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unveils Measures Against Steel Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government unveiled
Wednesday a new campaign against unfair trade practices of
foreign steel producers.
</P>
<P>
A 240-page report released by Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta
outlined an initiative to step up the pace and scope of measures
against foreign steel imports deemed to harm U.S. steelmakers.
</P>
<P>
The document is part of a Steel Action Program that President
Bill Clinton launched last year following what U.S. officials
described as a flood of cheap steel imports in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The tide of imports was attributed to a global financial crisis
at the time as well as market-distorting practices in Russia,
Japan, South Korea, Brazil and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
While cheap steel imports on the U.S. market jumped 33 percent
in 1998 over 1997, average prices for finished steel products in
the country fell dramatically, forcing plant closings and
thousands of layoffs, according to Mineta.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy pressure from an alliance of steel companies and
unions, the administration took steps to stem the flow, notably by
imposing punitive duties.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest lesson we learned from the recent steel crisis is
the need for early warnings and quick responses," Mineta said.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department proposed a six-point plan to deal with
future steel crises.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the department will provide early warnings of
import surges or changes in industry conditions, expedite "anti-
dumping" investigations that could lead to the imposition of
punitive tariffs on unfairly priced imports, and establish an
interagency team to coordinate a rapid response.
</P>
<P>
The government also will "vigorously engage" key steel
producers such as Japan, South Korea, Russia and Brazil on market
distorting practices, seek a moratorium on lending from
multilateral development banks that adds to global capacity in the
steel industry, as well as work with the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development to eliminate structural constraints to
fair steel trade.

<HEADLINE> Moldova's GDP to Drop by 7 Percent in 2000: IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP)
of Moldova will drop by 7 percent in 2000 as a result of the
drought, and meanwhile, the annual inflation rate will be 17-18
percent, the Moldovan Basa-press news agency quoted on Wednesday
regional director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)Richard
Haas as saying.
</P>
<P>
In earlier 2000, the National Bank of Moldova and the Finance
Ministry forecast a 2-percent rise in the GDP and a 26-percent
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of the IMF two-week
mission to Chisinau, Richard Haas said in 2001 the GDP of Moldova
will rise by five percent and the annual inflation will drop by
ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Based on these parameters, the IMF mission signed with the
Chisinau government an agreement on the 2000 budget that,
according to Haas, will be "financed from interior resources".

international scene in a speech on Wednesday given to ambassadors
of the country gathered here from around the world.

Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini echoed Amato's words and
stressed that foreign policy was also of growing importance to
Italy in terms of the country's competitiveness.

CARACAS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan electoral campaigns for
July 30 voting closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two main candidates to the presidency of Venezuela will
measure their popularity in the streets of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent president and candidate Hugo Chavez will start his
tour of Caracas in Bolivar Avenue toward the west of the capital
city and will end it with a speech before thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
His rival for the presidency and closest contender in the
opinion polls Francisco Arias Cardenas will tour Caracas along
Francisco de Miranda Avenue, and will end it with a speech for his
followers
</P>
<P>
Chavez is widely expected to win the presidential election
thanks to continued popularity among the poor, who made up the
vast majority of Venezuela's 24 million population.
</P>
<P>
But support for Chavez has been dented by the challenge from
Arias, who is supported by business groups and minor political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Backed by strong support among the South American country's
poor majority, Chavez holds a lead of around 20 percentage points
over his closest rival in the presidential race, according to
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Elected in a December 1998 landslide victory Chavez has ruled
virtually unopposed since taking office in February 1999.
