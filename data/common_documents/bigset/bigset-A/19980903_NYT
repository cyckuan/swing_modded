ATHLETICS SHUT OUT YANKEES, 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees talked casually about wnning their 100th
game of the regular season because they have long expected to do it
and because they have almost a month to get the one victory
necessary to reach the lofty total. Like every other milestone this
relaxed team has conquered, the Yankees treated the pursuit in a
businesslike fashion. There is no need to get too excited, they
stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was no reason at all for the Yankees to get too
excited on Wednesday night as a pitcher named Gil Heredia made them
look like impostors in guiding the Oakland Athletics to a 2-0
victory at Yankee Stadium. So the 100th victory celebration, which
was not going to be a celebration for the Yankees anyway, will have
to wait until at least Friday night, when they play the White Sox
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long night of anticipating for the Yankees and their
fans because the start of the game was delayed 2 hours 14 minutes
by rain. After it finally started, the A's scored what seemed like
a harmless run off David Cone (18-5) in the first inning and
surprisingly held tight to the lead behind Heredia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, if they win on Friday, the Yankees will still
reach 100 victories in the fifth fewest games in history and will
do it faster, in terms of the calendar date, than any other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get to 100, we will go ahead and try and do something
else,'' Paul O'Neill said. ``It's not like our goal was to win 100
games by Sept. 2. Our goal is to win the division and eventually
win the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday night, the Yankees are still at 99-38. Cone
pitched a marvelous game in stifling the A's on one run and four
hits, while striking out 10 in seven innings, but he failed to win
his major league-best 19th game for the third time as Heredia
baffled the Yankees in his second start since Sept. 28, 1996. The
32-year-old right-hander did not allow a run and gave up five hits
and no walks in seven and two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem like a positive sign for Heredia when he
dispatched one of the bat boys to the Yankee clubhouse to ask the
players to autograph a baseball for him. It was an unusual request
and it seemed as if it might be arduous for Heredia to oppose a
team he revered enough to ask for autographs. But Heredia was not
awed and he did not surrender a hit in four at-bats with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities against Heredia, who spent most of the last
two years in the minors, were scant. Bernie Williams doubled off
the right-center-field fence with two outs in the fourth, but Tino
Martinez grounded back to Heredia. Scott Brosius lined a one-out
double in the eighth but never budged. Derek Jeter poked a two-out
single in the sixth, but Heredia picked him off first.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had to wait more than two hours to throw the first pitch, a
painstaking amount of time for any starting pitcher. It was
probably disruptive for Cone, who purposely does not arrive at the
ball park until 90 minutes before games he pitches because he gets
too antsy.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game started at 9:49 p.m., with most of the soggy fans
still waiting for the Yankees to pursue their 100th, Cone delighted
them by striking out Jason Mc Donald. But Ryan Christenson made
sure that Cone would not chase perfection, as David Wells did the
night before, by singling. Jason Giambi hit a ball that bounced off
the grass and shot past Martinez at first base to advance
Christenson to third, and Matt Stairs's tapper to second was hit
too slow to turn a double play, so the A's had a 1-0 lead.
Christenson homered off Mike Stanton in the eighth for Oakland's
other run.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yanks were concerned about Cone, who had allowed 10
earned runs in his last two starts, there was no need to be
worried. He retired 20 of the last 24 batters he opposed,
registering nine strikeouts in that stretch to keep the
soggy-turned-groggy fans awake.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees could not score, so their 100th victory was
delayed.

HAWKS SHOW AT LEAST FIVE REASONS FOR FANS TO BELIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ So they're alive and kicking. Your 1998
Seattle Seahawks have told you all about that.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Adams, the defensive tackle with his eyes buggin', stars in
those TV ads and all but taunts you to get on board the Hawk
bandwagon. And you know Paul Allen is paying the tab and the money
man is personally stoking the engine.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still a hitch. Four days until the opener of another
season dripping with expectation, you don't know whether you should
believe. You don't know whether you should commit.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Seahawks going to be good as they should be? Or is the
ghost of ex-special teams' coach Dave Arnold going to haunt this
franchise, spooking some other aspect of the team to go
embarrassingly haywire and kill yet another season so full of
promise, so full of expectation?
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are begging you to get alive and kicking with them.
And there you are, unsure whether to take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   I understand your pain. Which is why it was time Wednesday to
make one last preseason foray to Seahawkland, stand at the edge of
the practice field and wait for the players to run off. Time to get
a final preseason look and make a determination about what's fair
to ask of these Hawks, what's fair to expect.
</P>
<P>
   And then they came running at me _ more ``You Gotta Love These
Guys'' types than the Mariners can shake a stick at. Big-name
players. Free agents and imports and veterans who are talking about
a certain ``cockiness'' the Hawks have not known since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And one by one, it seemed clear that there are ample reasons to
go ahead and make the commitment to the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Brian Habib. One look and it's clear the Hawks'
offensive line is better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran guard will be the key to the wars that must be won
in the trench, both for the protection of quarterback Warren Moon
and to uncork the upgraded Seahawk running game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, exiting the field, Chad Brown. He is another reason you
can comfortably call yourself a Seahawk believer.
</P>
<P>
   The dominating linebacker now has a new director in Jim Johnson
_ a coach who is going to let Brown line up all over the field this
season. Brown, the former Pro Bowler, will be given the green light
to go at opposing offenses from so many different angles, opponents
will need a prism to figure out where the blitz is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Brown was rendered almost useless by defensive
schemes that failed to make use of his quickness. This year, it
should be a return to the 13-sack season of Brown's heyday in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Ricky Watters. Braided hair and eyes dancin' almost as
quick as his feet. He is the other guy who should make you put your
trust and faith in the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The flashy back wearing No. 32 is going to be the primary ball
carrier for the Hawks _ not to mention the primary fire-breather.
(Think we'll miss Chris Warren? Not when Watters wants the ball,
wants to block, wants to lead and wants to rap.)
</P>
<P>
   Watters, despite the ongoing and silly rap against his fiery
nature, is not going to be an attitude problem. He is going to be
THE ATTITUDE. And he is going to be the key to uncorking a balanced
offense that could actually make '98 Hawks better than last year,
when they boasted the NFL's No. 3 offense.
</P>
<P>
   The more Ricky runs, the more defenses will stock the line with
eight-man fronts, which means the surprisingly unselfish Big Ricky
will be happy to let receivers Joey Galloway, James McKnight and
Mike Pritchard take on their single cover men.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to the fourth reason to put your faith in the
Hawks: Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   If Dennis Erickson and offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski
don't insist on Galloway getting the chance to catch 100 passes
this season, then heads will have to roll. Galloway had 72 catches
last season (and nine of those we-know-it's-coming reverses.)
</P>
<P>
   This is the year of the Buckeyes, since Galloway's former
college team is picked No. 1 to win a national title. And this is
the year of the Hawks' major Buckeye, too, since Galloway will be
turned loose, or else.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to reason No. 5 why the Hawks are worth kicking
with in '98: Warren Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Moon did not start Game 1 last season against the
Jets. Moon was the backup on the dead-out-of-the-gate Seahawks _
the team that was absolutely stunned by the pouncing Jets, 41-3, in
that demoralizing opener.
</P>
<P>
   With Moon in the pocket from the start, and with Watters running
and blocking for him, there is no way the Hawks come out flat
Sunday in Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those first three or four series are going to be very
important for us because Philadelphia plays well at home,'' Moon
said Wednesday, showing he already knows what to expect and how the
Hawks should counter.
</P>
<P>
   Moon is right. Not letting the first quarter or the first game
or the season get out of hand is crucial for the Hawks. And we have
all been here before, perched on the edge of a new season where the
coaches and the players all insist we should believe like they do.
</P>
<P>
   This time, if all the big fellas who filed by can do what they
can do, there's no reason not to take the plunge.
</P>

SWISSAIR PLANE LOST IN OCEAN OFF NOVA SCOTIA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is now the off-lead article on The New
York Times front page)  (sw) 
 By DAVID CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Swissair plane carrying more than 220 passengers and crew
crashed late on Wednesday night south of Halifax, Nova Scotia,
while on a flight from Kennedy International Airport in New York to
Switzerland, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses and early reports indicated that the plane had
crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, seven miles off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian television reported that there were survivors but there
were no details on the number or their condition.
</P>
<P>
   One official with the Canadian Maritime Operation Center in
Halifax said that the pilot of Flight 111, reported that a fire had
broken out in the cockpit at around 10:30 p.m. Atlantic Standard
Time (9:30 p.m., ET).
</P>
<P>
   Another official, Navy Seamen Sean Kelly, a spokesman for the
Halifax Rescue Coordination Center, said that the plane, which had
been flying over the Atlantic and was carrying 227 passengers and
crew, was then instructed to veer 300 miles to the northwest to
make an emergency landing in Halifax. But airport officials lost
the plane on the radar seven nautical miles south of Peggy's Cove,
near Blandford, a fishing village known as a tourist attraction for
its rugged coastal beauty.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Thursday morning, details were sketchy, and
sometimes conflicting, about the exact course of events. Canadian
officials, for instance, said that they could not immediately
confirm reports that the plane, an MD-11, had crashed, and there
were conflicting accounts about whether the plane was bound for
Geneva or Zurich, or how many people were aboard.
</P>
<P>
   But Matt Furman, an official with the National Transportation
Safety Board, said that the plane had crashed, but that its exact
location was not known.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses reported hearing a series of frightening sounds on
what had been a placid, moonless night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an aircraft,'' said Mieke Martin, the proprietor of
the Century House Bed and Breakfast in Blandford, who was lying in
bed with her husband when the hotel began to rumble. ``It was very
low and it had irregular sounds coming from it. It didn't sound
right, like a helicopter sound, or like it was tearing the sky
apart. Seconds later it crashed. There was no explosion. It hit
like a thud. It went into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``I started to think `Oh my God. Those people.' I
knew it went in. I whispered a prayer, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   By early Thursday morning, Canadian officials had dispatched a
Hercules aircraft, two Labrador helicopters and two naval vessels
to search the area. The fishing fleet from the small island
community of 57 people was also out in force, combing the cold
Atlantic for any signs of life, or death. But with the sky
overcast, and no stars or moon to illuminate the horizon, people
involved in the rescue reported that it was hard to see to much of
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board
appeared to be working under the assumption that there had been a
crash. Officials said that the agency would dispatch an 11-member
team to Halifax at 5 Thursday morning to assist Canadian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NTSB said that if there indeed was a crash, it
was not clear whose jurisdiction it was. If it was in international
waters, the Swiss would be in charge of the investigation, because
the MD-11 was registered in that country; if it was within Canadian
territorial waters, then Canada would be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, by international treaty, the United States would
be involved in the investigation, because the plane was built in
the United States and the flight originated in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the U.S. Navy has extensive experience in
retrieving wreckage and the flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder of such planes. Those ``black boxes'' carry pingers that
are activated by water and send out audio signals so they can be
easily located.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 is built by Boeing and is prduced in Long Beach,
Calif., at its Douglas Products Division. The plane, which first
went into production in 1988, is the world's only large wide-cabin
trijet, with engines mounted on the tail and under each wing. It
features a sophisticated flight deck and advanced automatic system
controls that significantly reduces pilot workload, according to
company literature.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is a modernized version of the DC-10, which also
features the trijet configuration. It is considered the latest
generation in the family line of the DC models, which dates back to
the 30s. The name was dropped after two cataclysmic crashes in the
1970s, one in Paris in 1974, the other in Chicago in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wednesday night's flight, Terry Benczik, a spokeswoman
for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that the
plane took off at 8:19 p.m., and that ``it was a normal routine
takeoff.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The Astros came to Turner Field like a band of snipers
intent on taking their best shots at the team with the best record
in the National League.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Snipers typically take their shots from a secluded area so as
not to be discovered. That was hardly the case with the Astros, who
put their hired gun front and center for all the baseball world _
and particularly the Atlanta Braves _ to see.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson shot holes through the Braves for eight innings
and the Killer B's took target practice against Greg Maddux in a
4-2 Astros victory before a sellout crowd of 46,238 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had 10 strikeouts and held the Braves to four hits. A
cramp in his left calf kept Johnson from shooting for his fourth
complete game in seven starts with the Astros, but it was nothing
like the pain the Astros caused for Maddux on a muggy night in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Sean Berry combined for seven
hits and had a home run apiece to pace a 12-hit attack, 10 of the
hits coming off Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have played them like this last year, it would
have been a different story in the playoffs,'' Astros right fielder
Derek Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But last year, the Astros didn't have Johnson, who
offered a preview of what he is capable of doing in a big-game
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy is a marquee pitcher who can match up with anyone,''
catcher Brad Ausmus said. ``We're lucky to have him on our side.
He's been everything we bargained for and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Maddux didn't hold up his end of the bargain in the
made-for-TV pitchers' duel, he did give the Braves a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's performance might have been enough to beat most
pitchers but not Johnson _ especially when Johnson settles into a
grove, which he did Wednesday after a fitful start.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a run in the first inning and walking three
batters in the first three innings, Johnson regrouped, then
dominated. The Big Unit retired 14 of the final 15 batters he faced
before his calf cramped on his first warm-up pitch of the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is fine,'' Johnson said. ``I must have gotten
dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``It loosened
up while we (Dierker and trainer Dave Labossiere) were out there.
Randy wanted to finish the game, but we decided to get him out of
there just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he pitched a very tenacious game. In the first three
innings, they weren't swinging and missing at all. He had to fight
to keep them to that one run. Once he settled down, he was pretty
tough on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves could hardly rejoice in Johnson's exit, because that
opened the door for Billy Wagner. Wagner allowed a solo homer to
Andruw Jones but struck out the final two batters he faced to bag
his 27th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us not to make too much out of this game,''
Wagner said. ``We still haven't locked anything up.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the NL Central, which the Astros lead by 10
games. The magic number to clinch the division is 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have won 12 of their last 15 games and trail Atlanta
by three games for the best record in the NL. Wednesday's game
concluded the season series, which the Astros won 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be worried about us,'' Wagner said. ``I don't
know how they feel about us, but I know I wouldn't want to play us
in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' offense was almost non-existent in last fall's
playoff series against the Braves, but the bats came alive under
tough circumstances Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often Maddux, a four-time Cy Young Award winner, gives
up 10 hits, four runs and three homers _ it was just the second
three-homer game he has allowed in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Maddux is probably the best pitcher in baseball, along
with Roger Clemens,'' Johnson said. ``But he's human and he makes
bad pitches just like I make bad pitches. We're not invincible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more intelligent than I am, because he doesn't have
a 95- or 98-mph fastball. I would tell any pitcher who wants to be
successful to watch him, because he's the true definition of a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're different kind of pitchers, but that doesn't mean we
don't have the same type of approach out there as far as trying to
set up hitters. The one thing I have going for me is that I can
challenge the hitters in a way that he can't because of my
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident as Johnson struck out six of the last 10
batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (facing Johnson) is scary,'' said Braves third baseman
Chipper Jones, who struck out three times. ``It's a little
unnerving. He's got some 97-mph cheese coming at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves catcher Javy Lopez, who has been as pesky as a rat
against the Astros this season, took a bite of the cheese in the
first inning with a two-out RBI single to give the Braves a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tried to be patient, drawing three walks in the first
three innings, and take advantage of Johnson's high leg kick once
they got on base. Atlanta had three stolen bases, including Gerald
Williams' swipe in the first inning that set up the Braves' first
run.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell tied the game in the second with a leadoff homer to
right, and Biggio untied the score in the fifth with a two-run
homer to left.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's solo shot in the seventh put the Astros up by three
runs, which was more than enough with Johnson on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit them good,'' Maddux said. ``It was like any other
game. I don't think I was up any more or down any more than I
usually am. I was where I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio said, ``We had a lot of hits, but we didn't score a lot
of runs for the hits we had. That tells you how good Maddux is at
keeping his team in the game. But Randy gave us a better chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those guys are awesome pitchers with nasty stuff. It
was fun to be out there.''

METS BEAT PADRES, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The last thing the New York Mets could have afforded
was a second consecutive loss here on Wednesday night. Not after
the Cubs and Giants had both won earlier on Wednesday. And not with
a four-game extended weekend series coming up against the
first-place Braves, against whom the Mets are 0-5 this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Armando Reynoso _ with a lot of help from Lenny Harris,
Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza _ gave the Mets a 4-1 victory and
made sure the Mets would fly back to New York for a much-needed day
off still trailing Chicago by one game in the National League
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso (6-1) shut down the N.L. West-leading San Diego Padres
on four hits over eight innings to win for the sixth time in seven
starts this season. And Harris, Alfonzo and Piazza combined to give
him all the runs he would need with three home runs off Andy Ashby
in the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The victory enabled the Mets (77-63) to finish a grueling
nine-day, nine-game West Coast swing with a more-than-respectable
5-4 record. The victory also allowed the Mets to keep pace with the
Cubs and stay a game ahead of the Giants in the postseason chase.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco pitched a scoreless ninth for his 31st save and
390th of his career, tying him with Dennis Eckersley for second
place on the major league career list.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets erased an early 1-0 deficit with home runs by three of
their hottest hitters. Harris began the barrage with his fifth of
the season, all of them in the last 16 games, a solo shot to deep
right field that tied the game at 1-1 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   In the following inning, Alfonzo hit his 15th of the year, a
two-run shot to left. It was his fourth home run in the last five
games and put the Mets up by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Piazza drilled his 28th homer to right-center leading
off the fourth, which gave Reynoso a comfortable 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Piazza's seventh in the last 13 games. For the
nine-game road trip, he was a sizzling 15 for 28 (.536) with five
homers and 12 runs batted in. The month has only begun, but if the
the All-Star catcher can approach the September he had last season,
when he hit .406 with eight home runs and 27 runs batted in for the
Dodgers, the Mets will greatly improve their chances of reaching
the post-season for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso lowered his earned run average to 2.64 over 472/3
innings by recording all but two of his 24 outs on infield plays or
on strikeouts (he had six while walking three). The way he is
pitching, Manager Bobby Valentine will find it difficult to leave
the 32-year-old right-hander out of his playoff rotation, should
the Mets qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso allowed a two-out home run to Tony Gwynn in the bottom
of the first to give Gwynn four hits in as many at-bats since he
came back from the disabled list. But Reynoso then settled down and
outpitched the right-hander Andy Ashby (16-7), who has had three
rough outings in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso, who scored on Alfonzo's home run after grounding
sharply into a fielder's choice in the third, doubled hard off
Ashby to open the fifth. And even though Ashby _ who allowed four
runs on four hits in his five innings _ escaped the fifth without
allowing another run, Manager Bruce Bochy pinch-hit for him in the
bottom of the inning.

L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT TO LAUNCH ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Superintendent Ruben Zacarias announced that more
than two-thirds of the 100 worst-performing schools in Los Angeles
increased their test scores, then said he would be implementing a
massive districtwide accountability plan modeled on that success.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, all schools in the Los Angeles Unified School
District would be expected to show improvement on yearly
achievement tests. If they fail, they face progressive intervention
and sanctions, including staff dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been anything like this in the history of Los
Angeles Unified,'' Zacarias said after a news conference Wednesday
at an elementary school in suburban South Central. ``Why should we
be different from the private sector? It's all about
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   The reform effort is based on stringent new guidelines Zacarias
created for the 100 lowest-performing schools, including six in
L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, named on a list a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But implementation of the plan might not be as smooth as the
superintendent hopes. While the push for boosting student
performance was lauded in some quarters, Zacarias' plan was derided
by union officials.
</P>
<P>
   Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers Los Angeles, said the
plan lacks substance and was not discussed with teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came out of left field,'' he said. ``What did the
superintendent do, read some book on reform over the weekend and
make up a plan?''
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi said drastic measures proposed by Zacarias would have to
be negotiated with the union.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Brent, president of Associated Administrators of Los
Angeles, said the plan makes principals but not teachers
responsible for failure at the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against accountability, but I'm for spelling out that
everyone, including teachers, is responsible,'' Brent said. ``But
the LAUSD won't do it because the teachers will have a fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Zacarias made the campaign to boost student
performance at the 100 worst-performing schools the cornerstone of
his reform effort. The schools were required to set improvement
goals and write action plans. They were given $10 million for
remedial programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Zacarias said 68 schools raised their test scores
and 30 showed declines or no progress. ``We've seen significant
improvements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenwood Elementary School in suburban Van Nuys showed one of
the most significant leaps -- 12 percentile points.
</P>
<P>
   Principal &UR;  &LR; Diane Agliam said she and her staff have been
focusing on improving literacy for years and are starting to see a
payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone feels elated that our hard work and diligence has
shown in our test scores,'' Agliam said. ``The challenge now is to
maintain that and continue to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools where scores improved -- some bounded ahead as much
as 18 percentile points -- did so without additional money. The $10
million for remedial programs was funneled to the schools after
students took their achievement tests in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores were based on a composite of the Stanford 9
achievement test, which is a statewide test taken in English, and
its Spanish-language equivalent, the Aprenda.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were also evaluated on decreases in the dropout rate and
increases in six other performance indicators, the number of
students transferred from bilingual to English-language classes,
student attendance, teacher attendance, parent involvement, the
number of students passing college-preparatory classes and the
number of Advanced Placement classes offered.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the information has been analyzed, Zacarias outlined a
step-by-step plan for the 100 schools. The same process will be
used at the rest of the district's campuses after Zacarias and his
staff agree on details.
</P>
<P>
   The 65 campuses on the list that increased test scores and
improved on at least half of their other success indicators were
classified as ``Category 1'' schools. That included four of the six
listed schools in the San Fernando Valley: Glenwood, Broadous
Elementary, Cohasset Elementary and Maclay Middle.
</P>
<P>
   These schools will continue to receive additional resources for
another year, review what worked in their plans to share with the
rest of the district and modify areas that were not as successful.
They were given a $5,000 reward to spend on student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Category 2'' schools are campuses where scores improved, but
did not see progress on 50 percent of their seven goals. Three of
the 100 schools were in this group. None were in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``Category 3'' schools are campuses that did not
improve test scores and are placed on ``academic probation.'' Of
the 31 schools in the 100 that fell in this group, two are in the
Valley: Pacoima Elementary and Olive Vista Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Each school in this group will be required to rewrite its
academic improvement plan and get it approved by parents, as well
as the regional administrator and assistant superintendent assigned
to the area.
</P>
<P>
   The campuses have to submit a quarterly progress report and a
midterm evaluation by the assistant superintendent. They will also
continue to receive the same stipend for remedial education from
the district.
</P>
<P>
   If these schools don't improve by the end of the 1998-99 year,
they will be placed under ``receivership.'' That means their local
decision-making on budget, hiring and curricula will be suspended
and they will come under the direct supervision of the assistant
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   If improvement is not made in another year, the school will face
total reorganization, including personnel changes, Zacarias said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Roos, president of Los Angeles Educational Alliance for
Restructuring Now, applauded Zacarias' efforts, even though LEARN
tenets stress local decision-making, authority that could be lost
under the superintendent's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, some sanctions for nonperformers,'' Roos said. ``On
balance, I think this is a terrific step forward for measurable
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Governor's Office, where Pete Wilson fought
unsuccessfully for a statewide school accountability plan with
teeth, officials lauded Zacarias' plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased the district is taking the lead on reform,''
said Rich Halberg, education spokesman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget battles, Wilson withheld millions in
education funding to force lawmakers to come up with a statewide
plan. But Halberg said the legislative bill that was passed ``had
no teeth'' and was likely to be vetoed.

PEREZ STOPS PHILLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Carlos Perez is rooting for Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   So there to start the third inning of Wednesday's 6-0 victory
over the Philadelphia Phillies, Perez walked to the plate, then
stopped to watch baseball's biggest story.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange sort of pause at Dodger Stadium these days, the
nightly race between Sosa, Perez's fellow Dominican countryman, and
Mark McGwire for Roger Maris home run record that is displayed on
the video screen in left field.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive night, the game was momentarily
delayed. Sosa and McGwire combined for three homers Wednesday and
the highlights carried over into the Dodgers game.
</P>
<P>
   This is much more important than Perez's search for his first
victory as a Dodger, which he got by limiting the Phillies to just
two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is history,'' said Dodgers center fielder Raul Mondesi,
also Dominican. ``We are all watching Sammy and McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans, who numbered 32,630 on Wednesday, haven't had much
to cheer this season. But they did get the chance to watch a pretty
good game.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who entered the game with the second-worst run support in
the National League, got home runs from Matt Luke and Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   He even scored a run and got another on an RBI single by Mark
Grudzielanek, who came over with him in the July 31 trade from
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Although he walked two batters in the ninth inning, Perez got a
double-play ground ball to end the game and record his first
shutout in exactly one year.
</P>
<P>
   Perez came in with three losses and three no-decisions in six
starts with the Dodgers, but he should have won his last game.
</P>
<P>
   That was the 5-4 loss to the New York Mets last Friday, when he
gave way to Scott Radinsky in the seventh inning and Radinsky
immediately allowed a game-tying three-run homer to John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez also had battled control problems and even went to
team doctors to have his non-pitching shoulder examined.
</P>
<P>
   A week before coming to the Dodgers, Perez was involved in an
auto accident that broke his nose and injured his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It has affected his usually good control, but Wednesday, he got
ahead of hitters and walked only three.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who had three complete games with the Expos, also gave
the tired Dodgers bullpen the night off.
</P>
<P>
   Setup man Antonio Osuna is gone for the year with bone chips in
his right elbow. Mark Guthrie has a sore left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   And closer Jeff Shaw, who allowed a monster home run to Bobby
Estalella to open the ninth on Tuesday, is tired and slumping.
</P>
<P>
   Perez (8-13) allowed his first hit to second baseman Mark Lewis
with one out in the second. The other was by right fielder Kevin
Sefcik, who singled with one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Luke has been starting in right since Gary Sheffield was lost
for the season with a left ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   He was 1 for 6 with one RBI in the first two games but hit a 2-1
fastball by right-hander Tyler Green (6-9) into the right-field
stands for his 10th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added two in the fifth when Roger Cedeno, getting a
rare start in left, doubled home Perez, who walked, and scored on a
single by Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   Karros had a chance for a two-run homer in the first, but Sefcik
went back to the wall in right to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, though, Karros hit the first pitch by Phillies
reliever Mike Grace into the right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   For Karros, it was his 21st homer and 79th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers made it 6-0 in the eighth when Mondesi ripped a
two-run single past Phillies third baseman Scott Rolen.

ANGELS END TRIP WITH WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It was supposed to be the road trip from hell, but
the Angels returned home with their halo intact even though one of
them clipped a wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels routed the Cleveland Indians 13-5 before a sellout
crowd of 43,200 at Jacobs Field on Wednesday night, completing
their trip to New York, Boston and Cleveland with a 6-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   They left town Aug. 23 with a 2{-game lead over the Texas
Rangers in the AL West, took three of five from the Yankees, two of
three from the Red Sox, split two with the Indians and maintained
that 2{-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   About the only bad news for the Angels was the hamstring injury
suffered by Darin Erstad in the first inning Wednesday. Erstad was
on the disabled list Aug. 4-18 with a strained left hamstring, and
he re-injured the same hamstring in the same spot running to first
base on a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who grabbed the back of his leg and appeared to be in
severe pain as he hobbled to first on what would have been a
double, will be examined by Dr. Lewis Yocum today. Trainer Ned
Bergert said he could not estimate how long Erstad will be out
until after Erstad is examined and has an MRI.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Erstad was in no mood to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I know the diagnosis, there's no use talking about it,''
he said. ``I just don't feel like talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's injury, in fact, left the entire bench quiet. It wasn't
until shortstop Gary DiSarcina spoke up that the players got their
heads back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `Let's go, we've got a game to play,''' DiSarcina said.
``It's an old subject with this team. Honestly, I'm sick of talking
about it. It's something we've grown accustomed to. It's nothing
against Darin, but let's move on. Guys have been getting hurt the
whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, however, admitted seeing Erstad's reaction had an
impact on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darin's not the type of person that shows a lot of pain,'' he
said. ``Obviously he appeared to be in pain, so the guys were in
shock over it. It's sick to say, but you've got to be professional
about it and play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Erstad's injury, the Angels come home feeling pretty
good about themselves. If there was any doubt about this team's
character, it seemed to be answered in the past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't show me anything I didn't expect, but they did
show me things you're really happy to see,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``They met all the pressure of the road trip and
didn't back off a bit. As a matter of fact, they enjoyed the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   As satisfied as they are with their performance on the trip,
Collins says it's time to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say, `OK, we had a good trip. Now what's the next
challenge?''' he said. ``That is to have a good homestand, try to
beat Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels jumped out to a big lead off Indians starter Bartolo
Colon (13-8), getting two runs in the first inning on Erstad's
single, and five more in second, including Jim Edmonds' three-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 21 hits in all, matching their season high set
June 13 against Texas. Gregg Jefferies and Randy Velarde each had
four hits, while Chris Pritchett _ filling in at first base for
Erstad _ and Edmonds had three hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   All the offense made things easy for Angels starter Steve
Sparks, who pitched into the seventh inning for the seventh time in
his past nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (9-2) gave up five runs and eight hits in 62/3 innings to
earn his sixth consecutive win, but it was bittersweet with
Erstad's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the big win and finishing up the road
trip, but it's all on a sour note,'' DH Tim Salmon said. ``That's
the one thing that's keeping this from being an exciting road trip.
This team's had a lot of experience with these kinds of things. You
kind of wonder if we play better because of the things that have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you want to have everybody out there in the last
month,'' pitcher Chuck Finley said. ``We lost me last year and what
happened to DiSar a couple years before (1995). You hope it isn't
that bad and we get him back in a couple weeks.''

SWISSAIR JET CRASHES OFF COAST OF NOVA SCOTIA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)  (sw) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Swissair plane carrying 227 passengers and crew crashed late
on Wednesday night south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, while on a flight
from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Switzerland, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses and early reports indicated that the plane had
crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, seven miles off the coast and 40
miles south of Halifax. There were conflicting reports about
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Two Halifax newspapers quoted rescue officials as saying that
bodies were pulled from the water, debris and oil slicks had been
spotted in the cold, dark waters, and that an overpowering smell of
jet fuel lingered in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hearing there are no initial signs of survivors,'' said
Bob Burgess, an editor with the Halifax Chronicle-Herald. ``They
are pulling bodies out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   One official with the Canadian Maritime Operation Center in
Halifax said that the pilot of the flight, No. 111, reported that a
fire had broken out in the cockpit at around 10:30 p.m. Atlantic
Standard Time (9:30 p.m., ET)
</P>
<P>
   Another official, Navy Seaman Sean Kelly, a spokesman for the
Halifax Rescue Coordination Center, said that the plane, which had
been flying over the Atlantic and was carrying 227 passengers and
crew, was then instructed to veer 300 miles to the northwest to
make an emergency landing in Halifax. But airport officials lost
the plane on the radar seven nautical miles south of Peggy's Cove,
near Blandford, a fishing village known as a tourist attraction for
its rugged coastal beauty.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for Swiss Air, in a statement, said that the
plane had apparently dumped fuel on its way down.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Furman, an official with the National Transportation Safety
Board in Washington, said that the plane had crashed, but that its
exact location was not known.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses reported hearing a series of frightening sounds on
what had been a placid, moonless night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an aircraft,'' said Mieke Martin, the proprietor of
the Century House Bed and Breakfast in Blandford, who was lying in
bed with her husband when the hotel began to rumble. ``It was very
low and it had irregular sounds coming from it. It didn't sound
right, like a helicopter sound, or like it was tearing the sky
apart. Seconds later it crashed. There was no explosion. It hit
like a thud. It went into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``I started to think `Oh my God. Those people.' I
knew it went in. I whispered a prayer, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   By early Thursday morning, Canadian officials had dispatched a
Hercules aircraft, two Labrador helicopters and two naval vessels
to search the area. The fishing fleet from the small island
community of 57 people was also out in force, combing the cold
Atlantic for any signs of life, or death. But with the sky
overcast, and no stars or moon to illuminate the horizon, people
involved in the rescue reported that it was hard to see to much of
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board
appeared to be working under the assumption that there had been a
crash. Officials said that the agency would dispatch an 11-member
team to Halifax at 5 on Thursday morning to assist Canadian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NTSB said that if there indeed was a crash, it
was not clear whose jurisdiction it was. If it was in international
waters, the Swiss would be in charge of the investigation, because
the MD-11 was registered in that country; if it was within Canadian
territorial waters, then Canada would be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, by international treaty, the United States would
be involved in the investigation, because the plane was built in
California and the flight originated in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the U.S. Navy has extensive experience in
retrieving wreckage and the flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder of such planes. Those ``black boxes'' carry pingers that
are activated by water and send out audio signals so they can be
easily located.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 is built by Boeing and is produced in Long Beach,
Calif., at its Douglas Products Division. The plane, which first
went into production in 1988 is the world's only large wide-cabin
trijet, with engines mounted on the tail and under each wing. It
features a sophisticated flight deck and advanced automatic system
controls that significantly reduces pilot workload, according to
company literature.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is a modernized version of the DC-10, which also
features the trijet configuration. It is considered the latest
generation in the family line of the DC models, which dates back to
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The name was dropped after two cataclysmic crashes in the 1970s,
one in Paris in 1974, the other in Chicago in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wednesday night's flight, Terry Benczik, a spokeswoman
for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that the
plane took off at 8:19 p.m., and that ``it was a normal routine
takeoff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other end was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Farmer, 57, a librarian who lives in Blandford, said she
and her husband, Fraser, 59, an engineer, heard the plane fly
overhead but paid no attention because plane noises were
commonplace in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the engine started sputtering,'' she said. ``Then there
was an explosion as it hit the water I guess although it wasn't
really a sound. It was more a big vibration as if somebody was
shaking the house.''

ERSTAD INJURES HAMSTRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Angels might be faced with losing Darin Erstad
for the rest of the regular season after the first baseman strained
his left hamstring in the first inning Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad sliced a groundball inside third and down the left-field
line to drive in the Angels' first two runs of the game. But
instead of reaching second easily with a double, he was in obvious
pain as he struggled to reach first base, holding the back of his
leg.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same hamstring Erstad injured Aug. 3 and forced him
onto the disabled list for 15 days. But Erstad's reaction Wednesday
seemed to indicate this time it was worse. He needed help off the
field from trainer Ned Bergert and pitcher Ken Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad will be examined today by Angels medical director Dr.
Lewis Yocum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good, no,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``There was a lot (of pain). It seems worse (than the injury last
month).''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Collins said Chris Pritchett and Gregg
Jefferies will split time at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what we've done all year long,'' Collins said. ``And
that is somebody will step up and get the job done. The big
difference is this is when you need your No. 1 guys. It's
September, not June. He's one of our best players on the team. We
have to hitch the wagons to somebody else and get after it.''
</P>
<P>
   No excuses: The Angels fell apart in 1995 after shortstop Gary
DiSarcina was injured, and the same thing happened last season
after injuries to Chuck Finley and Todd Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not use it as an excuse,'' DiSarcina said of Erstad's
injury. ``We played without him in August for two weeks and we can
play without him in September. We played well in August. To use it
as a crutch is stupid. It's a copout. I don't want anyone to say
`Erstad got hurt in September and we couldn't clinch without
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finley flat: The Angels are happy with the way they played on
their East Coast road trip, but it's difficult to imagine they did
it without much help from their top starting pitcher Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Though Finley received two no-decisions in his two starts on the
trip, the Angels lost both games _ 6-5 to the Yankees in 11 innings
on Aug. 28 and 7-6 to the Indians on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the two games, Finley pitched a total of 91/3 innings,
allowing eight runs and 16 hits. Hardly the numbers you'd expect
from your ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last start in New York I was tired,'' said Finley, who
pitched on three days rest against the Yankees. ``I was doing what
I could to get through it. (Tuesday) I felt great. I've got to
figure a way to get guys out. My fastball was a little flat.
There's no angle on the ball. It's flat in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley said it's a mechanical flaw that he's dealt with in the
past and can be corrected before his next start _ Sunday against
the Royals in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his occasional struggles this season, as well as being
hit twice by line drives on the mound and once in the dugout,
Finley is still among the American League's best pitchers. He ranks
third in the league with a 3.20 ERA, is tied for second in games
started with 30, is fourth in strikeouts with 186 and is ninth in
opponents' batting average at .244.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been trying to grind it out all year,'' he said.

PEREZ STOPS PHILLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Carlos Perez is rooting for Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   So there to start the third inning of Wednesday's 6-0 Dodgers
victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Perez walked to the plate,
then stopped to watch baseball's biggest story.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange sort of pause at Dodger Stadium these days, the
nightly race between Sosa, Perez's fellow Dominican countryman, and
Mark McGwire for Roger Maris' home run record that is displayed on
the video screen in left field.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive night, the game was momentarily
delayed. Sosa and McGwire combined for three homers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is history,'' said Dodgers center fielder Raul Mondesi,
also Dominican. ``We are all watching Sammy and McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans, who numbered 32,630 on Wednesday, haven't had much
to cheer this season. But they did get the chance to watch vintage
Perez (8-13).
</P>
<P>
   Perez was in search of his first victory as a Dodger, and won
with a two-hit complete-game performance.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who entered the game with the second-worst run support in
the National League, also got home runs from Matt Luke and Eric
Karros.
</P>
<P>
   He even scored a run and got another on an RBI single by Mark
Grudzielanek, who came over with him in the July 31 trade from
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Perez entered the game with three losses and three no decisions
in six starts with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped talking to the media after becoming upset with
published reports after a 12-7 loss in Atlanta on Aug. 23 that he
might be shipped to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stretch has been extremely frustrating for him,''
Grudzielanek said. ``It's an adjustment period where he has to
learn the coaches and players and they have to learn him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few games where teams have gotten to him
early and that has rattled him. He gives up one hit and everything
falls apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In last Friday's 5-4 loss to the New York Mets, Perez gave way
to Scott Radinsky in the seventh inning and Radinsky immediately
allowed a game-tying three-run homer to John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez also had battled control problems and even went to
team doctors to have his non-pitching shoulder examined.
</P>
<P>
   A week before coming to the Dodgers, Perez was involved in an
auto accident that broke his nose and injured his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It has affected his usually good control, but Wednesday, he got
ahead of most hitters and walked only two until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who had three complete games with the Expos, also gave
the tired Dodgers bullpen the night off.
</P>
<P>
   Setup man Antonio Osuna is gone for the year with bone chips in
his right elbow. Mark Guthrie has a sore left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   And closer Jeff Shaw, who allowed a monster home run to Bobby
Estalella to open the ninth Tuesday, is tired and slumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``The starters
have been great and they need to give the bullpen a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed his first hit to second baseman Mark Lewis with
one out in the second. The other was by right fielder Kevin Sefcik,
who singled with one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Luke has been starting in right since Gary Sheffield was lost
for the season with a left ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   He was 1 for 6 with one RBI in the first two games but hit a 2-1
fastball by right-hander Tyler Green (6-9) into the right-field
stands for his 10th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added two in the fifth when Roger Cedeno, getting a
rare start in left, doubled home Perez, who walked, and scored on a
single by Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   Karros had a chance for a two-run homer in the first, but Sefcik
went back to the wall in right to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, though, Karros hit the first pitch by Phillies
reliever Mike Grace into the right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   For Karros, it was his 21st homer and 79th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers made it 6-0 in the eighth when Mondesi ripped a
two-run single by Phillies third baseman Scott Rolen.

GALAXY SHUTS OUT DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With their defense, bloodied four nights
earlier, back to its dominating best, and the net no stranger to
their attack, the Los Angeles Galaxy got back on track Wednesday
night, destroying what's left of the Dallas Burn before the
smallest Rose Bowl crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-0 romp, before an announced crowd of 9,113 that appeared
half that, wasn't enough to deliver the Western Conference title
the Chicago Fire forgot to do their part but it gave the Galaxy
(21-7) a Major League Soccer record 61 points and made last
weekend's dreadful loss to Columbus just a memory.
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones, MLS's scoring leader, had a goal and an assist, and
Mauricio Cienfuegos and Carlos Hermosillo also tallied as the
Galaxy, finding plenty of space to work with all evening, hammered
the Burn to move within one victory, or one Fire loss, of claiming
its second Western regular-season crown in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the playoffs, if you drop a game, you face
elimination,'' said Danny Pea, who spearheaded a Galaxy defensive
effort that allowed the Burn (13-15, 31 points) just one shot on
target. ``At this stage of the season, that's the mentality we need
to have: Come back (from losses) and dominate. That's what we
wanted to do tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit again the defense, which surrendered perhaps a half-dozen
scoring opportunities over the span of four one-sided victories
that ended with the 3-0 loss Saturday to Columbus. The Burn, which
was missing three starters four if you count Alain Sutter, who
hasn't played since April create only two decent opportunities as
the Galaxy notched their fifth shutout of season despite losing
captain Robin Fraser to contact lens trouble in the 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games might seem easy,'' said Galaxy coach Octavio
Zambrano, ``but we have to look at every game the same and play
100percent. We have a lot to play for finishing first in the
Western Conference that's out main objective, what really
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hope of winning the West on Wednesday disappeared when
Chicago beat Miami, 3-2, on an 83rd-minute goal had it gone to
shootout, the race would have been over but L.A. can clinch it on
Saturday in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos got the first goal, his 13th of the season, in the
29th minute, with Jones picking up an assist to break a tie in the
scoring table with New England's Raul Diaz Arce. Jones' throw-in,
from deep on the left wing, found Greg Vanney streaking past Temoc
Suarez into the box. Vanney's cross found a diving Cienfuegos,
whose sharp seven-yard header caromed off goalkeeper Mark Dodd's
hands en route to the net.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo netted his fifth in the 54th minute, knocking home a
rebound after Dodd whose phenomenal play in the nets kept the score
much closer than it should have been dove to knock down a 21-yard
blast from Martin Machon.
</P>
<P>
   Jones picked up his 17th goal in 20 games giving him 46 points,
three more than Diaz Arce in the 70th, stripping Brian Haynes on
the right flank, taking the ball into the box and beating Dodd from
10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn, which was without suspended defender Chad Deering and
midfielder Jason Kreis and injured midfielder Mark Santel, fell
four points behind third-place Colorado in the West but held onto
its two-point lead over Kansas City a 3-2 loser to the Rapids for
the conference's final playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   GALAXY NOTES: Official word is expected late this week or early
next on English-language radio coverage of Galaxy games. L.A. and
One-On-One Sports (1540 AM) are on the verge of an agreement,
Galaxy general manager Danny Villanueva confirmed, for the
remainder of this season and all of the 1999 season. Wednesday's
game was to have been the first broadcast, but there were problems
with some of the contract language. If the agreement is finalized
in time, Saturday's game at Miami might be aired; otherwise, the
coverage will debut Sept.16 at San Jose. Kevin Wall and Rick Davis,
L.A.'s television announcing team, is expected to handle the radio
duties as well. ... KTNQ (1020) will continue as the Galaxy's
Spanish-language station. ... The Galaxy, its anticipated fall
schedule dead with the cancellation of Copa Merconorte, is looking
to play two home exhibitions after the MLS season is over, likely
against Mexican clubs. Three of Mexico's best America, Necaxa and
Guadalajara owe L.A. a game. Villanueva also has talked to with the
Merconorte organizers, Buenos Aires-bases Teledeportes, about
playing in tournaments in Argentina or Chile. ... Defender Paul
Caligiuri missed his second successive game after aggravating a
groin strain in training Monday.

   LONE PINE _ It's been called ``the red-headed stepchild of the
Mount Whitney Trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Long overshadowed by its neighboring world-famous hike to the
highest point in the lower 48 states, Meysan Lakes Trail is in many
ways more difficult, more pristine and certainly less traveled.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, Doug Davis of West Hills, his 14-year-old
son Sean and another backpacking companion hoofed the Meysan trail
that leads to its namesake lakes. ``It's a nice spot because it's
out of the way,'' Davis said.

   Out of the way, that is, of the masses searching for the glory
in scaling 14,494-foot Mount Whitney. Those who have trekked the
Mount Whitney Trail know it can be a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   But just a short way from the Whitney trailhead at Whitney
Portal is the outset of underappreciated _ and underestimated _
Meysan Lakes Trail. It's right there on the maps and its trailhead
is clearly flagged on Whitney Portal Road, but hikers must be
blinded to it by the daunting face of Whitney. I was as guilty as
anyone; during my two ascents of Whitney and several excursions to
the portal, I never noticed them.
</P>
<P>
   Meysan Lakes Trail was named after Felix Meysan, whose family
moved to Lone Pine in 1869 and who stocked the lakes with trout in
the 1920s. Starting at an elevation of 7,900 feet, the footpath
climbs 3,300 feet in 4.7 miles before first cresting out at
picturesque Grass Lakes, which is cradled between Lone Pine Peak,
Mounts LeConte, Mallory and Irvine and Candlelight Peak. That's an
ascent of just over 700 feet per mile.
</P>
<P>
   While much longer and higher, the 10.7-mile hump to Whitney
climbs more than 650 feet a mile. So, clearly, the Meysan Lakes
Trail is on par with its arduous brethren; and, for those planning
to attempt Whitney, it provides an excellent opportunity to
acclimate to the High Sierra's rigors and rarefied environs.
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Terry Robbins, who work on tanks at Fort Irwin
Military Reservation northeast of Barstow, found out the hard way
that Meysan Lakes Trail is strenuous. ``I tell you, it would be
neat to have something motorized to go up this thing,'' Terry
Robbins said. The pair packed in too much gear and fell well short
of their aim of camping at Meysan Lake, never reaching their goal
even on a side trip the next day.
</P>
<P>
   While the Whitney trail offers highlights such as Lone Pine
Creek, Lone Pine Lake and Mirror Lake, Meysan Lakes Trail counters
with exquisite Meysan Creek and Grass Lakes, with their mesmerizing
reflective quality and mossy perimeter that one hiker likened to
``walking in a vat of grapes.'' En route is Little Meysan Lake _
visible only from the surrounding mountains _ and 11,500-foot
Meysan Lake proper, which lies above Grass Lakes via a faint
half-mile path scratched into a rocky slope.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what Meysan Lakes Trail doesn't have is the dozens and
dozens of visitors that diminish the appeal of the Mount Whitney
Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we chose (Meysan Lakes) was that
(overnight) wilderness permits are available on fairly short
notice,'' Davis said. In fact, the Robbinses secured a backcountry
camping document the day before their journey; that's practically
unheard of for a Whitney trail permit, for which day-trippers and
backpackers alike must often apply six months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   From Whitney Portal's lower campground, the Meysan Lakes Trail
rises quickly past scrub oak, sage and an impressive set of summer
houses. Meysan Creek carves a deep and narrow gulch far below the
course of 96 switchbacks that direct followers to Grass Lakes. The
creek's cool flows are enticing as the reflective heat from the
canyon's granite cliffs fills the air upon entering the John Muir
Wilderness. Trees thicken initially before they thin out at higher
elevations; Davis spotted various firs and lodgepole, Jeffrey and
foxtail pines before he and his son scaled 12,944-foot Lone Pine
Peak, which, from Whitney's summit, appears as a solitary and
stalwart sentry.
</P>
<P>
   At a shady spot in the trail, our hiking trio met a group of
four returning from a two-day fishing trip to Meysan Lake. There
they landed 63 brook trout on two rods, releasing all but six that
wound up in the frying pan. Most were caught on Super Duper, Mepps,
Kastmaster lures and measured in the 11- to 12-inch range,
according to Darrell Sausser of Riverside. ``I thought they were a
little smaller,'' quipped fellow Riverside resident John Young.
``We got to get our stories straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Trout do tend to get bigger on the way home, I told them.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of Indian paint brush give way to precipitous talus as
the trail makes its final push to Grass Lakes. Here the vantage of
13,700-foot Mount Irvine, with its telltale pyramid silhouette, is
unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Break for lunch, then it's a speedy excursion back to the
portal, with expansive views of the Owens Valley and the Alabama
Hills along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 people were passed on the Meysan Lakes Trail during our
six-hour adventure. It may not have the glory of the Mount Whitney
Trail, but it doesn't have the glitz, either.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GOING &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Meysan Lakes Trailhead is found at Whitney Portal, 12 miles
west of Lone Pine on Whitney Portal Road.
</P>
<P>
   Camping is available either on a first-come, first-served basis
and limited to one night's stay or by reservation. Sites are $12
per night. For reservations, call (800) 280-2267. An $8.65
processing fee is charged.
</P>
<P>
   Information for overnight backcountry permits is the same as the
Cottonwood Lakes Basin.
</P>
<P>
   The trail is found on the Mount Langley 7.5-minute series
topographic map.
</P>
<P>
   Allow six hours to complete hike to Grass Lakes.

GOODBYE TO VERO BEACH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dodgers' threats to leave their spring training site of 50
years in Vero Beach, Fla., have begun to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   The club has contacted officials in Arizona and been approached
by the city of Las Vegas, which is planning to build a $50 million
spring training facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just exploring our options,'' said Dodgers spokesman
Derrick Hall. ``But we are the only team that privately owns and
operates our own spring training facility and that costs a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers celebrated their 50th year in Vero Beach this past
spring. The club's property was part of the $311 million sale from
the O'Malley family to Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, it was the jewel of spring training facilities, but
competition from nearby cities has drained much of the town's
spring fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also has expressed an interest in moving the club's training
camp closer to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   What also makes the move attractive is that the cities are
willing to put up the money to build the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said there is no timetable and that Vero Beach has not been
ruled out for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Faith hasn't waned: Roger Cedeno, the projected Opening Day
center fielder, made just his 35th start Wednesday night, not
exactly what the Dodgers had in mind for a one-time top prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who had an RBI double and scored before leaving
Wednesday's game with dizziness, never got on track after missing
the first month with a strained left hamstring. But the club says
it is not through with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of teams interested in him (at the trade
deadline), but I wouldn't let him go,'' interim GM Tom Lasorda
said. ``He's young (24), he can run and he's a switch hitter. Those
kinds of guys can be harder to find than the big names.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi is the center fielder of the future. That means
only spot starts and pinch hitting for Cedeno. He entered
Wednesday's game batting .243 in 86 games and leads the club with
eight hits and five RBI off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   With Mondesi locked up for the next three years and right
fielder Gary Sheffield the next five, Cedeno's only chance to start
next year is left field, where the Dodgers hope to acquire an
established left-handed bat during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Most concede the biggest drawback in Cedeno's development is a
lack of baseball instincts. He has hurt the club several times with
lapses in judgment on the bases and in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems is he doesn't maintain the confidence he
has playing winter ball or in spring training when he gets here,''
coach Joe Amalfitano said. ``And unfortunately, the expectations of
playing in L.A. do not allow him to learn on the job. We do not
have the luxury of time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal off DL: Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal, the former
Westlake High standout, came off the disabled list Wednesday, but
it is unlikely he will play again this season because of a stress
fracture in his pelvic region.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal, 26, had a breakout season last year with 20 homers
and 77 RBI. Now, he is behind starter Bobby Estalella, backup Mark
Parent, callup Gary Bennett and emergency catcher Ruben Amaro, an
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably is a one-in-a-thousand chance that he will
play,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance Lieberthal still could need surgery, but his
condition has improved since the Dodgers were in Philadelphia in
late July. He now can squat and swing a bat but has trouble
running.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lieberthal will be in uniform for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have my spikes on just in case,'' he said.

BASIN OFFERS NEW FISHING REWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONE PINE _ Sight-fishing is part shopping and part football.
</P>
<P>
   Because the products are viewed first, anglers can make their
selection before even wetting a line. Then they cast in front of
the specimen like leading a receiver. When fish and dry fly
connect, touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It's the feeling one gets when preparing to toss an insect
imitation or a glittery lure to an unsuspecting golden trout in one
of the namesake bodies of water that compose the remote Cottonwood
Lakes Basin west of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, you can spot the fish usually along the edges where
they are hanging out, cast in front of them and they do respond,''
said Culver City angler Ken Wells, who was targeting the brightly
hued trout with a gold-and-red Thomas Buoyant lure during his final
afternoon of an eight-day Sierra Club outing.
</P>
<P>
   I watched Wells hook three in 10 minutes on a recent cloudless
Saturday, prompting my fishing partner to quickly switch from his
unproductive fly-and-bubble rig to a hunk of hardware.
</P>
<P>
   He had landed more than two dozen at Cottonwood Lakes No.3 in
about an hour's time, the largest measuring 14 inches _ a monster
among the typically lilliputian goldens. Earlier in the day, even I
had hooked my largest fly-caught golden _ all 11 inches long _
among the hundreds I have taken on prior backcountry hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Why were these varieties so ``huge,'' so quick to charge bait
and so bold with towering anglers looming nearby?
</P>
<P>
   Lack of pressure, that's why. After being off-limits to anglers
since 1966 in order to protect brood stock, four of the five
Cottonwood Lakes in Inyo National Forest's John Muir Wilderness
were reopened to fishing July 1. It's the type of Shangri-la
situation for which trout anglers clamor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that's great, it gives a lot more area for people to
fish,'' said Al Crandell, a mining-company metallurgist from
Ridgecrest before making his first casts in the basin's lowermost
lakes. ``And these fish are unbelievable. They're not very big, but
they are gorgeous. It's a color you can't describe.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as one observer noted in 1905, ``the delicate golden
olive of the head, back and upper part of the side, the clear
golden yellow along and below the lateral line and the marvelously
rich cadmium of the under parts fully entitle this species to be
known above all others as the golden trout.''
</P>
<P>
   Endemic only to the Southern Sierra Nevada's Golden Trout Creek,
Little Kern River and South Fork Kern River _ just southwest of
Cottonwood Lakes Basin in the Golden Trout Wilderness _ the
delicate trout was designated the state fish in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   It was documented in two subspecies earlier, and, well before
that, introduced to many nearby lakes and streams. According to the
Department of Fish and Game booklet ``Golden Trout of the High
Sierra,'' the most significant transplant came in 1876, when one
Col. Sherman Stevens carried 13 goldens in a coffeepot over four
miles to Cottonwood Creek so he could have trout near his sawmill.
In 1891, about 100 goldens were collected from the creek and hauled
upstream to the Cottonwood Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1918, Cottonwood Lakes Basin has been home to the DFG's
golden trout spawning operations. In years when snowpack allows
biologists into the basin before July 1 (El Nino-impacted 1998
wasn't one of them), eggs are taken to produce 250,000 to 500,000
fingerling goldens, which, in turn, are planted in regional
backcountry waters.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their limited distribution, goldens are thought to be
the rarest of the primary Eastern Sierra trout, which include the
rainbow, brook and brown.
</P>
<P>
   The July 1 reopening of Cottonwood Lake Nos.1, 2, 3 and 4
greatly enhances the public's access to the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to add the golden to your list of trout, this is a
good place to do it,'' said Phil Pister, 69, of Bishop, a former
fisheries biologist for the DFG in Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Pister qualified the statement by noting that a study two years
ago revealed that the basin's golden trout population had somehow
been compromised by rainbow trout as long as 40 years ago,
producing what is known as a goldenbow hybrid. However, he said,
the subtleties are hardly noticeable to the layperson and the fish
is still largely considered a golden.
</P>
<P>
   The hybridization of the golden brood stock was less of a reason
for the angling reopening than the notion of adding four lakes to
the state's Wild Trout Program, which mandates that each year one
lake and 25 miles of streams be identified as quality
catch-and-release fisheries. The DFG is behind in naming lakes to
the program, according to Alan Pickard, senior fisheries supervisor
for the DFG in Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Pickard said a zero-take limit is not likely to affect the
golden trout spawning project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out there is a negative impact _ if after a few
years of angling we can't make our egg supplies, for example _ we
would take another look at the situation,'' Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now its full steam ahead for golden fishing in the basin
and as healthy as in times past, the biologist said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Ridgecrest fisherman Crandell landed footlong
goldens in lake No.5. Largest and most distant of the Cottonwood
quintet at 5.8 miles from the trailhead, it's the one lake that
escaped the closure of 1966, when the DFG recommended the golden
trout spawning project be more stringently preserved. As in
previous years, it is also the only body from which goldens can be
kept, with a limit of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream for him getting back up here,'' said Pat
Strickland, a First Baptist Church of Ridgecrest pastor
accompanying her friend. Crandell whistled ``I've Been Working on
the Railroad'' as the pair strode past 11,008-foot-high Cottonwood
Lake No.1, situated 4{-miles northwest of and nearly 1,000 feet
above the Cottonwood Lakes Trailhead.
</P>
<P>
   More than six hours later they would return to the parking lot
falling short of their goal to reach lake No.5 but having landed
eight goldens mostly on Super Duper lures at lake No.2.
</P>
<P>
   Framed by granite walls near tree line and dotted with a
smattering of yellow, red and purple flowers in breathtaking
meadows, it mattered not where the two wound up pitching their
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being out here in God's creation is a special treat and
whether I caught anything would be a special treat,'' Strickland
said of the basin that was named in the late 19th century for the
cottonwood trees that lined the lower stretches of its drainage
creek. ``But I caught one, and it was a beauty.'' &QL;

DAMP START TO DOVE HUNTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. _ Tuesday's opening of early dove season
drew strong reviews in the the state's lower southwest deserts and
along the Colorado River, despite a series of thunderstorms that
threatened to dampen the annual hunting rite.
</P>
<P>
   Such fowl, er, foul weather is blamed yearly for driving
whitewing and mourning doves into Mexico, frequently occurring just
before the season opens. However, this year's big storms didn't
take place until Monday afternoon, and most hunters reported seeing
numerous birds opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anybody who didn't get a limit,'' said Bill
Kerekes of Mesa Sports Shop in Yuma, Ariz., one of the most popular
destinations for California hunters. ``Everybody who's come in here
said it was over too quick. There are just birds everywhere,
including a lot of whitewings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerekes said there were many wheat fields in the Yuma and
Winterhaven regions along the lower Colorado that attracted large
quantities of birds. While most of the fields had been harvested
recently, many had not yet been plowed, attracting a lot of birds
to pick up seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the river, Wayne Pinkerton at B&AMP;B Bait in Blythe
noted, ``Some places have been real hot.'' Hunters who focused on
burned wheat fields in the Palo Verde Valley near Ripley found
excellent shooting, he said. For example, Jim Maxey of Riverside
and his group of eight hunters all had limits by sunrise, with many
of the limits consisting mostly of whitewings.
</P>
<P>
   The north end of the Palo Verde Valley, however, was not near as
productive, Pinkerton said, with most birds not on agriculture but
in the desert, where they were more scattered and difficult to
target.
</P>
<P>
   In the Imperial Valley, the hunting was generally reported to be
very good on harvested wheat fields, along the East Highline Canal
in the fallow fields and in more arid areas along the railroad
tracks. There were also some safflower fields at the Imperial
Wildlife Area, on the south end of the Salton Sea, that provided
some fair hunting.
</P>
<P>
   In the Coachella Valley near Indio and Palm Springs, the reports
of good hunting were less consistent. Hunters who scouted out
likely fields had limits early, but the numbers of birds in this
region were not as high as in the Imperial and Colorado River
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of hunters, but not a lot of limits,''
said Elva Perez of Poor Richard's in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   In the high desert from Victorville to Lancaster, the birds were
far more scattered and hunting not nearly as productive.
Thunderstorms hammered this region hard Monday and earlier in
August, and most hunters felt the storm activity pushed the birds
south. The same was true for the Southern San Joaquin Valley, where
bird numbers took a decided turn downward last week.

WITH FIESTA, ROSE NOT AS SWEET

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cade McNown's arm is fine, it's his mind that needs a little
rewiring.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA quarterback has been programmed to spend New Year's Day
in Pasadena for so long, he keeps throwing attention to the Rose
Bowl even though an even better target is breaking free a few yards
farther down the field.
</P>
<P>
   When McNown, wiggling to escape the clutches of any Heisman
Trophy hype, says his real motivation is to get seventh-ranked UCLA
back to the Rose Bowl, his intention isn't to sell the Bruins
short, even if that is sort of like Earl Watson vowing to lead the
Bruins basketball team to the N.I.T.
</P>
<P>
   McNown can be forgiven for finding a rain-slicked football
easier to grasp than the fact the Rose Bowl, long the grand-prize
float in the parade of postseason games, is no better than a
runner-up in this year's procession.
</P>
<P>
   It's blasphemous but true: for any Pacific-10 or Big Ten team
harboring national championship aspirations, Pasadena might as well
be Dubuque, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl is party central this season, with Sun Devil
Stadium the appointed site of the showdown between the No. 1 and
No. 2-ranked teams. College football's latest alliance, the Bowl
Championship Series, was forged this year so the Pac-10 and Big Ten
wouldn't systematically be denied a dance with the belle of the
ball as Michigan was last year and Arizona State the year before
that.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens? No sooner is Pasadena placed on the back burner
(January 2002) for a national-title game then Ohio State, Michigan,
Arizona State and UCLA all find their way into the top-10 in the
national preseason rankings, giving rise to the possibility the
Jan.4 title game could end up looking an awful lot like Rose Bowl
games of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Ohio State battling eighth-ranked ASU for all the
marbles while fifth-ranked Michigan duels UCLA for all the roses?
Stranger things could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, the championship matchup we'd clamor to see
is UCLA against ASU. They're arguably the two top teams in the
Pac-10 but for the second consecutive season they're not scheduled
to play each other. Who's arranging these conference games anyway,
Bob Arum?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade and I were talking about that earlier,'' ASU wide
receiver Lenzie Jackson said during Pac-10 media day. ``I wish we
had a chance to play each other. It's impossible to say who is the
best team in the Pac-10 if the best teams in the conference don't
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils may end up being sorrier not to see the Bruins
than the other way around; if the two schools do wind up sharing
the conference crown, UCLA will get the Rose Bowl bid (barring an
invitation to the Fiesta Bowl) because the Sun Devils have been to
Pasadena since the Bruins' last postseason appearance there, in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA or ASU falters, a sneaky-good Arizona team could become
the seventh Pac-10 representative in the Rose Bowl in as many
years. Don't laugh; if Northwestern can represent the Big Ten, why
not the Pac-10's Wildcats?
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Arizona has been patient. It is theonly school
in the Pac-10 that hasn't experienced the pomp and pageantry of
Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing quite like it, if you ask Northwestern coach
Gary Barnett. ``A mystical experience'' is what Barnett called his
Wildcats' 1996 trip to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything ethical to get back there,'' added Barnett,
who has mixed feelings about the Pac-10 and Big Ten letting other
teams in to trample on their holy ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a traditionalist,'' Barnett explained. ``I'd hate to give
up the Rose Bowl to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Dick Tomey also loved the Rose Bowl just the way
she was, even if she had given his Wildcats the slip these past 11
years. And yet Tomey endorsed her face lift, having recognized the
Rose Bowl's rich tradition was getting him only so far in the
living rooms of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's been a lot of attention paid to the (Bowl)
Alliance,'' said Tomey, who has been in Tucson so long, we're
pretty sure he pre-dates fajitas. ``The Rose Bowl needed to be part
of it. It's important for recruiting to be able to tell players
they have a chance to compete directly for the national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   What could be better than to show them? UCLA's McNown might be
the one to do it, so long as he remembers the road he's looking for
is the Interstate 10-East toward Phoenix, not the 210-East headed
for Pasadena. &QL;

TOLEDO'S TIMING PERFECT THUS FAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The interview would change the course of UCLA football, yet the
participants are foggy on details.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Toledo does not remember what he wore _ suit? sport coat? _
and athletic director Peter Dalis could not recall the date. Was it
before the 1995 Aloha Bowl, or after?
</P>
<P>
   For 30 minutes, they discussed Toledo's candidacy for the vacant
head coaching position. (Terry Donahue had resigned several weeks
earlier.) At the time, Dalis was in hot pursuit of Northwestern's
Gary Barnett after an unsuccessful attempt to lure Rick Neuheisel
from Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo's interview went well, better than Dalis expected.
They talked about what the stagnating program needed and why Toledo
was the man to deliver. He talked about his coaching philosophy
(attack, attack, attack) and his tough-love approach to dealing
with players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a real good feeling about Bob, more than anyone I've
ever interviewed for a head coaching position,'' Dalis said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   When Barnett said no, Toledo was next on the list. Dalis'
optimism was high, his expectations modest. The Bruins were 40-29
with Donahue in the '90s, and Dalis believed a return to national
prominence would take four years, perhaps five or six.
</P>
<P>
   But not this.
</P>
<P>
   Not two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes longer to cycle up than it does to cycle down,''
Dalis said. ``But Bob is way ahead of schedule. He has exceeded my
expectations.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years after his hiring, on a gray and chilly New Year's
afternoon, Toledo celebrated a Cotton Bowl victory against Texas
A&AMP;M and the bounty it wrought: A 10-game winning streak, a No.5
ranking and, yes, a return to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later the Bruins signed the most heralded recruiting
class in their history, rated No.1 by several national services.
Last month, UCLA was ranked seventh in both preseason polls and the
Pacific-10 Conference media's pick to win the league.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Toledo is ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the job, I thought we'd be at this level within
five years _ once we got our recruits and established our
philosophy,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we're making headway.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's methods are well documented. He hired Kevin Yoxall to
revamp the strength program _ ``He's a big, big part of this,''
Toledo said _ and a slew of solid assistants. He has reinvigorated
the recruiting, implemented a dynamic offense and an attacking
defense that attracts top talent. His energy is boundless, his
optimism unwavering.
</P>
<P>
   Can he keep it up? Is the success permanent or a flare in the
Westwood sky, bright and brief? Can the Bruins compete for the
Pac-10 championship annually and become a fixture in the top-10
alongside Nebraska and Florida State?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a great job,'' former USC coach John Robinson
said. ``But it's very difficult to remain at that level year in and
year out. When you graduate a senior group, then you start over and
you have a dip. Florida State, Ohio State and Nebraska are the only
ones that stay on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 is uniquely competitive among the major conferences.
Six different champions in the past six years. No repeat winner
since Washington in 1992. Only two 11-win teams this decade.
Scholarship reductions, player defections (to the NFL) and tighter
admissions have created unprecedented parity and a miniscule margin
for error. Toledo could hire the best assistants and recruit the
best players and still not return UCLA to its glory of the '80s _
when Donahue won three Rose Bowls and had eight top-15 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA, last year and this year, is in a two-year up cycle,''
said Donahue, now a CBS analyst. ``The issue becomes when Bob
starts playing with his players. That's when it's truly his
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, 90 percent of the players who took them to 10 wins
were in the program when he became coach. This year, it'll be 40
percent: (kicker) Chris Sailer, (safety) Larry Atkins, (offensive
tackle) Kris Farris, and (quarterback Cade) McNown are the
holdovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he can keep it up will be determined over a long
period of time. You have to withhold evaluation until history is
written. But this is a really exciting time for UCLA football.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toledo arrived in 1994, after five years at Texas A&AMP;M. His
mission as offensive coordinator was to energize a sagging offense
and develop a freshman quarterback named McNown.
</P>
<P>
   They clicked immediately. McNown was eager to learn and Toledo,
who tutored pros Chris Miller and Bill Musgrave at Oregon in the
'80s, had much to impart. During the coaching search, when
Neuheisel and Barnett were all the rage, McNown waltzed into Dalis'
office and endorsed his coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat down, and in a very formal way, described why Bob would
make a good head coach,'' Dalis said. ``I was impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as McNown's rise has paralleled UCLA's, replacing McNown
will dictate future success. This is a critical lesson from the
Donahue years, and one of the few building blocks to prolonged
success that Toledo can control.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the '80s, UCLA reloaded at the most important
position, quarterback. Tom Ramsey departed in 1983, and Neuheisel
stepped in. Neuheisel departed, and along came Steve Bono. When
Bono left, Matt Stephens took over. Then the best of them all, Troy
Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knew it at the time, Aikman's departure after
the 1988 season signaled the beginning of the end of Donahue's
success. UCLA won 10 games in each of Aikman's two seasons, then
three in '89 and five in '90.
</P>
<P>
   How will the Bruins cope with McNown's departure? A former
walk-on, Drew Bennett, is the projected replacement. If he falters,
UCLA has several young but talented successors: Scott McEwan, Cory
Paus, Ryan McCann and recruit J.P. Losman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Replacing McNown will be a critical question,'' Donahue said.
``If the evaluation process is right, they'll keep it going. If
not, then it gets more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue thought he had reloaded when Tommy Maddox arrived in
1989. Three years later, he was gone _ an early departure to the
NFL from which the Donahue regime never fully recovered. Sure,
Wayne Cook won a Pac-10 title, but he was no Aikman or Maddox. Rob
Walker, Ryan Fien and Steve Buck were not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Player defections are beyond a coach's control, as is staff
attrition. Donahue lost a plethora of assistants over the years,
from Rich Brooks and Dick Tomey to Homer Smith and Greg Robinson.
It's an unforgiving cycle: good assistants help generate more
victories, but more victories make those assistants marketable. The
better the hire, the quicker that coach is likely to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo felt the ripple effect in December, when defensive
coordinator Rocky Long took the New Mexico job. Toledo hired Nick
Aliotti, who masterminded Oregon's Gang Green defense during its
1994 Rose Bowl run. But if the defense performs, Aliotti will
receive other offers. The Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers
contacted offensive coordinator Al Borges last year. How long will
he last?
</P>
<P>
   Injuries can disrupt immediate success, as well. The Bruins
suffered one of their most devastating losses of the decade at
Arizona in 1992. It wasn't the score (23-3) so much as the
pounding: receiver Sean LaChapelle cracked his ribs and defensive
end Arnold Ale broke his leg. A five-game losing streak ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game destroyed us for a number of weeks,'' Donahue said.
</P>
<P>
   It gets back to recruiting. Quality depth offsets most injuries
and player defections _ other than an Aikman, Maddox or McNown, of
course _ and it tempers the impact of graduation. How the Bruins
fare next year depends on recent recruiting. Will freshman DeShaun
Foster run like Karim Abdul-Jabbar or Skip Hicks? Is freshman Blake
Worley the next Chad Overhauser? And what about the quarterbacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``The cycles come when a class graduates,'' John Robinson said.
``When Cade graduates, they have to replace him. I'm not sure how
many teams can stay on top without cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   And no team stays on top forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``USC is a great example,'' Donahue said. ``For 20 years, from
the mid '60s to the mid '80s, USC was as good as any program in the
country. Now they're in a down cycle. That's what happens. You
enjoy great periods of time and then periods that aren't so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's success could last for years. He should enjoy it while
it's here.

HACKETT TRIES TO RESTORE MYSTIQUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was shortly after Paul Hackett had been hired to be the USC
football coach and he was making his first campus visit in 20
years. He vaguely remembered the athletic facilities, and was eager
to see what changes had been made since he was an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came quickly. Not many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was the same. The same Heritage Hall. The same
offices. The same field,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   These were not feelings of nostalgia for Hackett. Frankly, he
was appalled so little had been done in the '80s and '90s to
improve the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else has used us as a model,'' Hackett said. ``We
used to be at the forefront. Now, we have to leapfrog them.''
</P>
<P>
   The facilities are already undergoing a face-lift at USC, with
an expanded practice field, new dining center, expanded weight room
and extra office space for coaches all either completed or being
built.
</P>
<P>
   But is some plaster and extra grass enough to restore USC to its
previous lofty stature?
</P>
<P>
   Three coaches _ Ted Tollner, Larry Smith, John Robinson _ tried
and ultimately failed to bring USC back to the so-called glory days
of the 1970s when the Trojans captured three national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hackett gets his chance to return USC to the top of the
college football class that's populated with Nebraska, Florida
State and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is king at the University of Southern California and
it should be,'' said former player and assistant coach Marv Goux, a
USC fixture from 1952-82. ``I just think you have to keep the
program going and you can't turn it on when you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the Rose Bowl after the 1995 season, the Trojans
have gone 12-11. USC may not have won a national championship in 20
years, a Heisman in 17 or beaten UCLA in the last seven games, but
expectations have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a golf tournament with Ronnie Lott, and he said we
need to win every game this year and go 12-0,'' Hackett said.
``Then I turned to Anthony Munoz, and he said, `Win them all and
the Rose Bowl.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is Hackett's task: rebuild a program that doesn't accept
rebuilding. Another challenge is to restore the Trojans' mystique,
that attitude that joined USC on the field during the era of
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like anybody respects us right now,'' senior wide
receiver Mike Bastianelli said. ``I don't think we really deserve
it the way we've played.''
</P>
<P>
   Goux thinks Hackett can restore the Trojans to their former
greatness. He saw first-hand what Hackett was doing by attending
several practices during training camp at UC Irvine, and so far, he
likes what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``History repeats itself. History will repeat itself,'' Goux
said. ``If you get somebody running it right, they can have a great
program. First, you have to have people who can coach. Paul Hackett
has gone out and gotten fine assistants. I've watched them very
closely. They're excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will SC win again? You're damn right. I believe they have the
right guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Goux also said he was impressed with Hackett's work habits. But
as important is Hackett's connection to the program. Hackett was an
assistant coach for the Trojans from 1976-80. In that period, USC
went to four bowl games, including three Rose Bowls, and won the
national championship in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the tradition. It's SC football again,'' Goux said.
``Larry Smith, Ted Tollner, they had no idea about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett, whose father was a professor at the University of
California, is a student and historian. In an unconventional move
this summer, he went to breakfast in Encino with John Wooden,
hoping to pick up a few pointers from the UCLA basketball coaching
legend.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden told him it might take a while, but it is possible to
bring USC back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `If I could hang on in the early years at UCLA, I
knew we could turn it around,''' Hackett said. ``I asked him if he
was frustrated. He said, `I was so frustrated but I knew I was in a
great city and at a great university. I just needed to coach. Just
stay the course.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Wooden reminded him to be a hands-on coach first
and not become overburdened by the administrative aspects of the
job. To reiterate this, Hackett has a note on his desk based on
that conversation saying, ``Paul, be sure you coach first.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is also instilling discipline, something Wooden and Goux
stressed. Players are monitored by student assistants to make sure
they attend classes. If they don't, they get to do something
enjoyable like run at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A warning was sent to the players last April when Hackett
suspended R. Jay Soward, the team's biggest star, after he had
trouble attending class and was failing two classes.
</P>
<P>
   When Soward got punished, everybody else cleaned up their act,
including Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd go through with it but he's pretty
serious,'' Soward said. ``His first goal is to have us take care of
business. This taught me to take care of my responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Soward's troubles, no other player has challenged Hackett,
and they have appreciated his even hand whether dealing with stars
or walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man doesn't care who you are, he treats everyone
equally,'' wide receiver Billy Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition. Discipline. Organization. All of these practices are
needed for a successful program. They will only work, however, if
Hackett recruits players comparable to the outstanding crops
brought in during the John McKay-Robinson era.
</P>
<P>
   And there may lie a problem bigger than any other for the USC
football coach, in luring top-notch talent. Again, though, the
supporters have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be harder than it used to be,'' Goux said. ``(But)
there are more better players than there's ever been. This is a big
metropolitan area. Young people dream about going to certain places
like USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett did not have an outstanding recruiting reputation at
Pitt, but he held together the core of USC's recruiting class last
winter and has already gotten three commitments this summer.
</P>
<P>
   His initial task to improve on the field is to recruit linemen,
USC's biggest weakness at the moment. The Trojans might sign as
many as 12 linemen this February, in an attempt to recapture the
domination of the Munoz-Brad Budde days, when USC could overpower
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is the foundation of this university,
which has always been linemen,'' Hackett said. ``Great offensive
linemen. Great defensive linemen. That has been the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is also a realist, knowing it could take five years to
completely overhaul the program. From the day he was hired, he has
been aware that college football has changed a lot since the 1970s,
and it's a much more competitive world that USC competes against
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference has changed. I remember people saying when
Arizona State joined the conference that it was going to be
different,'' Hackett said. ``Washington State ... Oregon had a
marvelous run a number of years ago. So that's great. If you're at
those places it's wonderful, and if you're here, it's not so
wonderful. That used to be our sole, exclusive place.''

STRONG MAKES PUSH FOR PLAYING TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not even Frank Strong could imagine how quickly he moved up the
USC depth chart, barely three weeks after he arrived from Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really surprised me,'' Strong said. ``I just go to my room
at night and I'm stuck thinking about how quickly I've adapted to
(college football).''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-2, 200-pound true freshman, Strong came to USC known as
a power runner who was buried under the accolades given to other
prominent Trojans recruits, including prep All-American tailback
Sultan McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell that a lot of people didn't know me,'' Strong
said. ``We don't get much attention in Stockton.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the USC coaches weren't completely sure what they were
getting in Strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the level of competition at Stockton,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said. ``I know what it is for a player at Mater
Dei or (Long Beach) Poly. But he's seized every chance he gets and
everybody makes note.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Strong has opened the coaches' eyes with his
elusiveness, which was not widely known even among some college
recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Strong was heavily recruited by Nebraska, but he got vibes that
the Cornhuskers were more interested in him as a linebacker, a
position he also played at Franklin High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like telling me tailback, but I already got an
indication about their moving me to defense,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation Strong might be a USC fullback one day,
but since he started practicing, it's been clear that his future is
at tailback. In his first scrimmage, he led all tailbacks with 36
yards in six carries. In the Trojans' second scrimmage, Strong had
39 yards in three carries.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't get any carries in the season-opener against
Purdue, Strong is tied for third on the depth with redshirt junior
Petros Papadakis, behind starter Chad Morton and backup Malaefou
McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been elusive for awhile but I was known more for running
up the middle,'' Strong said. ``It seems like I was a little
underrated for my speed and elusiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong committed to USC before coach John Robinson was fired,
but after the coaching change, gave Nebraska and Cal another shot.
</P>
<P>
   The new USC coaching staff quickly realized that it still wanted
Strong, however, and convinced him to make a campus visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's over 200 pounds and you look at him and he looks thin,''
USC assistant head coach Larry Petroff said. ``He moves really well
and has good speed and vision. He's a natural runner and has
grasped this offense very quickly, which sometimes for a true
freshman is hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong was impressed with Hackett and the coaching staff and
quickly re-affirmed his commitment to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mainly Coach Hackett and the staff,'' Strong said. ``I
knew they would be father figures to me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Strong harbored ambitions of playing this season for the
Trojans, he knew it was probably a long shot, considering the depth
at running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would redshirt,'' Strong said. ``Actually, I am
(doing better than I thought).''
</P>
<P>
   Petroff said the key to Strong's early development at USC has
been his ability to adjust physically, emotionally and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, Strong is not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going great. My future's here at USC,'' he said.

POLI-DIXON EXCITES BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, Brian Poli-Dixon did not understand. Everywhere he
turned, UCLA fans compared him to former Bruins star J.J. Stokes.
The position (receiver), the size (6-5) and the natural talent made
comparisons inevitable, yet Poli-Dixon was bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Tucson, Ariz., he rarely watched Stokes and
certainly never scrutinized his mannerisms and style of play. In
fact, Poli-Dixon knew very little about Stokes until he got to UCLA
last year and popped in a videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Then he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I saw why people make the comparison,'' said
Poli-Dixon, a sophomore split end. ``I've gotten up to date on J.J.
Stokes since I got to UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the similarities _ their long and lanky builds, their
gliding strides and deceptive speed _ Stokes and Poli-Dixon are
different in two respects: Stokes had 28 career touchdown
receptions, whereas Poli-Dixon has two. Stokes redshirted as a
freshman, while Poli-Dixon played.
</P>
<P>
   The latter point is critical to assessing Poli-Dixon's
performance to date, and in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes was a consensus All-American as a junior in 1993, with 82
catches and 17 touchdowns. But his rise to greatness actually
occurred in the last two games of the '92 season, when he torched
Oregon and USC for 16 catches and four touchdowns. That success
simply carried over to the following fall.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes was concluding his third year in the program when he
reached stardom. Poli-Dixon, for all his talent, is just beginning
his second year.
</P>
<P>
   Is he ready to bust loose?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the potential,'' receivers coach Ron Caragher said.
``He got experience last year, and I hope he can take it to the
next level. J.J. exploded at the end of his third year. Brian's
starting his second, but he's got a shot. Potentially, they are
very similar.''
</P>
<P>
   For proof, Caragher points to the Houston game, when Poli-Dixon
turned a non-descript screen into a 31-yard touchdown. Watching him
corral the ball, then dash through the defense with fluid, immense
strides, was to watch Stokes all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was just a chance to get my feet wet,'' Poli-Dixon
said. ``It was a whole new world for me. This year, I have more
confidence. Like in the SC game, when I caught a ball and went
(head-to-head) with the guy. This year, I'll try to juke him.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon started training camp as the No.2 split end, behind
Brad Melsby. But the Bruins probably will treat him as a third
starter, especially on third downs and goal-line situations _
whenever his size is most valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll help us make up the (11) touchdowns we lost
with (Jim) McElroy,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``I
don't expect him to get 11, but if he can get half that, it'd
help.''

HACKETT IS KEY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtually any analysis today of the USC football team begins and
ends with new coach Paul Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   This much is already certain: Hackett is extremely detailed,
organized and energetic as he embarks on his inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   But it is players who win games, no matter how much coaches
would like you to think they influence the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   And Hackett sent out an early red flag last spring when he said,
``The talent level is not quite what I thought it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pure talent level, I'm a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound like a coach deflecting criticism before it
begins, but Hackett does have a point.
</P>
<P>
   USC will only be as good as its talent. Right now, it has some
incredibly talented players at certain positions (middle
linebacker, wide receiver) and some entirely mediocre spots
(offensive line, defensive line).
</P>
<P>
   When Hackett says games are won in the trenches, it might be
time to worry.
</P>
<P>
   But USC does have enough to turn things around from the past two
seasons, when the Trojans were 12-11.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says USC will go 7-5, but every season
contains a few surprise moments. If the Trojans steal one or two
games, they go 9-3. That might be judged a minor miracle.
</P>
<P>
   If USC does win nine games, it can thank the defense. The
Trojans return eight starters and probably have the best defense in
the Pacific-10 Conference. Linebackers Chris Claiborne, Mark Cusano
and David Gibson have all turned games around with big plays the
past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And the secondary _ particularly safeties Grant Pearsall and
Rashard Cook _ is undeniably talented and experienced. Throw in
Daylon McCutcheon at cornerback and there is reason for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seven should keep USC in a lot of games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line is suspect. But it was a question mark last
season and wound up being the Pac-10's top defense against the run.
And unlike last year, there's more size and speed along the front
four.
</P>
<P>
   Whether USC can keep its patchwork offensive line from falling
apart and get another overachieving year from its defensive line
will determine whether or not the year is judged a success.
</P>
<P>
   With only one offensive lineman who has started a college game
(Travis Claridge) it might be too much to ask these guys to pass
block against Florida State, Arizona State, Washington or UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   But this is where a coach makes a difference _ at least in his
own mind.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of people believe Hackett can get results. He's
brought discipline and decisiveness into the program that have been
missing the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a week into training camp, junior quarterbacks John Fox
and Quincy Woods were playing tight end and wide receiver,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   He's made it clear he wants to go with his young quarterbacks,
and he's not about to play favorites at the other positions.
</P>
<P>
   Problem-child wide receiver R. Jay Soward was suspended from the
opener during spring practice for poor academic performance, and
that has put the rest of the team on notice. No other players have
gotten out of line since, and it's fair to say more than a few
might fear Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Gone forever are the laid-back days of John Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett will be nothing if not disciplined, and it will be
interesting to see if this really translates into more victories.
Hackett is the first to say this is really a five-year plan, but
with players like Soward, Claiborne and Palmer around, Trojans fans
will want immediate results.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is not overwhelmingly difficult. USC has seven home
games and does not travel to Seattle or Tempe. The Trojans even get
to go to Pullman, Wash., in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe, just maybe, those top-25 poll votes the Trojans have
received are no completely out of line.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, USC's skill position players can be so intoxicating
that you almost want to overlook the problems in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   The fans certainly will. They've never been big on rebuilding
years around here.!end!

WILL IT BE ROSE BOWL OR EL PASO FOR BRUINS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo is a weather balloon, the first to sense
changing dynamics within his program and altered expectations
without.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' 10-game winning streak, top-rated recruiting class
and Heisman Trophy candidate have combined to generate lofty media
expectations (UCLA is the preseason Pacific-10 Conference favorite)
and escalating fan enthusiasm (record increase in ticket sales).
</P>
<P>
   Toledo recognized the attention months ago, but he did not hide
from it. That acceptance has created more preseason optimism than
has existed since August 1994 _ before J.J. Stokes' bruised thigh
leveled the season.
</P>
<P>
   Is the current good cheer justified?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and no.
</P>
<P>
   With quarterback Cade McNown, kicker Chris Sailer, a sound
offensive line, depth at receiver and speed on defense, the Bruins
have enough raw materials to win nine games and the Pacific-10
championship. Their health is good. Their schedule is favorable.
Confidence is booming. Heck, make it 10 wins.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side is this: Lacking an accomplished tailback and
experience on defense, where only four starters return, the Bruins
are not a dominating team _ one capable of beating quality foes on
a bad day. Perhaps they'll reach that point in coming years, when
the freshman class matures, but they aren't there now.
</P>
<P>
   They have no seniors at tailback or receiver. Their most
talented defensive linemen are the most inexperienced. They cannot
possibly repeat the plus-1.82 turnover margin of last season or
replace the Pac-10's career touchdown leader (Skip Hicks). They
must play at Arizona and at Washington, places that invariably
bring out their worst. And the USC streak must end sometime. How
long does a coin keep coming up heads?
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the Bruins are teetering between good and great,
between seven wins and 10, between the Sun Bowl and the Rose Bowl.
Which way they fall depends not on the studs _ not on McNown or
Sailer, offensive tackle Kris Farris, linebacker Brendan Ayanbadejo
or safety Larry Atkins _ but on the supporting players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, the people surrounding Cade are a concern,''
Toledo said. ``I know Cade will do the right things, but other
people have to do the right things in order for him to perform
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and receiver Jim McElroy were a devastating combination
last year, accounting for 37 of UCLA's 60 touchdowns. Defenses
crowded the line of scrimmage to contain Hicks, enabling McElroy to
beat them deep. McNown delivered the ball to his scorers like a
premier point guard, on time and on target, but he rarely had to
create the touchdowns himself.
</P>
<P>
   Who fills the 222-point void?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than one or two players, it might be seven or eight.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Lewis, Keith Brown and DeShaun Foster will compete for
Hicks' carries and touchdowns. Dan Farmer, Brad Melsby, Freddie
Mitchell and Brian Poli-Dixon will battle for McElroy's receptions
and, more importantly, his big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, there are several potential stars: Foster, of
course, and perhaps Poli-Dixon and Mitchell, too. Collectively,
though, it remains to be seen if they can complement each other the
way Hicks and McElroy did.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the offense seems solid. If Brian Polak or James
Ghezzi perform at right tackle (McNown's blind side), the offensive
line will be one of the Pac-10's best. And the Bruins are so loaded
at tight end that Bryan Fletcher, the most gifted of the bunch, is
running fourth string.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is a greater concern. Sophomore Kenyon Coleman is
the defensive line's anchor, a heavy burden for a 19-year-old just
shedding his baby fat.
</P>
<P>
   Ayanbadejo alone cannot solidify the linebacking. He needs help,
but no one else has ever started a game. Cornerbacks Jason Bell,
Marques Anderson and Damian Allen have shown flashes of talent, and
enough inconsistency to get beat deep.
</P>
<P>
   True freshmen will be asked to contribute on the line (Ken
Kocher), at linebacker (Robert Thomas) and in the secondary (Lovell
Houston). That's hardly reassuring, however talented they might be.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is this: Just as good health, the spectacular
turnover margin and the McNown-Hicks-McElroy symmetry converged to
create surprising success in '97, obstacles might surface to create
unexpected difficulty this year.
</P>
<P>
   Call them bad breaks, vagaries of the game, whatever. But unless
you're at Nebraska or Florida State, you don't book New Year's Day
reservations in September. Things have a way of evening out, and
UCLA's balance sheet reads 8-3, payable Dec. 31, in the Sun Bowl.

   1. THREE LITTLE BOYS, THREE LITTLE GRAVES, AN UNENDING TRAGEDY
The nightmare in Northern Ireland never ends. Every horrific
bombing underscores a centuries-old religious division that
political will has yet to mend. The Quinn family knows the violence
all too well. In July, three young brothers, Richard, Mark and
Jason Quinn, died in the first major terrorist attack since the
Good Friday peace accord. In this moving interview, their mother,
Chrissie Quinn, spoke for the first time about her grief - a
family's dreams shattered, a country's future in shambles. By Linda
Slobodian. From The Calgary Sun. 2,000 words. 2. HOW MUCH OF
POLITICS IS ENTERTAINMENT? Have we reached the point where the line
between entertainment and news is blurring? Like entertainment,
politics is increasingly part of the easy-listening background
music of the time. More and more, politicians play to the camera.
There's nothing entertaining about Bill Clinton's plight since the
Monica Lewinsky story broke in January - and yet the entire
spectacle has more in common with mass entertainment than with
serious politics. By David M. Shribman. From The Boston Globe
Magazine. 2,500 words. 3. RAIDING THE TOY CHESTS Today's kids are
more brand-conscious than any other generation and understand that
professional athletes receive million-dollar paychecks for saying
they like certain shoes. Marketing ploys aimed at youngsters now
involve clothing companies teaming with toy makers to produce
co-branded products. By Rosemary Feitelberg. From Women's Wear
Daily. 1,500 words.

ANTIBODIES AGAINST THYROID GLAND LINKED TO
</P>
<P>
   CHERNOBYL DISASTER Young people living in the former Soviet
republic of Belarus exposed to radioactive fallout from the
Chernobyl disaster are much more likely to have antibodies against
their thyroid glands than children who escaped significant
radiation exposure. It is thought that radiation damage to the
thyroid may trigger an abnormal immune response to the gland that
leads to autoimmune thyroid diseases. Although the study found no
evidence that the antibodies had yet affected the thyroid function
of these young people, the findings suggest that they may develop
autoimmune thyroid diseases later in life that can cause
hypothyroidism. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News Service. 1,000
words.

street children in the world; 40 million live in Latin America. In
Bolivia, 11-year-old Macario, illiterate and homeless, is scheduled
to meet President Hugo Banzer Suarez to help ``show the world that

 &HT;    Bengals picks 'surprise' Brown
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ When he saw Stepfret Williams' name on the
waiver wire, Bengals president Mike Brown was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Enamored with Williams' speed, Brown claimed the former Dallas
wide receiver recently. To make room on the 53-man roster, the
Bengals waived first-year wideout Chris Doering.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a 6-foot, 170-pound, third-year veteran from Northeast
Louisiana, had 31 catches for 340 yards and a touchdown for Dallas
from 1996 to '97.
</P>
<P>
   He played in all five 1998 preseason games, compiling six
catches for 69 yards, six kickoff returns for 151 yards and two
punt returns for 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quick and fast,'' Brown said. ``He helps on punt returns.
We think he can be a solid backup here behind Carl (Pickens) and
Darnay (Scott), and compete for the third spot with (David) Dunn
and (James) Hundon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see names on the waiver wire from time to time that surprise
me. I wouldn't have predicted that he'd end up here a few weeks
ago, but that's how it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Doering, a former Florida star whose 31 TD catches are a
Southeastern Conference record, led the Bengals in preseason
receiving yards with 127 on six catches.

 &HT;    Miami Valley trees losing foliage early
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fall is still weeks away, but many people in the Miami Valley,
Ohio, are already hauling out their rakes and leaf blowers to deal
with growing piles of brown leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Trees are like a business facing a shortage of raw materials,
said Woody Wesig of Woody Tree Medics, and right now some are on
short work weeks and some are going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 10, a brown leaf is zero, and a bright green is
a Madonna 10,'' said Wesig. ``We're not seeing too many 10s right
now. Many trees are around five.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that trees are losing leaves early this
year: too much rain earlier and too little lately, the region's
soil composition, excessive aphids and mites in the spring, and, of
course, El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley is currently going through a mini-drought.
Although August rain levels are barely half an inch below normal at
2.71 inches, most of that precipitation came in three torrential
days early in the month. The rest of the month has been dry, and no
rain is forecast through Sunday, according to the National Weather
Service in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees' reaction is not unusual; when it gets hot some start
shedding,'' said Pete Lane of the Ohio State University
Agricultural Extension. ``And August is the time when trees need
more water.''
</P>
<P>
   The extremely wet spring brought on by El Nino, the warm
currents in the Pacific Ocean that disrupted weather patterns all
over the world, set the stage for the trees' early defoliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started in the spring with excess rainfall,'' said
Wesig. ``Excess moisture fills up the spaces between soil particles
and denies the roots oxygen and it washes away essential elements
the tree needs. As we say, no roots, no top.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesig said the region's soil is also a problem. ``There are a
lot of rocks and clay. It's better for making pottery than making
plants,'' he said. ``When the soil is hostile, roots stay up near
the surface. That makes trees more subject to the fluctuations of
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The wet spring also increased aphids and mites and certain
pathogens that can disrupt a tree's growth, according to Wesig.
Some areas have also seen Japanese beetle infestations.

 &HT;    Jury consultant's a whiz at judging us at a glance
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jo-Ellan Dimitrius is not someone you want to meet when you have
a spot of ketchup on your collar or a sesame seed stuck between
your front teeth.
</P>
<P>
   She'll notice. She notices everything about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   She notices whether they speak clearly, walk straight, slouch in
their seats, drum their fingers. Whether their clothes are too
tight or too short. Whether
</P>
<P>
   they look other people in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   And she's anything but nonjudgmental.
</P>
<P>
   As a jury consultant in more than 600 trials, including O.J.
Simpson's criminal case, she draws fast conclusions about strangers
that help defense attorneys identify the most sympathetic
prospects. She also prepares witnesses to look and sound sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's written a book, ``Reading People'' (Random House,
$23.95), revealing the techniques that prompted a law magazine to
dub her The Seer. You don't have to be facing the electric chair to
be interested.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitrius aims at bosses who hire employees, singles looking for
mates and anyone who wants to make a good impression. Her methods
are universal but have to be applied individually.
</P>
<P>
   You might use them to identify ambition in a file clerk or to
seek a child-care worker who can't imagine doing anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to decide what they want in a friend, a physician
or someone they're hiring,'' she says. ``You have to spend time
thinking about that first.''
</P>
<P>
   First impressions are meaningful, Dimitrius insists, although
she cautions against reading too much into someone's appearance.
After all, people really do have bad hair days.
</P>
<P>
   But cheap wigs, loud colors or scruffy beards may be important
personality clues when weighed with other factors. Among them: what
the person says (and how), body language and how the person
interacts with others.
</P>
<P>
   To really know someone, you have to consider the person's
environment. That means looking into their homes and meeting their
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environment includes the human environment,'' she says. ``You
learn a lot by looking at who they hang out with and what they do.
Do they do something cultural? Play softball? Go drinking and
carousing?''
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor may be time, a luxury Dimitrius
doesn't have in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You meet someone who's a lot of fun to be with, the life of
the party, but in time you realize he never chips in to help pay
the bill,'' she says. ``That's particularly a problem in dating.
You jump in before you know the person's character.''
</P>
<P>
   It also takes time to get the hang of reading personal signals,
especially when so many people have cut back on human contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it analysis paralysis,'' Dimitrius says. ``We're used
to reading e-mail and faxes, not meeting people. Get out of your
chair instead of sending a message down the hall. I'd rather see
how a person reacts to news.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimitrius, 45, started building her mental database of character
clues when she was a child, watching her parents' friends at dinner
parties. Her fascination with people led to a fascination with
juries, the subject of her doctoral dissertation at Claremont
Graduate School in California, where she lives. Her high-profile
trial work has led to numerous television appearances on talk and
news shows.
</P>
<P>
   She concedes that practice hasn't made perfect. After 20 years
of marriage, Dimitrius is in mid-divorce. She also concedes that
not everyone enjoys being subjected to her close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This explains why my daughter's not forthcoming about bringing
home new boyfriends,'' she says.

 &HT;    HOW TO READ PEOPLE
 &HT;    How to read people
 &HT;    By DOUGLAS KALAJIAN

<P>
   First, a warning: Author Jo-Ellan Dimitrius cautions against
judging anyone without considering many factors. Common Co5clusions
are often wrong. (For example, a person wearing sunglasses indoors
may not be shifty; he may just have an eye infection.)
</P>
<P>
   But here are some of the signals:
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO JUDGE YOUR BOSS
</P>
<P>
   How a supervisor treats employees is tremendously telling.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss is kind, respectful and friendly with employees, he
or she is probably self-confident, compassionate and generous.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss treats employees like servants, he is probably
insecure, domineering, insensitive and uncaring _ not only in the
workplace but in every aspect of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out for personal inconstancies: People don't flip a switch
and consistently treat their employees one way and their spouse
another. Truly kind and confident people do not treat others in
dramatically different ways depending on their mood or their
perception of what someone can do for them.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO JUDGE OUR CO-WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   The better the relationship between a person and his/her
co-workers, the more likely that he is self-confident and
comfortable with his position in life.
</P>
<P>
   Which three character traits are most likely to predict a
person's behavior?
</P>
<P>
   No trait means the same thing in every person or in every
circumstance. But these three characteristics provide consistently
reliable insight into almost everyone, almost all the time:
</P>
<P>
   1. Compassion: Dimitrius uses a `hardness scale' for judging
people _ on one end is the cold, unemotional, uncaring person; on
the other is the warm and compassionate soul. Cold people tend to
be more critical, punitive and self-centered. Warm people tend to
be more forgiving and make decisions more slowly (to give others
the benefit of the doubt).
</P>
<P>
   2. Socioeconomic background: People who have had to scratch and
claw for everything they have, whether financial or emotional, may
develop a siege mentality and retain it all their life. They may
become intolerant, stingy and defensive; on the other end, they
tend to be focused and hard-working. People who have had their
needs fulfilled tend to feel entitled to everything has been handed
to them, they may lack drive.
</P>
<P>
   3. Satisfaction with life: People who have achieved their
personal goals tend to be more compassionate and optimistic. People
who have not tend to be bitter, negative and pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH BODY LANGUAGE
</P>
<P>
   Signs of dishonesty:
</P>
<P>
   Sweating
</P>
<P>
   Shaking
</P>
<P>
   Sincere, furrowed-brow look
</P>
<P>
   Running tongue over teeth
</P>
<P>
   Inappropriate familiarity (back-slapping, touching, invading
personal space)
</P>
<P>
   Signs of anger:
</P>
<P>
   Arms, legs or ankles crossed
</P>
<P>
   Short or rapid breath
</P>
<P>
   Stiff, rigid posture
</P>
<P>
   Pointing fingers
</P>
<P>
   REVEALING ITEMS IN THE WORKPLACE
</P>
<P>
   Desktops: A messy desk points to a messy, disorganized person.
</P>
<P>
   Calendars: Sierra Club or pinup? Far Side or Norman Rockwell?
</P>
<P>
   Books: Don't just look at the subject; look to see if they've
been read.
</P>
<P>
   REVEALING ITEMS AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   Flowers and plants: A person likely to be sensuous, sensitive to
beauty and hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol: Open displays may mean the owner is fond of drinking or
entertaining those who are.
</P>
<P>
   Artwork: If you're attracted to what's hanging on a person's
wall, you may have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Red flag: If someone's home differs dramatically from the way
he/she presents himself/herself publicly, ask yourself, `Which is
authentic?' Usually, the home offers more reliable clues.
</P>
<P>
   TELLING SPEECH PATTERNS
</P>
<P>
   Loud voice: Used to control others, compensate for small stature
or other flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Soft voice: Could suggest lack of confidence (are the words
halting?), but might reflect calm self-assurance if words are
steady and controlled. Could suggest a person who is easily swayed.
</P>
<P>
   Fast speech: Nervousness, anxiety, anger.
</P>
<P>
   Slow speech: Thoughtful, lying, confused.

 &HT;    Travis Prentice big on team, not personal goals
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Travis Prentice is no Louie Armstrong when it
comes to blowing his own horn.
</P>
<P>
   The junior tailback from Louisville, Ky., has played in only 22
games, but is on pace to shatter a flock of Miami and Mid-American
Conference rushing and scoring records.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always bringing the records to my attention,'' the
soft-spoken Prentice said, ``but I'm not really big on personal
goals. The only goal I have is to play on the team that wins the
MAC championship. I just run with the football. If the records
happen, they happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened for the 6-foot-2, 225-pound Prentice last season.
He set school and MAC single-season records with 25 touchdowns and
rushed for 1,549 yards. He was one of eight finalists for the Doak
Walker Award, which goes to the top running back in the country.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, those accomplishments had a major effect on
his confidence level heading into a season that begins with
Saturday's road test at nationally-ranked North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm capable of,'' he said. ``Last year, I
anticipated what I could do. I backed up Ty King (as a redshirt
freshman), but I never started. I know what I can do a lot better
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things he does better is keep coach Randy Walker
scrambling for superlatives. ``Travis has great skills, great
talent and a great work ethic, but he's also a great kid. And that
gives him a chance to be real special.''
</P>
<P>
   Being special this season will be much more difficult for
Prentice. The RedHawks graduated quarterback Sam Ricketts and four
starters in the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bath is expected to run the offense at North Carolina,
although Walker hopes John Schacke will be back in time for the
home opener against Toledo on Sept. 26. Schacke, Ricketts' backup
last year, is still recovering from major knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Walker insisted he won't return to the run-oriented offense that
was his trademark until the 1997 season. ``As good as Travis is, he
can't beat 11 (defenders). We have to soften them up by throwing
the football. I have no question that we're going to be able to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice is an unusual blend of speed and power. He can bench
press over 400 pounds and still runs the 40-yard dash in 4.39
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When most Miami students went home last May, Prentice settled in
for the summer, joining a large contingent of his teammates for
daily workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're stronger,'' he said, ``you can last longer. I try
to treat the fourth quarter like the first quarter. I want to be in
such good condition that I never get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice said the RedHawks are eager for Saturday's shot at the
Tar Heels, who finished 11-1 last season and crushed Virginia Tech
in the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better way to open the season,'' Prentice
said. ``We'll be able to measure ourselves against a big-market
team. Those guys play Florida State and a lot of big-time teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get the publicity those programs do,'' he added,
``but a lot of our guys can play anywhere. We're not going to be
intimidated. There's a respect factor involved. The only way you
get respect is to play well and win. We expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has a storied past as a giant-killer and Walker wants to
continue that tradition. ``I know not many people will give us much
of a chance against North Carolina, but it only matters if 60 guys
(the traveling squad) think they have a chance. That's what
happened at Virginia Tech last year (24-17) and at Northwestern
(30-28) in 1995.''

 &HT;    Travels with Charley turn out all wet
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was beginning to feel like Tom Joad in the ``Grapes of Wrath''
last week while heading down Highway 21 toward Austin, pulling a
small flatbed trailer loaded with second-and even third-hand
furniture. The inside of my Explorer was crammed so full of boxes
and assorted junk that any type of collision would have buried me
in an avalanche of books, dishes and other personal items. I had to
rely on my sideview mirrors to see anything behind me, or to even
know for sure the trailer was still following me.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't so bad. I was moving my daughter back to
Austin, this time to an apartment a her first foray into what at
least bears a passing resemblance to the real world. She had cadged
and cajoled the necessary household items from me and her mom, and
I had volunteered to move her. I figure it's payback for all the
times my dad moved me around in the college years, a rite of
passage for both of us.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't worry about rain. Rain has been rare in these parts for
months.We did have a good thunderstorm the night before we left,
but when I got up at 5 a.m. to prepare to leave, the stars were
shining brightly. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we hit the Trinity River bottom, which I'm happy to
report is looking much greener these days, the clouds had gathered.
In Madisonville, I stopped at Wal-Mart to take stock. It was fixing
to rain, and I had an open-air trailer with a couch, chair and
cheap furniture made out of particle board. We bought tarps,
plastic sheeting and bungee cords. The Wal-Mart cashier knew
exactly what we were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving your daughter back to college, aren't you,'' she said.
``Stuff's going to get wet. That Tropical Storm Charley is heading
right through here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Charley? Somehow I had missed that one, what with
Bonnie churning toward the East Coast. Charley slipped in without
much attention, at least from me, cutting across Southern and
Central Texas and dumping loads of rain.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we hit Bryan-College Station, it was coming down
buckets. I stopped to check the tarp, which was hanging on, since I
had used two dozen bungee cords and several pieces of rope. Still,
it was not good news. Everything on the trailer was soaked from the
bottom up about halfway, because of the water coming off the
pavement. My daughter looked stricken. She would be starting life
in a new apartment with furniture that smelled like mildew.
</P>
<P>
   Our Travels with Charley were not pleasant. The wind howled,
tossing the trailer back and forth along the narrow highway. I
rarely got over 50 mph because of the rain. I worried constantly
about the particle board furniture dissolving on the trailer into a
puddle of wet sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   My brother met us at the apartment to help me unload. I was
still shaking after nearly rear-ending someone on I-35 because I
was watching the side-view mirror, still worrying about the danged
rain. Of course, this is a second-story apartment, which made it
even more fun to carry wet furniture up a flight of stairs in the
rain. We got everything inside, dried it off as best we could, and
surveyed the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The couch is OK; apparently it had some type of waterproofing
stuff on it because it dried quickly. The particle-board
entertainment center was a bit wobbly, and likely will not survive
long enough to be handed down as a family heirloom. Actually, we
survived quite well, all things considered.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter was relieved, though nervous about her first time to
live out on her own. (Dorms don't really count. You don't have to
worry about utilities, groceries, etc.) I reassured her she would
do fine and politely declined her offer to let me put together her
particle-board dresser still in the original box. Time to grow up
and learn how to do that type of stuff yourself, I told her.
Besides, I'm terrible at that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And, I had another date with Charley. I got back in the truck
and headed back the way I came, back to the Pine Curtain a 530
miles driving in one day. The rain lingered until about Crockett.
We here in Deep East Texas got none. The poor folks in West Texas
had floods and loss of life. It could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   I've called her about three times since leaving. Everything's
fine. She even got the dresser together, though she says it took
eight hours. I could have done it in seven, I'm sure.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. I wrote last week about my fear that a recent birthday
meant I was older than anyone playing pro baseball or football.
Good news. Readers have informed me that Dennis Martinez of the
Braves is three months older than me and still on the roster. In
football, Steve DeBerg of the Atlanta Falcons has a couple of years
on me. Middle age is knocking on the door, but it hasn't quite come
in.

 &HT;    Ohio dance troup gains PBS recognition
 &HT;    By Terry Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Filmmakers working on a Public Broadcasting
series about modern dance have been in Dayton this week to record
the making of a new work by the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Madison D. Lacy, who wrote and filmed two of the
programs in the PBS series Eyes on the Prize and is working with
Ken Burns on the upcoming documentary series, Jazz, said the
footage will be used in a three-program series with the working
title of Free to Dance that will be aired in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy and his New York-based crew were shooting performances of
historical black modern dance works by DCDC and other companies the
past summer at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., when
they learned about the collaboration that began in Dayton this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally known choreographers Donald McKayle, 68, and Ronald
Brown, who is in his early 30s, are joining forces for the first
time to make a dance work on DCDC that was commissioned by the
National African-American Museum in Wilberforce as the live
component of an exhibition analyzing the African origins of
physical movements that common throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two choreographers represent different ends of the
generational spectrum. That they had united to create a major
ballet like this one intrigued me,'' Lacy said. ``It fits right in
with our series, which is about the black traditions in American
modern dance. We're hoping to come back and shoot it fully costumed
and performed in February, which will allow us to show the contrast
between the making of it and the finished product.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy's six-member crew includes Horace Ove, who has made several
dance and drama documentaries for the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When African-American modern dance really started to gel in
this country in the 1950s, it was because of people from all over
this country, not just in New York. I like the idea that we're
coming to Dayton to help tell this story. These dancers are
inspiring others. They're influencing movement in places far from
here,'' Lacy said.
</P>
<P>
   McKayle and Brown said there is no title yet for their work in
progress, which is being done to recordings by the Dirty Dozen
Brass Band. They will be here through Sept. 11 before returning for
two more weeks to complete the dance before its premiere at the
Victoria Theatre.

 &HT;    200 march out of Bastrop High over dress code
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An untucked shirt can be a high school
teen-ager's fashion trademark. But to a school administrator in a
society of deadly school shootings, it could be the cover for a
dangerous weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The two views of an untucked shirt collided recently at Bastrop
High School, where school officials' insistence that all shirts be
tucked clashed with some students' drive for individualism. The
result: More than 200 of the school's 1,500 students walked out of
class, gathered in their soccer fields and marched, with police
cars closely following, to what they perceived as the purveyor of
conformity _ the district administration offices.
</P>
<P>
   Three students passed out from heat exhaustion during the
mile-and-a-half march and protest that began at about 10 a.m. and
ended several hours later. They were treated and released from
Smithville Regional Hospital. Martha Hernandez, 16, said the
protest and the district's reaction _ the dress code will be
discussed in a meeting with parents _ demonstrate how strongly both
sides feel.
</P>
<P>
   To students, the rule was meaningless, unfair and a surprise two
weeks into the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to school Tuesday, and they said tuck in your shirt or
go home,'' Hernandez said. ``We didn't like it at all, so we walked
all the way to the administration building.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Villasen(tilde)or, 18, said the threat of concealed weapons
is not a good enough reason to require students to tuck in their
shirts. ``They said we could conceal weapons with our shirts
hanging out,'' he said, ``but you could still take a weapon to
school with a tucked-in shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a school year following two high-profile national cases
of students killing classmates, education officials are nervous
about safety, even when their school has had few weapons problems.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent John Walch said the dress code, adopted this
summer and distributed on the first day of school, will help make
schools safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a heightened awareness of real baggy shirts that can
hide weapons,'' he said. Exceptions will be made for students who
are pregnant or obese.
</P>
<P>
   While walkouts may be rare, student challenges to dress codes
are not, said Barbara Williams, a spokeswoman with the Texas
Association of School Boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the older grades, the kids are trying to express
themselves,'' Williams said. ``We've all been there,'' but there
are things that school officials can do to make dress codes more
acceptable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think where they work best is when a district tries to meet
with parents ahead of time,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frequently get frustrated calls from parents who think the
dress code is too vague. It needs to be clear from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   While Williams says the tension at Bastrop High should
eventually subside, Villasen(tilde)or hopes not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't walk all that way just for nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If students don't voice their opposition to rules like this one,
he said, the next step might be the unthinkable: uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody would go to school if they made us wear
uniforms,'' Villasen(tilde)or said.
</P>
<P>
   Bastrop students are not alone in questioning school dress
codes. At a recent meeting of the San Marcos ISD school board,
students and their supporters spent more than two hours debating a
dress code with school board members.
</P>
<P>
   Bastrop school district students' protests recently reversed a
board decision to prohibit the school band from going to
Disneyworld because of the Disney Corp.'s investment policies.
</P>

 &HT;    HEB in Luling to expand
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LULING, Texas _ They set out close to 400 folding chairs in the
Luling Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, every one was filled. Another hundred people
stood.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens sat next to newborn babies cradled in their
mothers' arms. Farm workers rubbed elbows with chiropractors. Ten
percent of Luling's population _ the same turnout as for the city's
last mayoral election _ gathered Tuesday night for the same reason:
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Luling came to tell the executives of H-E-B Food
Stores Inc. to replace their tiny, cramped, odoriferous H-E-B _ a
former Piggly Wiggly built more than 40 years ago that is the
town's only food store _ with something bigger and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the subject is groceries, people turn out,'' said Luling
Mayor Bryan Nickells.
</P>
<P>
   H-E-B didn't disappoint. Although Luling ranked 16th on a list
of 15 store locations slated for expansion or renovation in 1999,
with some last minute scrambling they swapped with Cleburne for the
15th slot. The room erupted with applause when H-E-B executives
announced the company would pour at least $3.5 million into a new
or renovated Luling store over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a place like Austin, where H-E-B has 34 stores and joins a
half-dozen other grocers, it's rare that residents get overzealous
about groceries. Next year alone, H-E-B has four new stores in the
works for Austin, including a new Central Market gourmet store.
</P>
<P>
   But in Luling, where residents have to drive miles if they want
anything more than the basics, a grocery store is not something to
be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Luling H-E-B, on the corner of Walnut Street and
Highway 90, has less than 10,000 square feet. It looks more like a
convenience store than a supermarket. Inside, there's a strange
rotting smell that even H-E-B officials can't quite explain.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, most of H-E-B's new Austin grocery stores are
nearly eight times that size. The Luling store doesn't even look
like a distant cousin of H-E-B's fancy Central Market, with its
sushi chef, bins full of portobello mushrooms and arugula and
barrels of gourmet coffees.
</P>
<P>
   Luling _ the self-proclaimed Watermelon Capital of the World,
home of the annual Watermelon Thump _ is only about an hour's drive
from downtown Austin, but to some visitors, it's a world away.
</P>
<P>
   The oily smell of sour crude hangs in the air, rising from the
more than 100 pumping oil wells within the Luling city limits. The
city is home to the Central Texas Oil Patch Museum. And it boasts
some of the best barbecue in the state _ in the world, if you ask a
Luling resident.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than 6,000 residents, Luling may be small by most
standards. But folks in this farming and oil town, in Southeast
Caldwell County, don't understand why they should have to drive 15
miles to Lockhart or 23 miles to San Marcos or 22 miles to Seguin
to buy the groceries they need at a full-service supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the super Wal-Mart in San Marcos,'' said Robert J.
Carter, who was born in Luling in 1923 and has lived there ever
since. ``Nearly everybody here goes to the superstores to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiropractor Walter Nickells _ a Luling city council member,
chamber board member and the youngest son of the city's mayor _
said he doesn't expect a fancy Simon David supermarket like the
ones he left behind in Dallas. But his wife refuses to shop at the
Luling H-E-B, which doesn't even stock diapers for their newborn
baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' Nickells said.
</P>
<P>
   For the business leaders of Luling, a town sandwiched between
fast-growing Austin and San Antonio, the flow of dollars outside
city borders has been a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an economic developer, I try to plug the leaks in the
community,'' said Trey Bailey, manager of the Luling Area Chamber
of Commerce. ``There's a tremendous amount of consumer dollars
leaving Luling. This is the biggest leak out of our barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   So at the beginning of 1997, Luling residents formed the
seven-member Grocery Retail Task Force. Although the task force
began meeting with H-E-B officials more than a year ago, the
answers were slow in coming, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   With little concrete information, rumors circulated: H-E-B was
closing the Luling store; H-E-B was building a superstore in
Luling; another grocery chain might be coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a small town, if you don't know what's happening, you make
it up,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tuesday night, they got answers.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1 1/2-hour meeting, the citizens of Luling walked out
into the warm night with an air of triumph that comes with knowing
they could influence a multibillion-dollar corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Their feat is all the more amazing considering the competition
for H-E-B's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The $6 billion San Antonio-based grocery chain has 247 stores
and is growing rapidly, moving into new markets from the suburbs of
Dallas to Monterrey, Mexico. Because it is privately held _ still
owned by the Butt family that founded it 93 years ago in Kerrville
_ its growth is fueled solely by the company's profits. With thin
profit margins, each dollar spent must be carefully weighed. And
more often than not, that money goes into fast-growth areas like
Monterrey, where stores are bringing in $1 million a week.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, said Harvey Mabry, president of H-E-B's food and
drug division, smaller markets like Luling can have a tough time
competing. In these smaller markets, H-E-B has been remodeling,
expanding or building new stores in only two to three towns a year.
Last year, it was Burnet, Raymondville and Hondo.
</P>
<P>
   Luling's expansion was scheduled for 2000. But Mabry said he
didn't want to face hundreds of people with news they would have to
wait two more years for a new store. So on Monday, he urged H-E-B's
managing board to put Luling into the 15th slot. They agreed.
H-E-B's regional team will begin planning Luling's store this week.
One way or another, the project will be completed in 1999, Mabry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Luling leaders hope a new H-E-B store will bring more than just
better produce and more varieties of soup. They said they think a
better grocery store will even help attract more commerce and
residents to their city. Luling has been aggressively courting
small manufacturing plants to help diversify its economy _ an
economy once flush with oil money before the oil bust of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Mary French, a Luling real estate broker and 18-year resident of
the city, said Luling already is attracting people _ and they need
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, she sold homes to families from Colorado and
Las Vegas _ people who could live anywhere else but were lured to
the peaceful, rural atmosphere of Luling, she said. With a median
home price of $58,000, it's more affordable than many of
communities around Austin, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with these attributes, the H-E-B has been a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out here everyday, busting my buns, trying to sell this
community,'' French said. ``Then people come back from the H-E-B
and tell me 'My God, does it ever stink.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserve better.''

 &HT;    The whole story of Bubba and how his mother changed her life
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I only knew Bubba for a short time. I talked with him maybe
twice, though if he said any words I don't remember them. I know
for sure he did not talk
</P>
<P>
   much if he spoke at all. And yet of all the people I've met in
my life as a journalist, I remember
</P>
<P>
   Bubba best.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba - that was his real name - was 10 when we met and dying.
He had a terrible condition with a terrible name that his mother,
who had given birth
</P>
<P>
   to Bubba when she was 15, could say as easily as if she had
earned a Harvard medical degree.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing ``Harvard'' about Bubba or his mother.
They lived in absolutely the sorriest trailer house I have ever
seen. The front door hung
</P>
<P>
   crooked off its hinges and the rust had almost eaten it through.
</P>
<P>
   They were too poor to own a refrigerator so they had a small ice
chest that kept things cool when they had enough money to buy ice,
which was almost
</P>
<P>
   never.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this environment that Bubba was living and dying. In
this place he was lovingly cared for by his mother, who sometimes
worked three jobs and sometimes worked none because she would get
fired for missing shifts while she was tending to her
terminally-ill son.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of Bubba was more than wheeling him around in a
wobbly wheelchair -- which, as I recall, was too wide to go through
the narrow door of the trailer house. It also included the daily
unpleasant ritual of having to suck the mucus out of his lungs,
something Bubba could not do for himself.
</P>
<P>
   This happened within the first few minutes of meeting Bubba. He
began choking and I thought he was going to die right before my
eyes. His mother calmly got up, inserted a tube and saved her son's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives were hard for a number of reasons, but particularly
because of a snag in the state law that allowed aid to be given to
sick children who had a chance to live, but not to children who
were within two years of being terminal cases. Bubba was 10, no one
with Bubba's condition had ever lived beyond 12.
</P>
<P>
   Aid denied.
</P>
<P>
   After I wrote about Bubba, the good folks of Angelina County,
Texas responded in a remarkable fashion. The family got a
refrigerator, contributions of all sorts and kinds and, not
surprisingly, the state reconsidered its denial. This was good
because Bubba would live four more years before he finally
succumbed.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't all of this story and I didn't know the rest
until my telephone rang just this week.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bubba's mother.
</P>
<P>
   After Bubba died, she no longer had much of a purpose in living
-- after all, she'd spent almost all her energy taking care of the
boy. She went into a three-year downward spiral and plumbed the
depths of depression. She stayed in her bed and let the rundown
trailer house go filthy. She didn't work or eat much. She wanted
for all the world to die, just like her son.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day for no particular reason, she decided to get help
for her depression. When she took that first step, she began to
look around her andsee that where she was living had a significant
impact on how she was living. The people around her weren't helping
her overcome her pain and sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   So she moved out to Bonham and took a job as a waitress in a
restaurant. She began to live again, little by little, still poor,
but gaining on pride.
</P>
<P>
   After a while she met a good man who could listen to her
problems.
</P>
<P>
   They got married seven years ago and, with marriage came dreams.
She was a waitress, he could be a businessman. They could open a
restaurant, they
</P>
<P>
   thought.
</P>
<P>
   So on a wish and many prayers, they did just that.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of Los Amigos just off the square in Bonham happened
four, almost five, years ago now. It's a fixture in town and she
and her husband now own a house and rental property.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what she told me as she described her journey from
darkness into light?
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise be to God.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't speak for God, but I'd guess he's pretty impressed with
Bubba's mother himself.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Taking us back to the ballpark
 &HT;    (For release, Sunday, Sept. 6, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have done for baseball this
year, in addition to filling stadiums that otherwise would be near
empty, is return the sport to its raw basic: pitcher throws ball,
batter slams the bejabbers out of it.
</P>
<P>
   For too many recent years, the actual playing of the game has
been influenced by other elements, particularly pitching
terminology I cannot comprehend, or by calls by umpires that are
beyond our recognition.
</P>
<P>
   I have been going to baseball games for close to 60 years but
have never seen a balk. Oh, I've seen them called by umpires, but
I've never actually seen one. The only time baseball fans say they
see a balk is when it isn't one. That's when the pitcher wheels
toward third base, then first base, in an attempt to entrap base
runners and doesn't throw the ball to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a balk. What you can't see, apparently, is a balk.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, and without whipping out my baseball rules book,
a balk is something that happens when the pitcher moves in a way he
shouldn't move. He can be called for moving toward home plate, for
barely moving toward home plate, for imperceptibly moving toward
home plate, for subliminally moving toward home plate and, perhaps,
for thinking about moving toward home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Even instant replay fails to show me any of those moves, but the
expert commentator usually says he sees it, so I believe him; he
once played the game. ``There it is,'' the commentator will exclaim
during the replay. ``He twitched the pinky on his left hand. That's
a balk.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I didn't seem him twitch his pinky.
</P>
<P>
   This is similar to the game of hockey, where no one in the arena
sees the puck whiz past the goaltender, he included. Or in
basketball, where players are called for things such as a 3-second
violation, or illegal defense _ all imperceptible to me. Who ever
has seen the punch Muhammad Ali put on Sonny Liston in their Maine
rematch, and who ever saw a downed and writhing soccer player who
really was hurt?
</P>
<P>
   The game of baseball, until McGwire and Sosa brought it back to
earth, was getting too complicated. Growing up, I knew about fast
balls and curve balls, and made believe I understood the
then-terminology about pitches called inshoots and outshoots. And
there was a 1940s-era pitcher, Rip Sewell, who was blooping high,
arcing balls toward home plate. It was called an epheus pitch _
that word not in any of my dictionaries _ and at least I could see
it, going up and coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are into pitches I certainly cannot discern on the TV
screen, or in the ballpark; pitches such as the circle change, the
split-finger fastball, the cut fastball and the three-seam
something or other. What are they? Who, besides the expert
commentator, knows what they are _ and are those commentators
really bluffing us?
</P>
<P>
   One pitcher the other night was credited on TV with having four
or five different kinds of fastballs. I pondered that and decided
one kind must be 92 miles an hour, another 93 miles an hour, and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   I can separate a fastball from a curve ball, and can spot a
change-up because the batter is fooled into swinging early, but a
circle change? What's that?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball had been slipping past me recently. I was losing touch
with the game because I did not understand the ever-changing
terminology and was doubly confused with baseball players putting
only four fingers into gloves with five-finger openings.
</P>
<P>
   Now I can ignore that for a while. Thanks to McGwire, Sosa and
others, the unsophisticated art of simply crushing a baseball out
of the park has regenerated an interest in baseball that you
couldn't attain in recent years, certainly not with that three-seam
something or other.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: As world heats up, Clinton frozen in place
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has returned from what we may fairly,
alas, call the Pathetic Summit to a worsening sink of foreign
problems that steamy, seamy Monicamess leaves him little authority
to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The president either must find a way, as he and his dwindling
claque like to say, to put this thing behind him (his testimony-day
speechlet suited most of the public but not his scammed colleagues)
or he must think what is to him nearly unthinkable. He must think
of getting out of the way and letting Vice President Al Gore take
command.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Clinton is running an empty presidency. The drain had
begun even before the mea-first culpa in which the president
admitted to whoopee he had denied to the public in general and to
his closest circle in person. Like a kid who has wasted his
allowance on trifles, the president has nothing to spend at the end
of the week and nothing to show for what he had at the beginning of
it.
</P>
<P>
   This Monica-borne weakness was already implicated when Clinton,
rather than definitively confronting Saddam Hussein last spring
over Iraq's disruption of arms inspections, took eager refuge in
the uncertain diplomatic shelter U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
had arranged.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness showed, too, when the president cut Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright off at the knees after she had set a
deadline for Israeli movement in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton couldn't stand up to a Congress charging that the
administration was dictating to Israel, when Albright was intending
only to set out U.S. guidelines for an eventual settlement _
admittedly additional pressure on Israel but hardly marching
orders. The peace process is now mired both in Israel's internal
political standoff and in Clinton's own political bog.
</P>
<P>
   The president's trip to an economically and politically
imploding Russia was marginally useful in its show of U.S. concern
_ and canceling it would have flashed exactly the wrong semaphore _
but Clinton could bring no credible message of durable U.S.
commitment. He is too ephemeral a figure himself for that.
</P>
<P>
   Unfairly but to ill effect even so, the president's motive was
widely questioned when he struck back at terrorists who had bombed
two U.S. embassies; his domestic predicament makes such doubts
inevitable. And with timing as exquisite as Jack Benny's, though he
isn't half as funny, Saddam Hussein has run the arms inspectors off
again_ and looks likely to get away with it because the White House
can rally no multilateral effort against him.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have taken up nuclear arms. North Korea says
it still forswears them but is sly about it and has started lobbing
ballistic missiles into Japan's seas. And the Serbs are once again
getting away with murder, this time in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   None of these matters is wholly a result of the president's
troubles at home but each is being left to drift dangerously
because of those troubles. A victim both of his own misadventures
and of a political vendetta that finagled subpoena power, Clinton
is preoccupied with his political survival. That's understandable.
It is not acceptable.

 &HT;    Boy to sell Beanie Baby to help mom
 &HT;    By Aaron Porter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTROSE, Colo. _ The furor over Beanie Babies, stuffed animals
tagged with ``personal information'' about the doll, has reached a
fevered pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to cash in on the craze, Cody Davis plans to sell one of
his prized Beanie Babies to finance his mother's cancer treatment
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep him,'' said 11-year-old Cody, ``but not if it
can help Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Davis family was floored when his mother Nancy was diagnosed
with an extremely aggressive form of breast cancer in April.
Thought to be in a low-risk category, Nancy can only wonder what
caused the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we knew what gave her cancer,'' Cody said, ``because
we'd never do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody's grandparents obtained a Beanie Baby called ``Glory'' for
him while attending the 1998 Major League Baseball All Star Game in
Denver. Covered with stars, the small bear is kept in a plastic
case with a ticket stub from the game and a certificate of
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   To raise money for his mother's treatment, bids are being
accepted on ``Glory'' through Sept. 12. The highest bidder gets the
doll, Cody said.
</P>
<P>
   A Beanie Baby collector for some time, Cody now has 31 of the
stuffed dolls, all wrapped in plastic and sitting on a shelf. They
are not for playing, the fifth-grader said adamantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like collecting them,'' Cody explained.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in Beanie Babies is not unusual. According to Dora
Cornman, owner of the Hallmark Shop in Montrose, people of all ages
and all walks of life spend ``megabucks'' on their burgeoning
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Some simply like the stuffed animals, but most see it as a
financial investment, Cornman said. The craze has inflated prices
on some dolls dramatically, with Beanie Babies retailing for less
than $6 being sold to collectors for hundreds of dollars, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the buyer needs to be aware and understand what
they're investing in,'' Cornman said with a laugh. ``It's like the
stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody hopes for a good return, because the Davis family's
insurance company is unwilling to pay for the $50,000 cancer
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy is scheduled for a stem-cell transplant at Rocky Mountain
Cancer Center in September. During the cutting-edge treatment,
doctors will remove stem cells from her bone marrow, bombard her
body with high doses of chemotherapy, then replace the stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very confident that it's going to turn out OK,'' Nancy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis family attributes their ability to cope with the
cancer to a deep-seated faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hang onto our faith in God,'' Nancy said. ``We're trying
not to dwell on the scary part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they have come through this real good and through
their faith they've really coped with the trial that they're going
through,'' said their pastor, Ronnie Hanna of Montrose Christian
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Bids for the doll are being accepted by Cody, care of General
Delivery, Montrose Post Office, Montrose CO 91401.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: AS DOLLARS WENT WEST, RUBLES WENT SOUTH
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 6.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Russia had a government, it would be flat broke.
Before being shown the door, the prior government defaulted on $40
billion in short-term debt _ money that was mostly sucked out of
the country with its connivance by the ruling oligarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dollars that the International Monetary Fund had
been shoveling into Russia to keep what amounted to an official
Ponzi scheme going are gone. Many of those dollars left in
ruble-to-dollar transfers, to be stashed in distant safe havens.
</P>
<P>
   What remained of the IMF loans went back into the pockets of
Western bankers and governments _ repaying earlier credits that,
left unrepaid, would have accelerated the debacle. Precious little
went to develop natural resources, where it would have done the
most good.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was too much to hope that, after 70 years of
stultifying communism, reform would take hold. But there's really
no way of knowing, because real reform has never been tried in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   How Russia's oligarchs, ensconced in their armored limousines,
must have snickered into their cell phones over President Clinton's
pep talk to the Moscow university students. Listening to his brave
words, they must have imagined that Clinton lives on another
planet, which, in a sense, he does.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on this planet, missile flight trumps capital flight.
Even if the IMF fails to pay up, an embittered Russia is not about
to revive the Cold War or threaten to start a hot one with
Washington. But a new Kremlin strongman could revive old
relationships with the likes of Libya, Iraq and Syria, undoubtedly
involving military technology transfers. And that in turn imperils
Western interests.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF mandarins in Washington recognize those risks. At the
same time, they are no mood to fork over the next installment of
the remaining $23 billion rescue package _ on the reasonable
grounds that it would be wasted and stolen as well. So what to do?
</P>
<P>
   One solution making the top-level rounds here would do away with
the ruble and put Russia on a firm all-dollar diet. A fully
convertible ruble would have the same result, besides saving any
remaining shreds of Russian honor. In either case, just so many
rubles would circulate _ backed by dollar reserves.
</P>
<P>
   As matters stand, Russians already hold more dollars than
rubles, some $40 billion versus merely $8.5 billion of their own
diluted currency. In fact, more U.S. greenbacks remain in Russian
hands than circulate in the United States, where checks, credit
cards and electronic transfers are the norm in settling debts.
</P>
<P>
   A glut of oil and other commodities has caused world prices to
plunge, sending a fatal monetary torpedo crashing into an already
listing Russian hull. Ironically, Russia faces the prospect of
hyperinflation at a time when deflation poses the biggest risk to
most other major countries.
</P>
<P>
   Making the dollar Russia's reserve currency would free up IMF
funding. It may bring out of hiding stashes of $100 bills tucked
into cookie jars or parked in foreign bank vaults. They would then
be available to pay workers and buy raw materials, giving the
Russian people yet another chance to make a fresh start.

   BREAST-CANCER (San Francisco) _ Joy Fudem had gone through
radiation, three kinds of hormonal therapies, hit her limit on
chemotherapy and undergone a bone marrow transplant when she
learned last year that she finally was picked in a lottery to
receive the experimental breast cancer drug Herceptin. Soon, women
with Fudem's kind of cancer won't have to rely on chance to get
Herceptin, the first genetically-engineered breast cancer drug. By
ULYSSES TORASSA.

<P>
   INVESTMENT-CLUB (Cohoes, N.Y.) _ Arnold Galarneau was ready for
the meeting of his investment club with a file folder full of
research on stocks the club might buy in the wake of Monday's stock
market plunge. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more
than 512 points on Monday. To Galarneau, it was just an
overreaction. By JO-ANN JOHNSTON.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-LUNCHES (Albany, N.Y.) _ It's the start of the annual
parental back-to-school quandary over what to pack their kids for
lunch. ``It's a tough situation for parents because they want to
send a school lunch that's reasonably healthy and nutritious, but
it has to be something their child will actually eat or it just
sits in the lunch box and does nobody any good,'' said
nutritionist. By PAUL GRONDAHL.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTING-ART (Albany, N.Y.) _ The landed gentry in America began
commissioning sporting art in the early 19th century, with Edward
Troye (1808-1874) among the more prominent during this time.
Another artist, George Stubbs, was among the first to study the
anatomy of the horse. By FRANCES INGRAHAM.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Bill Clinton had to go Russia to
get away from Monica. Willie Brown has to go to China to get away
from questions about San Francisco's bus system, Muni.
Unfortunately for Brown, he doesn't leave for two weeks. Who knows
what could happen? Angry voters could storm City Hall _ if they
don't mind walking to the Civic Center. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-POLITICS (San Francisco) _ In politics, sometimes it's
better to be lucky than good. Just how good Matt Fong is remains
unclear, but he seems lucky. The Republican nominee for Senate is
running against pro-Clinton Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer at a
time when a lot of people are disgusted with the president. And
Fong is a symbol of hope for Chinese Americans who yearn for
political legitimacy. By WILLIAM WONG.
</P>
<P>
   WWII-SURRENDER (San Francisco) _ Thursday was the 53rd
anniversary of the unconditional surrender of Japan. The insistence
on unconditional surrender is one of the World War II's most
important and meaningful legacies. Whether or not it is a legacy
worth continuing depends on which we want more: peace, or a pause
between wars. By CYNTHIA BASS.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're under 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel to
``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting Golden Retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG
</P>
<P>
   At least visually, this update of the '60s British TV series
pays witty homage to the original's vein of Carnaby Street
surrealism. In between sips of champagne and civilized quips,
secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma
Thurman) foil criminals plotting against the British government.
But there are two main problems: a half-baked script and Thurman,
who is trumped by the cool, feline memory of Diana Rigg, who
originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball R
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for the rude boys of summer. In the wake of the
Farrelly Brothers and ``There's Something About Mary,'' here come
``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in another
zesty, disgusting, laugh-out-loud comedy. Parker and Stone play two
slackers who invent a hybrid of baseball and basketball that
becomes a national sport. The movie manages to be racist, sexist,
homophobic and just about everything else. But it does so in a way
that kiddingly tweaks the very notion of political correctness.
Rated R for profanity, gross-out humor. 1 hour, 43 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss R
</P>
<P>
   Harmless, mildly entertaining and completely disposable, this is
the movie equivalent of Richard Simmons. A cute, funny,
romantically minded photographer named Billy (Sean P. Hayes) falls
for a gorgeous hunk (Brad Rowe) who may or may not be gay, but who
keeps himself tantalizingly available. (Though for what? Friendship
or love?) Rated R for language, sex and drug references. 1 hour, 32
minutes. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting blood-sucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action beomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heartthrob title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a smalltown high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a Prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   54 R
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan nightclub Studio 54 was a late-'70s blast of
neo-Roman decadence where everyone could be fabulous.
Unfortunately, writer-director Mark Christopher gives us a tired,
creaky fable about a smalltown stud (Ryan Phillippe) who gets
seduced by the limelight, almost loses himself, but gets saved by
the right girl. The movie is as meek as Studio 54 was outrageous.
Rated R for sexuality, profanity, drug use. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Governess R
</P>
<P>
   Where's Mary Poppins when you need her? In the 1840s, a young
Jewish woman (Minnie Driver) poses as a Christian in order to
secure a job with a wealthy family on a remote Scottish island and
help her own debt-stricken family. The film tries to deliver a
treatise on religious bigotry plus a dollop of feminism within the
context of a fevered bodice-ripper. What evolves is an over-busy
movie with under-realized potential. Rated R for sexual scenes and
nudity. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>

   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-

   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B

   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious red-headed orphan living in
a girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B+

   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning newcomer, Catherine Zeta-Jones) from
the evil schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert
blend of panache, romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor.
Rated PG-13 for violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-

   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland R
</P>
<P>
   A small wonder in its own modest way. This charming low-budget
romantic comedy about the relationship travails of a Boston nurse
(Hope Davis) is stronger on character nuance than on plot; in fact,
filmmaker Brad Anderson loads it with too much plot. But by
applying a naturalistic independent-film sensibility to a vintage
glossy-Hollywood predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Rated R
for vulgar language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth identical
twins who meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting
their divorced parents. FAX machines and ``Leo'' DiCaprio
references dot this modernized tale. Young kids may fidget at the
length and several kissing scenes. Rated PG for mild profanity and
alcohol use. 2 hours, 7 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Passion in the Desert PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A desert reverie about the bond between man and beast. In the
late 18th century, an officer in Napoleon's army get separated from
the rest of the troop and wanders through the Egyptian desert until
he finds refuge in some ancient ruins. His sole companion? A lithe,
solitary, potentially man-eating leopard. A striking, strangely
lyrical, daringly original film about discovering your inner
cat-person. Rated PG-13 for violence and nudity. 1 hour, 33
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B

</P>
<P>
   Warning to anyone whose math paranoia dates back to 8th-grade
algebra: Darren Aronovsky has your number(s). In his technically
and intellectually brilliant film, a solitary math prodigy (Sean
Gulette) stumbles onto a number that could be the key to everything
unknowable in the universe, be it the stock market or god. Named
best director at Sundance, Aronovsky is clearly a talent to be
watched; hopefully, next time, he'll wed his head-trip images to a
more involving script. Rated R for vulgar language and grotesque
violence. 1 hour, 25 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise R
</P>
<P>
   Hardly paradise. Three guys party hard together in Malaysia. Two
(Vince Vaughn, David Conrad) return home and find out, two years
later from a lawyer (Anne Heche), that the third (Joaquin Phoenix)
has been jailed on drug charges since they left and will be hanged
in eight days unless they return to share the responsibility. But
that also means sharing the jail time. It's a terriifc,
what-would-you-do moral dilemma that's squandered by an inept
script. Rated R for language, drug references and a brief sex
scene. 1 hour, 49 minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all 'round here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A

<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+

   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-

<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological; the other spiritual) body. Rambling
and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that suggests
the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still definitely worth a
look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+

<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way.
But the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.
Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language. 1 hour, 58
minutes. (SM) Grade: B

   The Thief R
</P>
<P>
   This Russian fable of fathers and sons will steal into your
heart. In 1952, as Stalin inflicts his style of `'paternalism'' on
the Soviet Union, a six-year -old boy and his young widowed mom are
wooed by a charming soldier (Vladmir Mashkov) who isn't what he
seems. As allegories go, this one's pretty transparent. But the
film's considerable strength lies in its poetic vignettes, telling
visual details and three wonderful performances. A 1998 Oscar
nominee for best foreign-language film. Rated R for sex, nudity and
language. Subtitles. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>

   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A

   Why Do Fools Fall in Love R
</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively. The high note of this affectionate production is in
the performances. Rated R for language, sex scenes and drug use. 2
hours, 3 minutes. (Hollywood Reporter) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Wrongfully Accused PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The sultan of spoof, Leslie Nielsen (``Airplane,'' ``The Naked

``The Fugitive'' and ``Mission: Impossible.'' Co-starring Richard
Crenna and Kelly Le Brock. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM) Grade:
B-
</P>

   Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors R
</P>
<P>
   With friends (and neighbors) like these . . . Neil LaBute, who
did the lacerating ``In the Company of Men,'' suffers a sophomore
slump of sorts in this black comedy about sex games and power plays
among six thirtysomething urbanites, some paired off, some not. The
movie is smart, funny and cynical, but never as smart, funny and
cynical as it thinks it is. The result is less like first-rate Neil
LaBute than second-rung Woody Allen. Rated R for sex and language.
1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+

   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're under 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel to
``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting Golden Retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG
</P>
<P>
   At least visually, this update of the '60s British TV series
pays witty homage to the original's vein of Carnaby Street
surrealism. In between sips of champagne and civilized quips,
secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma
Thurman) foil criminals plotting against the British government.
But there are two main problems: a half-baked script and Thurman,
who is trumped by the cool, feline memory of Diana Rigg, who
originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball R
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for the rude boys of summer. In the wake of the
Farrelly Brothers and ``There's Something About Mary,'' here come
``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in another
zesty, disgusting, laugh-out-loud comedy. Parker and Stone play two
slackers who invent a hybrid of baseball and basketball that
becomes a national sport. The movie manages to be racist, sexist,
homophobic and just about everything else. But it does so in a way
that kiddingly tweaks the very notion of political correctness.
Rated R for profanity, gross-out humor. 1 hour, 43 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss R
</P>
<P>
   Harmless, mildly entertaining and completely disposable, this is
the movie equivalent of Richard Simmons. A cute, funny,
romantically minded photographer named Billy (Sean P. Hayes) falls
for a gorgeous hunk (Brad Rowe) who may or may not be gay, but who
keeps himself tantalizingly available. (Though for what? Friendship
or love?) Rated R for language, sex and drug references. 1 hour, 32
minutes. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting blood-sucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action beomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heartthrob title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a smalltown high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a Prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+

   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A

   54 R
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan nightclub Studio 54 was a late-'70s blast of
neo-Roman decadence where everyone could be fabulous.
Unfortunately, writer-director Mark Christopher gives us a tired,
creaky fable about a smalltown stud (Ryan Phillippe) who gets
seduced by the limelight, almost loses himself, but gets saved by
the right girl. The movie is as meek as Studio 54 was outrageous.
Rated R for sexuality, profanity, drug use. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C

<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)

   The Governess R
</P>
<P>
   Where's Mary Poppins when you need her? In the 1840s, a young
Jewish woman (Minnie Driver) poses as a Christian in order to
secure a job with a wealthy family on a remote Scottish island and
help her own debt-stricken family. The film tries to deliver a
treatise on religious bigotry plus a dollop of feminism within the
context of a fevered bodice-ripper. What evolves is an over-busy
movie with under-realized potential. Rated R for sexual scenes and
nudity. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: C

   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>

   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious red-headed orphan living in
a girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B+
</P>

   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning newcomer, Catherine Zeta-Jones) from
the evil schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert
blend of panache, romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor.
Rated PG-13 for violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-

   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A

<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland R
</P>
<P>
   A small wonder in its own modest way. This charming low-budget
romantic comedy about the relationship travails of a Boston nurse
(Hope Davis) is stronger on character nuance than on plot; in fact,
filmmaker Brad Anderson loads it with too much plot. But by
applying a naturalistic independent-film sensibility to a vintage
glossy-Hollywood predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Rated R
for vulgar language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth identical
twins who meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting
their divorced parents. FAX machines and ``Leo'' DiCaprio
references dot this modernized tale. Young kids may fidget at the
length and several kissing scenes. Rated PG for mild profanity and
alcohol use. 2 hours, 7 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Passion in the Desert PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A desert reverie about the bond between man and beast. In the
late 18th century, an officer in Napoleon's army get separated from
the rest of the troop and wanders through the Egyptian desert until
he finds refuge in some ancient ruins. His sole companion? A lithe,
solitary, potentially man-eating leopard. A striking, strangely
lyrical, daringly original film about discovering your inner
cat-person. Rated PG-13 for violence and nudity. 1 hour, 33
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   (pi) R
</P>
<P>
   Warning to anyone whose math paranoia dates back to 8th-grade
algebra: Darren Aronovsky has your number(s). In his technically
and intellectually brilliant film, a solitary math prodigy (Sean
Gulette) stumbles onto a number that could be the key to everything
unknowable in the universe, be it the stock market or god. Named
best director at Sundance, Aronovsky is clearly a talent to be
watched; hopefully, next time, he'll wed his head-trip images to a
more involving script. Rated R for vulgar language and grotesque
violence. 1 hour, 25 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise R
</P>
<P>
   Hardly paradise. Three guys party hard together in Malaysia. Two
(Vince Vaughn, David Conrad) return home and find out, two years
later from a lawyer (Anne Heche), that the third (Joaquin Phoenix)
has been jailed on drug charges since they left and will be hanged
in eight days unless they return to share the responsibility. But
that also means sharing the jail time. It's a terriifc,
what-would-you-do moral dilemma that's squandered by an inept
script. Rated R for language, drug references and a brief sex
scene. 1 hour, 49 minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all 'round here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological; the other spiritual) body. Rambling
and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that suggests
the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still definitely worth a
look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way.
But the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.
Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language. 1 hour, 58
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Thief R
</P>
<P>
   This Russian fable of fathers and sons will steal into your
heart. In 1952, as Stalin inflicts his style of `'paternalism'' on
the Soviet Union, a six-year -old boy and his young widowed mom are
wooed by a charming soldier (Vladmir Mashkov) who isn't what he
seems. As allegories go, this one's pretty transparent. But the
film's considerable strength lies in its poetic vignettes, telling
visual details and three wonderful performances. A 1998 Oscar
nominee for best foreign-language film. Rated R for sex, nudity and
language. Subtitles. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Why Do Fools Fall in Love R
</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively. The high note of this affectionate production is in
the performances. Rated R for language, sex scenes and drug use. 2
hours, 3 minutes. (Hollywood Reporter) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Wrongfully Accused PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The sultan of spoof, Leslie Nielsen (``Airplane,'' ``The Naked
Gun'') stars in this gag-glutted comedy that skewers such movies as
``The Fugitive'' and ``Mission: Impossible.'' Co-starring Richard
Crenna and Kelly Le Brock. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM) Grade:
B-
</P>
<P>
   Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors R
</P>
<P>
   With friends (and neighbors) like these . . . Neil LaBute, who
did the lacerating ``In the Company of Men,'' suffers a sophomore
slump of sorts in this black comedy about sex games and power plays
among six thirtysomething urbanites, some paired off, some not. The
movie is smart, funny and cynical, but never as smart, funny and
cynical as it thinks it is. The result is less like first-rate Neil
LaBute than second-rung Woody Allen. Rated R for sex and language.
1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+

 No. 484 for Sept. 3.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Sept. 2-3, 1998. We're with you, Christie Brinkley! No one
should take you less seriously just because you take your clothes
off for Playboy at your age, and we do realize the gravity of your
situation, says the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild, and this
is BONG Bull No. 484!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAUGHT. &LR;  Old habits die hard in this business. But Rory
Thompson of InformationWeek magazine caught the unattributed quote
in BB 483. It was Rear Adm. Grace Hopper who said it. Thompson's
colleague Senior Editor Rich Levin includes the following in his
e-mail signature, according to Thompson:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to apologize than to get permission.'' _ RADM
Grace Hopper (1906-1992), co-inventor of the COBOL programming
language, pioneer computer programmer, and the woman incorrectly
credited with coining the word `bug' to describe a software
defect.''
</P>
<P>
   (Incorrectly credited? Yes, there is such a thing as
overcrediting.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE 6-POINT BENDAY RULE. &LR;  What college-educated professional
can forget the day the senior professor of the journalism
department came into the classroom in that last week of class, sent
all the audit students and other guests out, locked the door and
solemnly intoned the holy writ of the 6-Point Benday Rule? Not
Gerard Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most J-schools even teach the 6-Point Benday
Rule anymore, much less require students to memorize or recite it.
Me? I've got it engraved in a brass plaque hanging over my desk,
and try to live by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, though not quite professing journalism but certainly
employed by a major Southwestern institution of higher tuition,
reminisced, ``As I recall from my student days (I was an English
major and journalism minor at The University of Texas), the only
thing any J-school prof ever required us to memorize, other than
our own names and the general area of campus where the class was
taught, was the First Amendment. 'Tis true; Marvin Olasky used it
as the single question in his daily 10-point quiz about six times
during the summer session, on an all-or-nothing grading system.
Misplace a comma? That's a zero; now go petition the government for
the redress of your grievance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND CANDY. &LR;  Isn't someone supposed to be checking the water in
New York? Is there a paper glut that other publishers haven't heard
about? Don't offer your novel to Ballantine unless it's the caliber
of their new release, ``How To Heal the Hurt by Hating,'' by
performance artist Anita Liberty (139 pp., $10.95, paperback).
</P>
<P>
   Liberty is in fact comedian Suzanne Weber.
</P>
<P>
   She begins, ``My boyfriend, Mitchell, whom I dated for three and
a half years, left me for a woman named Heather and, to get even, I
have devoted my entire career to humiliating him in public.''
</P>
<P>
   A sample of her thought: ``I used to have dreams that Mitchell
came back to me. I still do. But now I call them nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   (Full disclosure statement: Ballantine rejected BONG Chief
Copyboy Charley Stough's blockbuster novel this week and, to get
even, he has devoted his entire career to publicizing the next
press release Ballantine sent in. Any public humiliation is their
doing. Dang, it's great to be a columnist.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMIX SECTION. &LR;  The Further Adventures of Herman ``Speed''
Graphic, Ace Photographer for the Chagrin Falls Commercial
Scimitar, and his Faithful Companion, Typo the Wonder Pig.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL ONE: &LR;  The Deft Duo zoom to Russia and Ireland with the
presidential expedition, using the copy desk coffee urn, which
converts to a low-orbit rocket with the addition of a Do-Good
Pellet from the pocket of Speed's trenchcoat, a deathbed gift from
an ancient mystic wire service executive editor on a fog-shrouded
Eastern island.
</P>
<P>
   Typo warns, ``Stash the urn carefully, Boss! This use renders
the contents a potent aphrodisiac! Only copy editors are immune!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL TWO: &LR;  Speed defends, ``I don't think there ARE any
contents left, Typo! One taste, and those Russian guys dumped it
all on the radioactive steppes!''
</P>
<P>
   Typo suggests, ``Well, it would've been different if the women
over there didn't eat so many onions!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL THREE: &LR;  Speed marvels, ``I just love the Irish, don't
you, Typo? Always colorful groups parading nowhere, and the crowds
responding with such heavy confetti, and the police and army
tossing back rubber bullets! It's almost like New Orleans Mardi
Gras!''
</P>
<P>
   Typo explains, ``Um, yes, well, just let me write the captions
on this batch, Boss! But wait! Look, in that riverdancing SWAT
team, it's Ursula, my unrequited love! Ursula, Ursula, you've come
back to me...!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL FOUR: &LR;  Before Speed can intervene, the panel is obscured
by popout lettering reading kataSTOMP kataSTOMP kataSTOMP
kataSTOMP!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL FIVE: &LR;  Speed comforts his pal, declaring, ``Just lie
easy, Typo! Amnesty International is sending a contusion team!''
</P>
<P>
   Typo responds, ``Never mind that, Boss! Wasn't she wonderful in
those tapboots? Is there any wonder the music is so popular? Can
you see why I love her so hopelessly...?''

THE JOYS OF CLAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Sept. 8)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a close-up look at job satisfaction go roam a mud flat with
a clammer on an summer morning before the sun comes up.
</P>
<P>
   Clamming is plain, honest labor, no frills, no middle
management, no job evaluation. You have your clamming permit, your
boat, your boots, your clamming fork. You hone in on the clams,
dig, deliver and get paid before you go home.
</P>
<P>
   The clammer does not worry about being replaced by a computer or
forced into early retirement. Like a ballet dancer, the clammer can
work as long as his knees hold up.
</P>
<P>
   My nephew digs clams in the waters off Ipswich, Mass., where
he's lived since he was a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   He says of the life, ``It's simple and it's good.'' He loves the
freedom, the exercise and getting to work in his favorite place in
the world. He isn't making a fortune but he's the least stressed
person in my family.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 in the morning Paul wades out from Eagle Hill landing to
where his boat is anchored. A full moon dangles just over his head
and the water is as calm as a pond. Soon there is the pre-dawn
growling of motors from a dozen or so boats and greetings among men
who look and talk like extras in ``Good Will Hunting.'' They drive
off like they're in a road race, hand on the throttle, balancing
coffee mug and cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   It is cold and the light is just becoming rosy as we zing past
moored sailboats and sleeping cottages and come to a place where
you can hear waves breaking but can't see them. A clump of Plum
Island stands between us and the actual Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The mud is lumpy and full of puddles and tiny craters, like a
brown gooey moon surface. Paul grabs a wire basket, an onion bag
and starts digging.
</P>
<P>
   Clammers here seek the soft shelled Ipswich clam named for the
town. What they come up with today will end up in local clam
shacks, Boston restaurants and on fancy seafood menus around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The skill is in knowing where to go and working fast. Paul fills
a basket with about 35 pounds of clams in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Clammers work at the whim and order of Mother Nature. They dig
at low tide, starting two hours before the tide gets to its lowest
point, which on this day is 8 a.m. and then two hours after.
</P>
<P>
   The flats have been closed for five days because of rain and
there's a hurricane warning down the coast. Whenever there's a
half-inch of rain there's an automatic rainfall closure because of
runoff pollution into the water. ``You have to give the clams time
to clean themselves,'' Paul explains.
</P>
<P>
   Now each clammer hurriedly stakes a territory, not crowding each
other but getting close enough to yell out if they had something to
say. Mostly they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bunch of lonely old boys,'' Paul says with a smile
when I ask him what he thinks about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women. Or you focus on the work or plan the rest of your
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bent over their work, clammers look like those wooden bottoms-up
cutouts people put on their lawns that are supposed to resemble a
gardener perched over her petunias.
</P>
<P>
   There are two styles of bending, with locked knees or doing a
little bounce and keeping the knees loose. Paul does the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first basket your body loosens up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Up close all you hear are the sounds of fork hitting shell and
boots lifting out of sucking mud. Here's the rule: Push the toe in
and pull the heel up to disengage your boot.
</P>
<P>
   Paul was 10 years old the first time his father, a newspaper
editor and occasional recreational clammer, took him out. ``My back
killed me. I thought this is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he says, ``This is God's country. No people, no traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are no restrooms and nobody nearby with a muffin
cart.
</P>
<P>
   Clammers smell of sweat and Skin So Soft, the all-purpose bug
fighter that people on this shore are more allegiant to than
sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs are the clammer's nemesis. The north shore gets chewed up
every summer by greenheads, which cling and bite like horseflies,
but clammers dread the midgies. They can swarm on a person like a
scene in African Queen, burrowing into the hair, nose and ears.
Sometimes even when it's hot and humid, Paul wears a turtleneck and
a bandanna over his ears and nose to thwart the midgies. They're
bad at sunrise and sunset but today we're in luck. Maybe the
midgies got stuck overnight in Essex.
</P>
<P>
   Paul doesn't wear gloves but sticks his bare hands deep into the
muck. ``It's the only way to feel the clams,'' he says. Unlike
modern fishing and lobstering, which uses sonar detection, the
clammer has only his hands and his sixth sense to sleuth out the
clams.
</P>
<P>
   It makes it more fair, says Paul. ``Clams have more of a chance
than lobsters do.''
</P>
<P>
   He digs 180 pounds which is the maximum limit each day. At $2 a
pound, the primo price for Ipswich digger, that's $360 and it's not
even lunch time.
</P>
<P>
   As he pilots us home through the thick green maze of the marsh
grasses some Canada geese fly over. Paul grins like Leonardo
DiCaprio at the bow of the Titanic.

SPORTING ART A WINNER WITH THE LANDED GENTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sporting art became popular in England in the
early to mid-18th century, when artists began depicting the
favorite and prized animals of their patrons or royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Early scenes were of fox-hunting and racing. Most artists worked
in oils, for which they could charge more than drawings or
watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   The landed gentry in America began commissioning sporting art in
the early 19th century, with Edward Troye (1808-1874) among the
more prominent during this time, according to John von Stade,
president of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   George Stubbs was the first of the sporting artists to study the
anatomy of the horse, delineating from the outer skin to the
skeleton, von Stade said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early sporting artists depicted horses to look like rocking
horses, where the two front legs went in a forward direction and
the two rear went backwards,'' von Stade said. ``But Stubbs painted
them the way they really looked, especially when moving under
various gates, from a walk to a gallop. He defined the athletic
anatomy of the horse. Stubbs was the most original of all sporting
and animal painters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men dominated this field until the later part of the 19th
century, when there were a few women artists,'' von Stade said.
``But even then, they were far and few between until the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Some artists collaborated. ``One artist would paint the
landscape and background, while another artist would paint the
animals and figures,'' von Stade said.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the painting usually depended on the materials at
hand, which ranged from canvas to wood, how much the patron valued
their animal and what they would be willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   According to von Stade, early sporting art by noted painters
sell anywhere today from $25,000 to $500,000. Works by Stubbs and
British artist Sir Alfred Munnings, who died in 1959, have sold for
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Famous sporting painter Benjamin Marshall was well known for his
hunting, racing and game shooting scenes. ``I discovered many a man
who will pay me 50 guineas for painting his horse, who thinks 10
guineas too much for painting his wife,'' he once said.

 &HT;    KUWAITIS WARILY WATCH U.S. POLICY ON IRAQ, QUESTION ITS
INTENTIONS
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Sept. 5 And Thereafter.

<P>
   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ Billboards in this modern, rebuilt capital
warn the people of this oil-rich nation not to forget their POWs --
the more than 600 thought to be held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A few bombed-out buildings downtown still stand like incongruous
war memorials amid the gleaming towers of the sterile city.
</P>
<P>
   And every Kuwaiti has a tale of their life under or flight from
Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's citizens are keenly aware that Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein still rules and blusters just beyond the border of their
two countries, posing a constant threat. And, they closely followed
recent reports that the United States is allegedly changing its
strategy for keeping Hussein in check.
</P>
<P>
   But they take comfort in the 3,500 U.S. troops out in the
deserts protecting their cities. Also, many in Kuwait -- both the
740,000 Kuwaiti citizens and their 1.1 million foreign workers --
are just tired of the annual Saddam-inspired crises.
</P>
<P>
   They have played host to Hussein's invasion and then Desert
Shield, Storm and Sabre. They stocked up on gas masks when last
year's Desert Thunder looked like another war-in-the-making. Their
newspapers report on the ongoing ``Intrinsic Action'' exercises
that keep American and Kuwaiti troops in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that, unless the United States is serious about
knocking Hussein out of power, they would rather avoid the huge
military build-ups that have raised regional blood pressures in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like they are in for a quieter United States, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Compare today to last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Hussein closed the door on United Nations weapons
inspections in eight of his palaces. The U.S. aircraft carriers and
troops of Desert Thunder swooped into the region. With American
officials saying that diplomacy will not work without the threat of
force, the build-up continued until a U.N. agreement diffused the
crisis in February.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hussein went further in cutting off all new
inspections. But the United States has not increased its forces in
Kuwait. Instead, it awaits action from the U.N., which is holding
Iraq under the weight of crushing economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis look on with concern, but also a case of what might be
called build-up fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much sure about the solid position of the United
States vis-a-vis Iraq,'' said Sulaiman Majed Al-shaheen(CQ),
under-secretary of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a
recent interview with Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our friends in the United States realize . . . that when
Saddam Hussein says a word, we find that there is an alert, a
warning, the moving of carriers to the gulf. Suddenly, we find that
everything becomes so calm,'' Al-shaheen said. ``That game costs
that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides that, there is the accusation, whether it be right or
wrong,'' he added carefully, ``that the United States comes to the
(Persian) Gulf only to show and not to take actions.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Al-shaheen said, unanimity on the U.N. Security Council
will ensure that Iraq is controlled.
</P>
<P>
   He does not hold the United States responsible for removing
Hussein, and said he is not worried about reports that the United
States is going for a lower-profile policing of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports gained momentum last month after Scott Ritter,
leader of one of the U.N. inspection teams, quit his job, while
accusing the United States of taking the teeth out of the program
that is supposed to find and destroy Hussein's chemical and
biological weapons ``of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's comments prompted Congressional criticism, with House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., sounding out about a ``weak
response'' to Hussein's latest violations and Senate leaders saying
they would investigate the Clinton administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright denied
discouraging inspections or that the United States' overall policy
has changed. The U.S. goal, she said is still to keep economic
sanctions on Iraq until it gives up its weapons and until Hussein
complies with other U.N. requirements, including the payment of
reparations for war damage.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has asked the U.N. not to even consider
lifting the sanctions until Iraq complies with the inspections,
prompting Hussein to threaten new, unspecified retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been different tools used at different times,''
said a state department official. ``We're not being as militaristic
this time . . . this time we're not playing his game, we're playing
our game.''
</P>
<P>
   February's crisis was diffused when U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan traveled to Baghdad and secured an agreement with Hussein.
But, there had clearly been little support in the Arab world for
U.S. military action and France and Russia, members of the security
council, were hesitant. With this latest defiance, Hussein seems to
have snubbed all those countries and Annan -- not just America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. troops patrol and train in the desert, which
sometimes reaches a baking 140 degrees. Officials say the current
contingent is enough to strike Hussein, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great experimentation ground for new ideas,'' said Sgt.
Brian Goodknight(CQ), 42, who is based at Fort McPherson in
Georgia, and supplies the training equipment. ``We know we have to
employ heavy combat units to answer the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Collins, an expert in political military studies at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said
the new policy emphasis does not mean the United States has given
in to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins, a retired U.S. Army colonel, said U.S. policy has
been poorly spelled out by a president distracted by a domestic
scandal and a host of other foreign policy problems -- from North
Korean missile testing to the Russian economic and political
crisis. That will make allies doubt the strength of America's stand
against Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Clinton administration should work harder to
unseat Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   That would sit well with many Kuwaitis. They are fond of
Americans and grateful for their war effort -- the Kuwaiti
government built the new $30 million U.S. embassy as a gift and
named a luxury apartment building after former President George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But, many say that America is using the Hussein threat to keep
its troops in the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States wanted to get rid of Saddam, they could
with one finger,'' said Khaled Al-hassan(CQ), a 31-year-old Kuwaiti
soldier headed with his wife for a vacation in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks President Clinton is mainly interested in keeping oil
prices low, and pre-occupied with both Monica Lewinsky and Saudi
terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Hamani Al-khatan(CQ), 25, said that seven years after
the Iraqi invasion, she does not like to dwell on Hussein's
continued threat.
</P>
<P>
   But while she and her country have moved on and rebuilt their
prosperous daily lives, despite him, she said ``my mind works all
the time. In the heart and mind, we have a problem.''

 &HT;    PARENTS RACE THE CLOCK IN FIGHT TO FREE DAUGHTER FROM PERUVIAN
PRISON
 &HT;    With Rick McKay photos placed in the International folder on the

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The kind of call any parent would dread woke Rhoda
Berenson from a deep slumber one Friday evening in early December
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The woman on the other end said she was from the U.S. State
Department. Berenson's daughter, Lori, had been arrested in Peru.
The charge, she thought, was terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A second call -- this one even more disturbing -- came three
days later over a crackling line, 4,000 miles away, from a panicked
Lori.
</P>
<P>
   She said only four things: The charges were ``preposterous.''
She needed a lawyer. She wanted shoes and underwear. And, her
American Express card must be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was all some kind of misunderstanding,'' explains
Rhoda Berenson, 55, speaking in the patient tones of someone who's
told the story before. ``That the U.S. government would quickly
sort it out.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 998 days ago, as Berenson's number-minded husband,
Mark, quickly makes clear during an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the lives of the gregarious, middle-class college
professors has had more intrigue than a James Bond movie.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter was indeed arrested Nov. 30, 1995, at the tender
age of 26. She was accused of being an upper-echelon member of the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, or MRTA, a violent Marxist
group that was reputedly planning to kidnap members of Peru's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons hired two attorneys: Thomas Nooter, who
successfully defended a suspect in the World Trade Center bombing,
and Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But it did little good.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons call the secret military trial that followed their
daughter's arrest ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to challenge evidence or cross-examine witnesses, Lori
was found guilty of treason on Jan. 11, 1996 by a hooded judge she
never saw.
</P>
<P>
   Their hazel-eyed baby who grew up to sing and play clarinet was
sentenced to life in the notoriously grim Yanamayo prison, perched
on a wind-swept plain high in the frigid, inhospitable Andes of
southeastern Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that powerful people have raised concerns over
a flawed judicial system: President Clinton, former President
Carter, and, most notably, Peru's former prime minister, Javier
Valle Riestra.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that a hard-nosed Peruvian president has, so
far, been unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   President Alberto Fujimori paints a disturbing picture of the
woman he calls ``Comrade Lucia,'' a rebel mastermind who helped run
the safe house where guerrillas had trained for their attack on the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons admit that their daughter had become somewhat of a
stranger as she stumbled toward adulthood, but insist she is not,
and never was, a terrorist, even if she had associations with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the New Yorker was part of a terrorist body or
simply a left-leaning do-gooder is no longer the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The burning question today is whether Lori received due process
of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Berenson's plea for a new trial in a civilian court was
turned down by the Supreme Military Tribunal on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight's not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Their last and only hopes are an appeal before the Organization
of American States, or that a more-conciliatory Peruvian government
will have a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   At stake: nothing less than their daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Helene Berenson was raised along with an older sister,
Kathy, in a spacious but nondescript apartment in the Gramercy Park
section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She was a straight-A student at the LaGuardia High School of
Performing Arts, who often volunteered at soup kitchens and blood
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Lori was everything a parent could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to study anthropology at the prestigious
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which led to two study trips
to El Salvador at a time when Central America's civil wars were in
full swing.
</P>
<P>
   She became keenly interested in the roots of conflict, poverty
and inequality, so much so that she dropped out of school in 1989
to move to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   She also became increasingly distant from her family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Letters to her parents were sporadic, arriving every month or
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always assumed she would eventually go back to school,''
Rhoda Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lori moved to Peru in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   She obtained accreditation letters from two left-leaning U.S.
publications and told her parents that she hoped to write about the
effect of widespread poverty on Peruvian women.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture the Berensons have of their daughter through
letters and phone calls --observer, traveler, journalist -- is very
different from the one that emerged after Lori's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian authorities say they have evidence of a 1994 meeting in
Ecuador between Lori and rebel leader, Nestor Cerpa Cartolini --
who helped invade the Japanese ambassador's house in Lima and died
when it was retaken in April 1997 -- and that it was on his orders
that she agreed to help attack the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons say she never knew the man.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial was secret, it's hard to make an independent
assessment of any of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   What has become clear, however, is that Lori may have been her
own worst enemy during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the proceeding, Lori was led before television
cameras to make a public statement, which is customary in terrorism
trials. Her eyes looked wild; her hair unruly. Shouting, she
appeared angry and defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a crime to worry about the subhuman conditions in
which the majority of this population lives, then I will accept my
punishment,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons say her appearance was a set-up, that the
government riled Lori by holing her up with a wounded inmate prior
to her appearance. She had no comb, and was forced to yell because
there was no microphone.
</P>
<P>
   But it was like waving a flag before a bull: the judge gave her
life, even after prosecutors requested a 30-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Lori was convicted under a special judicial system created by
Fujimori in 1992 as part of his crackdown on terrorist groups such
as MRTA and Shining Path.
</P>
<P>
   Peru holds some 4,000 political prisoners accused of supporting
various rebel groups, in turn accused of having killed more than
30,000 people since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   With a 97 percent conviction rate, the system's been criticized
by human rights groups around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lori's trial didn't meet international standards,'' said
Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington
D.C. ``Lori was never allowed to put on a proper defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Lori bides her time in a 6-foot by 10-foot cell in one of
Latin America's harshest prisons. Just last month, the Paris-based
International Federation for Human Rights demanded the facility be
closed due to inhumane conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At 12,000 feet, the Yanamayo prison rarely gets above 40
degrees, a temperature made worse by the icy winds that whip off
Lake Titicaca. Meals, and a bucket of ice-cold water daily, are
disbursed through a hatch in the cell's door. Lori sleeps under
eight blankets, and is allowed outside only an hour a day.
</P>
<P>
   At least once a month, either Mark or Rhoda Berenson makes the
4,000 mile, two-day trek to the prison -- located some 525 miles
southeast of Lima -- where they're allowed an hour with their
daughter, who's always separated from them by a screen. Each trip
costs $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   They generally bring more than 60 pounds of food and toiletries
with them at a time, and through the months they've learned the
idiosyncracies of prison guards: No pen caps or shoe laces; shampoo
must be poured into clear, plastic bags so it is visible.
</P>
<P>
   Once the guards forced Mark Berenson to unwrap hundreds of Halls
cough drops so that they could be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people usually count the grapes we bring in,'' he said.
``You never know what they're going to make you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda Berenson said that during her most recent visit, on Aug.
22, she received a note from her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe in violence. I have never been a member of
the MRTA. I do believe in the ideals of justice and equality,'' it
read in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, say the Berensons, it's not her spirit -- but her
physical health -- that has them so worried.
</P>
<P>
   Lori has chronic laryngitis and talks in a raspy, Lauren
Bacall-like voice. She once had strep throat for seven weeks. She
suffers from digestive problems and her hands are swollen and
discolored.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Berenson's high-profile campaign to get their
daughter a new trial has taken on new urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal before the OAS could take from two to seven
years,'' Mark Berenson said. ``We don't have that long, because
Lori doesn't have that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Berenson, who says he's 56 going on 100, recently left his
job as a statistics professor at Baruch College, where he has
taught since 1964, to devote more time to Lori's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only 168 hours in a week and I need to concentrate all
of them on Lori,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, the Berensons e-mail updates on Lori's case to more
than 1,000 groups and individuals. Every three months, they mail
updates to another 1,000 or so people.
</P>
<P>
   This summer they led dozens of activists in protesting Fujimori
as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel; this week they'll start calling
members of Congress to ask them to limit U.S. aid to Peru, which
totaled $104 million last year, unless Lori's case is reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The determined couple whose only previous protests have been
against the Vietnam War admits that a series of sudden ups and
downs have left them on an emotional roller-coaster this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In June, then-Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra suggested a
pardon for Berenson. But, Fujimori swiftly rejected that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats in Peru have said that Fujimori's dug in his
heels and that little movement in this case is expected until he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   But, thanks to some recent political maneuvering, Fujimori, who
won a second-term in 1995, may seek a third term in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Berensons, it looks like they may be the
ones who will have to dig in their heels. And they say they're
ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider my daughter a hostage, and, as a father, I'll do
all I can to free her because I'm frantic,'' Mark Berenson said.
``She's the first thing I think about when I wake up, and the last
thought I have before going to sleep.''

UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER LEADS TO PEACE RATHER THAN PAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wednesday was the 53rd anniversary of the
official end of World War II in the Pacific. In a ceremony on board
the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Harbor, in the presence of
officers, allies and former enemies, Gen. Douglas MacArthur
accepted the formal surrender of Imperial Japan. The terms of
surrender were unconditional.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``unconditional surrender'' was first introduced
into modern warfare in 1862 by Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.
Considered at the time extremely callous and harsh, even by Grant's
own officers, the expression so intrigued President Abraham Lincoln
he made it a policy aim.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's insistence on unconditional surrender was hotly
criticized in the North, which feared it would only encourage the
South to dig in and so prolong the fighting. Once the war ended,
however, the North was more than pleased that Lincoln _ who by then
was dead _ had been so insistent, as his policy permitted free
reign to set up Reconstruction in a thoroughly demilitarized South.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, with World War I drawing to a close, Gen.
John Pershing, head of the American Expeditionary Force, urgently
recommended ``unconditional surrender in the field'' to President
Woodrow Wilson, contending that only under such stringent
conditions would Germany stay defeated. Perhaps remembering the
devastation wreaked on his native Virginia during Reconstruction,
Wilson demurred, instead offering Germany an armistice and later,
his beautifully worded, fatally flawed Fourteen Points.
</P>
<P>
   Defeated but not defanged, Germany eventually embraced fascism.
It spent most of the '30s rearming, until, 21 years after her
conditional surrender in the Great War, it proved Pershing's point
_ and Lincoln's _ by invading Poland and driving Europe into a
second, even more disastrous war.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between Germany's conditional surrender in 1918
and its invasion of Poland in 1939 was noted with great avidity by
every military and political leader of World War II. Both Great
Britain and Germany aimed for the unconditional surrender of the
other from day one of the war. Later, the Soviet Union, Japan, and
the United States gunned for total victory, too.
</P>
<P>
   As things turned sour for them, Germany and Japan began hinting
that they were prepared to accept peace terms which were almost,
but not quite, unconditional. They were told, bluntly, to take a
hike: the only acceptable surrender was total, take it or leave it.
Rather than take it, Hitler committed suicide, while the Japanese
would absorb two atomic bombs before agreeing to it.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the Allies occupied Germany and the United States
occupied Japan. These occupations transformed both nations into
such loyal allies that today it is just as hard to imagine either
country as our enemy as it was, during the war, to imagine them as
anything but. The insistence on unconditional surrender is one of
the World War II's most important and meaningful legacies. Whether
or not it is a legacy worth continuing depends on which we want
more: peace, or a pause between wars.

ASIAN AMERICANS MAY GIVE FONG EDGE OVER BOXER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In politics, as in life, sometimes it's better
to be lucky than good. Just how good Matt Fong is remains unclear,
but he seems lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Fong is the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate. He is
running against pro-Clinton Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer at a
time with a lot of people are disgusted with the president. And he
is a symbol of hope for California's Chinese Americans and,
perhaps, other Asian Americans who yearn for political legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent statewide polls show Fong, a lesser-known figure, in
a virtual tie with Boxer. Granted, it's still early, but Fong's
numbers have been rising, while Boxer has flattened out in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer beat archconservative Bruce Herschensohn six years ago in
a close race. In polls pitting Boxer against any opponent, she
hasn't cracked the magical 50-percent threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Fong had to turn toward the right in the Republican
primary to capture enough of the party's conservative base, he is
more of a moderate, Jack Kemp-style Republican. Boxer, one of the
most liberal senators, is also moving to the center, such as
reminding voters she is tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   In their first debate recently, Fong wasn't all that good. He
read from notes when he should have been speaking extemporaneously.
He chuckled inappropriately. He called Boxer ``Barbara'' several
times.
</P>
<P>
   But it may not matter when Californians go to the polls in
November. Boxer has the Clinton albatross around her neck, and she
can't count on all Asian-American Democrats to support her because
some are attracted to Fong, a Chinese American who is the current
state treasurer, on the grounds of ethnic pride.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, will pro-choice Republican women cross over to
Boxer, an abortion rights advocate, or will they be so offended by
President Clinton's womanizing that they will stick with their own
party's straitlaced candidate despite his mostly pro-life stance?
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is having a hard time getting out from under questions
about Clinton's character. Her criticisms of Clinton have been
interpreted as tepid while she was aggressive in criticizing others
accused of sexual harassment _ Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas and former Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., for example.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key factors in the Boxer-Fong race could be how the
state's Asian-American voters feel. Boxer won only 52 percent of
the Asian-American vote in 1992. Although not a large percentage of
the state's voters (an estimated 6 percent), Asian-American voters
are increasing as more become naturalized citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Famously independent, California's Asian-American voters are
roughly split among the two parties and many refuse to align
themselves with either party. Their votes remain up for grabs, as
they have for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-June primary survey by the non-partisan Chinese
American Voters Education Committee, Chinese-American voters in San
Francisco preferred Fong over Boxer by 3-to-1. In a primary
election day exit poll conducted by political consultant Tom Hsieh
Jr., a large majority of Chinese-American voters in San Francisco
supported Fong while an equally large majority voted for a
Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Fong stands a good chance of getting a majority of
Asian-American independents, and he could get a fair number of
Asian-American Democrats. Some Asian-American Democrats are angry
at their own party for not standing behind Asian-American party
fund-raisers in the campaign-finance scandal. Some don't feel Boxer
has paid much attention to issues important to Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer has lately launched an Asian Americans for Boxer movement,
but as one Asian-American Democrat said privately, she's doing it
to stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   There's still plenty of time for Boxer to take the upper hand
against the relatively inexperienced Fong, but maybe her luck is
running out.

<P>
   RASHARKIN, Northern Ireland _ The nightmare never ends. Every
horrific bombing underscores a centuries-old religious division
that political will has yet to mend.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinn family knows the violence all too well. In July,
Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, three young sons, died in the first
major terrorist attack since the Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, their mother, Chrissie Quinn, spoke for the
first time about her grief _ a family's dreams shattered, a
country's future in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when she fears the grief will drive her insane,
Chrissie Quinn tells herself she's just having a nightmare and that
when she wakes up, all her boys will be alive, laughing and
inseparable, as they always were.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact three of her four boys are lying, inseparable
forever, side by side by side, in their graves. Only her eldest,
Lee, 13, is with her.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brothers _ chatty Richard, 11, gentle Mark, 10, and
wee Jason, the warrior who turned nine just four days before they
died _ were murdered in an evil and cowardly way by someone who
used the name of God as a pitiful excuse for hatred. The family was
targeted while they slept; the terrorist tossed at least one,
perhaps more, firebombs into their home July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, on merciful days, Chrissie is just numb. She's beyond
tears. Months later, the reality hasn't really sunk in.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The winding road to Rasharkin, a town about 35 miles northwest
of Belfast, is quite beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Quinn is staying in this mostly Catholic small town
with her mother. Along the way, sheep graze peacefully in gently
rolling hills people proudly describe as ``40 shades of green.''
Church bells seem to be always ringing. Weaving through villages,
one can see children playing in quiet streets with tidy flower
beds. The serenity is so deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Union Jacks mark areas where Protestants live. None fly in
pockets where Catholics dwell. The area suffers the undercurrent of
hatred that sweeps throughout Northern Ireland pitting Catholic
against Protestants, loyalists against those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   There's always tension between the Catholic minority that pushes
for a united Ireland, free of British rule, and the 60 percent
pro-British Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   What the religious hatred can do, and has done _ bombings,
shootings and beatings, all especially brutal over the past 30
years _ makes parents overly protective of their children.
</P>
<P>
   And then the death of the Quinn boys in the early morning hours
of July 12 shocked the world and brought it to disbelieving tears.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in the predominantly Protestant town of Ballymoney,
about five miles from Rasharkin. Outrage rocked Northern Ireland, a
place quite accustomed to violence, a place where 1.6 million
people had their hopes pinned on the Good Friday peace agreement
developed last April.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was endorsed in the Irish republic and on May 22, an
overwhelming majority in Northern Ireland voted to give peace a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence would not be over that easily. Dissidents in
the Irish Republican Army oppose a cease-fire. And some, likely
dissident splinter groups, continue to let off bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballymoney is 10 km from Bendooragh, where Chrissie was born.
Ballymoney is where she had lived for 20 years _ and where all her
boys were born and went to school and played with other children,
Protestant and Catholic alike.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place she says she wants to go back to for only one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like going there to ask them why ...''
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at Chrissie's mother's home, a pretty row house in a
quiet cul-de-sac, not expecting to see her. Her uncle Harry Patton
wanted to talk but had warned that Chrissie hasn't been strong
enough to face many people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's waiting, standing in the living room like a statue,
trying to be brave. So pretty, so fragile and in so much pain. What
does one say to this tormented mother? Who can really know what
she's going through? No one, her Uncle Harry says.
</P>
<P>
   The chatter of children _ her nephews and cousins _ permeates
the small house. But three wee voices are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's wearing a new tan sweater, new pants and new shoes,
bought out of necessity because everything she owned _ including
every picture, drawing and treasure of her boys accumulated over
the years _ was destroyed in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her eldest son Lee, 13, is ``Grammy's boy.'' He slept here that
tragic night with Chrissie's mom Irene, a kind woman who brings in
tea and chocolate. She smiles, but her eyes reveal an utterly
shattered heart.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie and her boys lived in the Ballymoney house with her
sister Colette and her four-month-old daughter Shannon. Colette,
18, who was visiting friends that July night, came home at about 9
p.m. to feed Shannon. Her friends urged her to come back _ and
bring the baby with her. She did, and decided they'd both stay the
night. It was a casual decision, one that may have saved their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie let the three boys stay up late to watch TV. Jason had
nodded off to sleep. She woke him up and sent them all off to bed
at 1 p.m. ``with a tuck and a kiss,'' like she always did, not
knowing it would be the last time she'd feel the loving joy of
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Two friends were staying over _ Raymond Craig, 31, and Christina
Archibald, 18.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m. an explosion rocked the house. Someone had thrown
at least one petrol bomb in through the living room window. A
fireball roared through the house.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie, Raymond and Christina escaped though a front window.
The boys were trapped in an upper rear bedroom. Their screams
pierced the night.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors poured out of their houses. Craig tried desperately to
get to the boys. He broke a window, cutting himself, but was driven
back by heat and flames.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, young Richard cried: ``I'm in a corner.'' For some
reason he didn't, couldn't, obey pleas from those on the street
urging him to jump. One of the other boys, no one's sure which one,
screamed that his feet were burning. All efforts to get them out
were futile. By the time firemen arrived, the boys were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie can't say much about that night. She goes pale and
silent for a long time. Until now, she hasn't said much to anyone
except her younger brother Frankie, 23, a handsome young man with a
gold earring and a gentle manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie lies here on the couch to go to sleep. I won't let
him. I shake him night after night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Brother and sister talk and she chain smokes. The silence of her
eldest son Lee worries her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee hasn't talked about it yet,'' Chrissie says. ``And I don't
know what to say to him. Lee sits and daydreams. He was crying the
other morning but he wouldn't talk. Last night ... he was sitting
on his bed looking at a photo of his brothers. I lay down beside
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Who were these boys they'll always grieve for?
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie smiles for the first time when asked to talk about the
boys she devoted her life to. ``All I did was be a mum,'' Chrissie
says, having largely raised them herself.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, whom she divorced, went off to England a long time
ago. Chrissie and their stepfather split up almost a year ago.
``It's the memory of my boys that keeps me sane _ I have to keep
strong for Lee. Every pregnancy was easy. The longest I was in
labor was three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard liked to be independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard, he was the most outgoing _ hyperactive. His chatter
never stopped. He never stopped running around, playing. I don't
have a picture of the boys together. I could never get Richard to
sit long enough with the other boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a dark look crosses Chrissie's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard had his shoes packed for high school. He was ready to
go. He was going to be in Grade 8. I'm dreading his birthday,'' she
says. It's not until Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The living room door opens. Uncle Harry and a boy with rosy,
chubby cheeks walk in. It's Lee, a shy, teddy bear of a boy who
steals one's heart in a second.
</P>
<P>
   He silently sits on the couch _ as close as he can to his mum.
The boy looks confused. He listens to Chrissie talk about Mark, the
quiet one who had his mind set on being a policeman and had an
insatiable appetite for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to read anything, everything. He'd get off the school
bus with a book open. I like to read as well. We read together. He
used to bring me love stories from the library.'' Another smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark would walk in the house and say 'Mummy, I brought one for
you.' Mark would get teased by other children because he was so
clingy to me.'' His little brother Jason felt obliged to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason stuck up for Mark all the time. He had no fear. His
fists flew if they had to. He was a loner, but Jason was starting
to come out of his shell. Jason was excellent at TV games.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were always together. They'd spend most nights
playing cards and TV games and drinking tea Mummy made.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just being boys growing up with their mom,'' she
says. ``My boys were the best boys. They were mine. They didn't
deserve what happened to them. They deserved to grow up. The people
who did this got to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger is starting to seep into her numbness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am starting to feel angry. That's why I couldn't sleep last
night. And I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland has long been tormented with sectarian
killings. No one needs much of an excuse, a simple anniversary will
do. Things particularly get tense when July 12 approaches, the
anniversary of the 1690 battle when the Catholic army was defeated
by England's Protestant king. Catholics don't want Protestants
parading in their areas. Protestants say it's their right. Conflict
goes hand in hand with demonstrations and parades. And so do
sinister threats.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 300 Protestant and about 25 Catholic homes in
Ballymoney. On the morning of July 11, Catholic families received
letters warning them to ``get out'' from a paramilitary group
identifying itself as the Ulster Volunteer Force. Some of the
envelopes had bullets in them. Many families left to live with
relatives elsewhere _ and are still staying away from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's mom had recently moved to Rasharkin because it was
coming up to the 12th. On the 10th, two petrol bombs were hurled
into the house she left. It was empty so they just burned
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a letter. I thought I must be excepted,''
Chrissie says.
</P>
<P>
   There had been trouble in the past, but she thought it was over.
``Three years ago around July 12, my husband and my brother fought
with people in the square. It started because my childrens' tennis
ball went into the neighbor's yard.'' The neighbors were
Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a different home in Ballymoney, her second
husband John Dillon, a Catholic, was shot. ``It took his thigh
away,'' Chrissie says. Shortly after, about 15 members of the UVF
came by ``to smash chairs through my windows.'' She asked the
housing executive to move her to another house. They said no.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that police visited and said they'd received a
``coded message'' warning that John's life was in danger. The
family fled to England. After six months Chrissie was homesick. She
and the boys returned. All was calm. Her four boys played football
with other children and went to the Protestant school. And now
there is only one.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie clings to a vow made by police, who Uncle Harry says
``haven't slept _ the whole team hasn't slept.'' ``They promised me
they'll never close this case until they get all of them. I know
there's more than one,'' Chrissie says. ``I want them all caught,''
she says flatly.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the tragedy, the outpouring of grief from
around the world has stunned Chrissie Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes you realize there's only a small percentage of
people who are evil,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of letters continue to arrive. Chrissie says some are
written in foreign languages _German, Japanese. It doesn't matter
to her. She knows that whatever the contents are, whoever sent them
meant well. Others offer words of sympathy. And still others
personal stories of their own tragic losses.
</P>
<P>
   Three innocent boys.
</P>
<P>
   Three lives lost in a horrible way.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? One confused brother and one devastated mother who
face spending the rest of their lives without them, trying to make
sense out of why.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the outrage and outpouring of grief, Chrissie
believes, their brutal murders won't help the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Ireland won't get better. It won't change,'' Chrissie
sighs.

the Irish Republican Army oppose a cease-fire. And some, likely
dissident splinter groups, continue to let off bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballymoney is 10 km from Bendooragh, where Chrissie was born.
Ballymoney is where she had lived for 20 years _ and where all her
boys were born and went to school and played with other children,
Protestant and Catholic alike.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place she says she wants to go back to for only one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like going there to ask them why ...''
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at Chrissie's mother's home, a pretty row house in a
quiet cul-de-sac, not expecting to see her. Her uncle Harry Patton
wanted to talk but had warned that Chrissie hasn't been strong
enough to face many people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's waiting, standing in the living room like a statue,
trying to be brave. So pretty, so fragile and in so much pain. What
does one say to this tormented mother? Who can really know what
she's going through? No one, her Uncle Harry says.
</P>
<P>
   The chatter of children _ her nephews and cousins _ permeates
the small house. But three wee voices are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's wearing a new tan sweater, new pants and new shoes,
bought out of necessity because everything she owned _ including
every picture, drawing and treasure of her boys accumulated over
the years _ was destroyed in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her eldest son Lee, 13, is ``Grammy's boy.'' He slept here that
tragic night with Chrissie's mom Irene, a kind woman who brings in
tea and chocolate. She smiles, but her eyes reveal an utterly
shattered heart.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie and her boys lived in the Ballymoney house with her
sister Colette and her four-month-old daughter Shannon. Colette,
18, who was visiting friends that July night, came home at about 9
p.m. to feed Shannon. Her friends urged her to come back _ and
bring the baby with her. She did, and decided they'd both stay the
night. It was a casual decision, one that may have saved their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie let the three boys stay up late to watch TV. Jason had
nodded off to sleep. She woke him up and sent them all off to bed
at 1 p.m. ``with a tuck and a kiss,'' like she always did, not
knowing it would be the last time she'd feel the loving joy of
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Two friends were staying over _ Raymond Craig, 31, and Christina
Archibald, 18.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m. an explosion rocked the house. Someone had thrown
at least one petrol bomb in through the living room window. A
fireball roared through the house.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie, Raymond and Christina escaped though a front window.
The boys were trapped in an upper rear bedroom. Their screams
pierced the night.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors poured out of their houses. Craig tried desperately to
get to the boys. He broke a window, cutting himself, but was driven
back by heat and flames.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, young Richard cried: ``I'm in a corner.'' For some
reason he didn't, couldn't, obey pleas from those on the street
urging him to jump. One of the other boys, no one's sure which one,
screamed that his feet were burning. All efforts to get them out
were futile. By the time firemen arrived, the boys were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie can't say much about that night. She goes pale and
silent for a long time. Until now, she hasn't said much to anyone
except her younger brother Frankie, 23, a handsome young man with a
gold earring and a gentle manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie lies here on the couch to go to sleep. I won't let
him. I shake him night after night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Brother and sister talk and she chain smokes. The silence of her
eldest son Lee worries her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee hasn't talked about it yet,'' Chrissie says. ``And I don't
know what to say to him. Lee sits and daydreams. He was crying the
other morning but he wouldn't talk. Last night ... he was sitting
on his bed looking at a photo of his brothers. I lay down beside
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Who were these boys they'll always grieve for?
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie smiles for the first time when asked to talk about the
boys she devoted her life to. ``All I did was be a mum,'' Chrissie
says, having largely raised them herself.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, whom she divorced, went off to England a long time
ago. Chrissie and their stepfather split up almost a year ago.
``It's the memory of my boys that keeps me sane _ I have to keep
strong for Lee. Every pregnancy was easy. The longest I was in
labor was three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard liked to be independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard, he was the most outgoing _ hyperactive. His chatter
never stopped. He never stopped running around, playing. I don't
have a picture of the boys together. I could never get Richard to
sit long enough with the other boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a dark look crosses Chrissie's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard had his shoes packed for high school. He was ready to
go. He was going to be in Grade 8. I'm dreading his birthday,'' she
says. It's not until Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The living room door opens. Uncle Harry and a boy with rosy,
chubby cheeks walk in. It's Lee, a shy, teddy bear of a boy who
steals one's heart in a second.
</P>
<P>
   He silently sits on the couch _ as close as he can to his mum.
The boy looks confused. He listens to Chrissie talk about Mark, the
quiet one who had his mind set on being a policeman and had an
insatiable appetite for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to read anything, everything. He'd get off the school
bus with a book open. I like to read as well. We read together. He
used to bring me love stories from the library.'' Another smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark would walk in the house and say 'Mummy, I brought one for
you.' Mark would get teased by other children because he was so
clingy to me.'' His little brother Jason felt obliged to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason stuck up for Mark all the time. He had no fear. His
fists flew if they had to. He was a loner, but Jason was starting
to come out of his shell. Jason was excellent at TV games.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were always together. They'd spend most nights
playing cards and TV games and drinking tea Mummy made.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just being boys growing up with their mom,'' she
says. ``My boys were the best boys. They were mine. They didn't
deserve what happened to them. They deserved to grow up. The people
who did this got to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger is starting to seep into her numbness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am starting to feel angry. That's why I couldn't sleep last
night. And I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland has long been tormented with sectarian
killings. No one needs much of an excuse, a simple anniversary will
do. Things particularly get tense when July 12 approaches, the
anniversary of the 1690 battle when the Catholic army was defeated
by England's Protestant king. Catholics don't want Protestants
parading in their areas. Protestants say it's their right. Conflict
goes hand in hand with demonstrations and parades. And so do
sinister threats.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 300 Protestant and about 25 Catholic homes in
Ballymoney. On the morning of July 11, Catholic families received
letters warning them to ``get out'' from a paramilitary group
identifying itself as the Ulster Volunteer Force. Some of the
envelopes had bullets in them. Many families left to live with
relatives elsewhere _ and are still staying away from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's mom had recently moved to Rasharkin because it was
coming up to the 12th. On the 10th, two petrol bombs were hurled
into the house she left. It was empty so they just burned
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a letter. I thought I must be excepted,''
Chrissie says.
</P>
<P>
   There had been trouble in the past, but she thought it was over.
``Three years ago around July 12, my husband and my brother fought
with people in the square. It started because my childrens' tennis
ball went into the neighbor's yard.'' The neighbors were
Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a different home in Ballymoney, her second
husband John Dillon, a Catholic, was shot. ``It took his thigh
away,'' Chrissie says. Shortly after, about 15 members of the UVF
came by ``to smash chairs through my windows.'' She asked the
housing executive to move her to another house. They said no.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that police visited and said they'd received a
``coded message'' warning that John's life was in danger. The
family fled to England. After six months Chrissie was homesick. She
and the boys returned. All was calm. Her four boys played football
with other children and went to the Protestant school. And now
there is only one.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie clings to a vow made by police, who Uncle Harry says
``haven't slept _ the whole team hasn't slept.'' ``They promised me
they'll never close this case until they get all of them. I know
there's more than one,'' Chrissie says. ``I want them all caught,''
she says flatly.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the tragedy, the outpouring of grief from
around the world has stunned Chrissie Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes you realize there's only a small percentage of
people who are evil,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of letters continue to arrive. Chrissie says some are
written in foreign languages _German, Japanese. It doesn't matter
to her. She knows that whatever the contents are, whoever sent them
meant well. Others offer words of sympathy. And still others
personal stories of their own tragic losses.
</P>
<P>
   Three innocent boys.
</P>
<P>
   Three lives lost in a horrible way.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? One confused brother and one devastated mother who
face spending the rest of their lives without them, trying to make
sense out of why.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the outrage and outpouring of grief, Chrissie
believes, their brutal murders won't help the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Ireland won't get better. It won't change,'' Chrissie
sighs.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Imagine if just a portion of world military spending was
redirected toward human development. In 1995, world military
spending totaled nearly $800 billion dollars.
 &HT;    If we channeled just $40 billion of that figure over the next 10
years into antipoverty programs, all of the world's population
would enjoy basic social services, such as education, health care
and nutrition, clean water and sanitation.
 &HT;    Another $40 billion over 10 years would provide all people on
the planet with an income above the poverty line for their country.
 &HT;    Since the end of the Cold War, many industrialized nations have
reduced their defense budgets. As a result, those countries' arms
merchants have turned to new clients in the developing world, where
the majority of today's conflicts take place.
 &HT;    The United States stands as an extreme case. Currently, the
world's only superpower is responsible for 45 percent of all
weapons deliveries in the world. And, in the past four years, 85
percent of U.S. weapons sales have gone to undemocratic governments
in the developing world.
 &HT;    During President Bill Clinton's first term in office, his
administration gave $35.9 billion to the militaries of
non-democratic governments for arms and training _ an average of $9
billion per year. This figure represents 82 percent of the $44
billion in total U.S. military support for developing nations.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, half of the world's governments dedicate more
resources to defense than to health programs. Such distortions in
national budgets contribute to poverty and retard human
development. War, and the preparation for war, is one of the
greatest obstacles to human progress, fostering a vicious cycle of
arms buildups, violence and poverty.
 &HT;    In South Asia, an arms race rages between India and Pakistan,
fueled by a dispute over the Kashmir territory. India spent more
than $12 billion on arms purchases from 1988 to 1992 alone _ more
than either Saudi Arabia or Iraq during the same period. From 1978
to 1991, Pakistan increased its defense budget sevenfold, so that
defense now accounts for nearly 40 percent of all government
spending.
 &HT;    These two nations, which rank alarmingly low on the Human
Development Index, spend exorbitant amounts on this unforgivable
arms race, leaving their people in their own desperate race against
time to merely survive.
 &HT;    In the past few years, two countries in Latin America have taken
historic steps toward ending once and for all the vicious cycle of
poverty and militarism.
 &HT;    Following the restoration of democracy to Panama in 1989 and to
Haiti in 1994, I helped persuade both countries to constitutionally
abolish their national armies, as Costa Rica did in 1949. As a
result, Costa Rica and Panama now enjoy the safest border in the
world.
 &HT;    Furthermore, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere, may now dedicate more resources to crucial development
needs. These landmark decisions have shown the world that Costa
Rica is not a unique case. The abolition of national armed forces
is truly a viable option for many countries.
 &HT;    Commitments made toward demilitarization in the developing world
must be supported by responsible leadership in the global
community. Yet in several industrialized countries that manufacture
weapons, armament production is viewed as a vital source of
employment and income.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, world leaders must accept the fact that we cannot
let the free market rule the international arms trade. We must not
enrich ourselves through the commerce of death. Rather, we must
realize that the arms trade is most often a friend of dictators and
an enemy of the people.
 &HT;    The time has come to choose human lives over weapons. Indeed, we
must settle at nothing less than a comprehensive, international
effort to regulate and monitor arms transfers.
 &HT;    Toward this end, I convened a meeting this spring with seven
other Nobel Peace laureates _ Elie Wiesel, the Dalai Lama, Jose
Ramos-Horta, Betty Williams, and the directors of American Friends
Service Committee, Amnesty International and International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War _ to publicly unveil
an International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers.
 &HT;    This Code is also fully endorsed by eight more Nobel Peace
laureates: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Lech Walesa, Rigoberta Menchu,
Adolfo Perez Esquivel, Mairead Maguire, Norman Borlaug, Joseph
Rotblat and this year's winner, Jody Williams. Furthermore, former
President Jimmy Carter has expressed his strong support for the
Code of Conduct.
 &HT;    This International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers would
prevent undemocratic governments from building sophisticated
arsenals. Governments that systematically abuse internationally
recognized human rights through practices such as torture or
arbitrary executions would not receive military training.
 &HT;    Countries that commit genocide would not be able to buy
munitions. Governments engaged in armed aggression against other
countries or peoples could not buy missiles. States that support
terrorism would be prevented from acquiring weapons.
 &HT;    In addition, all nations would be required to report their arms
purchases to the United Nations. This Code of Conduct would
undeniably promote global security and protect human rights.
 &HT;    Current initiatives to restrict arms sales in the United States
and the European Union represent a first step toward our mission
for peace. Earlier this year, owing to back-room dealings and
political tricks, a U.S. Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers failed
to pass a joint House and Senate Conference Committee.
Nevertheless, its strong showing was indicative of the Code's moral
sway and great promise.
 &HT;    Across the Atlantic, Belgium and the United Kingdom have taken
the lead in promoting a comparable European version.
 &HT;    Some might question the Code's relationship to the free-market
concept of supply and demand. If a country's leaders want arms,
some might ask, who are we to say that they shouldn't have them?
 &HT;    First, since the end of the Cold War, arms manufacturers have
been aggressively promoting sales to the developing world in order
to compensate for the drastic reduction in arms purchases by most
industrialized countries. Furthermore, when we assert that a
``nation'' desires arms, to whom exactly are we referring?
 &HT;    (ital) Is the single mother in Indonesia or the street orphan in
Egypt pressuring government leaders to buy tanks and missiles? Or
is it a dictator _ who sees arms purchases as the only way to
maintain power? (end ital) The poor of the world are crying out for
schools and doctors, not guns and generals.
 &HT;    Another argument posited to justify the sale of arms is that, if
one country does not sell arms to a nation that wishes to buy them,
someone else will. That is precisely why all weapons-selling
nations must agree to certain common restrictions.
 &HT;    We can no longer say business is business and turn a blind eye
to the poverty and oppression caused by arms transfers. Just like
slavery and the drug trade, the arms trade reaps profits tainted
with blood.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Is your local high school drug-free? Fully 82 percent of
principals say yes.
 &HT;    But 78 percent of high school kids say drugs are used, kept and
sold at their schools, according to a new ''Back to School Teen
Survey.''
 &HT;    Is a 13-year-old at much greater risk of drug use than a
12-year-old? Most parents would say no. They are wrong.
 &HT;    ''The transition from age 12 to 13 is the most critical turning
point in the lives of America's children,'' says the survey by the
National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA).
 &HT;    It is the year when their access to illegal drugs skyrockets,
while parental involvement in their lives dramatically diminishes.
 &HT;    Fifty percent of 13-year-olds can buy pot vs. only 14 percent of
12-year-olds. It is a big step to go from the sixth grade, where
only 13 percent can buy acid, cocaine or heroin, to the seventh
grade, where 43 percent can buy those hard-core drugs.
 &HT;    Only 15 percent of 12-year-olds say they would not report a
student they see using illegal drugs. But a year later, 48 percent
say they would not snitch.
 &HT;    What are parents doing during this critical year? Withdrawing.
 &HT;    When a sixth grader comes home from school, 17 percent have no
adult to greet them, but 30 percent of seventh graders have no
adult at home.
 &HT;    Result? The percentage of kids who rely most on their parents in
making important decisions drops from 58 to 42 percent in that
crucial year, while those who rely most on friends in making
decisions triples from 7 to 21 percent.
 &HT;    This is tragic. But there is some good news in the CASA report.
 &HT;    Parents can be far more influential in the lives of their
children than many seem to realize. Take the issue of faith. Only a
fifth of students who attend church at least four times a month say
that half their friends drink, compared to 38 percent of those who
attend less than once a month.
 &HT;    Only 8 percent of kids who attend religious services at least
four times a month smoke cigarettes vs. 22 percent who attend less
than once a month.
 &HT;    This is profoundly important. Cigarette smoking is a gateway
drug. Only 10 percent of teens who never smoked get drunk once a
month compared to 63 percent of smokers! Teen smokers are also six
times as likely to be pot users as those who don't smoke.
 &HT;    ''The powerful correlations among teens who smoke, drink and use
marijuana and expect to try an illegal drug in the future make it
essential for parents, principals and teachers to focus on all
substances in their prevention efforts,'' said Joe Califano, CASA
Chairman and former secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.
 &HT;    Those teens who always eat dinner with their parents are more
than twice as likely to never smoke pot as those who rarely eat
with parents.
 &HT;    Thus, the remedies are simple. Eat dinner with your children and
be there when they come home from school. Take them to church. Do
not permit them to smoke.
 &HT;    Perhaps the single most helpful step I took as father was a
present I gave each of my sons at age 12 -- an ''Adolescent
Weekend.'' Leaving the rest of the family home, I took the boy on
his birthday to a great resort, where we played golf for the first
time together, went fishing, and listened to six ''Preparing for
Adolescence'' audio tapes by Dr. James Dobson.
 &HT;    Reg Jones, another father at church, who told me about the
tapes, said, ''I had no well-conceived idea of how to explain
adolescence growing up to them. This seemed like a way to share
with a child, but have a professional explain it.
 &HT;    ``By taking off with a child alone for a weekend, in our busy
lives, that demonstrates how much you care.''
 &HT;    In the first tape, Dobson explains he will talk ''about the
things teenagers worry about most.'' What causes the most pain is a
sense of inferiority, ''that awful awareness that nobody likes you,
that you are not as good as others.'' For example, he notes that 80
percent of teens don't like the way they look. Eighty percent!
 &HT;    I turned off the tape at that point and told each of my boys how
awful I myself had felt being 6 feet 8 inches tall and inept on the
basketball court. It was the first time they had seen me as
vulnerable.
 &HT;    Reg and I are proud of the contributing young men our sons have
grown into.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats who may run for president have made the
following comments about the Clinton-Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrong and it was reprehensible,'' Gephardt said about
Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica S.
Lewinsky. Gephardt, who has not ruled out the possibility of
impeachment proceedings, added: ``I think it's important for us to
not be out there saying he's guilty of impeachment or not, as if we
know.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska:
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, we've got to be a lot more than `legally
accurate,' '' Kerrey said, referring to Clinton's description of
his Jan. 17 deposition testimony that he didn't have a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky. ``You either tell the truth or you
don't. And he didn't. He did not provide the full truth.'' Kerrey
once called Clinton an ``unusually good liar.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make a judgment until I read the Starr
report,'' Kerry said, referring to a report to be issued by
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. Kerry also said about
Clinton: ``I know he is prepared to make clear to people the degree
to which he understands that he bears responsibility in creating
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey:
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has declined to comment on the matter, an aide said. ``I
don't expect Bill (Bradley) to make any kind of proactive
statement,'' aide Ed Turlington said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota:
</P>
<P>
   ``None of it is defensible,'' Wellstone said about Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky. Asked whether Clinton should resign or
be impeached, Wellstone said: ``It's premature to talk about that.
We need to wait to see what's in the Starr report and evaluate
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's expressed his contrition,'' Jackson said. ``It takes an
awful lot to face a wife and daughter and live with the fallout ...
We would do well to let that process take place and focus more on
the nation's business.''

LOYALTY TO CLINTON MAY COST GORE IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's unstinting loyalty to
President Clinton is facing its ultimate test, as the aftershocks
of the Monica S. Lewinsky story and a new campaign-finance probe
increase the chances that Gore will face tougher competiton for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of nervousness in the Gore camp, aides have called
dozens of top campaign donors recently and said that Gore intends
to run for president, but will not distance himself from Clinton.
The calls were made after Clinton acknowledged on Aug. 17 that he
had an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's loyalty has been his most valuable asset as vice
president, but could become a weakness if key constituencies such
as women voters turn against Clinton. And if the global downturn
and the shaky US stock market begin to hurt Americans' pocketbooks,
Gore's strategy of running on the administration's economic record
will have to be rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Attorney General Janet Reno last week opened a 90-day
preliminary review into whether to ask for an independent counsel
to investigate Gore's fund-raising phone calls, creating the
possibility of a broader probe that could be active while the vice
president is campaigning for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, Gore was viewed by many as a shoo-in for
the presidential nomination. But recent events, at the least, may
have emboldened Gore's potential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of a primary challenge may have changed,'' said Roy
Neel, Gore's former chief of staff. ``All of a sudden, different
people may be attracted into primaries. Maybe they wanted to run,
and this gives them a reason for the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Neel said the biggest challenge probably will come from
those who already planned to oppose Gore and will run on issues
unrelated to Lewinsky and the Reno probe. So far, the potential
rivals include House minority leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri,
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, and former senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore allies are unsure of how the events of the last two weeks
will affect the vice president's future.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``A lot of people are concerned,'' said Martin Peretz, the
Cambridge-based chairman of The New Republic magazine and a
longtime Gore confidant. ``The public is sometimes unpredictable
and not exactly rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers see three major scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   _A politically weakened Gore could face months or even years of
investigation from an independent counsel, whose authority could be
expanded, just as Clinton has endured a four-year investigation
that started with a land deal and is ending with his relationship
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _Gore, who already was in line to assume expanded
responsibilities after the November elections, could take the lead
on many issues if Clinton's authority weakens. This would heighten
Gore's visibility and help define him in the public mind as he
prepares for the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   _If Clinton resigns or is impeached, Gore would become
president, providing both opportunities and problems. As president,
Gore would have a head start on the campaign and could raise money
even more easily. If the stock market steadies itself and the
economy remains strong, Gore will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gore's presence as president also would remind
Americans about the troubles of the Clinton-Gore administration,
perhaps prompting voters to want a new start in 2000. If the
economy sours, he could be branded as the man who presided over the
end of a prolonged expansion.
</P>
<P>
   It is most likely that Gore, who declined to be interviewed for
this article, will end up with some combination of the weak and
strong scenarios, analysts said, meaning that the vice president
could spend the next two years struggling to establish himself and
battling rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Peretz, like many others interviewed last week, hopes that Gore
will work in the coming months will underscore his identity and
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marla Romash, a spokeswoman for Gore's political action
committee, said the vice president will not try to reinvent
himself. Asked whether Gore will identify some new issues to run
on, Romash said: ``I don't think there will be any. This vice
president has built a record with the president'' that the public
will support.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, he is one of the most influential vice
presidents in history, leading in areas such as technology,
environment, and international affairs. He led a widely publicized
effort to ``reinvent government'' and cut bureaucracy. But he has
never been able to follow through on his top priority, the
ambitious environmental plans outlined in his best-selling book,
``Earth in the Balance.'' For example, Gore's effort to cut
pollution by enacting a tax on carbon-based products went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   For months, some Gore aides have been saying that the vice
president's wooden personality is just what the country will be
clamoring for in the wake of the Clinton-Lewinsky story. Dull is
in, according to this view. However, other Gore aides cringe at
this idea.
</P>
<P>
   Neel, who served both in the Senate and in the White House with
Gore and is now president of the US Telephone Association, said
Clinton's admission of an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky
had a personal impact on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects him deeply, personally,'' Neel said. ``There is a
deep personal element of this that may not be understood in a
cynical political context, but it is true. It is just feeling deep
sadness for the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neel said Gore would never distance himself from Clinton
because the two are so close. ``If there is a political price to be
paid for the personal loyalty to his friend Bill Clinton in a time
of great personal distress here, then I believe the vice president
is willing to pay the price,'' Neel said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, many Gore backers say everything is going along
smoothly. But privately, some are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's major financial backers, a Bostonian who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said last week that he is worried Gore will
be ``finished'' unless Clinton steps down and turns the presidency
over to Gore. Otherwise, this contributor said, Gore will be
dragged down the same way Vice President Gerald Ford was hurt by
President Nixon's Watergate actions and delay in resigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad because Al Gore is a nice man. He is a very loyal
man,'' the Boston contributor said. ``I'm sure deep down he is
furious.''
</P>
<P>
   Romash dismissed the idea that Gore would be best served if
Clinton stepped aside and let Gore become president. ``The elites
are starting this buzz,'' she said, ``and it is just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's aides are clearly concerned about the impact of
the Lewinsky investigation on major campaign donors. After
Clinton's Aug. 17 speech, Gore ally Peter Knight _ who may run
Gore's 2000 campaign _ began calling big contributors to reassure
them, according to a knowledgeable source. Knight declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious problem for Gore may be the possibility of
facing an independent counsel investigation into fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Lowell Democrat, said the
combination of problems facing Gore could reshape the race for the
presidential nomination. ``There are a lot of people looking it,''
Meehan said. While Meehan still thinks Gore will win the
nomination, the congressman said it would be ``very difficult'' to
run for president if he is facing an independent counsel
investigation and the inevitable leaks from such a probe.
</P>
<P>
   Reno previously decided against seeking an independent counsel
because she believed Gore raised only unregulated ``soft money''
when making 45 telephone calls from the White House to solicit
donations. But the Justice Department recently obtained a memo
written by former Gore aide David Strauss that suggests Gore may
have known he was also raising regulated ``hard money,'' which
could violate a law that prohibits soliciting donations on
government property.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has repeatedly said his action are legal and proper, and
his aides said a memo written by a staff member does not prove
anything. But Gore allies fear that if Reno does ask for the
appointment of an independent counsel to examine this narrow issue,
the investigation could be expanded and still be going on when he
is running for president.

ROSE GROWER A CHAMPION OF ROOT PROPAGATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  NASHUA, N.H. _ Mike Lowe is leading a movement to put roses
back where they belong _ on their own roots.
</P>
<P>
   Most roses are grown commercially by fusing the tops of
desirable varieties onto the roots of stronger but homelier types.
Called grafting, the technique gets rose bushes to market bigger
and faster than growing them on their own roots. After World War I
it gradually became an almost universal practice in the industry,
except among growers of miniature roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started propagating roses on their own roots 20 years ago
because friends asked me to. They couldn't find non-grafted plants
elsewhere,'' said Lowe, 63, a retired Raytheon engineer. What
started out as a hobby became a small home business with a devoted
following among rose aficianados, who have also prized Lowe's
willingness to custom-grow rare antique roses from his own
collection of a thousand varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Now the big rose producers like Weeks and Jackson &AMP; Perkins are
having second thoughts and are also beginning to offer roses grown
on their own roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All producers are moving in that direction,'' said Keith Zary,
vice president of research for Jackson &AMP; Perkins, the world's
largest rose grower.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a war of the roses, and for Lowe, the smell of victory
is sweetly scented.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lowe and his wife, Irene, propagate roses in the sunroom of
their flower-festooned suburban ranch house along the Salmon River
here. They patiently snip canes from rose bushes into six-inch
cuttings, dip them into Hormondina (a rooting hormone), then stick
them into trays of Pro Mix BX potting mix. When the slips take
root, they are transfered into a greenhouse for several weeks under
intermittent misting, then to a nursery bed to grow for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the Lowes have propagated about a thousand kinds of
roses, both modern and antique, usually in batches of a dozen or
less. In fact, half are custom-grown upon request. If you've been
looking for a rosa moyessii ``Sealing Wax,'' Mike Lowe will grow
one just for you _ if you're willing to wait 18 months for
delivery. It's slow work, and the roses themselves grow slowly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Disadvantages of grafting
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why is this technique worth the time and effort?
</P>
<P>
   ``Own-root roses are hardier. You get an extra zone, which is
important in New England,'' said Zary. ``When you bud or graft a
rose and you have a particularly cold snowless winter, the rose can
freeze back to that bud union. Then you're left with that
rootstock, which you don't want.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason why flowers on rose bushes sometimes seem to
mysteriously ``change color'' after a hard winter. Maybe you buy a
``Peace'' rose with large delicately tinted pink petals and one
spring it suddenly puts out small red or white blooms. Miraculous
though it may seem, this is not good. What's really happened is
that the named variety of rose you bought has died or is being
overwhelmed by suckers from the roots of the less desirable rose
onto which it was grafted. Most of the time the understock is ``Dr.
Huey,'' a small red multiflora rose with no smell that blooms for
about five weeks. Dig it up and discard it.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Dr. Huey'' has a dirty little secret. Many roses grafted
onto this rootsock suffer from mosaic virus, which causes yellow
streaks in the leaves and affects the plant's ultimate vigor. The
disease can only be transmitted through grafting. Lowe estimates
that at least 10 percent of roses grafted onto ``Dr Huey'' have the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began a program 30 years ago to eradicate that from our
budding and spent millions of dollars doing it so I feel confident
that our roses are extremely clean,'' said Jackson &AMP; Perkin's Zary.
``That's not true of our competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosaic virus gets its name because new leaf growth is mottled
yellow and green. ``There is some scientific proof you get fewer
flowers, and you have to believe the rose is less vigorous because
you're feeding a parasite. So the virus does some harm,'' Zary
says.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that some roses with a weak disposition, including
most hybrid teas, do perform better if they're grafted.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowe, New England director for the American Rose Society,
also maintains that grafted roses start to die out after a decade
while own-root roses can live a century.
</P>
<P>
   It's a claim Zary disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe counters that when grafted roses are long-lived, it's
because the top rose has sprouted its own roots, superseding the
grafted rootstock.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Shrub roses his specialty
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Own-Root Roses, as Mike Lowe's home business is called,
is a labor of love, and not a money maker. He is in the process of
setting up a partnership which will allow propagation of the roses
he sells to be done in North Carolina, freeing him to concentrate
on breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's favorite roses in his extensive collection are three
modern shrub roses, ``Golden Wings,'' ``Lilian Austin,'' and
``Immortal Juno'' (the most fragrant rose he grows), the antique
white ``Madame Hardy'' (1832), and ``Autumn Sunset,'' his own
discovery, which he says is the closest thing yet to a yellow
repeat-blooming climber that is hardy in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago Lowe noticed a cane with fragrant gold
flowers on an apricot orange bush of rosa kordesii ``Westerland.''
He cut it off and propagated it. While the parent rose is a hardy
shrub, the mutation likes to climb. This year it was widely
introduced into the nursery trade by Weeks, the wholesale rose
growers, under the name Lowe registered a decade ago, ``Autumn
Sunset.'' Some plants are grafted and some are grown on their own
roots. It's also sold in Britain through noted rosarian Peter
Beale's nursery in Attleborough.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who gets a royalty for each bush sold, says ``Autumn
Sunset'' is more vigorous and fragrant than its parent. ``It's one
of the most fragrant roses I grow. And being a kordesii, it's very
disease resistant. It grows into a climbing shrub 8 to 10 feet
high. It has some dieback in zone five, where we are, but it's
hardy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Sunset'' is now available from regional nurseries such
as Roseland in Acushnet, Mass. (508-995-4212) or through mail order
from Heirloom Old Garden Roses (503-538-1576) and Edmunds' Roses
(503-682-1476). Ironically Lowe himself may have fewer than a dozen
plants to sell when he has his year-end sale of field-dug roses on
Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 because he deals in such small quantities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Roses in his blood
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's nursery is sort of the second coming of Lowe's Roses. His
father's uncle had a nursery by the same name in the 1800s in
Nottingham, England. His father worked there as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died when I was 6, but my mother talked about it so I
thought I'd grow some roses when I bought my first house.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe never visited the first Lowe's Roses or met his uncle.
``The last catalog I have of them is 1970. I heard it's not there
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But he found his way into the family business all on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happen to like roses. I don't know why. Maybe it's
inbred.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Lowe's Roses, Sheffield Road, Nashua, N.H. 03062
(603-888-2214).cq Catalogs, $3; orders placed before May 1, 1999,
will result in delivery 18 months later.)

THE GAMES DON'T COUNT -- BUT THE PAIN IS REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ We all remember Jack Nicholson, a.k.a.
astronaut Garrett Breedlove, at the airport in ``Terms of
Endearment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost a clean getaway,'' he deadpanned as Shirley MacLaine
approached in a manner that let him know he was deluding himself if
he thought he was going to remain single much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Collins was kind of thinking the same thing as he examined
his busted pinkie, an injury sustained on his last play of last
Saturday night's exhibition victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   And he got off easy. Marty Moore broke a rib on the last play.
Getting carried off, chair-like, by two burly mates wasn't exactly
the way the onetime Mr. Irrelevant _ who has morphed into a
special-teams Mr. Irreplaceable _ wished to conclude his preseason
duty. Early estimates call for Moore to be out four to six weeks,
although Collins has his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll be back a lot quicker than they say,'' Collins
contends. ``But you know something's busted if he comes out. You've
got to run him over with a dump truck to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   You can get hurt in any sport, of course, but football is one of
those deals where you expect to become incapacitated to some
degree. These guys start whacking each other in practice in the
heat of July. If they are very fortunate, they aren't through
whacking each other until the last Sunday in January. If the
Patriots were to be one of those two teams, they could conceivably
have played 25 games. Can you possibly imagine what a body will
feel like by that time? I can't.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you know you're going to be hurting. It's only a matter
of time. But what you positively, absolutely do not want is to get
hurt in a stupid exhibition game. As each game goes by and you
don't get hurt, you thank the Big Guy upstairs, or somebody. Now
imagine getting down to the final minute of the final exhibition
game and tearing up a knee, shoulder, ankle, or wrist. Or breaking
a rib. Or breaking a little finger.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a clean getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Collins can relate to what Moore's going through to some degree.
He was close to the desired clean getaway in 1996 when he messed up
his knee in the final exhibition game against the Redskins. It was
a severe bruise and it knocked him out of the first three games of
the season. Considering that he was trying to get back into the
good graces of Bill Parcells after staying home on his Tennessee
farm for the entire 1995 season, you can imagine how frustrated
Collins must have felt when he was rendered hors de combat on the
eve of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was having a good preseason and then I got hurt,''
he says. ``I'm on the sidelines saying, `Oh, Lord, why did this
have to happen?' But then you just get back in as quick as you can.
You've just got to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much anyone can do to prevent injury in this game.
The prevailing theory is that you can't simply be floating around
out there trying to stay out of trouble, for that is almost a
guaranteed method to ensure that you will get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But when you see the exhibition finish line in sight, is it not
human nature to relax?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of guys get nicked in that final game,'' says
seven-year veteran safety Willie Clay. ``Sometimes you're just not
aggressive and you pay the price. I'm not saying that was the case
with Marty ...''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to finish the thought. The Patriots know that
anyone whose entree into this brutal profession was as ``Mr.
Irrelevant'' (i.e, the very last man selected in the annual college
draft) will never be caught lollygagging around the ol' gridiron.
They know that Marty Moore plays this game with a laudable passion.
Mr. Irrelevants do not take plays off. None of his mates is sure
just how Moore sustained his broken rib, but they would testify in
court that he darn well didn't do it by ogling some blonde in the
fifth row.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that the same is true of Todd Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out there,'' he explains, ``you must give 100
percent. This is a very violent game, and you've got to treat the
exhibition game the same way you would a regular-season game. You
can't just stand around and watch plays. Things are going on all
the time. The minute you start to let up, that's when something
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-time granddaddy of final-day disasters, at least around
here, occurred on Sept. 1, 1989. Bad enough that Raymond Berry's
Patriots stunk up the joint during a dismal 16-0 loss to the
Packers. Worse, by far, was that during this horrifying practice
game, no fewer than three starters were lost for the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, ouch. Cornerback Ronnie Lippett ruptured his left
Achilles' tendon _ gone. Defensive end Garin Veris tore a left knee
ligament _ gone. Linebacker Andre Tippett, merely the team's best
player at that point, blew out his right shoulder. The preliminary
reports held out some hope that he might get back in action, but it
was a false hope. He, too, would be gone. As were the Patriots'
chances. The team had gone 9-7 the year before and was seriously
thinking about participating in the postseason. Instead, the team
went 5-11 and Raymond Berry went bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like that happened to the Patriots Saturday. You had
Moore and you had Todd Collins. It was a fairly good but not
completely clean getaway.
</P>
<P>
   As for Collins and his broken pinkie, so? It's football, isn't
it? He's not a wide receiver, he's a linebacker. He'll just have to
make a one-handed interception, if need be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just get me some Tylenol,'' Collins shrugs, ``and go to
it.''

   Except for their bylines, many journalists don't like to see
their names in print. That's certainly the case with several dozen
former employees of Arizona's Phoenix Newspapers Inc. who were laid
off and then read nasty things about themselves in a journalism
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the January/February issue of the Columbia
Journalism Review, Steve Knickmeyer, then managing editor of The
Arizona Republic, described most of the terminated reporters as
``fat, lazy, incompetent and slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in two suits, the reporters are suing over Knickmeyer's
remarks, which they say are defamatory. According to one suit, the
plaintiffs suffered ``mental anguish and emotional distress,
humiliation, embarassment, and damage to their professional
reputations.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bodney, who is defending the newspaper company and has
moved to dismiss both suits, said the plaintiffs have lost sight of
the First Amendment rights that protected their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly ironic and really unfortunate that reporters
would not be more sensitive to the need for wide open and robust
speech,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>

   Black Monday's 513-point drop on Wall Street was big business
for the cable news networks. CNBC set a business-news ratings
record with 1.03 million households watching between 4 and 4:15
p.m. as the market closed. CNN's 4-to-5-p.m. Monday ratings were up
by 50 percent, as were those for an hourlong edition of
``Moneyline'' at 10. And the ratings for Fox News Channel's 5 p.m.
``Cavuto Business Report'' tripled.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC president Bill Bolster thinks the extensive coverage of
Wall Street's gyrations kept a more serious panic from setting in.
``If the crash of 1929 had had television,'' he noted, ``it
probably never would have happened.''
</P>
<P>

   Media industry analysts like to point out that so far, no one
has proved that you can make money with on-line journalism. Nobody
except the journalists themselves. According to a University of
Georgia survey of recent graduates of journalism or mass
communications programs, there's significantly more cash in
cyberspace. The median weekly full-time salary for a 1997 graduate
working in Web or on-line publishing was $525 compared with only
$378 at a weekly newspaper, $404 at a daily, $385 in radio, and
$360 in television.

   That sound you hear heading south on Interstate 95 is a sigh of
relief. Tuesday's announcement that Maine's largest daily, the
Portland Press Herald, would be purchased by the family-owned
Seattle Times Co. prevented what many of the paper's employees and
boosters thought of as a worst-case scenario _ a takeover by chain
ownership _ more specifically, by MediaNews Group boss William Dean
Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, earlier this year, a 21-page study commissioned by the
local citizens' group Save Our Hometown News examined some
``worst-case'' scenarios for the Press Herald and cited Singleton's
purchase of the Long Beach Press-Telegram and Oakland Tribune as
two examples of the kind of deals that would jeopardize the Press
Herald's future.
</P>
<P>
   Press Herald editor Jeannine Guttman was effusive after learning
of the Times deal. ``From the newsroom standpoint, it is a
wonderful fit,'' she said. ``We're ecstatic.''

US WARY OVER FATE OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV   AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russia in financial meltdown and its political
leaders paralyzed, US and Russian specialists are increasingly
concerned about the threat posed by the country's vast nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has about 7,000 nuclear warheads and several thousand
more nuclear bombs and other devices, though no one seems to agree
on an exact count. The important questions are how many of them are
well-guarded and how many are simply decaying, half-forgotten, in
fenced-in cities.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapidly deteriorating economy where little funding is
available for maintaining secure facilities and the people who work
in them, US officials worry that nuclear weapons and materials
could end up in the hands of terrorists or pariah states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern remains (that) with the economy in trouble,
it is a constant challenge to make sure no one with access to these
materials crosses the line and tries to smuggle or sell it,'' one
senior US official said Wednesday, when Presidents Clinton and
Yeltsin signed two minor nuclear-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deals, on converting 50 tons of Russian weapons-grade
plutonium into material unusable for weapons, addresses concerns
raised by US officials and Russian and American analysts about the
safety of weapons that have been dismantled under arms reduction
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure signed Wednesday would set up a system for the
United States and Russia to share information on launches of
ballistic missiles and space rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Senior US officials say they have significant confidence that
Russia's active nuclear missiles are properly safeguarded. It is
the dozens of nuclear facilities spread throughout the former
Soviet republics that have given the US military its greatest
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the disparate facilities, many of them
storehouses for plutonium and uranium left over from the Cold War,
and the failing Russian economy provide a potentially terrifying
mix. Officials fear that military personnel, many of whom are low
paid or unpaid these days, will smuggle or sell plutonium and
uranium to terrorists, rogue states, or US enemies such as Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in recent years, the United States has mounted operations
to remove significant amounts of weapons grade plutonium from
former Soviet republics where they were at risk of being smuggled,
last year in Kazakhstan and this year in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, US officials and other analysts remain fearful that
former Soviet nuclear scientists, left unemployed and destitute by
the end of the Cold War, may begin selling their knowledge to
developing nuclear states such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those would be the first people I would pay,'' said Stan
Norris, an analyst on nuclear weapons for the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Washington. ``If you don't pay your nuclear
weapon designers and they can't feed their families, then they
might be tempted.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, nuclear physicists in Sarov, the closed research city
that designed much of Russia's atomic arsenal, went on a brief
strike to protest late paychecks. Ivan Gradobitov, head of the
nuclear industry workers union, said even top specialists faced pay
delays of up to five months. Nuclear industry workers plan to hold
another protest next week.
</P>
<P>
   To try to stem the risk, the US Department of Energy has created
at least two programs, though they conceded that the risk still
exists. Energy officials have set up contracts with some 45 nuclear
sites in the former Soviet Union to help upgrade the facilities,
officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials said the pact signed Wednesday that calls for
each country to dissassemble 50 metric tons of weapons grade
plutonium will also ease the anxieties of the US military.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials have established a program that
allows the US government to, in essence, hire former Soviet nuclear
scientists to assure that they remain gainfully employed and not
susceptible to the overtures of a terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the United States slapped sanctions on seven Russian
defense industry companies it suspects of aiding Iran in that
country's quest to build nuclear missiles. The Russian government
says it is investigating the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say Russia has done much to consolidate the vast
nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union, which comprised over 50,000
nuclear devices, and was as late as 1991 spread throughout over 500
sites in the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe. Russia
reportedly has made efforts to remove weapons from unstable parts
of the country, such as the north Caucasus regions near the
separatist republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian nuclear arsenal is greatly reduced and over time
it is atrophying,'' said Robert L. Pfaltzgraff, professor of
international security studies at Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Russia's arsenal could before long be reduced
by decay to fewer than the 3,000 warheads mandated by the 1993
Start-II agreement, which the Russian parliament has yet to ratify.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia remains a country committed to a strong nuclear
deterrent as part of its defense doctrine, especially in the wake
of its conventional military's disastrous failure to defeat poorly
armed militants in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Russia continues to develop new weapons, even as it
dismantles old weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Felgenhauer, defense analyst for the Russian daily
Segodnya, said Russia has already produced 40 new SS-27 missiles,
which have a capability to avoid detection by anti-ballistic
missiles systems.
</P>
<P>
   And as Russia's weapons grow older, many are being
decommissioned, often in ways that pose a threat, if not of falling
into the hands of nuclear terrorists or pariah states, then to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Felgenhauer said that thousands of tactical nuclear weapons have
been ``taken apart and thrown in plutonium pits and factories,
where it's dismantled and lying around.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamara Robinson, a senior research associate at the Monterey
Institute of International Studies in California, said Russia's 73
nuclear-powered submarines, including some 26 that carry ballistic
missiles and 12 with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, also pose a
security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after meeting Clinton at a discussion with other
governors and opposition leaders, Alexander Lebed, the
tough-talking possible presidential candidate, said he had told the
US president to beware a repeat of the Bolshevik revolution in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him today the situation in Russia is catastrophic. The
situation is worse than in 1917,'' Lebed said. ``Now we have huge
stockpiles of poorly guarded nuclear weapons.''

 `Contraceptive kit' designed to be simple
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A newly approved ``emergency contraceptive kit'' costing about
$20 offers women and their physicians an easy way to avoid
unintended pregnancies after unprotected sex or contraceptive
slipups. The kit will be available later this month. A woman can
use it up to 72 hours after sexual exposure. The kit uses old
technology _ a pregnancy self-test, conventional birth control
pills _ but packages it in a way that simplifies its use in
``emergency'' situations. ``Before, patients had to take two pink
tablets now and two in 12 hours, or four of the yellow pills, or
whatever, depending on the brand of birth control pills,'' said Dr.
Anita L. Nelson, director of the Women's Health Care Clinic at
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. ``Until now there hasn't
been a really clear, all-in-one kit.''
</P>
<P>
   The new product, called PREVEN Emergency Contraceptive Kit, won
Food and Drug Administration approval Tuesday. A consumer-tested
booklet instructs users to do the pregnancy self-test first,
because the contraceptive will not work if pregnancy has already
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   If the pregnancy test is negative, a user would take two of the
four special-dose oral contraceptives included in the kit, wait 12
hours, then take the other two pills.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy works, Nelson said, by preventing or delaying
ovulation. It may also prevent fertilization of an ovum or
implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterine wall, said the UCLA
gynecologist, who was acting as a medical spokeswoman but said she
has no financial relationship with its manufacturer, Gynetics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Of 100 women who have unprotected intercourse, eight will
ordinarily become pregnant, Nelson said. If those 100 women used
the new kit properly, only two unwanted pregnancies would occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the nation had 2.7 million unwanted pregnancies,''
Nelson said. ``Only 1 percent of women have ever used emergency
contraception.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the kit is designed to stop pregnancy before it begins,
and has no connection to the controversial ``abortion pill''
RU-486, which terminates established pregnancies at an early stage,
some right-to-life advocates still condemned it.
</P>
<P>
   American Life League president Judie Brown Wednesday called
PREVEN a ``do-it-yourself abortion kit'' and said the FDA's
approval of it ``does not surprise those of us who understand that
government agencies will go to any length to pander to the sexually
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Benign breast tumors are studied for risks
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the overwhelming majority of cases, benign breast lumps never
turn cancerous. But doctors and their female patients often wonder
if a benign tumor might presage malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe'' is the answer from a new Canadian study of nearly
5,000 women with benign breast disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue from 92 women who later developed breast cancer was 2 1/2
times more likely to have an accumulation of a particular protein
called p53, compared to 288 women who stayed cancer-free, after
accounting for all risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the protein is involved with regulating cell division, a
buildup within some benign breast tumors is ``in keeping with a
role for p53 protein in breast cancer development,'' Dr. Thomas E.
Rohan and his University of Toronto colleagues write in the Journal
of the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying editorial agreed that p53 might become a useful
marker for women with benign breast tumors who should be watched
more closely. Still, they noted, the absolute risk associated with
p53 appears small. Cancer could be expected to develop in only 3.3
percent of those with high p53 levels, vs. 1.3 percent of those
without it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Payment per patient weighed by ethicists
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Capitation _ the fast-increasing method of paying doctors a lump
sump to cover each patient's care _ worries doctors and patients
because it rewards doctors for doing less.
</P>
<P>
   But like it or not, capitation ``is not going to go away soon,''
three Boston ethicists note today in the New England Journal of
Medicine. So they prescribe some features to lessen conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   They urge health plans to insulate doctors from the direct
economic effects of what they do for particular patients. For
instance, no more than 10 percent of a doctor's income should be
``at risk'' because of decisions they make, and the risk should be
pooled by groups of more than 15 doctors caring for more than 250
patients.

TO HAITIANS, AIDS QUIP NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entire exchange lasts less than a minute, almost lost in
sharp-tongued banter and tropical vistas of the summer movie hit
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   But a passing joke that links four volatile words _ Haitians,
AIDS and ``those people'' _ has dredged up a stinging, decade-old
stigma and turned a feel-good romance into a target of outrage for
Haitians, Haitian-Americans and public health officials across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The joke has newly inflamed a simmering clash of culture between
African Americans and Haitian blacks. Activists say a movie that
was hailed for breaking through black stereotypes has now
reinforced one, one that Haitians say still haunts and humiliates
them _ Haitians as AIDS carriers and Haiti as the diseased,
monkey-to-man birthplace of the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a bitter, growing chorus of complaints on Internet sites
and radio waves prompted a protest rally in New York Wednesday, and
further plans for a national demonstration in Miami, some who bear
the burden of caring for Haitians with AIDS expressed an outrage
that was tinged with ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   The energy, emotion and resources that have been mounted against
Hollywood's pop-culture insult is something they rarely see applied
to the long fight against a deadly disease that has hit their
community as hard as any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie does have certain implications, yes,'' said Eustache
Jean-Louis, who heads the Center for Community Health, Education
and Research in Dorchester. Jean-Louis was among those who led the
fight to lift a ban on all Haitian blood donors imposed by the Food
and Drug Administration, and to amend a high-risk-group list by the
Centers for Disease Control that came to be known as the ``Four-H
Club:'' homosexuals, hemophiliacs, heroin-users and Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians were removed from the CDC list in 1985; the blood ban
was lifted at the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people with HIV see that this stereotype still continues in
the media, they may not want to come out and get help. That makes
my work and the work of other providers more difficult,''
Jean-Louis said. ``But you cannot be taking to the street because
of two lines in a movie, and then when your next-door neighbor is
dying from a disease, you don't take to the street and instead do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, based on the best-selling novel by Terry McMillan,
Angela Bassett plays a 40-year-old divorcee and high-powered
stockbroker who travels to Montego Bay and meets a Jamaican man
half her age. When she returns, her sisters question her about the
affair, asking if she used a condom ``because those people have a
history of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sister then interjects, ``No, that's Haiti, Miss
Manners.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange sparked a spontaneous protest in Miami last week,
and Wednesday Haitians picketed in front of a movie theater in
mid-town Manhattan. On Tuesday, the Haitian consul in Boston _ home
to the third-largest population of Haitian immigrants after New
York and Miami _ joined other organizations to demand an apology, a
re-edit of the film and a studio-sponsored HIV/-AIDS education
campaign by 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the World Health Organization and
UNAIDS, Haiti is ranked 22d in the world in the rate of adults
living with the disease, with a rate of 5.17 percent. The top
country, Zimbabwe, has a rate of 25.84 percent. The rate in the US
is .76 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Haiti was one of the first countries associated
with the HIV virus, even though at the time Haiti had a much lower
rate of AIDS cases than other Caribbean countries and most US
cities. Almost immediately, the myth about a ``Haitian connection''
to AIDS set off an epidemic of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by public fear and flawed research, Haitians were
accused of exporting the virus. Years after medical evidence
debunked the myth among scientists and massive demonstrations
reversed social policy, it lingered in the popular imagination: the
myth found its way into recurring jokes on ``Saturday Night Live''
and ``The Arsenio Hall Show''.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some say, cruel misperceptions are being given new life
before a movie-going audience of millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled. This is outrageous,'' said Dr. Nicole Prudent, a
pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, who remembers when Haitian
children came to her office crying, shunned by classmates and
worried the virus lay dormant in them. ``We have been fighting
against this for such a long time and people still don't know that
AIDS has no nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bernadine Lormilus heard the joke, shock was the only thing
that kept her from walking out of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just boiled me up,'' said Lormilus, 22, who lives in
Brockton and studies elementary education at Regis College in
Weston. ``It's degrading to Haitians, it's degrading to Jamaicans,
it's irrelevant, it's outrageous and it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lormilus, born in Boston of Haitian parents, the taunts by
classmates of ``go back to your country'' and ``boat people'' are
still raw after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all of this was over with about Haitians bringing
AIDS,'' she said. ``To have it in Hollywood where everyone goes to
see it and looks up to these actors is just the worst thing that
can happen. Because once people hear it from them, they'll say it
must be true.''
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend it was released, ``Stella'' was the
second-highest grossing film, pulling in $11.8 million. That was
three weeks ago. Since then it has made another $16.2 million, with
roughly four million viewers, and still ranks in the weekly top ten
grossing films.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue on that scale is a testament to the growing power of
black Americans in film and for McMillan in particular. Her first
novel-to-film, ``Waiting to Exhale,'' was praised for portraying
middle-class women struggling with love and success.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a joke about Haitians and AIDS could surface in
``Stella,'' some say, shows how weak are the links that bind blacks
of different nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that whole scene wasn't there, it wouldn't have taken
anything away from the movie,'' said Brunir Shackleton, who works
for the mayor's Office of Jobs and Community Services in Boston.
``It just makes me feel that the whole so-called brotherhood, the
idea that being black automatically makes you sensitive to the
plight of other people with the same skin color, is lip service.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at 20th Century Fox WednesdayWednesday said the
studio had no comment. A spokeswoman at Signet Books, which is
releasing the paperback edition of McMillan's book, said the author
was unavailable. The joke about AIDS and Haiti does not appear in
the novel, only the film.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Farmer, a professor at Harvard Medical School who has
written several books on AIDS and Haiti, said most research shows
that HIV probably came to Haiti from North America through
sex-for-money exchanges by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the movie reference to AIDS and Haiti, Farmer said, ``In one
way, you can say, `Sure. It's just a movie.' The problem is, in
order for these misperceptions to stay alive, they have to keep
cropping up in popular culture. As long as they are shored up and
reiterated, they live on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he supports the march, Farmer said he wishes the same
passion applied to deep-rooted inequalities that have plagued
Haitians in the US and in Haiti for years.
</P>
<P>
   So would Jean-Louis, who once led Boston's battle against the
stigma, and who now helps care for some of the 566 known cases of
Haitians living with full-blown AIDS in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question really is, what are we going to do? What are our
priorities?'' he said. ``AIDS is a reality for Haitians now. ... We
should march for the movie, and we should march for the victims, so
they can seek care and live with dignity.''

   HARWICH, Mass. _ Holy historical accuracy, Batman! Where did you
really come from?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question Frank Foster Jr. is still adamantly raising,
even though Bob Kane is universally recognized as Batman's
inventor. To make his case, Foster, a retired commercial
photographer who lives in Harwich, slowly eases a stiff, slightly
wrinkled piece of paper dated 1932 out of a drawer.
</P>
<P>
   On it are three black-and-white drawings done by Foster's
father, Frank Sr., who attended several Boston art schools. Even a
casual glance reveals a comic strip figure bearing a stunning
resemblance to the Caped Crusader _ the same kind of rat ears on
his cap and a similar costume. There are two names written next to
the figure _ ``Nightwing'' and ``Batman.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the intrigue begins. The drawings, if they are the
real thing and were done in 1932, came seven years before the first
Batman comic book hit the newsstands, giving birth to one of
America's most enduring and lucrative superheroes.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sr., who died more than three years ago, went to his grave
believing his idea was lifted either by Kane or Kane's employer,
D.C. Comics So does his wife Ruth, who is 90 and lives in Harwich.
And so do his son Frank, 62, a retired commercial photographer, and
some of Frank Sr.'s friends.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting nearly three years ago at the New York City
headquarters of D.C. Comics, Paul Levitz, the company's executive
vice president and publisher, told Frank Jr. that he did not doubt
the authenticity of his father's drawings, according to notes of
the meeting kept by Foster's attorney, Bernard G. Sykes III, who
also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, all parties agree, is trying to establish a
clear link between Frank Sr., his drawings, Kane, and D.C. Comics.
A D.C. Comics official said privately that Foster and Kane may
simply have been influenced by the same sources. ``The issue is,
how do you show the direct correlation between his drawing and
seven years thereafter the arrival of Batman at D.C. Comics? And
that's a chain with some missing links,'' Sykes said. ``From a
legal standpoint, in order to prove damages, you have to have some
certainty. And that's a pretty high hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, Sykes adds, the story of Foster's drawings is a
``fascinating historical footnote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our meeting with them was very cordial, and they asked us if
we could tell them more to prove a connecting thread between Mr.
Foster and Mr. Kane, and that's where the situation lies now,''
said Sykes, who has an office in Harwich Port.
</P>
<P>
   Levitz and the other D.C. Comics official who attended the
meeting _ Lillian Laserson, D.C.'s vice president and general
counsel _ were on vacation last week and could not be reached for
comment. &UR;  &LR; Martha Tohomases, a spokeswoman for D.C. Comics, said of
Foster's account, ``That's an interesting story. We have a video
that we just showed at a comic convention in San Diego in which Bob
Kane talks about how he was influenced by da Vinci's sketches for
the Batman character. That's always been the history of Batman here
at D.C. comics.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jr. says he lacks the money to launch the kind of
investigation _ a scientific analysis of his father's drawings and
hiring detectives to determine if there was any connection between
Frank Sr. and Kane _ needed to try and prove his case. Part of the
reason he has never shown the drawings to anyone other than family
members and close friends before now was, ``I didn't know what I
could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he recently decided to seek publicity in hopes someone
might come forward with more information on the origins of Batman.
</P>
<P>
   Kane, who has served as a consultant on several Batman movies,
lives in California, but could not be located last week. He has
often said that his inspiration for Batman came from Leonardo da
Vinci's sketches of flying machines, and popular movie heroes from
the 1920s and '30s like Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Foster's memory has become fuzzier as the years have
passed. But this is the short version of the story, pieced together
from her recollections in a Globe interview, her written statements
to family lawyers, and an affidavit Frank Sr. gave to his attorney
in the 1970s:
</P>
<P>
   Armed with an art degree and a portfolio, including his Batman
drawings, Frank moved to New York in search of work. It was either
late 1936 or early 1937, and Frank made the rounds of numerous
companies that published comic books, dropping off his portfolio.
No one can remember if he visited D.C. Comics, but his son says it
is hard to believe his father did not go there because it was the
biggest comic book company and the offices were just a few blocks
from where his parents lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it could just be that two men had the same idea at
around the same time,'' Sykes said. ``It's happened before. But it
seems like an incredible coincidence. It would be fascinating to go
back and dig around.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Fosters moved to Washington in 1940, where
Frank got a job at what is now the National Gallery. It was in
Washington where Frank first spotted the Batman comic. ``He brought
it home and said, `Can you believe this,''' Ruth Foster recalled.
</P>
<P>
   They did not have the time or the money then to raise the issue,
she said, and over the years they stopped worrying about it. ``We
both never doubted what had happened, but as Batman got bigger and
bigger we didn't really think anyone would ever take us
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jr. also knows he has a difficult case to make. ``But I
would like to see some justice for my father,'' he said. ``At the
very least I would like to see him get some recognition.''

   Summer's end hasn't been as dull as I feared. In the past few
days I've had to contend with a dead iMac, a sluggish Gazelle, and
a Web site so bad that it apparently contributed to the US air
strike against a suspected chemical weapons plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Apple Computer Inc. iMac computer that the Globe purchased
for me was dead on arrival. Actually, the computer itself was fine,
as our techs could see when they plugged it into the Globe's
computer network. Nevertheless, the monitor stayed resolutely
blank.
</P>
<P>
   That was good news for the techs. Like me, they welcome any
excuse to use their screwdrivers. In minutes, the shapely iMac lay
in lovely blue-green pieces. The problem was quickly uncovered: a
loose connector on the machine's video card. But they've ordered me
a new one just to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's not necessarily Apple's fault. The cable could have
worked loose during shipment. Don't send me hundreds of e-mails
denouncing me as an enemy of the Macintosh. Last week's tidal wave
was quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I got many notes of praise for saying nice things
about the iMac. But my critical comments about the iMac's lack of a
floppy disk drive sent some of you into a fury.
</P>
<P>
   Others railed against me for citing ``inaccurate'' speed tests
from CMP Media Inc., which found that Macintosh computers generally
aren't as fast as Apple claims. But now PC Magazine Labs has
benchmarked the iMac. The result: The iMac is fast, but hardly a
barnburner. What do you expect for your $1,300?
</P>
<P>
   That's still more than a lot of consumers can afford, which is
why I had to get my hands on the Gazelle GZW180, by PrecisionTec
LLC of Costa Mesa, Calif. It's a Pentium-class computer at a
startling price _ $399.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay extra for a monitor, and in other ways as well.
Inferior performance, for instance. The Gazelle comes with Windows
95 rather than Windows 98. Worse yet, it comes with just 16
megabytes of memory. And you can use only 14 megs of that. In the
name of corner-cutting, the Gazelle has its video chip built right
onto the motherboard. But this chip isn't given its own separate
ration of high-speed video memory. Instead, it swipes two megabytes
that would normally be used by the processor. The results:
lower-quality video and slower computing speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazelle sports a mere 1.4 gigabyte hard drive; a pair of
tinny, staticky speakers; a flimsy keyboard; and a mouse of
surpassing cheesiness. And yet, the thing works, and it costs a
mere $399. The mind reels _ and so should the minds of Steve Jobs
and his colleagues at Apple. The brutal price wars in the PC
hardware business will continue to drive prices to levels Apple
can't touch. By next year, there'll be really good PCs selling at
Gazelle prices. If the iMac is to stay in the game, it'll have to
get a lot cheaper, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   I'll conclude this week with a warning to designers of World
Wide Web sites: Be careful what you publish on the 'Net _ your life
could depend on it.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation recently launched cruise missiles at a suspected
nerve gas plant in the Sudan, injuring at least 10 people. The
Sudanese government insists the plant, El Shifa Pharmaceuticals,
merely produced medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Our military people first denied this, but have since
backtracked. They still say the plant made chemicals used in nerve
gas, but they admit that El Shifa also made medicine. The plant
even had a contract to supply drugs to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't our military know this? According to the Los Angeles
Times, US intelligence services relied on a visit to El Shifa's Web
site. The site made no mention of drugs produced at the plant, and,
according to the paper, the intelligence folk took this as more
proof that El Shifa didn't make any. Bombs away.
</P>
<P>
   It creeps me out to imagine generals logging on to Yahoo to
decide who to blast. Still, this may get the attention of corporate
Webmasters, who all too often produce Web sites that lack vital
information like product listings, prices, or phone numbers. If I
flung Tomahawks at all the bad Web sites I've seen, there'd be a
smoldering crater every 20 paces. Good thing I'm not president.

YANDLE BELONGS IN PRISON FOR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 20, 1972, Joe Reppucci was murdered. His killers were
Joseph Yandle and Edward Fielding, who robbed Reppucci's Medford,
Mass., liquor store at gunpoint. On that day it was Fielding who
pointed the gun while Yandle readied the getaway car. In earlier
robberies, the roles had been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were caught, prosecuted, convicted of first-degree
murder, and sentenced to life without parole. But in Massachusetts
in the 1970s and 1980s, nobody went to prison for life, jury
verdicts notwithstanding. The state's official penal policy was
that everyone _ even first-degree murderers _ eventually made
parole. As part of that policy, criminals were routinely allowed to
leave their cells for unsupervised weekend furloughs. Over the
years, Yandle was set free at least 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, in the wake of the Willie Horton atrocity,
furloughs for first-degree murderers were abolished. (Horton, a
brutal killer, spent one of his furloughs raping a Maryland woman
and beating up her fiance.) For the first time, Yandle began to
fear that he might actually have to serve the sentence meted out
for his crime: a life without liberty.
</P>
<P>
   And so he embarked upon a public relations campaign to win
clemency. He submitted to the state's parole board a sheaf of
documents detailing his heroism in Vietnam and the medals he had
earned during two tours of duty. He explained that the war had left
him with a heroin addiction, and that it was only to support that
addiction that he turned to robbery. He got himself elected
president of the Massachusetts chapter of Vietnam Veterans of
America _ and on the cover of the organization's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It was all a fraud. Yandle had never been in Vietnam. His drug
habit dated from his mid-teens. The military documents were
forgeries. But no one thought to challenge his story, and a lot of
well-meaning people were eager to spread it. The Boston Globe
mounted a publicity campaign in Yandle's behalf, producing stories,
columns, and editorials promoting his plea for a commutation.
Twice, ``60 Minutes'' aired a segment on Yandle's case. Veterans
groups launched telephone and letter campaigns urging that he be
set free.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Yandle did more than lie about his past. He
became a model prisoner, overcame his drug abuse, earned two
college degrees. He expressed regret for his crime and counseled
fellow inmates. To all appearances, he had rehabilitated himself,
and his supporters argued that no good purpose would be served by
keeping him locked up. ``I do not believe I deserve to die in
prison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the clamor for Yandle's release, few thought about the
ongoing suffering of the Reppucci family. Like many who lose a
loved one to murder, Joe Reppucci's wife and sons never fully
recovered from that shattering day in 1972. For 23 years, they
ached for the husband and father Yandle and his accomplice had so
casually destroyed. The only thing that gave them comfort was the
promise, made solemnly in a court of law, that Joe's killers would
stay behind bars forever. It never occurred to them that a sentence
of life without parole could be tossed out merely because a convict
cleaned himself up and generated a wave of sympathetic PR.
</P>
<P>
   But in May 1995, Governor William Weld recommended that Yandle's
sentence be commuted. In June, the Governor's Council voted 5-1 to
let him go. On Oct. 11, he was released.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, when his web of lies finally came to light, he
was re-arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Now Massachusetts is again debating Yandle's fate. Should his
commutation be revoked? Can a commutation be revoked? Does Yandle's
elaborate deceit, as Governor Paul Cellucci says, undermine the
claim that he was ever truly rehabilitated in the first place? Or
was his Vietnam deception, though inexcusable, unrelated to the
remorse and self-improvement that were the basis for setting him
free?
</P>
<P>
   All of these questions are beside the point. Now as before,
there is only one question that matters: Was Yandle justly
sentenced? For if he was, there is nothing to debate.
</P>
<P>
   The jury that rendered the severest verdict possible under state
law was not concerned with the Yandle's military career, with his
drugs, with his lies, or with his personality. It was concerned
with his crime. The man was an accomplice to murder, the worst of
all offenses. For murder, no forgiveness is ever possible _ not in
this world _ for only victims have the right to forgive, and murder
wipes out its victims.
</P>
<P>
   Life without parole is a terrible punishment. It is meant to be.
For stealing a man's life, how could the law exact a penalty that
wasn't terrible? The price for Joe Reppucci's life was decided
fairly and imposed after due process of law. No one had the right
in 1995 to cheapen that price _ not Weld, not the Governor's
Council, not ``60 Minutes,'' not The Boston Globe, not the Vietnam
Veterans of America.
</P>
<P>
   It matters not that Yandle may no longer pose a threat to
society. It matters not that he wants to counsel at-risk kids. It
matters not whether he did or didn't earn two Purple Hearts. It
matters not that he now expresses shame for his crimes. It matters
only that he was guilty as charged.
</P>
<P>
   When Yandle has paid off his debt to society, then it will be
time to free him. But that debt is still owing, for Joe Reppucci is
still dead. Let his killers remain locked up until they are, too.

EXHIBIT SHOWCASES HISTORIC WHITE HOUSE DECOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. _ The Romanoffs had their Faberge Easter eggs. The
Clintons have The White House Collection of American Crafts,
precious objects made, like those jeweled eggs, for the delectation
of rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs scattered after the Russian Revolution, ended up in
museums and mansions all over the world. The White House
Collection, formed in 1993 at the Clintons' behest to mark the Year
of American Craft, is traveling, too, on a national tour. Currently
it's at the Peabody Essex Museum, where it offers ``both wonderful
primer and survey,'' says decorative arts curator Dean Lahikainen.
</P>
<P>
   What it also offers is work on a residential scale rather than
the huge pieces some craft masters are now making. Instead of one
of the room-sized installations glass master Dale Chihuly has been
turning out of late, for instance, there's his ``Cerulean Blue
Macchia With Chartreuse Lip Wrap.'' Relatively modest in size but
big in presence, as Chihuly's works tend to be, it is a fluid,
asymmetrical, rippling bowl that flares invitingly, the delicate
splotches of its surface resembling a pointillist painting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of one of the large-scale fantasies of celebrated
furniture artist Wendell Castle, there's a smallish but witty
table-sized clock whose base, made of two limp-looking pairs of
clock hands that seem to have keeled over with exhaustion, is
reminiscent of Dali's surreal paintings of melting pocket watches.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for these great American craft artists to be
represented by compact works. Those works were meant for specific
spots in the White House _ a tabletop, say, or a mantelpiece. What
we have here is the craft equivalent of the proverbial and much
maligned painting to go over the sofa _ work that has to harmonize
with pre-existing surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Take David Levi's blown glass ``Bird Jar'' for the White House
Blue Room. The bird is blue, too, as are the feet of the jar, whose
body is bright yellow. Perched on a marble-topped table smack in
the center of the space, Levi's little blue bird holds its own in
the company of the Imperial eagles that turn up on the room's
Empire furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Dante Marioni's glass ``Yellow Pair,'' color coordinated
with the Yellow Oval Room. Like many works in the collection,
``Yellow Pair'' alludes to the past. The ``Pair'' borrows the forms
of the Greek kylix and oinochoe _ a shallow bowl and a tall, thin
vessel _ but Marioni brings them into the present by blowing up
their scale.
</P>
<P>
   The lavish book that serves as the exhibition's catalog _ ``The
White House Collection of American Crafts'' (Abrams, $35) _ is full
of photographs of other serendipitous marriages between
contemporary work and historic decor. The gold interiors of Cheryl
Williams's ``Prayer Bowls'' echo the gilt mirror and clock in the
White House entrance hall. The slim, elongated forms of Michael
Sherrill's ``Incandescent Bottles'' echo the slim elegance of
Jacqueline Kennedy in a portrait hanging in the Vermeil Room. The
rich browns of wooden bowls by Philip Moulthrop and Ronald Kent
complement the browns of an Empire table in the Grand Staircase.
The arrangement of the collection is a crash course in how to mix
centuries and styles.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons aren't the first White House occupants concerned
with craft. In 1882, President Chester Arthur commissioned a
Tiffany screen for his official residence. Mostly, though, crafts
have been the domain of first ladies. In his essay in the
exhibition catalog, the show's curator, Michael Monroe, notes that
in 1913 Woodrow Wilson's wife, Ellen, furnished the ``Blue Mountain
Room'' in the White House with fabrics handwoven by women from the
Blue Ridge Mountains. In 1927, Eleanor Roosevelt helped organize
Val-Kill Industries, a workshop producing Colonial Revival
furniture, some of which wound up in the White House, along with
coverlets woven in Virginia under the auspices of the WPA. In 1977,
Rosalyn Carter had the tables in the State Dining Room set with
contemporary handmade pottery, glassware, napkin rings, and
centerpieces, all expressly created for the occasion, a Senate
wives' luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, when the Clintons moved in, there was general
recognition that the nation was, as Lahikainen puts it, ``in the
middle of a craft renaissance. We're now at the point where
shopping malls have excellent craft shops.'' His own museum, the
Peabody Essex, which already had fine holdings in Early American
artisanry, has recently started to collect contemporary crafts.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't already know that the 72 objects in The White
House Collection were by American artists, would you be able to
guess their country of origin? ``No,'' says Lahikainen, ``not
necessarily.'' This is sophisticated, worldly work, neither
regional nor following in a folk tradition. It's completely of the
1990s. Had the collection been assembled 30 years ago, it might
have been heavy on somber brown pots, macrame, and wood that echoed
Shaker or Japanese sources. But American craft has grown up, gone
from rustic to refined _ and that makes it resonate with the
Federal and Empire furnishings of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Since that house has more visitors than most _ over a million
annually _ The White House Collection stands to have a big impact,
once the works return home after their tour. Lahikainen notes that
visitors to the Peabody Essex's presentation of the collection are
``personalizing this show, daydreaming about which work they'd
choose if they could pick one to take home.'' And which would he
choose? Po Shun Leong's complex ``Cityscape Box,'' he says, which
is based on architecture and archeology of legend and fact.
Constructed of exotic woods, its drawers swing open to reveal
secret hiding places. With a boat, an obelisk, staircases, columns,
mountains, and golden doorways, it looks like a metropolis from a
sci-fi film. ``You can see what fun he had making this,'' says
Lahikainen. ``It's like a lost world.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme from Po Shun Leong's world-in-a-box is the
simplicity and sobriety of Sam Maloof's 1982 walnut rocking chair,
the only piece of furniture in the show. (The White House is
already packed with furniture; there wasn't room for more.) Many
furniture makers feel that a chair is the ultimate design and
engineering challenge. Maloof's looks simple, but its contours are
precisely gauged to maximize comfort, and its proportions are
generous enough to accomodate a linebacker. Maloof's chair was
donated to the White House by Barbaralee Diamonstein and Carl
Spielvogel; Diamonstein, a noted cultural commentator, has also
contributed a fine catalog essay, tracing the history of American
craft from ancient Native American work, through the Industrial
Revolution and the Arts and Crafts movement that rebelled against
machine-made shoddiness, right up to the eclectic styles of the
present.
</P>
<P>
   While Michael Monroe included artisans from various regions of
the country, he wisely didn't force himself to choose someone from
each state. Only 26 states are represented; Washington and
California tied for the largest number of artists in the
collection, with seven apiece. Massachusetts has four: ceramists
Thomas Hoadley of Lanesborough and Mara Superior of Williamsburg;
and glass artists Sidney Hutter of Waltham and Josh Simpson of
Shelburne Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's ``Megaworld'' was, when he made it in 1994, the
largest solid glass sphere in the world, weighing in at 53 pounds.
(He's since made one even bigger.) ``Imagine lifting 50 pounds of
molten liquid on the end of a 5 foot long pipe that you need to
turn,'' Simpson says, by way of explaining the challenge of the
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Most works in The White House Collection were donated by their
makers; Simpson's was given by a collector of his work, Stewart
Rosenblum. Simpson's glassware had already been seen in the White
House: Rosalyn Carter used his wine goblets at that long-ago lunch.
But inclusion in the official collection was ``thrilling,'' he
says. ``As a craftsperson in a tiny little town in Massachusetts,
to have my art recognized in such a profound and public way
validates all these years I've spent working on this windy
hilltop.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior's ``A Cocoa Pot'' is typical of her witty twists on
tradition. A pot flattened and enlarged so it becomes a tribute to
a historical form, it is decorated with lettering, lacy patterns,
and brown specks. ``I heard that Hillary took about 30 of the
pieces in the collection upstairs, and the pot was one of them,''
Superior says proudly, ``so they lived with it for a year before it
went on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass and ceramics are the strongest media in the collection,
but there are fine objects in wood, fiber, and metal as well. Akira
Blount's ``Man in Lion Costume'' is one. A cloth doll with a lion
mask that lifts to reveal a human face, it suggests that an animal
can possess traits valued in humans, including gentleness and
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Collection is, for the most part, a display of
non-functional tours de force of technique and design. You're not
likely to look at the ceramics in this show and wonder whether
they're microwavable. One of the few things you can actually
imagine using is a stoneware bowl just 3 1/2 inches high, glazed
with a washed-out red, animated with calligraphic strokes. Its
modesty contrasts with the attention-grabbing attitude of almost
everything else in the show. Its maker: Joan Mondale.

THE NEW HEARTTHROB: THE GIRLY MAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Science may have shed light on the mystery of the current crop
of male movie hearthrobs, who almost to a boy-man look like
somebody's little sister. Recent studies of facial attractiveness
have found that people of boths sexes prefer delicate-featured,
rounder-faced, more feminine-looking men over traditionally
masculine-looking types.
</P>
<P>
   From all reports no one seems exactly sure what this means, or
if it means anything, but perhaps helps explain Leonardo DiCaprio,
Matt Damon, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, et al., each and every one of
them just too adorable for words.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a blessing that William Holden, Clark Gable, John
Wayne, and other craggy screen hunks of yore didn't live to see
their places in the popular imagination usurped by a bunch of
baby-faced post-adolescents. I'm trying to imagine Leo sweeping up
Vivien Leigh and ascending that staircase in ``Gone With the
Wind.'' I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the studies are published in the current issue of
Nature. Strange as it may seem to some, illuminating Leo's appeal
was not the main aim of the cross-cultural research, conducted in
Scotland and Japan. Scientists were investigating what makes a face
attractive to both sexes. They weren't surprised when both male and
female subjects expressed a preference for ``ultra-feminized''
female faces, with high, round cheeks, wide eyes, a small nose, and
full lips. But they were caught off guard by the preference for
male faces with similar feminine features.
</P>
<P>
   They had predicted that both female and male subjects would be
drawn to mature male faces with larger features, heavy brows, and
big jaws. They assumed that such men, bristling as they are with
testosterone, would be impressive to other males and irresistible
to females. But they weren't. One of the Scottish researchers told
a New York Times reporter, ``When it was found early on that there
was a preference for feminized male faces, nobody believed it, so
we did it again, and again. The preference for a feminized face
keeps coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that most recently the research team ``replicated this
work among hunter-gatherer tribes in the Amazon.'' Science marches
on, into the heart of the rain forest, in search of answers. Except
there are no answers. The results of these studies are wide open to
intepretation. According to the Times story, one theory put forward
by the researchers is that women may prefer more feminine-looking
men ``because they give the appearance of being sensitive, honest,
and potentially reliable fathers.'' Because they look like women,
presumably.
</P>
<P>
   For women _ particularly for young women, who buy a lot of movie
tickets _ Leo and his ilk are probably less threatening than macho
types. It's safe to swoon over these sweet-looking guys. They're so
sensitive, so vulnerable, so ... feminine?
</P>
<P>
   But what explains the male preference for feminine-looking
males? Maybe hyper-masculine men are intimidating to ordinary men.
In terms of movie idols, for example, what man can measure up to
the super-macho image of John Wayne? Leonardo DiCaprio is merely
cute, therefore no real threat. That's the fantasy, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory: It may be that all the girls and young women who
are crazy over Leo only want to mother him. The current issue of
Psychology Today has a short piece about Lesley Zebrowitz,
professor of psychology at Brandeis and author of a book, ``Reading
Faces.'' Her research indicates that baby-faced adults bring out
the nurturing instincts in both men and women. I can almost see a
remake of ``Sunset Boulevard,'' with Leo as Joe Gillis and Barbra
(``I am big. It's the pictures that got small.'') Streisand as
Norma Desmond. In this version, she adopts him.

BATHROOM FAN PULLS IN DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have an exhaust fan directly over the tub/shower. When it
is on, I get dust that looks like lint on the vanity top. How can I
prevent that linty dust from building up on surfaces?
</P>
<P>
   MARY GUERRIERO, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Clean the duct from the fan, where it goes through the wall
or soffit to the outdoors. If you find lint there, you know the
source of your problem. Also, if there is a door at the outside end
of the duct, make sure it is fully open when the fan is on and, of
course, fully closed when it's off.
</P>
<P>
   It is my guess that there is some sort of backdraft in the duct
when the fan is on, bringing some lint from the duct itself back
into the room.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a house built in the 1930s, and one of my first
chores is to strip five coats of paint off the fireplace brick. Is
there an fast, easy way to do it?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT STODDARD, Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, yes there is. Pay some long-suffering painter to do it.
OK, enough frivolity. No, there is no fast, easy way to do it. It
is hard, frustrating work, and when you are halfway done you will
say, ``Why did I ever start it?'' But hope springs eternal, because
many of us have done this, including the handyman, and here's how:
Use Peel Away, or a methylene chloride stripper such as Stripeeze
or 5F5. Use lots and lots of ventilation when working with the
compound, because it is toxic. Apply a coat, let it sit for 15
mintues, and start scraping with a wide, stiff putty knife. If only
the top layer of paint softens, then don't scrape; apply another
coat of stripper. It works through itself and will get to lower
layers of paint. Repeat this procedure until you get pretty well
down to the brick. Apply another coat of stripper and scrub with
very coarse steel wool. Wear rubber gloves and protect other areas
of skin and your eyes. Finally, you may have to switch to a liquid
stripper rather than the gel stripper; the liquid may get into the
pores and other nooks and crannies of the brick better than the
gel.
</P>
<P>
   There are citrus based strippers such as Citristrip, which are
safer to use than the methylene chloride types, but they are likely
to work slower.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 1 1/2-year-old Amana refrigerator makes a high-pitched
sound every 30 to 45 minutes. A service man came twice and told me
it is normal, due to a new type of coolant used these days. Is this
true? If so, what can I do about it? Should I buy a new
refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   ATTILIO CERALDI, Mooresville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A fan noise in a refrigerator is normal, but I don't think it
is because of a new coolant, but rather is part of the no-frost
system, which circulates the air through a fan. These systems have
been in refrigerators for the past 30 years. Maybe some appliances
are quieter than others, but I don't think it is worth replacing
the present refrigator, unless of course you can determine that
another model or brand is much quieter. Mine doesn't whine but
sometimes makes the strangest moaning noises.
</P>
<P>
   You can try muffling the sound. I did it successfully some years
ago for a unit that had a high whine. Build an alcove that you can
insert the refigerator into, as deep as practicable and with enough
room at the top and sides for air circulation. Line the sides,
back, and ceiling of the alcove with acoustical tiles, which absorb
sound. A few tiles on the floor will help, too. Put the
refrigerator on medium-density rubber pads to help reduce the
vibration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My son's house has window wells, but they stick out 24 inches
from the house and the standard plastic bubble covers come only in
16- and 18-inch depths. What else can be used over these holes so
that rain and debris do not collect? Does anyone custom-make these
covers?
</P>
<P>
   ELAINE MYERS, Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your son could make his own window-well covers, using a wood
frame, say, of 2(MUL)2s and acrylic or Plexiglas plastic, hinged to
the wall. He may have to build up the sides of the well itself so
that the cover slopes, but that's no problem. He could tack a strip
of rubber or other flexible flashing over the hinged side to
prevent water from getting in that joint. Any slight leaking that
would occur without flashing is insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Or, yes, you can order them from a custom maker if you provide
specifications and dimensions. Write to or call Dilworth
Manufacturing Co., Box 158, Honey Brook, PA 19344; telephone
717-354-8956.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The mortar in my chimney is coming out, but there are no
leaks. One man said he would repoint the chimney (chip out old
mortar and insert new) for $625, another said he would rebuild the
chimney from the roofline up, for $1,250. Are those prices
reasonable, and if so, which way should I go?
</P>
<P>
   GINA VILLA, Milford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Both prices are reasonable, I think. If the bricks are
intact, and not spalling or chipping off in any way, then
repointing, if done right, is the way to go. If some or a lot of
the bricks are deteriorating, then rebuilding from the roofline up,
with new bricks, would be best.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

WRONGLY ACCUSED AT BC, KIERNAN SPEIGHT IS STARTING OVER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Va. _ Another August, another football season, and
Kiernan Speight was hurting.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good kind of hurt, the kind that comes with two-a-day
sessions, football training camp, and the anticipation of a new
season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of tiredness that comes on a Saturday morning
late in August after a tough two-hour scrimmage, like this one that
had given him his first real taste of football in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling real good,'' said Speight when the session was over.
``Like nothing ever happened. Like this is where I was always meant
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight is here at Hampton University, playing cornerback on a
team that will begin its season Saturday against Florida A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly enough, the road that runs past the practice field is
called Emancipation Drive.
</P>
<P>
   He is here among new friends, teammates, and expectations that
weren't even on the radar screen a year ago _ freed, finally, from
the past year, which had been so bleak, so stunning in its reversal
of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   So much had changed, so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   One day he was at Boston College, playing in the Big East, a
defensive back with a football career that once looked full of
potential.
</P>
<P>
   And then, suddenly, his career was in a state of suspended
animation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Heights to depths
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never had Kiernan Speight felt like such an outsider. ``Why
me?'' he thought. Why couldn't it have been different, the way it
had been a couple of years earlier when he arrived at BC, guided by
his teachers and coaches at H.D. Woodson High School in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   ``An opportunity,'' they told him then. ``A great opportunity to
prove yourself as a student, as a football player, and as a man.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't that, of course. Not yet. He was just 18, out on his
own, wondering where the road would take him next.
</P>
<P>
   But by the middle of the fall, he was not only playing for the
Eagles. He was starting. A freshman! And while the Big East may not
be the Big Ten or the Southeastern Conference, it was still the big
time. Playing at places like Notre Dame and Miami. Getting all that
TV exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Speight experienced all that and marveled at his good fortune.
His mind wandered. One day he would be an NFL cornerback, an
All-American, like Charles Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Other days, he would be a doctor. He liked that idea, too. At
BC, he took some premed courses. He had goals. Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that seemed so long ago. Instead of BC, Speight was in
Hampton, walking around a campus that gave him no sense of comfort,
no sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   The faces he saw were those of strangers. Over at Armstrong
Field, where the Division 1-AA Hampton Pirates were practicing,
Speight was also a stranger. Who were those guys, anyway? Football
players, sure. But they weren't teammates. Or friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' coach, a no-nonsense disciplinarian named Joe
Taylor, knew who Speight was. Taylor had also come out of Woodson
and played for the same high school coach, Robert Headen, who had
guided Speight. It was on Headen's request that Speight wound up at
Hampton. But while Taylor knew who Speight was, knew all about his
past and his background and the circumstances that had brought him
to Hampton, he didn't really know Speight, what motivated him, what
ticked him off, what made him tick.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there, because at that point, last fall, Kiernan
Speight didn't quite know what was in his head or who he was.
</P>
<P>
   All he knew was that he was no longer playing football, no
longer at Boston College, and no longer sure of anything.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
An innocent target
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flashback time. Fall of 1996. The Boston College football team
is going from bad to worse each week. No one, even among the
Eagles, knows what the real problem is. All they know is that it's
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Halloween weekend and the Eagles are coming off the
dog game of all dog games, an embarrassing 20-13 loss against a
Pittsburgh team that would lose games that season by scores of
72-0, 45-0, and 60-6.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Eagles, the Panthers had looked like the Steelers.
It was so bad, with so many missed tackles and mistakes, that some
observers jokingly question whether the Eagles tanked the game.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, rumors float around the BC campus. Whispers become
louder. Maybe there is something to the rumors. Talk of shaving
points, of players at least being involved in a gambling scandal,
picks up.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings are held with coach Dan Henning, athletic director Chet
Gladchuk, and school officials. No one is saying anything, but
something is amiss.
</P>
<P>
   In a players' and coaches' meeting Saturday, with the media now
alert to a growing crisis, all hell breaks loose.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a gambling scandal. Yes, players have made bets,
and some may have even bet against their own team.
</P>
<P>
   Now names start to come out. Thirteen players in all, which
makes it the biggest betting scandal in NCAA history. Those
targeted in a players-only meeting are Jermaine Monk, Jamall
Anderson, Brandon King, and ... Kiernan Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, stunned that he has been implicated _ and publicly, at
that _ verbally lashes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not me,'' he says. ``No way.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, with all the minicameras rolling, Middlesex
County District Attorney Thomas Reilly reviews a list of players
implicated. Name after name is announced.

   TAKE-BOS  
 HAMPTON, Va.: ... is announced . 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Missing from that list is Kiernan Speight. There are no charges,
no accusations. For all intents and purposes, Speight has been
cleared. He is told he is welcomed back on the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Speight doesn't want to hear that. He wants to hear someone
say publicly, as well as privately, that they are sorry. That they
made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he hears only silence, a silence that he says continues
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   In Speight's mind and in those of his family and friends, the
damage is irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   Go back and play against Notre Dame the next week? You've got to
be kidding. He hires a lawyer, threatens a lawsuit against BC, and
makes the only decision that seems logical. He leaves BC _ forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still doesn't make sense,'' Speight said, months later,
painfully looking back. ``None of it, really. I guess it was guilt
by association more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A clean slate
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anger of 18 months ago has left him. He picks through his
memory, reliving the chaos and the confusion with a calm
detachment.
</P>
<P>
   He is older now, wiser. If there is resentment, it is muted.
</P>
<P>
   Others do not feel the same way, however.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodson High School, Susie Kay, a history teacher who was
instrumental in Speight's enrollment at Boston College, wonders how
things went so wrong as well as why they happened.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's father, John, questions all of it with a sense of
regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thankful for what happened to him,'' he said. ``But
since it happened, it was a blessing in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   John Speight still wonders about the racial aspects of the case,
which he says were a factor.
</P>
<P>
   But what bothers John Speight most is the lack of remorse or
regret from BC officials after the fact, after the allegations had
been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish deep down they would have apologized,'' he said. ``That
would have helped a lot. But they never did.''
</P>
<P>
   John Speight says his feelings about BC are mixed. ``There are
things I could say but I won't. That time was one of dark clouds.
We didn't know what to say to Kierney. How to help him. But there
were a lot of people in his corner who have helped, and I think
we've all learned from it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Speight says he is not bitter toward BC. ``That's the wrong
word,'' he said. ``Hurt is better. I just think the situation could
have been handled better. Much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Headen makes it clear that he is not as forgiving or
forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder why they would never apologize,'' he said. ``They put
all those guys' pictures in the paper and on television, and
naturally, people think he's guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Headen paused. He concedes that the changeover in the BC
athletic administration has been complete. Henning and Gladchuk are
gone. New levels of communications and crisis management are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a man who holds grudges in this instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never send anyone to Boston College,'' he said. ``And
I will tell all the coaches I know to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom O'Brien, Henning's successor as BC football coach,
understands the anger, the resentment, knowing that he ultimately
will have to pay for it if he loses a blue-chip recruit because of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happened once when I was at Virginia,'' said O'Brien.
``All you can do is sit down with the coach and explain yourself.
And then hope that time can heal the wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight says he is recovering, slowly but steadily. But it has
been a difficult transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do well in the first semester,'' said Joe Taylor,
standing on a practice field after last week's scrimmage, looking
over at a player he never thought he'd have a chance to get. ``I
think he needed time to just get used to everything. A lot of it
was still new to him. Now he's fine. It's a win-win situation for
him and for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a man with a reputation as a no-nonsense coach, says he
checked things out about Speight, even called the NCAA to make sure
there were no lingering eligibility problems.
</P>
<P>
   When he got the go-ahead, he penciled Speight into his plans for
this season. ``He's had the best training camp of anyone so far,''
said Taylor. ``The Kiernan I see in practice now is the Kiernan I
remember coming out of high school.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Looking forward
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speight says he is now focused on the future, not the past.
``All that stuff is behind me now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall was his most difficult period. ``I wasn't even sure I
wanted to be in school,'' he said. ``I was just confused about a
lot of things. I didn't know any people. I thought I might just
take a year off from school. But it's gotten better. I feel I'm
pretty close to being on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about his tenure at BC and he pauses. ``No, I'm not
angry,'' he says, choosing his words carefully. ``It was just a bad
period. But I don't resent the city or the people there. Boston is
a great city, and the people are great. Things just didn't work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   He has made a change in career objectives as well, dropping his
premed major courses and switching to marketing.
</P>
<P>
   He says if he could step in a time machine and go back three
years, he wouldn't change much in the way he handled things. ``I
regard it as a learning experience,'' he said. ``An unfortunate
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, things just seemed to snowball on us. We started
out with great expectations and we had some disappointing losses,
and things started to steamroll, get out of control. I think the
gambling incident was used as an excuse to blame all those
problems. But it really didn't have anything to do with our
season.''
</P>

   He is firm in declaring his innocence of any wrongdoing. ``I was
judged guilty because I was part of the group,'' he said. ``But
it's not something I worry about anymore. It's time to move on, and
that's what I'm doing.''

MARKET SLUMP COULD MEAN RECRUITMENT DOWNTURN AT FUND FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executive recruiter Joe Haberman was on the phone this week with
one of his clients, a private investment management firm. The
message: Hit the brakes on their search for three new managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to wait until the end of the week to see how the
market responds,'' said Haberman, managing director of the
financial institutions group at A.T. Kearney, a large executive
search firm.
</P>
<P>
   Caution is the watchword at investment management firms around
the country after Monday's stock market plunge. The question of the
moment: What would happen to one of the state's most important
industries if the stock market went south for a prolonged period of
time?
</P>
<P>
   Investment executives insist publicly that such a scenario would
have little or no impact at their companies. History over the last
decade is less conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies and other investment firms have been
hiring people, leasing office space, and contracting for services
at a furious pace through much of the 1990s and almost nonstop over
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a question of the impact on a single industry. The
economic ripple effect of the money management work force stretches
far beyond the world of fund accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very high-paying jobs and their impact on the
economy is much greater than the numbers would suggest,'' said Mark
Zandi, chief economist for Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa. ``One lost job in the mutual fund industry has a much
greater affect than one lost job in retailing or even
manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston's commercial real estate market, money managers have
been the clients with a seemingly insatiable appetite. When
developers recently reinvented Lafayette Place as an expanded
office building, investment custodian State Street Bank &AMP; Trust and
mutual fund manager Massachusetts Financial Services signed up to
lease every square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services firms, excluding banks, accounted for more
than 30 percent of all the space in Boston commerical real estate
transactions so far this year, according to Spaulding &AMP; Slye. In
the early 1990s, when real estate was in recession, Fidelity and
its fund competitors seemed to be the only companies looking for
space.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund executives, almost unanimously, said Wednesday that
an extended stock market decline would not force them to make
cutbacks. They pointed to factors such as the powerful and
predictable flow of retirement money into investment accounts as a
steadying influence. They said the most likely impact of a bad
stock market would be slower growth for their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find that the jobs associated with these types of
savings vehicles are servicing jobs,'' said David Weinstein, chief
of administration and government affairs at Fidelity. ``They are
not so dependent on the level of the Dow or Nasdaq. They are really
more dependent on the number of customers and accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those retirement accounts have been a big part of the growth of
leading Boston fund companies like Fidelity and Putnam Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's local payroll has grown from 7,000 to about 13,000
since the start of the 1990s. The company, which occupied 1.2
million square feet of office space in 1990, now needs 3.6 million
square feet to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Putnam Investments employed just over 2,000
people and leased 425,600 square feet. Today, Putnam has 5,600
employees, almost all local, working in just over 1 million square
feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   Even smaller firms like Massachusetts Financial Services have
had an economic impact, increasing its payroll 67 percent to 1,873
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a high-tech firm that has to make a new sale of a chip
or a personal computer to maintain its business, ours is a more
stable business,'' said Richard Tibbetts, a managing director at
Putnam Investments in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Several large companies said they had already planned for slower
growth, giving themselves a breather after several years of
high-octane expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already told analysts we don't expect to see that kind
of explosive growth,'' said Marshall Carter, chief executive of
State Street Corp. ``We want to track our traditional double-digit
(earnings) growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experience of the past decade suggests that financial
markets do have an impact on investment firms and their business.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts employment at financial firms, excluding banks,
was nearly flat for four years after the stock market crash of
1987, according to Fred Breimyer, chief economist at State Street
Bank &AMP; Trust. Some firms, including Fidelity, cut their work forces
after the market declines that year.
</P>
<P>
   Those same firms increased their combined work force over the
next several years, but the gains stopped again in 1994 when
interest rates rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Investment firms started hiring aggressively again in 1995 and
haven't stopped through this year, boosting total employment by
about 50 percent in 3 1/2 years to about 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Breimyer and others were skeptical investment firms could
continue to grow quickly in a declining stock market, particularly
after several years of such dramatic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of many public money management firms reflected
similar apprehension this week.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Boston-based Affiliated Managers Group Inc. continued
a slide that has cut the company's value in half since its July
peak. United Asset Management Corp. stock lost about 15 percent in
a week. Shares of local investment firms as varied as Liberty
Financial Cos., Nvest L.P., and the Pioneer Group Inc. have all
lost substantial ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has boomed along with a booming stock market,''
said Zandi, the economist. ``It stands to reason that if the market
declines, it's going to take a lot of steam out of the industry's
growth.''

DRUM CALLS FROM A MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our friends, Judith and Michael, invited us to dinner the other
night, and Judith showed me her new drum, a 3-foot-tall goatskin
and hardwood instrument made in Africa. She is part of a drumming
group that meets every Wednesday night here in Marblehead under the
tutelage of Mohamed Kalifa Camara, her West African teacher.
Judith's not only learning how to drum, she's learning about the
role that drumming has historically played in the rural culture of
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mohamed taught us one rhythm which signals the beginning of
the coming-of-age ritual,'' she told me, ``and another that summons
the community to resolve a couple's marital difficulties.'' When a
man and wife in Guinea find things getting out of hand, they call a
meeting of their families, and perhaps village officials, to help
them resolve their dispute.
</P>
<P>
   As Judith spoke, I was flooded with memories of a time when my
marriage to Jack was far more tumultuous than it is now. I can
recall two occasions when our emotions were so out of control that
we felt trapped in an impossible situation, afraid to continue
arguing, yet unable to let the matter go. In both instances we
turned to friends or to family, hoping they could keep us from
doing something we might live to regret.
</P>
<P>
   The first incident took place in the '70s. Jack and I had been
married about a dozen years, but our nerves were still raw when it
came to dealing with Jack's sister's suicide, which occurred while
we were on our honeymoon. In those days I was adamantly insisting
that I was merely a bystander to that tragedy, even though every
time Marge and I had been brought together, it had been like
introducing a match to dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think that if I got upset enough, Jack would stop
challenging my version of the part I'd played in Marge's death. My
cries of pain and outraged declarations of innocence were designed
to persuade him to cease and desist. This time, however, it wasn't
working. As Jack persisted, I became hysterical. I couldn't stop
upping the ante; Jack wasn't willing to capitulate to appease me. I
was sobbing uncontrollably on the bed when he called friends with
whom we'd once shared the circumstances of Marge's death and asked
them if we could come over.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and I each got to present our point of view. I sat on the
couch next to Jim, feeling the comfort of his strength. Jack was in
a chair near Judy, feeling the comfort of her gentleness. I can't
remember a word we said, but when we left after an hour or two, we
had somehow managed to get back in touch with the love that had
brought us together.
</P>
<P>
   I have only a visual image of the second incident. Jack and I,
having driven to Boston separately, were in line outside a movie
theater. I have no idea what we were arguing about, but Jack said
something so infuriating that, for the one time I can remember, I
resorted to violence to make my point. I swung my pocketbook at his
head with all my might. He raised his hand and warded off the blow,
but he was outraged. Trembling with rage myself, I took a page out
of my father's book and stormed off.
</P>
<P>
   I headed for my car. I considered going somewhere Jack would not
be able to find me. I wanted to make him worry, but as I drove, I
cooled down and headed for home. I spent an anxious half-hour in
our kitchen, waiting for Jack to arrive. Finally, the phone rang.
My brother explained that Jack had driven to his place in Watertown
and asked Ken to come home with him to mediate our argument. Ken's
presence helped us focus and created a safe space for us to share
our feelings about what had happened. With an impartial observer in
the same room, Jack and I managed to resolve whatever had set us
off.
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky to have people in our lives who were unafraid of a
highly emotional interaction. By not being too embarrassed to ask
for help, we turned them into the equivalent of a UN peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that both times Jack was the one who summoned
help. Researcher John Gottman has been able to predict the
likelihood of divorce from the degree of physiological stress the
male experiences in response to the female's perceived criticism or
anger. Too high and the marriage shatters. Jack was wisely trying
to reduce his anxiety to manageable proportions, and in a culture
without tribal gatherings or a counsel of elders, he took the only
course available. He picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   He was expecting a dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   What he got was the beating of drums.

JONES UNMOVED BY PLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVE VALLEY, Colo. _ By and large, offensive linemen are among
the friendliest, most thoughtful, and most talkative players on a
football team. Even so, they usually go unnoticed except when their
quarterback is being pummeled to bits or their running backs are
being tackled behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive linemen of the Denver Broncos are no different.
They're friendly, thoughtful, and talkative _ not to mention very
good.
</P>
<P>
   But last season they found a way to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped talking to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Denver media are talking about the Broncos' offensive
line, because once again, that line is in the spotlight _ and not
because that line is hammering linebackers and defensive linemen as
it did against the Packers in last January's Super Bowl. This
season that line is in flux and has questions swirling around it.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when camp opened in July and speculation was
rampant that Gary Zimmerman once again would ``unretire'' and
return to left tackle, just as he had done a few weeks into the
1997 season. Watching this drama play out and watching it most
closely was Tony Jones, who was moved back to right tackle from
left tackle when Zimmerman came back to the Broncos last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike (Shanahan) had promised what happened in 1997 wouldn't
happen again in 1998,'' said Jones. ``And I put my faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones already had made clear to the coach ``that I wasn't going
back to right tackle this year. I told Mike, `This is it. I'm not
playing right tackle. If you want me to play left, I'll play left.
But I'm not playing right tackle.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the two Denver newspapers and the vast media that cover the
Broncos kept reporting on Zimmerman's status _ the reports often
were conflicting _ and Jones was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed when they moved me to right tackle last
season,'' he said. ``But I looked upon it as a team thing and I
figured, `What do I want here? Do I want to go to the Super Bowl or
do I want to think about personal things?' It was a thing where you
had to put your ego down.''
</P>
<P>
   But the move back to right tackle was far from smooth. ``I think
I was having an All-Pro year at left tackle when they moved me to
right,'' said Jones. ``I wasn't happy when they moved me. I almost
got to the point of retiring, things were so bad. I was frustrated.
I couldn't play right tackle at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an 11-year veteran, had played right tackle for one
season ``way back in 1989, and I couldn't remember nothin' about
it. I remember coming home and telling my wife a couple of times,
`This is it. I can't do it.' There was one game against Oakland
where I was terrible and I was real close to retiring. I battled it
for weeks. I was thinking, `I've been so good at left, I've been
there the whole time, and why do I have to go and start over
again?'''
</P>
<P>
   But ``praying to God'' and his wife's encouragement convinced
him to stay with the team. As the season wore on, Jones felt more
and more at home at right tackle, and by the Super Bowl, the Denver
offensive line was awesome.
</P>
<P>
   So when the talk began anew this summer that Zimmerman might
return, Jones knew that was an experience he did not want to go
through again. But Zimmerman announced finally that he is retired
for good.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is now at left tackle and Harry Swayne, a well-traveled
12-year veteran, is at right tackle. Also gone, though, is right
guard Brian Habib, who left Denver to sign with Seattle. And right
guard became an even larger question mark when David Diaz-Infante,
Habib's replacement, was hurt in the exhibition season, so Dan
Neil, a second-year pro, will be making his first start there
against the Patriots Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   All is not well on this line.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, the running back who's most dependent on
stability in front of him, conceded that it may take a few games
before the new Denver line starts to click.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see teams whose lines have been together for years and
they still didn't get to the point where we were last year,'' said
Jones. But the tackle is confident that Denver's line once again
will be good, even if it may take a few games.
</P>
<P>
   Center Tom Nalen of Foxborough, Mass., and Boston College agrees
with Jones. For one thing, said Nalen, ``Tony played left tackle
throughout camp last year and the first two games (of the 1997
season). And we won those first two games and Terrell had a couple
of 100-yard rushing games. The big deal is with Tony and Harry
switching sides and each getting comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry on the line ``should be there,'' said Nalen, ``even if
it takes a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nalen and Jones said these words only hours before the offensive
line decided to go mute once again in the 1998 season. But going
silent will not be the only reason the Broncos' offensive line _
the team's strength last year _ will be noticed this season. All
eyes will also focus on how well it plays.

PARENTS' ATTITUDE TO HOMEWORK CAN SHAPE KIDS' SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any American parent what they dread most about the start of
school, and you're likely to get a two-word answer: homework
struggles. Some of the nation's most innovative educators have a
seven-word response: It doesn't have to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude we bring to homework is what can make a difference,
they say, starting with the very first homework assignment a child
gets in kindergarten or first grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you take it seriously, treat it with respect and even
excitement, or do you see it as onerous and burdensome?'' asks
educator and researcher Carol Seefeldt, a professor at the
University of Maryland Institute for Child Study.
</P>
<P>
   Children, after all, absorb our attitudes. If we see homework as
a pain that interferes with the fun stuff, so will they.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally recognized educator and author Lucy Calkins offers
her family as an example. At the start of each school year, she
hunkers down at the kitchen table with her sons, looking at
assignments, poking into books, checking work, asking questions
and, most of all, having some spirit about it: ``Do you realize all
the fun ideas we can come up with for this?''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like Calkins is doing the work for Miles, a sixth
grader, and Evan, a fourth grader, she admits she walks a thin
line. It's a risk she says is worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, one of the points of homework is to help a child
achieve independence in work and thought, she says. But, she adds,
``When your theme is, `It's your work, your responsibility, and you
need to own it,' research shows kids tend to do less, be satisfied
with less, and learn less. If you don't get involved, they don't
know what it is to do an excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Calkins' over-involvement peaks at the beginning of school. Her
goal is to get her children used to high standards (again) and to
get new teachers to expect high quality from them. Calkins is
professor of education at Teachers College at Columbia University
and author of ``Raising Lifelong Learners, A Parent's Guide''
(Perseus).
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is that a child gets too dependent on
you, which is why Calkins backs off after a few months. Oh, she'll
still be visible and always ready with questions, conversation, and
poster board, but her hope is that by then, her sons will have
internalized the standards she set.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Catherine Snow endorses the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most parents don't realize is that teachers respond more
to a child whose parents are actively involved,'' she says. Snow is
a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Calkins's first step is to make sure Miles and Evan have an
assignment pad for writing the homework down, and a folder for
homework papers. She also builds in a time and place for homework
so it becomes as routine as brushing teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Seefeldt encourages this kind of routine starting in first
grade. Indeed, her favorite strategy is to create family homework
time where everyone does some quiet work, including younger,
homework-free siblings who are expected to draw or play quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a high level of structure, even with a high level of
enthusiasm, there's bound to come a time when a fourth or fifth
grader asserts himself: ``It's my homework and I can do it any way
I want, even if it is sloppy or wrong!'' This is where parents
usually turn into Homework Cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gets you into struggles,'' says educational
consultant Dawna Markova. She tells parents to think coach instead
of cop. ``Be a partner, not a boss,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of yelling at your kid, `You're rushing too much! This
is too sloppy! Why aren't you concentrating?' help him see for
himself that he's rushing. Help him figure out for himself what
helps him to be the best possible learner,'' she says. She is
coauthor of ``Learning Unlimited, Using Homework to Engage Your
Child's Natural Style of Intelligence'' (Conari).
</P>
<P>
   Her strategy involves writing a homework contract with your
child that might go something like this: ``We agree to be homework
partners so that John can learn the best way that he learns and so
that homework can be ... fun for him ...'' Clauses might include:
``John promises not to whine or give up. Mom promises not to yell
or offer help unless it's asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   When he does ask for help, have the contract on the table
between you before you look at the math. If it's messy and full of
sloppy errors, the Homework Cop would say, ``How can a teacher read
this? You have to do it over!''
</P>
<P>
   The Homework Coach says, ``I'm going to partner you through.
Here's what I see: 14 correct answers, 6 mistakes, and a paper
that's hard to read. What would you like to see the teacher write
on it? How many answers do you wish were correct?'' Markova says
that approach frees a child from being defensive and enables her to
correct herself because she wants to.
</P>
<P>
   Calkins's answer to ``It's my homework!'' is to show shock and
amazement: ``I can't believe you want to take the quick way out!''
She might even acquiesce: ``For one night, that's fine, but if this
is a habit, we have a lot to talk about. It's my job to steer you
to be the most thoughtful person you can be, just like it's my job
to make sure you eat vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   When a child gets frustrated, Markova suggests a glass-full vs.
glass-empty approach that helps increase a child's ability to see
what is working. She throws down her pencil in frustration? Point
out what she had done successfully up to that point. She whines
that she can't sit still? What can she do? Jog in place? Run in
circles? Sing at the top of her lungs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she begins to learn that she needs to take short breaks
in order to regain her concentration,'' says Markova. ``Or that she
can concentrate better if she has a headset on. Gradually that
translates to other situations. During a test, she calms herself by
humming the song she studied to.''
</P>
<P>
   For the inevitable moment when all your child wants from you is
the answer, Markova has two responses:
</P>
<P>
   _``If I give you the answer, you have to agree to tell me
tomorrow how it helped you learn in school.'' Typically, she says,
a child will admit it didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   _``I'll give you the answer but you have to figure out how I got
it.'' Make sure he agrees that if he can't figure it out, he'll ask
you to help him figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   When a child gets very frustrated, Markova talks about ``sizzle
points.'' ``Help him to figure out what was going on just before he
felt like he wanted to throw something out the window: `Is there a
voice in your head saying you're stupid? Does your stomach tighten
up? Do your hands get sweaty?'''
</P>
<P>
   She says that if he can recognize he's reaching a breaking
point, he can ask himself, `What do I need to do now? Run up and
down the stairs? Make faces in the mirror?' ``Pretty soon,'' says
Markova, ``he can work his own gear shift.''
</P>
<P>
   For the times when no strategy helps, Seefeldt recommends old
fashioned logical consequences. ``If he's satisfied to turn in
sloppy work with wrong answers, the teacher's unhappy response may
be what most motivates him not to do it again,'' she says. If
possible, let a teacher know you're doing that.
</P>
<P>
   For the times when homework is nothing more than busy work,
Calkins says, ``I'd help him get through it as fast as possible.''
She'll type on the computer what Evan dictates to her, or she'll
allow her sons to barter services: Evan helps Miles cut out what he
needs from a magazine in exchange for homework help Miles will
profer at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, her favorite strategy is to stretch her sons'
thinking by making homework fun. Last year, Miles had an assignment
to weigh himself in something other than pounds. ``He was satisfied
to convert to ounces,'' says Calkins, ``but I said, `Wait a minute!
How much do you weigh in Tuckers (the family dog)? Before the night
was out, they had weighed John (their father) in cans of Ragu
spaghetti sauce!''

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Always provide time for play after school before homework but
also don't squeeze homework right up to bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   -- The first month of school, ask the teacher for homework
patterns, for instance, that there's more on Tuesday because
there's a math quiz every Wed.
</P>
<P>
   -- Never secretely correct a homework paper.
</P>
<P>
   -- What is the teacher's homework philosophy? What role does she
want you to play? Are there assignments she doesn't want you to
help with? Are there specific ways she wants you to help?
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't dwell on last year's homework struggles. Consider a new
year a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   -- A struggle over a specific assignment may be a signal that
something's wrong with the assignment. A struggle almost every
night is more likely a signal that you and your child have an issue
about something beyond homework.
</P>
<P>
   -- If homework is consistently too easy or too difficult for
your child, be sure to let the teacher know.
</P>

ABUSIVE FATHERS A TENNIS PLAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though it's not clear who launched the Bad Dads Club
of tennis, the latest member appears to be Marinko Lucic, a Croat
whose rising teenage daughter _ 50th-ranked Mirjana Lucic _ wants
to present him with a restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it's to be a belated Father's Day gift, she feels
he's had it coming for years, and she has moved with her mother out
of his household grasp in Makarska to Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in my life that I really enjoy
tennis,'' she said after overpowering Naoko Sawamatsu of Japan,
4-6, 6-1, 6-1, Wednesday at Flushing Meadow. That set up a US Open
third-round collision tomorrow with her girlhood heroine, Steffi
Graf, whose father happens to be a prominent club member.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Mirjana, a 6-footer who strikes tennis balls
ferociously, told a Croatian newspaper, Slobadna Dalmacija of
Split, that her dad beat her when he was displeased with her
results. ``It was going on for a long time,'' she said.
``Everything kind of happened in Wimbledon _ a time when I couldn't
handle it anymore and I just had to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The breaking-up point apparently was reached when she and Mahesh
Bhupathi lost the Wimbledon mixed doubles final to Serena Williams
and Max Mirnyi. ``Mirjana,'' said a Serbian journalist, ``was
showing too much joy, in his view, happy to be in a Wimbledon
final. But Marinko was furious with her for losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sad and distressing as it is, there's nothing new about parents
who _ physically or mentally _ beat up on their kids for falling
short of expectations or not following orders. Or, in the case of
Peter Graf, Steffi's old man, battering her emotionally with his
misdeeds: philandering, drunkenness, and income tax evasion that
landed him in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have our fathers,'' John F. Kennedy once shrugged,
alluding to the slippery behavior of his own when somebody brought
up an indiscreet act of Martin Luther King's.
</P>
<P>
   While you can point to any number of peerless papas in tennis,
such as Jimmy Evert (Chris Evert's sire) and Bill Moffitt (Billie
Jean King's), the Bad Dads Club has gotten the ink and camera time.
Possibly the founder in the 19th century was John Roosevelt of the
prominent New York family, an uncle of President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed daughters Ellen and Grace in the game at a time when
it was no more than a hit-and-giggle diversion for well-bred young
women in corsets and ankle-length dresses. Ellen Hansell, the
original US champ in 1887, remembered, ``Their father coached and
treated them as if they were a pair of show ponies. We silly,
non-serious-minded players laughed at their early-to-bed and
careful food habits.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1890, Ellen Roosevelt took the US singles and joined Grace
for the doubles title, but soon they were out of the game, perhaps
feeling that father didn't know best about tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Hooker pleased her demanding, wealthy industrialist daddy,
Elon Hooker, by making the US quarterfinals in 1923. But when he
suggested she'd have to work harder for Wimbledon the following
year, she recalled with relish, ``I threw my racket at him and
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most celebrated Bad Dads we know and hiss today, besides
Graf, are Americans named Jaeger, Capriati, and Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pierce brutalized daughter Mary, verbally and sometimes with
his fists, while motivating her toward the top. After she got a
restraining order, Mary rebounded to win the Australian Open in
1995. She faces Cara Black in the second round today. She's damaged
goods, erratic in her performances but struggling to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Capriati raised a gold mine named Jennifer. He threw her
among the pros at 13, then watched her win Olympic gold in 1992 and
turn from a sweet, ingenuous kid into a sullen, troubled young
woman. He made sure she roamed the world, competed too much even
when injured, and pursued as many dollars as possible before she
fell apart at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, 22, was here again, granted a for-old-times'-sake wild
card, trying to find herself. She was heartened by a fond reception
from a large crowd as she lost aimlessly to Jana Novotna, but she
is clearly confused. You hope she can find direction and purpose
missing at home.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Jaeger instilled in his child, Andrea, the joys of
playing hurt, including the French Open with a cracked pelvis. She
was a Top 10 player (No. 5 at 15), a French (1982) and Wimbledon
(1983) finalist _ and scrapped by injuries before she was 20.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary and edifying P.S.: Andrea, one of the great
products of the game, cares lovingly for countless children today,
operating Silver Lining Ranch for terminally ill kids at Aspen,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea demonstrates that there's always a chance for the progeny
of the Bad Dads. Mirjana Lucic says she has received ``tremendous
sympathy and support'' from her colleagues and thinks life without
father can be beautiful. We can only hope.

BURNS WON'T PUT UP WITH COMPLACENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was named NHL coach of the year in June, and in many
ways, Pat Burns was as much the toast of the town as rookie of the
year Sergei Samsonov. In his first season behind the Bruins' bench,
Burns led Boston to 91 points (39-30-13), 30 points better than the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, seated at his desk in the FleetCenter, Burns wouldn't
acknowledge that there was a honeymoon period. Sure, the club
performed better than many expected. But as far as the coach is
concerned, since he didn't know what to expect himself, the idea of
a honeymoon period is a misconception.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the life expectancy for a coach in the NHL?'' he asked.
``Three or four years? If you want to call it a honeymoon period, I
guess I'm OK for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are expectations for the 1998-99 season, they are
likely to be delayed until the five remaining Group 2 free agents
(Jason Allison, Kyle McLaren, Anson Carter, Ted Donato, and Steve
Heinze) are in the fold. Without them, any projections would surely
be greatly diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year nobody really expected us to do what we did,'' said
Burns. ``Now, of course, the expectations are that we're going to
do better. There are some changes in the alignment of the divisions
and the schedule is tough again early. So that's going to be
obviously important. The only difference between this year and last
year is that teams aren't going to say, `The Bruins are in town
(and they're) easy.' They're going to say, `We have to work to beat
these guys.' We have to be prepared to have a little bit more
adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   That adversity could begin as early as the first day of training
camp, Sept. 12, when at least one of the five free agents is
expected to sit out. Burns said he won't allow their absence to be
a disruptive influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely no fun,'' said Burns. ``I'm hoping and praying
they'll all be there, but if they're not, I'll have to just turn
the page and go on. There's nothing I can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns is remaining positive about the club's chances for a
resolution with the free agents. He is expecting an even better
season from Allison than last year. One reason Allison came into
his own, ending up as the team's leading scorer and ninth in the
league, was the influence of Burns, who wouldn't allow the player
to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is going to be definitely in his court,'' said Burns.
``Last year it was a little bit in mine, but now it's in his. He's
proven what he can do in this league. Now it's all up to him
because the adversity is going to be different. He's not going to
be able to do perhaps what he did over the course of an 82-game
schedule with people not knowing who he is. It took him a while to
get going. He was real close to not even staying on this team last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This time Allison and Samsonov won't be able to sneak up on
other teams. Opponents will make it their mission to shut them
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not just going to be No. 41 on the ice _ teams are going
to say, `Watch this guy. This guy can break your back,''' Burns
said of Allison. ``He is going to have to know that, and we'll
remind him of that. But I don't think I'm going to have to take the
same course of action I took last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato, who had asked to be moved in the spring after his role
under Burns diminished as the season wore on, has a place on the
club, but the coach said he has to earn it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to Teddy what kind of role he wants,'' said Burns.
``He can't live in the past, either. He has to live on what he's
going to bring forth to the hockey club. If he wants to bring forth
something to the club which he can do, we'll give him a role. I
don't dislike Teddy Donato. I don't dislike anybody on this hockey
club. My job is to win games. I don't pick on people. Teddy played
some big games for us and he played some not-so-big games for us.
I'm not going to sit here and define his role publicly, that's for
darn sure. He went public, that's his business, but I'm not going
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns believes he treats all players equally and said he'll be
happy to give Donato ice time _ provided Donato plays better.
Donato has acknowledged that he had some struggles last season and
said he will enter this season hungrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't bring something to the table on a certain night,
we're not going to use you,'' said Burns, who has been known to
parcel out ice time shift to shift rather than game to game. ``That
was the same with everybody. Jason sat on the bench. Dmitri
Khristich sat on the bench. They didn't give up and say, `That's
it.' Obviously, Teddy sees himself in a different role or a more
important role. That's all up to him. It's not up to me. If you
want to give me that, we'll give it to you, but it has to be our
way, not your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns believes captain Ray Bourque _ who turns 38 in December
and is scheduled to begin negotiating a contract extension next
week _ can play ad infinitum.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he wants to play and as much as he wants to play,''
said Burns, summing up how Bourque will be used in his 20th NHL
season. ``I said that last year. I'm not going to start saving
Raymond Bourque because he's 38 years old. Save him for what? If he
can play and he can keep up to what he's done, he will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is a special person and a special player. Unfortunately,
we don't have a whole bunch of those guys. As long as he wants to
play, he's welcome to play, for me, anyways.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bourque anchors the veteran end of the dressing room along
with Don Sweeney, Dave Ellett, and Ken Baumgartner, Burns said
there are plenty of lessons to be learned by the kids. He expects
Cameron Mann and Shawn Bates, who spent last season in Providence,
to make a contribution in Boston this year, and he is banking on
players such as Hal Gill to build on last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a young hockey club and it has a lot to learn,''
said Burns. ``Mann and Bates have a lot of upside. But you can't go
up and then flatten out. That's what they did. This is a big year
for those two guys. With Gill, there's going to be a little bit
more pressure on him. In your second year, it's a little different
because people know you a little bit more. He's going to have to
sit down and really look at that and be able to understand that
it's not going to be like it was.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins had an Achilles' heel last season, it was that
they were a tad undersized. Their strength was in their skating
game, and that should be true again. Burns hopes the size situation
will be improved by forward Landon Wilson, who can best be
described as an enigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Landon as a boy,'' said Burns. ``He's a great guy.
What's important for him is he can't live on what he's done in the
last 10 minutes. He has to live on what he's going to do in the
next 10 minutes. What we have to get across is it's not the last
two shifts you played well, you just played a bad one. We need his
size. He's a big, strong boy, and we need that up front.''

THE WET JET SET RIDES LOUD AND PROUD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HAMPTON, N.H. _ ``Bummer,'' Mike Bandecchi declared, surveying
the calm seas off Hampton Beach State Park last Sunday. ``I like it
rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, don't they all? Bandecchi, a 26-year-old sheet metal
mechanic from Chichester, who's an Ed Marinaro look-alike, wasn't
the only jet skier who couldn't wait for Hurricane Bonnie's skirts
to brush the New England coast. What good's a 450-pound oceangoing
version of a dirt bike if you can't crash a cresting 8-foot wave at
50 miles per hour, point your nose to the sky, and catch some air?
</P>
<P>
   They come here every weekend, just as they do to Newburyport or
Falmouth or anyplace else they hope to catch a wave. Unloading at
the state boat ramp at Hampton Marina, these self-admitted
adrenaline junkies motor their personal watercraft (PWC) _ Jet Ski
is actually a Kawasaki brand name _ out the mouth of the Hampton
River to the ocean. You can see and hear them from the
cheek-by-jowl homes on Seabrook Beach as they buzz like bees off
Beckmans Point, yahooing through jumps, spins, and doughnuts. And
if they fall overboard or capsize, that's part of the game.
``Raising heck and jumping waves'' is how Robert Goss, a
34-year-old bricklayer from Manchester described it.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is just the kind of talk that drives boaters,
swimmers, cottagers, and environmentalists crazy. A lot of these
folks tend to see the PWC crowd as uncouth and untrained waterbound
terrorists whose only redeeming value is keeping hospital emergency
rooms busy. Powered by water that is drawn by an inboard motor and
pumped out the rear, PWCs can travel at speeds as high as 75 miles
per hour. There are no brakes, and the craft can't be steered when
the throttle is off, although they can still continue moving via
Newton's laws.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that PWCs are involved in a disproportionate share of
boating accidents. A record 85 operators were killed last year in
the United States. Just this week, a 15-year-old boy riding in a
PWC was killed on Lake Winnipesaukee, 50 miles northwest of
Hampton. Many states and municipalities have placed restrictions on
the machines, and sales finally began to dip in 1997 after a decade
of phenomenal growth. (Current prices of new models range from
$4,800 to $9,400.) Memo to the opposition, however: There are still
an estimated million-plus PWCs flitting through US waters.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, most of the many men and few women (an estimated 85
percent of PWC buyers are males) who trailer their craft here each
weekend don't much care what other people think of them. ``What is
it they call us, `The Psychos of the Beach?''' Rich Ventura of
Billerica, Mass., asked proudly on Sunday. ``Get a couple of girls
on the beach watching me, and I'll stand on my head on this
thing,'' the 27-year-old landscaper added, nodding toward his
Kawasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was here with Tom D'Ovidio, also from Billerica, also
27, and also a landscaper. After slipping into their wet suits
(optional) and life jackets (required), the pair donned light
zippered boots and padded gloves. As D'Ovidio prepared to launch
his $8,200 Yamaha, which he noted will top off at 72 miles per
hour, he revealed the wave-jumping math that would, alas, be
irrelevant on this particular day. ``The height of your jump is
usually twice the height of the wave,'' he explained. ``Five-foot
waves, 10-foot jumps. Twelve-foot waves, 25-foot jumps.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the winds weren't cooperating, Ventura and D'Ovidio could
at least hang out at what is informally known here as Jet Ski
Beach, on the opposite shore of the Hampton River. The strip of
sand is an informal PWC clubhouse on weekends, a place to spread
your blanket and eat lunch, and from which to periodically motor
forth to the (hopefully) high seas.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five-year-old Bob Healey of Salem comes to Jet Ski Beach
with a gaggle of relatives every couple of weeks or so, beaching
his Sea-Doo GTX in the sand, giving rides to his nephews and
nieces, heading alone into the waves. When he bought his PWC for
$7,600 in 1996, taking a three-year note from a bank, he often
traveled to Winnipesaukee to ride. But the big lake doesn't have a
place where PWCers can hang, he said. And it doesn't have what the
ocean has. ``Once you come out here and hit the waves, you wouldn't
go back there,'' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   (Like a lot of PWC owners here, Healey also owns a motorcycle.
Not surprisingly, the craft tend to be sold by cycle dealers rather
than boat dealers. Sometimes a PWC serves as a motorcycle
substitute. ``My wife won't let me have a motorcycle because I
crashed two of 'em,'' explained Steve Leonard, 25, of Lowell, Mass.
``That's why I got one of these,'' he added, pointing to his
two-month-old Sea-Doo.)
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, Greg Chicoine, a 24-year-old auto mechanic
from Uxbridge, Mass., lounged on the beach and watched a 20-foot
motorboat speed past, tossing up a significant wake in a no-wake
zone. Shaking his head, Chicoine offered a common lament: ``If that
was a jet skier, the (New Hampshire) Marine Patrol would stop him.
Happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet most of the folks jockeying PWCs out here admit _ some a
tad proudly _ that the people who gnash their teeth over jet skiers
often have a case. Every rider has a near-miss story (``The damn
kid nearly landed on top of me!''), although it was almost always
the other guy's fault. ``There are a lot of people out here who
just don't know what they're doing,'' pointed out 32-year-old Mike
Desmarais of Manchester, who races PWCs competitively. Desmarais
puts the blame for hotdogging on the large two- and three-seaters
that now account for almost all PWC sales. The first units that
became popular, nearly a quarter of a century ago, were one-seaters
or even stand-up models, which you seldom see today. ``Those take
at least a season to master,'' Desmarais said. ``Anybody can get on
a two- or three-seater and take right off.'' Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Not that absolutely everyone here was seeking the perfect wave.
Bob and Celeste Schmitt of Nottingham were beginning a leisurely
26-mile run up the coast to Portsmouth and back for lunch, a Sunday
drive on the water. ``I like it because it's easy to park,''
Celeste Schmitt, one of the few women in sight, said of the
family's Polaris three-seater.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bandecchi, meanwhile, had finally given up after a couple
of hours of fruitless waiting for waves. ``Too damn calm,'' he said
as he pulled his Sea-Doo XP Limited two-seater from the water. ``I
guess I'll go find my girlfriend. I'll come back in a few days if
the storm comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bummer, indeed.

</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders often talk about a teachable moment -- a time
when events focus public attention on a moral question in an
unprecedented way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the months leading up to the Gulf War,
Americans conducted an extensive discussion about the nature of a
just war.
</P>
<P>
   The eight months since the Monica Lewinsky scandal emerged has
been a painful time for all Americans. But it has also been a
teachable moment -- a time when the public's attention has been
focused on core moral and ethical issues, including the nature of
sin, forgiveness, and trust; professional ethics, and the
connection between private and public morality.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this moment has been squandered. The tone of
moral debate has been set by the tabloids -- a category that now
includes just about all of the media.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the only religious leaders who have spoken
out are those who hate President Clinton no matter what he does and
those who love him no matter what he does. Most religious leaders
are extremely reluctant to talk about public controversy involving
sex or partisan politics, and this controversy involves both.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to speak out in a situation that demands cool
heads, nuance and moral perspective is a dereliction of duty on the
part of Americans religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be surprising at a time when the professions of
politics, law and media have generally disgraced themselves. But we
expect more from religious leaders, if only because they tell us we
should.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, are some of the things that religious leaders, and
anyone concerned about morality and ethics, should be saying:
</P>
<P>
   --It is always wrong to spread false and malicious stories.
</P>
<P>
   --Everyone sins. The American Heritage Dictionary defines sin as
``a transgression of a religious or moral law, especially when
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once called original sin -- the belief that every human
being sins at some time or other -- the most empirically verifiable
religious belief. Jesus came to the defense of an adulteress woman
by telling a crowd, ``Let he who is without sin cast the first
stone.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people who mistakenly believe they are without sin are
throwing a lot of stones today.
</P>
<P>
   --All sins are not equal. Sins differ in both their nature and
their context. Stealing a pizza is wrong and so is murder, but the
offenses are far from equal. And stealing a pizza for fun, stealing
it to trade for drugs, and stealing it to feed a starving family
are also very different offenses.
</P>
<P>
   --You have to ask for forgiveness before you can receive it, but
asking isn't enough. If we forgive someone who has not asked for
forgiveness, we only encourage him or her to repeat the offense.
When someone does ask for forgiveness, he or she must also do
penance and take steps to show that he or she will not repeat the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   --The test of your commitment to ethical standards is your
willingness to stick to them when it's not convenient. If grand
jury testimony is supposed to be secret, it's supposed to be secret
even when leaking it would give you an advantage. If reporters are
supposed to verify stories before they report them, they have to
verify them even when skipping that stage would give them a scoop.
If we throw out ethical standards to seek a temporary advantage,
then our commitment to those standards is a sham.
</P>
<P>
   --We must evaluate people by the sum of their actions. About 20
years ago I mused to a wizened editor that good people sometimes do
bad things and bad people sometimes do good things. He replied,
``And there are very few good people or bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   --What we think of someone today can change dramatically
depending upon what they do tomorrow, or what new facts emerge
tomorrow. We evaluate people in different ways in different
circumstances; we may stop considering someone a friend, but still
admire his or her talents.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always lived with ambiguous attitudes toward
their presidents. Did John F. Kennedy risk his presidency with his
reckless private life? Did Lyndon Johnson do more good with the
Great Society than he did harm with the Vietnam War? Even many
liberals who detested Richard Nixon when he was in office look back
on many of his domestic policies as surprisingly liberal by today's
standards. We should practice humility when we attempt to judge
people.
</P>
<P>
   --We should evaluate public officials primarily on the basis of
their public responsibilities to advance the common good. Private
action is not irrelevant, but it must be seen in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   --Morality is often a matter of proportionality. The just war
theory argues that to be morally justified, the good that a war
achieves must outweigh the evil that it causes. That's a daunting
standard -- one that should apply to every major public
undertaking.

TO HAITIANS, AIDS QUIP NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entire exchange lasts less than a minute, almost lost in
sharp-tongued banter and tropical vistas of the summer movie hit
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   But a passing joke that links four volatile words _ Haitians,
AIDS and ``those people'' _ has dredged up a stinging, decade-old
stigma and turned a feel-good romance into a target of outrage for
Haitians, Haitian-Americans and public health officials across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The joke has newly inflamed a simmering clash of culture between
African Americans and Haitian blacks. Activists say a movie that
was hailed for breaking through black stereotypes has now
reinforced one, one that Haitians say still haunts and humiliates
them _ Haitians as AIDS carriers and Haiti as the diseased,
monkey-to-man birthplace of the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a bitter, growing chorus of complaints on Internet sites
and radio waves prompted a protest rally in New York Wednesday, and
further plans for a national demonstration in Miami, some who bear
the burden of caring for Haitians with AIDS expressed an outrage
that was tinged with ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   The energy, emotion and resources that have been mounted against
Hollywood's pop-culture insult is something they rarely see applied
to the long fight against a deadly disease that has hit their
community as hard as any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie does have certain implications, yes,'' said Eustache
Jean-Louis, who heads the Center for Community Health, Education
and Research in Dorchester. Jean-Louis was among those who led the
fight to lift a ban on all Haitian blood donors imposed by the Food
and Drug Administration, and to amend a high-risk-group list by the
Centers for Disease Control that came to be known as the ``Four-H
Club:'' homosexuals, hemophiliacs, heroin-users and Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians were removed from the CDC list in 1985; the blood ban
was lifted at the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people with HIV see that this stereotype still continues in
the media, they may not want to come out and get help. That makes
my work and the work of other providers more difficult,''
Jean-Louis said. ``But you cannot be taking to the street because
of two lines in a movie, and then when your next-door neighbor is
dying from a disease, you don't take to the street and instead do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, based on the best-selling novel by Terry McMillan,
Angela Bassett plays a 40-year-old divorcee and high-powered
stockbroker who travels to Montego Bay and meets a Jamaican man
half her age. When she returns, her sisters question her about the
affair, asking if she used a condom ``because those people have a
history of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sister then interjects, ``No, that's Haiti, Miss
Manners.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange sparked a spontaneous protest in Miami last week,
and Wednesday Haitians picketed in front of a movie theater in
mid-town Manhattan. On Tuesday, the Haitian consul in Boston _ home
to the third-largest population of Haitian immigrants after New
York and Miami _ joined other organizations to demand an apology, a
re-edit of the film and a studio-sponsored HIV/-AIDS education
campaign by 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the World Health Organization and
UNAIDS, Haiti is ranked 22d in the world in the rate of adults
living with the disease, with a rate of 5.17 percent. The top
country, Zimbabwe, has a rate of 25.84 percent. The rate in the US
is .76 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Haiti was one of the first countries associated
with the HIV virus, even though at the time Haiti had a much lower
rate of AIDS cases than other Caribbean countries and most US
cities. Almost immediately, the myth about a ``Haitian connection''
to AIDS set off an epidemic of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by public fear and flawed research, Haitians were
accused of exporting the virus. Years after medical evidence
debunked the myth among scientists and massive demonstrations
reversed social policy, it lingered in the popular imagination: the
myth found its way into recurring jokes on ``Saturday Night Live''
and ``The Arsenio Hall Show''.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some say, cruel misperceptions are being given new life
before a movie-going audience of millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled. This is outrageous,'' said Dr. Nicole Prudent, a
pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, who remembers when Haitian
children came to her office crying, shunned by classmates and
worried the virus lay dormant in them. ``We have been fighting
against this for such a long time and people still don't know that
AIDS has no nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bernadine Lormilus heard the joke, shock was the only thing
that kept her from walking out of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just boiled me up,'' said Lormilus, 22, who lives in
Brockton and studies elementary education at Regis College in
Weston. ``It's degrading to Haitians, it's degrading to Jamaicans,
it's irrelevant, it's outrageous and it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lormilus, born in Boston of Haitian parents, the taunts by
classmates of ``go back to your country'' and ``boat people'' are
still raw after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all of this was over with about Haitians bringing
AIDS,'' she said. ``To have it in Hollywood where everyone goes to
see it and looks up to these actors is just the worst thing that
can happen. Because once people hear it from them, they'll say it
must be true.''
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend it was released, ``Stella'' was the
second-highest grossing film, pulling in $11.8 million. That was
three weeks ago. Since then it has made another $16.2 million, with
roughly four million viewers, and still ranks in the weekly top ten
grossing films.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue on that scale is a testament to the growing power of
black Americans in film and for McMillan in particular. Her first
novel-to-film, ``Waiting to Exhale,'' was praised for portraying
middle-class women struggling with love and success.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a joke about Haitians and AIDS could surface in
``Stella,'' some say, shows how weak are the links that bind blacks
of different nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that whole scene wasn't there, it wouldn't have taken
anything away from the movie,'' said Brunir Shackleton, who works
for the mayor's Office of Jobs and Community Services in Boston.
``It just makes me feel that the whole so-called brotherhood, the
idea that being black automatically makes you sensitive to the
plight of other people with the same skin color, is lip service.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at 20th Century Fox WednesdayWednesday said the
studio had no comment. A spokeswoman at Signet Books, which is
releasing the paperback edition of McMillan's book, said the author
was unavailable. The joke about AIDS and Haiti does not appear in
the novel, only the film.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Farmer, a professor at Harvard Medical School who has
written several books on AIDS and Haiti, said most research shows
that HIV probably came to Haiti from North America through
sex-for-money exchanges by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the movie reference to AIDS and Haiti, Farmer said, ``In one
way, you can say, `Sure. It's just a movie.' The problem is, in
order for these misperceptions to stay alive, they have to keep
cropping up in popular culture. As long as they are shored up and
reiterated, they live on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he supports the march, Farmer said he wishes the same
passion applied to deep-rooted inequalities that have plagued
Haitians in the US and in Haiti for years.
</P>
<P>
   So would Jean-Louis, who once led Boston's battle against the
stigma, and who now helps care for some of the 566 known cases of
Haitians living with full-blown AIDS in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question really is, what are we going to do? What are our
priorities?'' he said. ``AIDS is a reality for Haitians now. ... We
should march for the movie, and we should march for the victims, so
they can seek care and live with dignity.''

   HAMPTON, N.H. _ ``Bummer,'' Mike Bandecchi declared, surveying
the calm seas off Hampton Beach State Park last Sunday. ``I like it
rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, don't they all? Bandecchi, a 26-year-old sheet metal
mechanic from Chichester, who's an Ed Marinaro look-alike, wasn't
the only jet skier who couldn't wait for Hurricane Bonnie's skirts
to brush the New England coast. What good's a 450-pound oceangoing
version of a dirt bike if you can't crash a cresting 8-foot wave at
50 miles per hour, point your nose to the sky, and catch some air?
</P>
<P>
   They come here every weekend, just as they do to Newburyport or
Falmouth or anyplace else they hope to catch a wave. Unloading at
the state boat ramp at Hampton Marina, these self-admitted
adrenaline junkies motor their personal watercraft (PWC) _ Jet Ski
is actually a Kawasaki brand name _ out the mouth of the Hampton
River to the ocean. You can see and hear them from the
cheek-by-jowl homes on Seabrook Beach as they buzz like bees off
Beckmans Point, yahooing through jumps, spins, and doughnuts. And
if they fall overboard or capsize, that's part of the game.
``Raising heck and jumping waves'' is how Robert Goss, a
34-year-old bricklayer from Manchester described it.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is just the kind of talk that drives boaters,
swimmers, cottagers, and environmentalists crazy. A lot of these
folks tend to see the PWC crowd as uncouth and untrained waterbound
terrorists whose only redeeming value is keeping hospital emergency
rooms busy. Powered by water that is drawn by an inboard motor and
pumped out the rear, PWCs can travel at speeds as high as 75 miles
per hour. There are no brakes, and the craft can't be steered when
the throttle is off, although they can still continue moving via
Newton's laws.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that PWCs are involved in a disproportionate share of
boating accidents. A record 85 operators were killed last year in
the United States. Just this week, a 15-year-old boy riding in a
PWC was killed on Lake Winnipesaukee, 50 miles northwest of
Hampton. Many states and municipalities have placed restrictions on
the machines, and sales finally began to dip in 1997 after a decade
of phenomenal growth. (Current prices of new models range from
$4,800 to $9,400.) Memo to the opposition, however: There are still
an estimated million-plus PWCs flitting through US waters.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, most of the many men and few women (an estimated 85
percent of PWC buyers are males) who trailer their craft here each
weekend don't much care what other people think of them. ``What is
it they call us, `The Psychos of the Beach?''' Rich Ventura of
Billerica, Mass., asked proudly on Sunday. ``Get a couple of girls
on the beach watching me, and I'll stand on my head on this
thing,'' the 27-year-old landscaper added, nodding toward his
Kawasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was here with Tom D'Ovidio, also from Billerica, also
27, and also a landscaper. After slipping into their wet suits
(optional) and life jackets (required), the pair donned light
zippered boots and padded gloves. As D'Ovidio prepared to launch
his $8,200 Yamaha, which he noted will top off at 72 miles per
hour, he revealed the wave-jumping math that would, alas, be
irrelevant on this particular day. ``The height of your jump is
usually twice the height of the wave,'' he explained. ``Five-foot
waves, 10-foot jumps. Twelve-foot waves, 25-foot jumps.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the winds weren't cooperating, Ventura and D'Ovidio could
at least hang out at what is informally known here as Jet Ski
Beach, on the opposite shore of the Hampton River. The strip of
sand is an informal PWC clubhouse on weekends, a place to spread
your blanket and eat lunch, and from which to periodically motor
forth to the (hopefully) high seas.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five-year-old Bob Healey of Salem comes to Jet Ski Beach
with a gaggle of relatives every couple of weeks or so, beaching
his Sea-Doo GTX in the sand, giving rides to his nephews and
nieces, heading alone into the waves. When he bought his PWC for
$7,600 in 1996, taking a three-year note from a bank, he often
traveled to Winnipesaukee to ride. But the big lake doesn't have a
place where PWCers can hang, he said. And it doesn't have what the
ocean has. ``Once you come out here and hit the waves, you wouldn't
go back there,'' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   (Like a lot of PWC owners here, Healey also owns a motorcycle.
Not surprisingly, the craft tend to be sold by cycle dealers rather
than boat dealers. Sometimes a PWC serves as a motorcycle
substitute. ``My wife won't let me have a motorcycle because I
crashed two of 'em,'' explained Steve Leonard, 25, of Lowell, Mass.
``That's why I got one of these,'' he added, pointing to his
two-month-old Sea-Doo.)
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, Greg Chicoine, a 24-year-old auto mechanic
from Uxbridge, Mass., lounged on the beach and watched a 20-foot
motorboat speed past, tossing up a significant wake in a no-wake
zone. Shaking his head, Chicoine offered a common lament: ``If that
was a jet skier, the (New Hampshire) Marine Patrol would stop him.
Happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet most of the folks jockeying PWCs out here admit _ some a
tad proudly _ that the people who gnash their teeth over jet skiers
often have a case. Every rider has a near-miss story (``The damn
kid nearly landed on top of me!''), although it was almost always
the other guy's fault. ``There are a lot of people out here who
just don't know what they're doing,'' pointed out 32-year-old Mike
Desmarais of Manchester, who races PWCs competitively. Desmarais
puts the blame for hotdogging on the large two- and three-seaters
that now account for almost all PWC sales. The first units that
became popular, nearly a quarter of a century ago, were one-seaters
or even stand-up models, which you seldom see today. ``Those take
at least a season to master,'' Desmarais said. ``Anybody can get on
a two- or three-seater and take right off.'' Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Not that absolutely everyone here was seeking the perfect wave.
Bob and Celeste Schmitt of Nottingham were beginning a leisurely
26-mile run up the coast to Portsmouth and back for lunch, a Sunday
drive on the water. ``I like it because it's easy to park,''
Celeste Schmitt, one of the few women in sight, said of the
family's Polaris three-seater.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bandecchi, meanwhile, had finally given up after a couple
of hours of fruitless waiting for waves. ``Too damn calm,'' he said
as he pulled his Sea-Doo XP Limited two-seater from the water. ``I
guess I'll go find my girlfriend. I'll come back in a few days if
the storm comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bummer, indeed.

TO HAITIANS, AIDS QUIP NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entire exchange lasts less than a minute, almost lost in
sharp-tongued banter and tropical vistas of the summer movie hit
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   But a passing joke that links four volatile words _ Haitians,
AIDS and ``those people'' _ has dredged up a stinging, decade-old
stigma and turned a feel-good romance into a target of outrage for
Haitians, Haitian-Americans and public health officials across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The joke has newly inflamed a simmering clash of culture between
African Americans and Haitian blacks. Activists say a movie that
was hailed for breaking through black stereotypes has now
reinforced one, one that Haitians say still haunts and humiliates
them _ Haitians as AIDS carriers and Haiti as the diseased,
monkey-to-man birthplace of the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a bitter, growing chorus of complaints on Internet sites
and radio waves prompted a protest rally in New York Wednesday, and
further plans for a national demonstration in Miami, some who bear
the burden of caring for Haitians with AIDS expressed an outrage
that was tinged with ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   The energy, emotion and resources that have been mounted against
Hollywood's pop-culture insult is something they rarely see applied
to the long fight against a deadly disease that has hit their
community as hard as any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie does have certain implications, yes,'' said Eustache
Jean-Louis, who heads the Center for Community Health, Education
and Research in Dorchester. Jean-Louis was among those who led the
fight to lift a ban on all Haitian blood donors imposed by the Food
and Drug Administration, and to amend a high-risk-group list by the
Centers for Disease Control that came to be known as the ``Four-H
Club:'' homosexuals, hemophiliacs, heroin-users and Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians were removed from the CDC list in 1985; the blood ban
was lifted at the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people with HIV see that this stereotype still continues in
the media, they may not want to come out and get help. That makes
my work and the work of other providers more difficult,''
Jean-Louis said. ``But you cannot be taking to the street because
of two lines in a movie, and then when your next-door neighbor is
dying from a disease, you don't take to the street and instead do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, based on the best-selling novel by Terry McMillan,
Angela Bassett plays a 40-year-old divorcee and high-powered
stockbroker who travels to Montego Bay and meets a Jamaican man
half her age. When she returns, her sisters question her about the
affair, asking if she used a condom ``because those people have a
history of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sister then interjects, ``No, that's Haiti, Miss
Manners.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange sparked a spontaneous protest in Miami last week,
and Wednesday Haitians picketed in front of a movie theater in
mid-town Manhattan. On Tuesday, the Haitian consul in Boston _ home
to the third-largest population of Haitian immigrants after New
York and Miami _ joined other organizations to demand an apology, a
re-edit of the film and a studio-sponsored HIV/-AIDS education
campaign by 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the World Health Organization and
UNAIDS, Haiti is ranked 22d in the world in the rate of adults
living with the disease, with a rate of 5.17 percent. The top
country, Zimbabwe, has a rate of 25.84 percent. The rate in the US
is .76 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Haiti was one of the first countries associated
with the HIV virus, even though at the time Haiti had a much lower
rate of AIDS cases than other Caribbean countries and most US
cities. Almost immediately, the myth about a ``Haitian connection''
to AIDS set off an epidemic of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by public fear and flawed research, Haitians were
accused of exporting the virus. Years after medical evidence
debunked the myth among scientists and massive demonstrations
reversed social policy, it lingered in the popular imagination: the
myth found its way into recurring jokes on ``Saturday Night Live''
and ``The Arsenio Hall Show''.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some say, cruel misperceptions are being given new life
before a movie-going audience of millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled. This is outrageous,'' said Dr. Nicole Prudent, a
pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, who remembers when Haitian
children came to her office crying, shunned by classmates and
worried the virus lay dormant in them. ``We have been fighting
against this for such a long time and people still don't know that
AIDS has no nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bernadine Lormilus heard the joke, shock was the only thing
that kept her from walking out of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just boiled me up,'' said Lormilus, 22, who lives in
Brockton and studies elementary education at Regis College in
Weston. ``It's degrading to Haitians, it's degrading to Jamaicans,
it's irrelevant, it's outrageous and it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lormilus, born in Boston of Haitian parents, the taunts by
classmates of ``go back to your country'' and ``boat people'' are
still raw after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all of this was over with about Haitians bringing
AIDS,'' she said. ``To have it in Hollywood where everyone goes to
see it and looks up to these actors is just the worst thing that
can happen. Because once people hear it from them, they'll say it
must be true.''
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend it was released, ``Stella'' was the
second-highest grossing film, pulling in $11.8 million. That was
three weeks ago. Since then it has made another $16.2 million, with
roughly four million viewers, and still ranks in the weekly top ten
grossing films.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue on that scale is a testament to the growing power of
black Americans in film and for McMillan in particular. Her first
novel-to-film, ``Waiting to Exhale,'' was praised for portraying
middle-class women struggling with love and success.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a joke about Haitians and AIDS could surface in
``Stella,'' some say, shows how weak are the links that bind blacks
of different nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that whole scene wasn't there, it wouldn't have taken
anything away from the movie,'' said Brunir Shackleton, who works
for the mayor's Office of Jobs and Community Services in Boston.
``It just makes me feel that the whole so-called brotherhood, the
idea that being black automatically makes you sensitive to the
plight of other people with the same skin color, is lip service.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at 20th Century Fox WednesdayWednesday said the
studio had no comment. A spokeswoman at Signet Books, which is
releasing the paperback edition of McMillan's book, said the author
was unavailable. The joke about AIDS and Haiti does not appear in
the novel, only the film.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Farmer, a professor at Harvard Medical School who has
written several books on AIDS and Haiti, said most research shows
that HIV probably came to Haiti from North America through
sex-for-money exchanges by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the movie reference to AIDS and Haiti, Farmer said, ``In one
way, you can say, `Sure. It's just a movie.' The problem is, in
order for these misperceptions to stay alive, they have to keep
cropping up in popular culture. As long as they are shored up and
reiterated, they live on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he supports the march, Farmer said he wishes the same
passion applied to deep-rooted inequalities that have plagued
Haitians in the US and in Haiti for years.
</P>
<P>
   So would Jean-Louis, who once led Boston's battle against the
stigma, and who now helps care for some of the 566 known cases of
Haitians living with full-blown AIDS in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question really is, what are we going to do? What are our
priorities?'' he said. ``AIDS is a reality for Haitians now. ... We
should march for the movie, and we should march for the victims, so
they can seek care and live with dignity.''

<P>
   In Bolivia, 11-year-old Macario, illiterate and homeless, who
ran away from home at age 4 and has lived on the streets since
then, is scheduled to meet the president of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Macario wants to ask President Hugo Banzer Suarez to help ``show
the world that we are also people,'' and that he and his street
friends ``have talents we want to develop,'' he told a reporter
from EFE, when asked about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Macario has a friend, he told the news agency, who
would certainly be an athlete fit to win the Olympics, if given the
opportunity _ Mr. President can you help?
</P>
<P>
   The boy says that actually he wants to convey several things.
For instance, it is infuriating to see government officials on
television talk about the rights of children when the violence they
fear the most comes directly from the authorities. It is this
statement that is most important about the meeting between the boy
and the president.
</P>
<P>
   Macario described how the police extract money from him and
other street children _ how the boys must pay the officers to be
able to sleep an entire night without being awakened by blows and
kicks. ``Some girl from the group has to sleep with a policeman so
that they will leave us in peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Rev. Morris Bertolli, the priest who runs the Santa
Aquilina Children's Home, a place where many Bolivian street
children have found shelter, and who organized the meeting between
Macario and the president, has the best of intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But the priest's efforts could amount to little more than
providing Banzer with a photo opportunity and a chance to seem
concerned and compassionate about the plight of these unfortunate
children without having to confront the urgent issue _ the constant
abuse they endure from his government's police force.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be fooled by the possibility of a fairy tale come
true. Who wouldn't be tempted to run with the fantasy that
Macario's friend might win an Olympic medal? But for the millions
of street children who are victims of police brutality it would be
more important, instead, to stop and think about the crude reality
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   To demand the unraveling of the Gordian knot of systemic abuse
and impunity under which police forces in Latin America operate is
less romantic than asking to turn a street orphan into an Olympic
hero, but it would prove, in the long run, more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   There are 100 million street children in the world; 40 million
live in Latin America. Macario could very well be speaking for them
all. His mother abandoned him and a younger brother, leaving them
with an abusive father. The abuse must have been intolerable
because Macario preferred, rather than to endure it, to abandon his
sibling and take to the street _ at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   On the street he found friends, other children, and formed his
own street family. Still today, they fight hunger by begging,
eating scraps and inhaling glue. They protect one another from
inclement weather and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Macario's story is not exclusive to Bolivia. It is the same tale
one hears from the ``ninos de la calle'' in Guatemala, from the
gamines in Bogota, from the ``meninos du rua'' in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, efforts such as Bertolli's exist throughout Latin
America. Catholic groups; non-governmental organizations such as
ChildHope, Covenant House and UNICEF; and even local governments
spend millions of dollars providing these children with the
possibility of a future. They are given homes, sent to school,
taught a skill.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, Rev. Javier de Nicolo has spent more than 30 years
giving shelter to these children. He rides a white van into the
dark, dirty and damp streets of downtown Bogota where he invites
the swarms of boys and girls to live in his houses.
</P>
<P>
   In Central America, Casa Alianza, a branch of Covenant House,
has provided thousands of children with a future. I once met a
young man, a former street boy, who was studying to be a doctor;
another one in Bogota was taking a computer programming course.
</P>
<P>
   But these stories, as inspiring as they are, are few and far
apart. The truth is that the offer of a home does not necessarily
mean these children depart from the streets. After their chaotic
lives, many cannot get used to rules, even to the obvious and
necessary ones in these well-meaning programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do and stay, still face a life of discrimination,
marginalization and abuse. ``No one wants to employ a former street
boy,'' a social worker once told me.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more beneficial to everyone if more effort were
spent trying to teach society how to change the attitudes toward
street children before offering promises that sound beautiful but
would be very hard, if not impossible to keep. We can start by
changing the attitudes of, say, the private armed guards in Bogota,
who refer to street children as ``desechables,'' disposables.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mexico, if hospital authorities were more considerate in
the way they treat street children who come asking for help, deaths
such as the one of Brenda Ramirez Carrillo would be avoided. This
July in Mexico City, Brenda, a street girl who lived on the Avenida
Insurgentes, was hit by a car. The driver fled, leaving her to die.
She pulled herself together, but was too afraid of doctors to seek
medical help.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better for Banzer to promise that he will act to end
the systemic abuse of street children than to help Macario's friend
in a noble quest to win the Olympics.

For instance, it is infuriating to see government officials on
television talk about the rights of children when the violence they
fear the most comes directly from the authorities. It is this
statement that is most important about the meeting between the boy
and the president.
</P>
<P>
   Macario described how the police extract money from him and
other street children _ how the boys must pay the officers to be
able to sleep an entire night without being awakened by blows and
kicks. ``Some girl from the group has to sleep with a policeman so
that they will leave us in peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Rev. Morris Bertolli, the priest who runs the Santa
Aquilina Children's Home, a place where many Bolivian street
children have found shelter, and who organized the meeting between
Macario and the president, has the best of intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But the priest's efforts could amount to little more than
providing Banzer with a photo opportunity and a chance to seem
concerned and compassionate about the plight of these unfortunate
children without having to confront the urgent issue _ the constant
abuse they endure from his government's police force.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be fooled by the possibility of a fairy tale come
true. Who wouldn't be tempted to run with the fantasy that
Macario's friend might win an Olympic medal? But for the millions
of street children who are victims of police brutality it would be
more important, instead, to stop and think about the crude reality
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   To demand the unraveling of the Gordian knot of systemic abuse
and impunity under which police forces in Latin America operate is
less romantic than asking to turn a street orphan into an Olympic
hero, but it would prove, in the long run, more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   There are 100 million street children in the world; 40 million
live in Latin America. Macario could very well be speaking for them
all. His mother abandoned him and a younger brother, leaving them
with an abusive father. The abuse must have been intolerable
because Macario preferred, rather than to endure it, to abandon his
sibling and take to the street _ at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   On the street he found friends, other children, and formed his
own street family. Still today, they fight hunger by begging,
eating scraps and inhaling glue. They protect one another from
inclement weather and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Macario's story is not exclusive to Bolivia. It is the same tale
one hears from the ``ninos de la calle'' in Guatemala, from the
gamines in Bogota, from the ``meninos du rua'' in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, efforts such as Bertolli's exist throughout Latin
America. Catholic groups; non-governmental organizations such as
ChildHope, Covenant House and UNICEF; and even local governments
spend millions of dollars providing these children with the
possibility of a future. They are given homes, sent to school,
taught a skill.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, Rev. Javier de Nicolo has spent more than 30 years
giving shelter to these children. He rides a white van into the
dark, dirty and damp streets of downtown Bogota where he invites
the swarms of boys and girls to live in his houses.
</P>
<P>
   In Central America, Casa Alianza, a branch of Covenant House,
has provided thousands of children with a future. I once met a
young man, a former street boy, who was studying to be a doctor;
another one in Bogota was taking a computer programming course.
</P>
<P>
   But these stories, as inspiring as they are, are few and far
apart. The truth is that the offer of a home does not necessarily
mean these children depart from the streets. After their chaotic
lives, many cannot get used to rules, even to the obvious and
necessary ones in these well-meaning programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do and stay, still face a life of discrimination,
marginalization and abuse. ``No one wants to employ a former street
boy,'' a social worker once told me.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more beneficial to everyone if more effort were
spent trying to teach society how to change the attitudes toward
street children before offering promises that sound beautiful but
would be very hard, if not impossible to keep. We can start by
changing the attitudes of, say, the private armed guards in Bogota,
who refer to street children as ``desechables,'' disposables.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mexico, if hospital authorities were more considerate in
the way they treat street children who come asking for help, deaths
such as the one of Brenda Ramirez Carrillo would be avoided. This
July in Mexico City, Brenda, a street girl who lived on the Avenida
Insurgentes, was hit by a car. The driver fled, leaving her to die.
She pulled herself together, but was too afraid of doctors to seek
medical help.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better for Banzer to promise that he will act to end
the systemic abuse of street children than to help Macario's friend
in a noble quest to win the Olympics.

`FIRELIGHT' TAKS A LOOK AT SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD IN VICTORIAN ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Nicholson's historical romance ``Firelight'' rather
audaciously blends a timely and modern theme _ surrogate motherhood
_ with an early-Victorian setting and a Gothic British literary
style to come up with only so-so results.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened the last Seattle International Film
Festival and begins a regular run today, seemingly lifts its
storyline right out of the '90s cable-movie line-up and plops it
down in the setting of ``Jane Eyre.'' Despite some good moments, it
doesn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the 1830s, the script has Charles (Stephen Dillane), a
handsome British nobleman tied to a comatose wife, so desperate for
an heir that he's auditioning candidates to anonymously mate with
him, have his child and instantly give it up _ for a fee, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   He finds the ideal match in Elisabeth (Sophie Marceau), a
hard-pressed, drop-dead beautiful Swiss woman with a past. They do
the deed for three days at a French hotel, she has a daughter nine
months later and, as per her contract, promptly vanishes from
Charles' life.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, however, she's so tormented by abandoning her
child that she tracks father and daughter down (just how is never
explained), and _ while Charles is away _ snags the job as
governess to her very own daughter (Dominique Belcourt).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, when Charles returns to find Elisabeth on the
premises, he's not a bit happy about it. But he soon remembers
their several nights of passion together, and, after a while, the
spoiled daughter begins to take to the governess, and ... well, you
know where this is going.
</P>
<P>
   As a first-time director, Nicholson (the screenwriter of
``Nell'' and ``Shadowlands'') has an eye for history and offers up
a handful of impressively executed scenes, including one exciting
and poignant sequence in which surrogate mother and child bond
through a harrowing experience on an ice-covered lake behind the
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his script seems predictable every step of the way, and
curiously devoid of the scenes that might force us to feel some
emotional investment in the characters or their situation. The film
would be a respectable enough episode of ``Masterpiece Theater''
but is strangely aloof and unsatisfying as a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   It is also somewhat handicapped by having Sophie Marceau as its
star. She's competent, beautiful and has a pouty French elegance
that has worked well for her in many other roles (``Braveheart,''
Maurice Pialat's ``Police''). But she doesn't convey the grand
maternal tragedy necessary to make this film a heartfelt
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Firelight. Directed and written by William Nicholson. Cast:
Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane, Kevin Anderson, Lia Williams,
Dominique Belcourt, Joss Ackland. Hollywood Pictures. 104 minutes.
Rated R for adult themes.

`THE CHAMBERMAID' IS ORIGINAL AND SMART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago, the French-Italian-Spanish co-production
``The Chambermaid'' was officially known as ``The Chambermaid of
the Titanic.'' In fact, it's already had a reasonably successful
European run under that intriguing title.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of our own mega-hit, ``Titanic,'' the name
reportedly evoked giggles whenever its American distributors (the
Goldwyn Company) brought it up, making them fear the public might
expect the film to be an ``Airplane!''-like spoof.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the new title is even more misleading, and would
seem to doom the film to some corner of the art-house multiplexes.
Too bad, because it's an original and smart film, and one that
obliquely makes a wonderful comment on the recent ``Titanic''
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1912, it's the story of a handsome but shy and somewhat
hen-pecked Frenchman named Horty (Olivier Martinez) who wins a
coal-hauling contest at his Lorraine foundry, with the first prize
of a trip to Southhampton to watch the maiden sailing of the
Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The night before that event, a beautiful French woman (Aitana
Sanchez Gijon) appears at the door of his hotel room. She has a job
as a chambermaid on the great liner, but all the hotels are full,
so she's hoping that, as a countryman, he might put her up.
</P>
<P>
   He does, they share a bed, and, though she seems to be coming on
to him during the night, he does not respond. The next morning,
she's gone. When he races down to the mooring, he gets there just
in time to watch her steam off into destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Back at his village, he relates the story to his friends, and _
egged on by their prurient interest _ not only lies about
consummating the union but wildly exaggerates it into a night of
passion worthy of the steamiest modern romance writer.
</P>
<P>
   When the Titanic sinks and the chambermaid is not on the list of
survivors, his story takes on a poignancy it didn't have before.
Horty is compelled to embellish his lie again and again. And he's
so spellbinding that people are soon coming from miles around to
hear his voluptuous, bittersweet story.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he's recruited by a traveling dramatic show, and he
becomes its headliner and a legend all over Northern France. His
presentation takes on elaborate props, and his jealous,
long-suffering wife (Romane Bohringer) eventually gets into the
act, and even insists on portraying the Chambermaid on stage.
</P>
<P>
   As co-written and directed by noted Spanish filmmaker Bigas Luna
(``Jamon, Jamon''), the single downside to the film is that it
feels slightly contrived. It strains credulity here and there, and
the plot mechanics of getting Horty to the Titanic seem
particularly labored. After all, what kind of grand prize is it to
merely watch a ship sail?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film works as a marvelous metaphor for the magic and
mystery of the artistic process. Horty is not delusional: he knows
exactly what he's doing. It's just that something about his
experience requires him to preserve it, twist it to his
psychological need and have people react to it. The same reason
other artists write books, compose music or paint chapels.
</P>
<P>
   Or make movies. Indeed, the wonder of the film is that it works
as a perfect metaphor for James Cameron's ``Titanic.'' Horty's need
to turn his Titanic experience into romance and mythology is the
same irresistible impulse that Cameron felt _ and we react to the
result pretty much as Horty's slightly less sophisticated audience
does.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, ``The Chambermaid'' is either a clever
exploitation of the great ``Titanic'' phenomenon, or, more likely
(given the fact they were made at about the same time), an amazing
bit of artistic prescience on the part of Lunas, his team of
writers and Didier Decoin, who wrote the original novel on which
the film is based.
</P>
<P>
   The Chambermaid. Directed by Bigas Luna. Screenplay by Luna,

Sanchez Gijon, Romane Bohringer. Goldwyn. 96 minutes. In French

`INSOMNIA' IS THE BEST OF THE LOT ABOUT URBAN PARANOIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been a rash of movies about urban paranoia with
Kafka-esque leanings lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark City'' thrust its protagonist into an unknown realm and
dared him to solve the mystery of his own identity. ``Pi'' created
a schizophrenic world endured by a mathemetician slowly going
insane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insomnia,'' a 1997 film from Norway, which stars Stellan
Skarsgard (``Breaking The Waves'' and ``Good Will Hunting''), is
the best of the lot. It explores a different kind of paranoia _ a
far more complicated and interesting variety.
</P>
<P>
   Self-imposed panic overtakes chief criminal investigator Jonas
Engstrom (Skarsgard) as he arrives in Norway, the ``land of the
midnight sun,'' to solve the brutal murder of Tanja (Maria
Mathiesen), 17-year-old teenager whose body is found _ hair washed
and nails scrubbed _ in a rubbish heap. But Jonas' panic is
self-inflicted because of guilt and the fear of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, ``Insomnia,'' which is the debut film from Erik
Skjoldbjaerg, is more psychologically bent on transference and
counter-transference between killer and cop than the standard
cat-and-mouse chase of most American action films.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is made even more intriguing because Jonas'
terror stems from the fact he has accidentally caused the death of
a colleague _ something he goes to great lengths to conceal. It's
an act that gives him perspective on Tanja's killer _ he, too,
claims her murder was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Skjoldbjaerg says his movie was inspired ``by the notion of
secrecy and how when one chooses to conceal something from others,
the sense of perspective is lost.'' Indeed, Jonas is so remote and
self-absorbed that he is as creepy as the killer he slowly comes to
resemble.
</P>
<P>
   With the unsettling effect of the bright, infernal sun and
Jonas' inability to sleep because of its eternal glare,
``Insomnia'' is a tense, taut suspense thriller in the vein of Lars
von Trier's subliminal ``The Element Of Crime'' or Hitchcock's
repressed mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Even better is the lack of actual violence. Everything is
implied and, outside of an explicit scene with a carcass of a dog,
the film eschews blood for suggestion and the dark corners of the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The film teases with scary suggestion: will a basket of innocent
kittens become victims or will something happen to the beautiful
concierge at Jonas' hotel? Perhaps a detective who seems to know
the truth will run into bad luck. But like a puzzle or a maze,
there is only one logical exit. Skjoldbjaerg taunts us with a ton
of options but he skillfully takes the path that seems in perfect
sync with all that has come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Insomnia. Directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. Written by Nikolaj
Frobenius. Cast: Stellan Skarsgard, Sverre Anker Ousdal, Gisken
Armand, Bjorn Floberg. First Run Features. 97 minutes. In Norwegian
with English subtitles. Unrated but with graphic violence, nudity.

RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH SEES ITS PRAYERS ANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAVOLVSK, Russia _ His country in turmoil, the Rev. Valery
Svetsov reflected recently on how the Russian Orthodox Church has
helped his countrymen endure decades of war, oppression and
seemingly endless deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``An old adage says, `The Russian man never makes the sign of
the cross until the thunderstorm comes,''' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The heavens have unleashed an economic and political deluge on
Mother Russia, providing urgency to the just-concluded summit
between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. And
true to the adage, many here are returning to religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church where I worshiped was packed today. Adversity
drives people to God, and that is the plus side,'' wrote Kathryn
Teitzel, an outreach worker from University Presbyterian Church in
Seattle, in an e-mail message to friends this week.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of revived interest in the church is everywhere. An
icon and candle shop does a brisk business at the gate to Red
Square in Moscow. Thousands of worshipers crowd into cathedrals
once used as museums. The three-hour Orthodox liturgy is again sung
by Svetsov at St. Nicholas Cathedral in Pavlovsk, which for years
was used as a repair shop for Red Army tanks.
</P>
<P>
   As it experiences a revival, however, the Russian Orthodox
Church remains at the center of controversy. The church hierarchy
was aligned with the state even during the area of Soviet atheism.
Its leaders continue to bless and be blessed by state authority.
The church is involved in business dealings that range from
cigarette imports to bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed last year and signed by President Boris Yeltsin
enshrines the church as the country's dominant religion and imposes
arduous registration and other requirements on other religious
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the law, the church has competition.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Protestant denominations have sent missionaries to
places such as prisons, which have rarely seen an Orthodox priest,
and have brought in goods and social services. An estimated 4,000
evangelical congregations have grown up in Russia, along with 110
Bible schools. Other movements also have gained adherents.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox leaders are not particularly pleased at the competition
for souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we have a lot of religious movements now, but a lot
of them are not positive,'' said Bishop Konstantin Gorianov, head
of the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that any denomination could ever supplant or
really contest the Orthodox Church. The church has served as a
keeper of the soul and culture of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet state tried everything in its power to diminish and
substitute for church influence, including turning Lenin into a
kind of secular icon. Wedding palaces were erected to substitute
for church marriage ceremonies. Churches were used as granaries and
machine shops. Historic cathedrals in Moscow and St. Petersburg
became museums of atheism.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many priests were arrested or churches
vandalized, the church remained so influential that Stalin had to
seek its help in mobilizing resistance to the Nazis during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church kept not only the faith but the culture,'' said the
Rev. Alexander Tkachenko, an Orthodox priest who received
chaplaincy training at Swedish Hospital in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian people, they always were spiritual,'' he added. ``It
has always been inside us. Every man inside has a gut feeling of
the presence of eternity. Nobody could drive that away.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets certainly tried. The front door of St. Nicholas
Cathedral has been rebuilt, but visitors can still see where the
door was widened so tanks could be brought inside.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 to 100 worshipers now crowd into a small restored area
that is rich in the smell of incense and where the chants and
rituals go back a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   St. Nicholas Cathedral gets no support from the Diocese of St.
Petersburg and Ladoga. It is supported by the faithful, and by the
priest's enterprising wife, Ziniada Svetsova, who designs clergy
vestments and presides over a bakery that sells meat pastries to
the nearby Great Palace of Pavlovsk, once a czarist summer home and
now a premier visitor attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding parish also has a benefactor thousands of miles
away. It receives money and such needed items as children's
vitamins from St. Augustine's-in-the-Woods Episcopal Church on
Whidbey Island, Wash., one of eight Seattle-area congregations to
have sister parishes in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet authorities began turning property back to the church in
the late 1980s. St. Petersburg had 14 active Orthodox churches
before the era of perestroika; now it has 287. ``When we came here
in 1991, the whole territory of the church was covered with garbage
and metal,'' Svetsov said. ``Water was 3 meters deep in the
basement.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran priest also is able to do much more ministering.
During the Soviet era, Svetsov was exiled from the city to a remote
country parish after committing the crime of having his picture
taken with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could once do was have a service,'' he said. ``I could
not preach about bringing up children in the church. I could not
have a Sunday school. I had to register every baptism with the
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Soviet authorities permitted only three seminaries to operate in
the country, and chose which students could study for the
priesthood. The total has risen to 27 seminaries, with two to three
applicants for each position.
</P>
<P>
   Gorianov has expanded the curriculum of his seminary to include
topics such as psychology. ``We are now able to tell our students
how to teach philosophy,'' he added. ``Such subjects we were

</P>
<P>
   In looking forward, church leaders also are looking for ways to
hold together Russia. In July, such former Communist Party
officials as Yeltsin and St. Petersburg's governor, Vladimir
Yakovlev, were on hand for the religious ceremony in which the
remains of Czar Nicholas II were interred at the Cathedral of
Saints Peter and Paul in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachenko watched them. Yeltsin's wife made a sign of the cross,
as did Yakovlev's wife. Their husbands stood solemnly with their
heads bowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say Yakovlev is a believer, but he is very respectful
toward the church,'' Tkachenko said. He noted that Yeltsin had the
patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Alexsy II, bless his troubled
reign.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``They perhaps understand,'' he said, ``that only the church can
preserve Russia from civil war, from moral destruction.''

INVESTMENT CLUBS SEE OPPORTUNITY IN ROLLER-COASTER WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COHOES, N.Y. _ Arnold Galarneau was ready for the Tuesday night
meeting of the Capitol Investors with file folder full of research
on stocks local investment might buy after Monday's stock market
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``These knee-jerk things happen all the time,'' the retired
accountant said. So the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more
than 512 points on Monday. To Galarneau, it was just an
overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is OK, inflation is low, interest rates are low,
so what more do you want?'' But since the market tanked the
resident of Cohoes, N.Y., was going to suggest to his fellow
investors that this week would be a good time to buy stocks whose
prices were way down.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy sounded good to his investment club partners. While
some investors were a little more ``apprehensive'' than Galarneau,
the idea of buying recession-resistant retail stocks like Office
Depot made sense, said John Munn, one of Galarneau's peers in the
investment club. In all, Capitol Investors has 14 members.
</P>
<P>
   Investment clubs are gatherings of ordinary people like
Galarneau and Munn, a chemist, who come together once or twice a
month and pool money to put into the stock market. Usually, members
buy shares or pay monthly dues to fund purchases. Members share the
job of researching the stocks and making the purchasing decisions,
and, they say, learn more about stocks and finances than they might
working alone.
</P>
<P>
   Through investment clubs, middle-class people like teachers,
mechanics and government workers find a way into the world of Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   A mother organization, the Michigan-based National Association
of Investment Clubs provides guidance and helps local groups form
and practice the art of investing for the long term, at least three
years out. That generally means finding well-managed companies at
good prices and holding onto the stock for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment club members, including Rick LaPierre of Latham,
N.Y., say that belonging to a club and getting mutual support from
peers helps steady the nerves in trying times. LaPierre tried
investing on his own before joining the 6-year-old Upstate
Investment Club, but said he fared poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I panicked at every up and down.'' But the club will likely
hold onto its roster of 16 holdings, including PepsiCo Inc.,
Wendy's International and Prime Medical Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're riding it out,'' said LaPierre, who serves as treasurer
of the 22-member club. As of August, the club's holdings were worth
$53,000.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Investors, partly since it is a younger club, had only
about $6,000 in its portfolio before Monday's dive, Munn said.
</P>
<P>
   But another young club, Schenectady's We Want $, has amassed
about $30,000 in its two years said club president Dave Anker.
Anker, who owns an auto repair shop in Schenectady, was asked to
steer the club because he had experience investing on his own, and
the 28 other members apparently liked his confidence in the
long-term approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trading, we're investing,'' Anker said.

   IRELAND-CLINTON _ BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ At stop after stop
here Thursday, President Clinton won praise for shepherding the
Ireland-Northern Ireland peace accord. The congratulatory tone was
markedly different from the economic turmoil and political
uncertainty he addressed in Moscow in the first half of his
overseas trip. At the scene of Northern Ireland's worst terrorist
attack, Clinton consoled relatives of victims of the car bombing
last month that killed 28 people and shattered hundreds of lives in
this religiously mixed farming community. Earlier, the president
told an assemblage of lawmakers and citizens in Belfast that
Catholics and Protestants must pull together with ``courage and
reconciliation'' to build a new Northern Ireland. ``America will
continue to walk the road of renewal with you,'' he declared.

will attempt to tap the hope that remains in most of the people

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ MOSCOW _In the wake of President Bill
Clinton's departure following a two-day summit in which he urged
Russian leaders to pull together, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin began making
overtures Thursday to reach a compromise with Communist and
Nationlist leaders. Meanwhile, the Russian ruble -- trading
officially for the first time in a week -- fell hard and fast
Thursday, while Yeltsin and his rivals in the State Duma headed for
a second showdown vote over Chernomyrdin's nomination to become
prime minister. The official ruble rate fell to 13.5 rubles to the
dollar, but traders said it was as low as 17.4 to the dollar. The
ruble had been trading at 6.2 to the dollar last month before it
began its slide. Developing. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-ECONOMY (Analysis) _ WASHINGTON _ Russia, despite its
size -- both geographically and in population -- has an economy no
bigger than the Netherlands. That's only a fraction of the size of
the U.S. economy. Then why is that the current economic crisis
gripping the former Communist superpower is being credited with
sounding the alarm for the global economy? That is one of several
questions that have to be addressed on Friday when Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
meet with Japanese Finance Minister Miyazawa in San Francisco.

   When President Clinton returns to the White House after his long
vacation and business trip, I'm sure there will be quite a bundle
of mail piled up outside his door. Catalogs from Hammacher
Schlemmer, old copies of Golf Digest and Cigar Afficionado, cable
bills, stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton wades through the pile, he'll also find a package I
FedExed to him, containing a CD of his new theme song: ``Hard for
Me to Say I'm Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; After all that we've been through &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I will make it up to you, I promise you &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You might recall they used that tune in the classic movie
``Summer Lovers,'' starring Peter Gallagher as a smooth charmer who
lives with a blonde but fools around with a brunette. Hey, just
like the president!
</P>
<P>
   This guy is beyond belief. It's not just hard for him to say
he's sorry, it's impossible.
</P>
<P>
   My theory: It's all about ``Love Story.'' You know, the Erich
Segal novel that was turned into the movie in which Ali MacGraw
uttered the immortal line, ``Love means never having to say you're
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   As you'll recall, popular lore says Segal based the story in
part on the romance of his old Yalie buddy Al Gore and bride-to-be
Tipper. Gore has no doubt taken his Love Story connection to heart
- whispering in Clinton's ear, ``Mr. President, love means never
having to say you're sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   That's my theory and I'm sticking with it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you knew that sometime during Clinton's visit to
Russia, a reporter was going to ask him about his semi-apology to
the American people and whether he regretted the decision not to
say two words: ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to the president's chagrin, it happened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' the reporter said, ``you were just speaking of the
challenges that we face as a nation. And one is reaction since your
admission of a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky _ (Has it) given you
any cause for concern that you may not be as effective as you
should be in leading the country?
</P>
<P>
   There was the windup and the pitch. Now all Clinton had to do
was say, ``You know, I've been thinking a great deal about that,
and I've been listening to what the American people have had to
say, and I understand the concerns of those who believe I wasn't
clear enough in my speech. So let me take this opportunity to say I
am sorry. Truly, deeply sorry for lying to people and prolonging
this madness. And that's the last we're going to speak of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton launched into one of the most astonishing
examples of political doublespeak we've ever heard. You may have
caught snippets of his answer on the evening news, but I'd like to
reprint his answer in its entirety, to truly capture the
slitheringly duplicitous nature of his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the president replied, ``I've actually been quite
heartened by the reaction of the American people and leaders
throughout the world about it. I have acknowledged that I made a
mistake, said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a
lot of very valuable time with my family in the last couple of
weeks and said I was going back to work. I believe that's what the
American people want me to do, and based on my conversations with
leaders around the world, I think that's what they want me to do,
and that is what I intend to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see from what we're discussing here, there are very
large issues that will affect the future of the American people in
the short run and over the long run. There are large issues that
have to be dealt with now in the world and at home. And so I have
been quite encouraged by what I think the message from the American
people has been and what I know of the message from leaders around
the world has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm going to do my best to continue to go through this
personal process in an appropriate way, but to do my job, to do the
job I was hired to do. And I think it very much needs to be done
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, that's more than 200 words of pure, Grade-A, unadulterated
bull-oney.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same press conference, Clinton offered another
lengthy non-apology, which started thusly: ``Well, to your second
question, I think I can almost reiterate what I said in response to
the first question. I think the question of the tone of the speech
and people's reaction to it is really a function of _ I can't
comment on that ...''
</P>
<P>
   Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   While I continue to maintain the president's personal life is
his and his alone to screw up, he does owe the American people a
straightforward apology for lying to our faces. That he continues
to dance around ``I'm sorry'' and thinks he can assuage us with
classic Clinton-speak tells us we are dealing with the most
self-absorbed president in modern history.

`BEASTIE BOYS' HOT TICKET AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They started out as three musically bereft but
affluent Jewish kids from New York's Upper West Side. Their idea of
a stage act was spewing Budweiser at the first three rows.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the Beastie Boys became the first white rap
group to matter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scorn of critics and purist hip-hoppers who accuse
them of cultural piracy, the Beastie Boys always treated rap as
just another entry in a post-punk musical underground.
</P>
<P>
   In late '70s Manhattan, that's just what rap was. Even superstar
Mariah Carey, an unknown high schooler at the time, recalls growing
up to the background noise of ``two turntables and a microphone,''
as Beck famously sang.
</P>
<P>
   The Beasties _ Mike D (Mike Diamond), MCA (Adam Yauch) and
Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz) _ transformed their obnoxious party-animal
image into a groundbreaking sound on such inspired albums as
``Paul's Boutique,'' ``Ill Communication'' and the current ``Hello
Nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   And along with musical growth that places the trio at ground
zero of today's youth culture comes an appreciation for social
issues, as evidenced by the group's conversion to Buddhism and
their support of Tibet's plight under Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Beasties are more concerned with partying for
your right to fight than fighting for your right to party.
</P>
<P>
   Mike D, MCA and Ad-Rock appear in sold-out shows Sept. 11-12 at
the Forum with support from longtime allies Money Mark and
Mixmaster Mike. The group's latest album, ``Hello Nasty,'' named
for the trio's New York public relations firm Nasty Little Man,
reached No. 1 in the national albums chart a few weeks ago and has
sold more than 1 million copies. It ranks at No. 2 this week.
</P>
<P>
   Like Madonna, Smashing Pumpkins and even Snoop Dogg, the Beastie
Boys enjoy an audience that has grown up with their sound and
remained fans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trio refused interview requests to promote a
sold-out tour and massively popular album, Diamond told Rolling
Stone he realized how lucky they were to have such staying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate that the audience has _ well, it would be
presumptuous of me to say `grown with us','' he said in the Aug. 6
issue. ``But it being the nature of beings to progress, a lot of
people have gone through, and continue to go through, what we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry types, however, didn't predict ``Hello Nasty'' (Grand
Royal/Capitol) would sell as well as it did upon its release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of this record was a real surprise,'' admits Larry
King, product manager at Tower Sunset. ``They've been around long
enough that they're sort of grizzled veterans of the scene. But for
this release to just explode out of the box like that was
completely unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their exaggerated frat-boy antics in the early days, the
Beasties have been on the cutting edge for some time. Their 1986
debut, ``Licensed to Ill,'' became the first rap album to hit No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the complex and inventive Dust Brothers-produced second
album, ``Paul's Boutique,'' presaged the genre-blending,
sample-happy, cut-and-paste style of record making so prevalent
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think `Hello Nasty' is anywhere as visionary as
`Paul's Boutique' was,'' says longtime fan Steve Alper, co-owner of
Atomic Records in Burbank. ``It seems to be more influenced by Beck
than the other way around. I mean, it has the unusual loops, weird
samples and pop-culture references but it's not quite as
inventive.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with sharp record production, the Beasties did something
else that was smart: Early on, the trio developed a musical
community by way of its own label, Grand Royal, and a magazine of
the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they touch turns to gold,'' Alper said. ``They
co-own some restaurants, a clothing company, the magazine and the
label. But they're still the worst hard-core band ever, and thank
goodness there's no hard-core music on this new record.''
</P>
<P>
   But fans who plan to attend the Forum shows will probably get a
taste of the Beasties' attempts to play punk-rock whether they like
it or not. During earlier stops on the ``Hello Nasty'' trek,
Diamond, Yauch and Horovitz have given crowds a gander at the
world's most inept rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, reviews have been raves.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times said the recent Beasties show at Madison
Square Garden achieved ``New York's potential as a melting pot ...
True, it was just a pop show, but it felt like the coolest one
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bongiovanni, editor of Pollstar, a weekly trade magazine
that covers the concert industry, said it could be one of the
year's most successful rock tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big tour,'' he said. ``To some extent, it's a surprise.
It's getting tougher to predict when an act that's been around for
a while is going to explode in mainstream popularity. It starts
becoming broader-based when a record crosses over into multiple

ROBESON'S ACADEMY HONOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Old Man River'' from the Oscar
Hammerstein-Jerome Kern musical ``Show Boat'' pairs lyric and
melody in a way that mimics the deep Mississippi _ slow and
deliberate, always sure of its course. Paul Robeson, the basso
profundo who sang it in the 1936 screen version, embodied those
same characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Robeson was a Renaissance man and the son of a slave. He was an
athlete and scholar at Rutgers University, and later studied law at
Columbia University and played pro football. He was headed for a
law career until a production at the Harlem YMCA changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will screen the
1936-made ``Show Boat'' at 8 p.m. Sept. 11 in honor of the 100th
anniversary of the late actor's birth. Charles Musser, a Yale
University professor of film studies, will make the introduction.
</P>
<P>
   After his YMCA debut, Robeson's talent became apparent to
playwright Eugene O'Neill, who sought out the law-school graduate
to star in two plays. For three decades, Robeson split time between
making films (11 in all from 1925-42) and touring European stages,
where he won acclaim and his fame grew. But his affinity for
Soviet-style socialism caused him great troubles in this country.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of being a Communist. His denial and steadfast
refusal to renounce his U.S. citizenship in spite of strong
accusation won him the admiration of his fellow African-Americans.
He died at age 77 in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $5 general admission, $3 for academy members. The
evening program is part of the Academy Series at the organization's
Samuel Goldwyn Theatre, 8949 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. Call
(310) 247-3600 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Two exhibitions will open this month to commemorate Robeson's
centennial. The first, ``Paul Robeson: Artist and Citizen,'' opens
Sept. 12 at the California African-American Museum in Exposition
Park. On Sept. 27, a lecture series and exhibit, ``Paul Robeson:
All-American Superstar and Man for the People,'' begins at Watts
Labor Community Action Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, UCLA's James Bridges Theatre will devote a film
series to Robeson from Oct. 1-11.
</P>
<P>
   DISTINGUISHED WOMEN: Barbara Walters, Diahann Carroll and USA
network founder Kay Koplovitz are this year's honorees at the
annual Women in Film Lucy Awards on Sept. 12 in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucy Awards, founded in 1994 with support from the estate of
Lucille Ball, honor television actors, writers, producers,
directors and creative artists who exemplify the spirit and
achievements of the late comedic actress. Past winners include
Carol Burnett, Angela Lansbury, Tracey Ullman and Garry Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime service award will be presented to Bonnie Dore, past
president of Women in Film and co-founder of the Lucy Awards.

`UNFINISHED MONKEY BUSINESS' FOR SINGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Former Stone Roses vocalist Ian Brown has a
special reason for naming his upcoming solo effort ``Unfinished
Monkey Business.''
</P>
<P>
   When the British singer first began appearing with the Roses, he
explained, ``the press used to refer to me as `simian lead singer.'
My arms have always been too long for my body. But I've been called
`monkey' all my life, so I thought I'd keep that theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on the album began on an eight-track tape deck in Brown's
Manchester bedroom through the winter of 1996 before moving to
Chiswick Reach Studios in West London. Brown produced everything
himself and played most of the instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to sound rough and ready, but I didn't want it to
sound like it was made in an expensive studio,'' Brown said. ``I
wanted it to sound honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the album's standouts is ``Can't See Me,'' based upon a
Stone Roses bass line Brown discovered on an old demo tape. Roses
bassist Mani and original drummer Reni cut the track with Brown,
who embarked on a solo career when Stone Roses imploded two years
ago shortly after a gig at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke up mostly because we didn't have a manager and
everyone was on different drugs,'' Brown said. ``I don't take them,
so it was a bit weird for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown plans a local date in November. ``Unfinished Monkey
Business'' (Mercury) is due Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OF THE BRITS: Current releases from the Verve, Pulp and
Portishead are among nine nominees for Britain's prestigious 1998
Mercury Music Prize, presented Sept. 16 in London.
</P>
<P>
   Contenders for the sixth annual honor, which recognizes the
year's most adventurous album, include Asian Dub Foundation's
``Rafis Revenge,'' Catatonia's ``International Velvet,''
Cornershop's ``When I Was Born for the 7th Time'' and Gomez's
``Bring It On.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining nominees are Massive Attack's ``Mezzanine,''
Portishead's ``Portishead,'' the Verve's ``Urban Hymns,'' Pulp's
``This Is Hardcore'' and the Propellerhead's ``Dex N Drums and Rock
N Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian Dub Foundation, incidentally, opens for Money Mark on
Sept. 12 at the Hollywood Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   HAIL SEYMOUR: Mysterious Scottish folkies Belle &AMP; Sebastian on
Tuesday release their third album, ``The Boy With the Arab Strap''
(Matador), complete with a track titled ``Seymour Stein'' after the
music executive and Sire Records founder who signed Madonna and the
Ramones.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member Belle &AMP; Sebastian's previous effort, ``If
You're Feeling Sinister'' (Enclave), was among the most acclaimed
discs of last year.

AN `ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS' SEND-UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rule Britannia, Britannia rule the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Britain doesn't rule much of anything these days, much less
the airwaves, but over the years it has given us some great
television, from the sublime (``Brideshead Revisited,'' ``I,
Claudius,'' ``The Singing Detective'') to the farcical (``Monty
Python,' ``Fawlty Towers'').
</P>
<P>
   The release this week of ``Absolutely Fabulous Moments'' (BBC
Video; $19.95) is a chance for those who missed the absolutely
fabulous British TV series to find out why the critics were raving.
</P>
<P>
   The show revolves around a pair of self-styled trend-setters in
their 40s _ Edina Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders) and Patsy Stone
(Joanna Lumley) _ who refuse to accept the fact that they're not
young anymore. Eddie and Patsy still party like it's the '60s and
'70s, imbibing ample amounts of booze and drugs and chasing younger
men (usually unsuccessfully). As part of their vain attempt to hold
on to their youth, Eddie (the queen of PR) squeezes into trendy
haute couture fashions at least two sizes too small, while former
Bond girl (as she claims) and current fashion editor (she slept
with the publisher and has a job for life) Patsy has had so much
cosmetic surgery on her face that it seem permanently frozen into
an I'm-hipper-than-thou look, which pretty much sums up the pair's
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Completely clueless as to how silly they look, Eddie and Patsy
are hilarious in their self-absorption. ``Absolutely Fabulous
Moments'' includes highlights and outtakes from the ``Ab Fab''
series, which are strung together within a documentary that Eddie
is doing on herself.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, Eddie has been wrapped up like a mummy in yet
another futile attempt to lose weight, when her disapproving
college-age daughter, Saffron (Julia Sawalha), asks her to come to
the kitchen to hear some bad news. After waddling down the stairs,
Eddie encounters her mom (June Whitfield), who after much prompting
from Saffron tells Eddie that her father is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Grief or sadness is not part of her repertoire, and watching
Eddie sort of spin the dial on her face as she searches for the
appropriate reaction (while not breaking the wrap, of course) is
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely Fabulous,'' which was written by Saunders, is a
wicked, satirical look at a generation that can't accept aging and
so falls for the latest fashion trends while refusing to grow up
emotionally. (Eddie is constantly being reproved by her daughter
for her shallowness.) But while Eddie and Patsy are being
lampooned, Saunders is also targeting the double standard we have
in which older men can cavort with young women while older women
are made comic figures. The fact that Saunders and Lumley are
wonderful physical comedians in the tradition of Lucille Ball makes
the point even more.
</P>
<P>
   Series episodes still run on cable's Comedy Central on Saturday
afternoon (check listings), but ``Absolutely Fabulous Moments'' is
a great addition to any video collection.
</P>
<P>
   THE REAL PEEL DEAL: If you were suckered into buying a ticket to
this summer's ``The Avengers,'' our condolences. The film, starring
Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes, was directionless and dull. Despite
spending a bundle on special effects, it lacked all the wit and
charm that even one episode of the classic '60s British series had.
So if you are a fan of the original John Steed (Patrick Macnee) and
Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg), A&AMP;E sells 18 out of 24 episodes from the
1967 season. One tape retails for $12.95; a set of three is $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   TITANIC CURIOSITY: Yes, now that you've gotten your hands on the
video of James Cameron's ``Titanic'' starring someone named
Leonardo DiCaprio, here's a reminder that there are other videos
about the ill-fated ship. (It was a British ship; yes, there is a
premise _ admittedly thin _ to this column).
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E has an comprehensive 1994 documentary (also called
``Titanic'') that includes rare footage, archival documents and
photos on the ship disaster. It follows the story from the creation
of the supposedly unsinkable ocean liner to its fateful collision
with an iceberg on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic in 1912.
The four-tape, 200-minute documentary retails for $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   The recently released ``Titanica'' (Miramax; $19.99) was
originally an IMAX documentary; so it really doesn't have the
big-screen look on your TV that it had in the theaters. However,
there's enough to look at as the filmmakers take you to the ocean
floor in submersibles to view the world's most famous shipwreck.
The tiny subs are outfitted with powerful lights that illuminate
the Titanic's final resting place. It's an eerie but fascinating
trip as you watch the robotic arm of the sub sift through the
wreckage.

MAYOR HAS A TRAIN WRECK ON HIS HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bill Clinton had to go to Russia to get away
from Monica. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown has to go to China to
get away from the municipal transit system.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Brown, he doesn't leave for two weeks. Who
knows what could happen? Angry voters could storm City Hall _ if
they don't mind walking to the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brown should feel at home in Shanghai. Mass transit isn't so hot
there, and the city is building a pedestrian tunnel under the
Huangpu River _ an intentional pedestrian tunnel, unlike Muni's.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Brown held a news conference to talk about his
trip to Shanghai. However, reporters were preoccupied with real
adventures _ from one end of San Francisco to the other.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about ``a matter closer to home,'' Brown snapped,
``No, I'm not taking any questions about Muni.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an odd response for a mayor who said he was elected to
speak for the voters. He won't even speak to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at the news conference was so tense that the only
laugh came when Brown ally and trip organizer James Fang
accidentally called Brown ``Mr. Chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times in his life, Chairman Willie didn't
have any witty sayings. He was in a foul mood. He would have sent
reporters to re-education camps, if there were any way to get them
there.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he wouldn't talk about it, the messed-up transit system
must be running around Brown's brain because he began the news
conference by saying, ``I'm just delighted we'll be transporting
the flavor of San Francisco to Shanghai.''
</P>
<P>
   Transporting _ a curious choice of words. Try transporting San
Franciscans through San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Among other gifts, Brown will be taking a cable car to Shanghai.
Why can't he take one of those useless cars? Nobody got to ask that
question either.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayor exited the news conference, he fended off reporters
by saying, ``You guys are amazing. I don't want to talk about
Muni.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told state Sen. Quentin Kopp about this. Kopp, who has
been mentioned as a possible opponent of Brown's in the 1999
election, said: ``You've got to talk about it if you're mayor. If
it isn't working, you've got to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else was talking about it. While Brown was saying
nothing about Muni in front of the cameras, all the action occurred
offstage.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, Brown met behind closed doors with
transit officials, perhaps trying to assess the damage to the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local pollster David Binder was schmoozing in the
hallway, perhaps trying to assess the damage to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Binder was there, the mayor's press secretary,
Kandace Bender, said: ``All kinds of people come in and out of
here. That's the thing, you can describe all kinds of conspiracy
theories.''
</P>
<P>
   The only conspiracy theory I have is that all Muni officials are
behind the grassy knoll, taking a nap.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Binder told reporters he isn't working on Muni. However,
you can see why a pollster would be drawn to the problem. Imagine
the theoretical challenge of trying to construct a poll that gets
any positive responses on the mayor's handling of Muni.
</P>
<P>
   On the local television news Tuesday night, you saw a distinctly
uncharming Mayor Brown trying to avoid even looking at reporter
Thuy Vu, much less answering her.
</P>
<P>
   Vu was interviewing passengers on a Muni Metro car arriving at
Civic Center station, when suddenly riders spotted Brown standing
on the platform. They immediately started booing and cursing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't air much of it,'' said KTVU-TV producer Rosemarie
Thomas. But the footage they did show was frightening enough. It
showed a mayor losing his automatic control system as badly as any
Muni car, and getting in a train wreck of an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, clearly angry at being called nasty names by riders on
camera, didn't even respond to Vu at first. Then he started blaming
Muni's problems on previous mayors dating all the way back to
Dianne Feinstein, now a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   When Vu asked him if he regretted promising to fix Muni within
100 days of taking office, Brown said: ``No, I don't regret any
promises I've ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters are holding you to it,'' Vu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't argue with me about it. You asked me a question,'' Brown
said. ``The voters should hold me accountable. But what I don't
want is you speaking for the voters. I'm elected to speak for the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that backward? Aren't mayors elected to listen to the
voters? It's unfortunate that the mayor has to listen to some
voters calling him obscene names, but he has to understand that
these are people who have been driven to the brink by Muni, rather
than downtown and back home again.

HEALTHFUL SCHOOL LUNCHES REQUIRE SOME PARENTAL CREATIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Mindy Holland, a mother of two, paid the price
for trying something different with her 6-year-old son David's
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, I tried to give him yogurt and he went around telling
everyone that we didn't own any bread in our house and we forced
this on him,'' said Holland, director of youth services at the
Jewish Community Center in Niskayuna, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waging a daily culinary battle, Holland gave in and
returned to her son's cherished lunchtime entree: tuna fish with
mayonnaise. On a hamburger roll. Nothing else would do for David.
Not celery or pickles. Not bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the year of the tuna fish sandwich,'' Holland said.
``He begs for it. I'm just hoping he doesn't eat tuna fish on a
hamburger roll every day for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   And so begins the annual parental back-to-school quandary over
what to pack their kids for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation for parents because they want to send a
school lunch that's reasonably healthy and nutritious, but it has
to be something their child will actually eat or it just sits in
the lunch box and does nobody any good,'' said Jean Bigaouette, a
clinical nutritionist who counsels school-aged children and parents
in her private Albany practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bigaouette said offering alternatives to the standard peanut
butter and jelly sandwich might accomplish both goals.
</P>
<P>
   She has found that kids like an interactive lunch. She suggested
sending in slices of fresh vegetables that kids can dip into
hummus, a favorite salad dressing or cottage cheese. Soups or pasta
dishes in a thermos with crackers or a biscuit can replace
sandwiches as the main course. Try a piece of string cheese rolled
up in a flour tortilla. Even a slice of cold pizza will fill the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't get too weird. Kids want to fit in, Bigaouette said,
and they won't eat something strange from their lunch box, even if
it has the artistry of a chef's nouvelle cuisine creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child gets ridiculed for the way his lunch looks because
it's too different from what his peers are eating, he's going to
leave it in the lunch box uneaten,'' Bigaouette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern is a child developing a taste for those
salty, fatty pre-made lunch packs,'' said Nan Windmueller, a
certified nutritionist with a private practice in Albany. She cited
a recent survey that reported more than 10 million children in the
United States are overweight. Among children she works with in her
practice, Windmueller said obesity is the leading health issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obesity is a disease of affluence that begins in childhood,''
Windmueller said. ``It leads to other diseases of affluence like
heart disease and diabetes. It's a matter of over-nutrition in
children, giving them more fuel than is required for the
increasingly sedentary lifestyle of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Windmueller said she tries to shave calories while boosting
nutrition ideally without the child ever realizing the nutritional
sleight-of-hand going on behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Windmueller suggested replacing a piece of fresh
fruit such as a pear or apple for a small box of raisins (a savings
of about 50 calories). Instead of regular string cheese, substitute
light string cheese (30 calories less). Apple juice is pretty weak
in terms of nutrition, so opt instead for a pop-top fruit can with
mixed fruit in its own juice and no added sugar (70 calories less).
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can shave 100 to 200 calories at lunch while increasing
nutrition, I'm developing good eating habits,'' Windmueller said.
``I'm looking for a strategy for eating healthy, not a strategy for
food deprivation.''
</P>
<P>
   A technique that has worked for Windmueller's clients is to
invite the child to help plan a school lunch, purchase the
ingredients and physically make it. They like feeling involved and
there are no surprises for them when they open that brown bag,
Windmueller said.
</P>
<P>
   Theory and practice often diverge, though.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, a great existential divide has opened up across the
yawning maw of the unpacked lunch box. On one side, the kids. They
clamor for Oscar Mayer Lunchables, a kind of TV dinner at lunch for
kids. It's a pre-fab meal under molded plastic. For $1.99 you get
entree choices such as pepperoni pizza, beef tacos and cheese and
salsa nachos. Each Lunchable also comes with a Capri Sun fruit
drink (10 percent fruit juice) and a Butterfinger or Nestle Crunch
candy bar. Calories are included. The nachos Lunchable, for
example, contains 530 calories (210 calories from fat) and 24 grams
of total fat.
</P>
<P>
   Some students like the Lunchables for the Nickelodeon game of
chance that's included. The back of the box touts instant winners
of 1,000 toy spin-offs from the popular kids' cable TV channel and
three grand prize trips to host the Nickelodeon Nickel-O-Zone show
at the Nick studios in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make Fun of Lunch'' is the Lunchables motto.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Fox isn't buying the concept. ``I think they're very
expensive, really high in fat and a lot of junk food,'' said the
mother of two daughters in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pleading wears Fox down and she relents by packing a
Lunchable once or twice a month for Sharon, a fifth-grader, and
Joanna, a second-grader, in Niskayuna.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between parent and child over what to pack for a
school lunch requires give-and-take and delicate negotiation. But
Bigaouette stressed that a parent can't just take a bye on this
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to remember that the lunch they send in with
their child should represent one-third of the nutrition their child
needs for the day,'' Bigaouette said. ``It's not just a throwaway
thing. It's a real meal. It has to keep the child going through the
most active part of their day.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think of the four basic food groups as a good framework for
building an adequate school lunch, Bigaouette said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can begin to strike a balance with what kids like and
what is healthy. Don't fight white bread, for example, and let the
child win that battle if the parent gets a concession on, say,
pretzels instead of potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to packing a school lunch for your child, however,
the best-laid plans of parents can go awry. Forewarned is
forearmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A parent might do a superb job packing a healthy, nutritious
lunch that looks great and is fun to eat,'' Bigaouette said. ``And
then your child goes and trades it with another kid for two candy
bars.''
</P>
<P>
   There's always the school cafeteria lunch.

   POPCORN-SEASON (Undated) _ As Hollywood's popcorn season fades
into a filet mignon fall and the explosions of ``Deep Impact,''
``Armageddon'' and ``Godzilla'' recede into distant background
mutterings, what, if anything, have this summer's movies taught us
about ourselves and our tastes in film? The most revealing lesson
of the last two months, one that is, I hope, not lost on Hollywood,
may be that popcorn doesn't have to rule the summer box office. The
season's biggest hit, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' is the kind of
prestige film that usually opens after Thanksgiving. And ``Saving
Private Ryan'' isn't an anomaly. A critic's notebook by Stephen
Holden.
</P>
<P>
   MCCALLUM-THEATER (New York) _ As paranoid as it sounds, David
McCallum is absolutely certain he is being shadowed by a Russian
agent. ``He's there every day,'' McCallum said, ``I mean, it's been
30 years, but I can't escape him. Illya Kuryakin is there 24 hours
a day.'' The role for which most fans remember McCallum is that of
Kuryakin, the brooding, mysterious Russian operative in the 1960s
joke-and-dagger spy series ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' McCallum's
current assignment is playing Harold Palmer, the befuddled security
guard in Alan Ayckbourn's comedy ``Communicating Doors,'' his
second play in New York this year after an absence of nearly a
decade. By Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   UNUSUAL-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ Hugh Francis Hicks, a 76-year-old
dentist in Baltimore, has the largest collection of light bulbs in
the world, the Mount Vernon Museum of Incandescent Lighting. Why do
people collect? It is taken for granted that art is worth
collecting, but collectors collect pretty much everything, without
necessarily thinking that what they collect has esthetic or
monetary value. I spent a few days poking around unusual museums
and other places, wondering about that. I visited a museum of trash
and the basement of a teetotaler in New Jersey who owns several
thousand miniature liquor bottles and several dozen miniature
Vargas pinups from old cigarette packs. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   SAGAMORE-HILL (Undated) _ The house I would most love to go home
to is Sagamore Hill. As an ardent visitor to museum-houses that
offer glimpses of the personal daily lives of their revered
occupants, I feel that Theodore Roosevelt's beloved estate in
Oyster Bay on Long Island, more than any other, seems the perfect
home in which to have grown up. By Mimi Sheraton.

FDA MOVES TOWARD APPROVAL OF NEW BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS

 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Joy Fudem had gone through radiation and three
kinds of hormonal therapies, hit her limit on chemotherapy and had
a bone-marrow transplant when she learned last year that she
finally had been picked in a lottery to receive the experimental
breast cancer drug Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just screaming, I was so elated,'' said Fudem, 66, a San
Francisco resident who had been turned down twice in her attempts
to participate in clinical trials of the drug. Now, every Tuesday
she spends a half-hour at the Mount Zion-University of California
at San Francisco Cancer Center getting the antibody infused into
her bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, women with Fudem's kind of cancer won't have to rely on
chance or participate in complicated trials to get a hold of
Herceptin, the first genetically engineered breast cancer drug,
developed by Genentech of South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel
recommended approving the drug for the 25 percent to 30 percent of
breast cancer patients with a genetic abnormality that contributes
to an aggressive form of the disease. The drug helped prolong the
lives of many, especially when used with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel's recommendation was one of two significant
milestones Wednesday in the fight against breast cancer. Despite
warnings from scientists and advocacy groups, the FDA advisory
panel also voted to recommend tamoxifen, a hormone-related drug
already used to treat breast cancer, for use in preventing the
disease in women who are at high risk for it.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said that data showing tamoxifen kept breast tumors at
bay were slight and conflicting, and that there were serious risks,
such as increased cases of uterine cancer and other side effects,
from the powerful drug. The FDA panel urged an aggressive education
campaign to make sure only women at the highest risk of getting the
disease were given the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamoxifen is not a sugar pill,'' said Barbara Brenner,
executive director of San Francisco-based Breast Cancer Action.
``Our concern is about large numbers of women being pressured to
take a drug, the long-term side effects of which are not known, and
the short-term side effects that are known aren't good.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA panel's actions, part of an accelerated timetable for
reviewing promising breast cancer treatments, signal the growing
attention being paid to the disease, which strikes 178,000 U.S.
women each year. Several other potential drugs are in development,
including therapies like Herceptin, which is designed to interfere
with the chain of events that turns cells cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Also, raloxifene, already used to treat osteoporosis, is being
touted as a possible breast cancer prevention drug that has fewer
side effects than tamoxifen. Comparative studies of the two
possible preventives _ raloxifene and tamoxifen _ are to begin
later this year. Brenner, however, also is skeptical of raloxifene,
which she said had very little data to support its use.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pending final approval from the FDA, Genentech said
it was prepared to ship doses of Herceptin to the market later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing was packed with advocates who have worked
for years to speed up development and approval of Herceptin, the
first genetically targeted drug found effective against a major
type of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the next phase of breast cancer research
and treatment,'' said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast
Cancer Coalition. ``It's the first targeted therapy shown to have
effectiveness, and it's something we've been looking for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of women with breast cancer have a genetic
variation that causes their cancer cells to have extra amounts of a
protein that acts as a receiver for growth-stimulating hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an on-switch for the cancer,'' said John Park, a
cancer scientist at University of California at San
Francisco-Stanford Health Care Breast Care Center. Park has been
involved with Herceptin trials since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herceptin binds to it and turns it off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also believe Herceptin, which is an antibody, may
signal the immune system to begin fighting the tumor, Park said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the drug was not universally effective even for those who
had the right genetic profile. Forty-nine percent of those
receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy responded to the treatment,
versus 32 percent who received only chemotherapy. One year after
treatment, 78 percent of the Herceptin and chemotherapy patients
were alive, compared with 67 percent of those who received
chemotherapy alone.
</P>
<P>
   Heart problems, mostly non-fatal, have been detected in 28
percent of the women who took Herceptin with a class of
chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines. For patients who only
received Herceptin, 15 percent responded to the treatment, meaning
in most cases they were not cured but lived several months longer
than expected.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, when Herceptin was first being developed,
advocacy groups played a large role. They sat in with company
officials in drawing up testing standards and helped recruit
patients to the early studies to speed up research, Visco said.
</P>
<P>
   Other activists demonstrated in front of Genentech to try to
force the company to open so-called compassionate care trials,
pioneered by AIDS activists, to make the drug available to very ill
women who would not otherwise be eligible for formal testing.
</P>
<P>
   Even after those programs were set up, so many women wanted the
drug that a lottery was established, and only a fraction of those
eligible were able to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Fudem was one of the lucky ones. Fourteen months later, her
tumors remain, but none has grown or spread. She exercises, works
as a travel agent and says she feels fine.
</P>
<P>
   Since she also received heavy doses of chemotherapy and the
bone-marrow transplant months before starting on Herceptin, it is
not certain which therapy is responsible for stopping the spread.
However, Fudem believes Herceptin has made a big difference. She is
especially grateful because she has had no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Fudem's doctor, Debu Tripathy, has been involved with Herceptin
since it was just a concept in the late 1980s. He has been able to
treat only about 50 patients at the cancer center with the drug,
even though many more fit the profile for it.
</P>
<P>
   Tripathy said he expected to recommend it for many of the women
now under his care who had been excluded so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty frustrating not to be able to give something that
might help,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   POPCORN-SEASON (Undated) _ As Hollywood's popcorn season fades
into a filet mignon fall and the explosions of ``Deep Impact,''
``Armageddon'' and ``Godzilla'' recede into distant background
mutterings, what, if anything, have this summer's movies taught us
about ourselves and our tastes in film? The most revealing lesson
of the last two months, one that is, I hope, not lost on Hollywood,
may be that popcorn doesn't have to rule the summer box office. The
season's biggest hit, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' is the kind of
prestige film that usually opens after Thanksgiving. And ``Saving
Private Ryan'' isn't an anomaly. A critic's notebook by Stephen
Holden.
</P>
<P>
   MCCALLUM-THEATER (New York) _ As paranoid as it sounds, David
McCallum is absolutely certain he is being shadowed by a Russian
agent. ``He's there every day,'' McCallum said, ``I mean, it's been
30 years, but I can't escape him. Illya Kuryakin is there 24 hours
a day.'' The role for which most fans remember McCallum is that of
Kuryakin, the brooding, mysterious Russian operative in the 1960s
joke-and-dagger spy series ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' McCallum's
current assignment is playing Harold Palmer, the befuddled security
guard in Alan Ayckbourn's comedy ``Communicating Doors,'' his
second play in New York this year after an absence of nearly a
decade. By Jesse McKinley.

   UNUSUAL-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ Hugh Francis Hicks, a 76-year-old
dentist in Baltimore, has the largest collection of light bulbs in
the world, the Mount Vernon Museum of Incandescent Lighting. Why do
people collect? It is taken for granted that art is worth
collecting, but collectors collect pretty much everything, without
necessarily thinking that what they collect has esthetic or
monetary value. I spent a few days poking around unusual museums
and other places, wondering about that. I visited a museum of trash
and the basement of a teetotaler in New Jersey who owns several
thousand miniature liquor bottles and several dozen miniature
Vargas pinups from old cigarette packs. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   SAGAMORE-HILL (Undated) _ The house I would most love to go home
to is Sagamore Hill. As an ardent visitor to museum-houses that
offer glimpses of the personal daily lives of their revered
occupants, I feel that Theodore Roosevelt's beloved estate in
Oyster Bay on Long Island, more than any other, seems the perfect
home in which to have grown up. By Mimi Sheraton.

 &HT;    A PRIMER ON IRELAND-NORTHERN IRELAND
 &HT;    With IRELAND-CLINTON-0904.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ireland at a Glance
</P>
<P>
   Two countries: The island of Ireland comprises the Republic of
Ireland, an independent country with Dublin as its capital, and
Northern Ireland, a province of the United Kingdom with Belfast as
its capital. The island was partitioned in 1921, the year before
the republic gained its independence. Northern Ireland had its own
parliament between 1921 and 1972, when the British government
assumed direct responsibility for governing Northern Ireland. The
two share a 303-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   Population and Religion: Northern Ireland has a population of
1.6 million, with a slight majority declaring their religion to be
Protestant. The Republic of Ireland has a population of 3.5
million, with a large Catholic majority and less than 10 percent of
the population describing themselves as Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Economics: One of the biggest differences between the two
Irelands has been economics. Northern Ireland, plagued by its
history, has for years received the heaviest doses of public
subsidies of any area of the United Kingdom, amounting to $7
billion a year. It has been a different story in the republic, once
considered just a notch above Third World in the strength of its
economy. Over the decade, the republic has prospered so much that
in 1996 the per capita income there exceeded that in Britain.
Dubliners are buying land and businesses in the north. However, it
is the north that may be benefitting the most from the peace
process: Last year was the best year on record for new investment
in the north, amounting to $1 billion, generating 7,000 new jobs.
Continued economic success is considered essential to the success
of the still-fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The Conflict: Since 1921, the majority of people in Northern
Ireland have voted in successive elections for candidates who have
favored continued union with the United Kingdom, a position known
as Unionism. Unionists are primarily Protestants, while Catholics
in Northern Ireland tend to support a move to become part of the
Republic of Ireland, a position known as nationalism or
republicanism. The Irish Republican Army, or IRA, has been the most
visible advocate of this position. The IRA for years conducted a
guerilla -- many say terrorist -- war to drive the British from
Ireland. Sinn Fein is the political party that represents the
republican movement, while the Ulster Unionist Party represents
those who want to remain part of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Violence: More than 3,000 people have been killed in sectarian
violence over the last 30 years, many of them civilians killed in
terrorist attacks. The violence was particularly acute in the late
1960s and early 1970s, but has been sporadic since. The largest act
of violence was last month's bombing at the small town of Omagh,
which killed 28 and wounded more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Plan: Outlined in the ``Good Friday Agreement,'' which
was approved by representatives of major political parties on April
10, a new Northern Ireland Assembly comprising both sides of the
struggle is undertaking the task of reaching a political settlement
of the dispute. The plan was approved by an overwhelming majority,
about 70 percent, in both the north and south. A new Northern
Ireland Assembly has been elected and will take office soon. The
assembly is intended as the forum to continue the debate over the
fate of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges: Trust remains the over-arching issue. While there
has been considerable progress, key issues stand in the way, chief
among them: Decommissioning, or the disarmament of all sides in the
conflict, particularly the IRA. Even though the participants in the
peace process have disavowed the use of violence, huge stocks of
bombs and weapons remain in the hands of paramilitary organizations
on both sides. Thus far, not one bullet has been turned in. This
threatens to undermine the process because members of the new
assembly, particularly David Trimble, the Ulster unionist who
serves as the assembly's first minister, has said he would not form
a government until this disarmament begins.

   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``ARMAGEDDON,''  &LR;  starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler
and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes).
This big, showy, spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a
single heartfelt moment, unless you count its sequence set in a
strip club. Imminent doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid)
becomes the excuse for rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and
a notion of heroism that has nothing whatever to do with real
courage. Willis gets the film's noblest lines for the same reason
that he probably got the set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries
gamely to seem mad about Ms. Tyler, who serves as window dressing
at NASA headquarters. Totally predictable elements _ loud noises,
frequent explosions and bright computer screen colors _ seem as
inevitable and deadly as the asteroid while they create the
illusion of escapist fun (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE AVENGERS,'' &LR;  starring Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes, Sean
Connery and Eileen Atkins. Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100
minutes). Sometimes major movie studios  &UR; should &LR;  be afraid to
screen expensive fiascoes for the press, but they go ahead anyway.
``The Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that
actually had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day,
and no wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin
Powers blush and with so many shades of ``Howard the Duck'' that
one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a
conference table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television
series and perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday
morning show where I heard actual cries of ``Ugh!'' on the way out
the door (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BLADE,''  &LR; starring Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Traci Lords
and Kris Kristofferson. Directed by Stephen Norrington (R, 120
minutes). Vampires are plotting to take over the world, and the
only person who can save the planet is a vampiric half-human
superhero named Blade. So much fake blood drips, gushes, explodes
and congeals in this hyperkinetic science-fiction horror film
adapted from a popular comic book that there's barely a scene that
isn't drenched in red. Snipes' Blade is a low-rent Arnold
Schwarzenegger imitation dressed in a ludicrous mixture of black
leather and what look like car seat belts. There's lot of morphing
and Hong Kong action movie-style acrobatics. Dorff is the bratty
leader of the young vampire rebels. The visuals are garish, the
acting wretched (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``DANCE WITH ME,''  &LR; starring Vanessa Williams, Chayanne and
Kris Kristofferson (PG, 126 minutes). A likable mess of a movie,
``Dance With Me'' wants to be the ``Saturday Night Fever'' of salsa
dancing, and in the smoldering-eyed young Puerto Rican star
Chayanne it has found a charismatic Latino answer to John Travolta.
But the story of an ambitious young Cuban who works in a Houston
dance studio run by a man who may or may not be his biological
father ( Kristofferson) meanders so much that the movie never
gathers dramatic momentum, and the dance sequences are hopelessly
choppy and poorly framed. Even a percolating Latin American score
and a winning performance by Ms. Williams as the object of
Chayanne's affection can't hold the pieces together (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EVER AFTER: A CINDERELLA STORY,''  &LR; starring Drew Barrymore,
Anjelica Huston and Dougray Scott. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13,
120 minutes). The clever notion of reinventing Cinderella as a
self-motivated powerhouse who doesn't need a fairy godmother to get
ahead has been reduced into a bland mishmash of comedy and soap
opera. Drew Barrymore is appealing as Danielle, a plucky,
resourceful, slightly tomboyish 16th-century French girl who knows
how to stand up for herself. But her wimpish prince ( Scott) isn't
much of a prize to crow over. And why is Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick
Godfrey) traipsing around France with the ``Mona Lisa'' under his
arm, giving advice to the lovelorn? The most orthodox refugee from
the standard fairy tale is Ms. Huston's haughty stepmother
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EVEREST,''  &LR; directed by David Brashears with Greg
MacGillivray (not rated; 45 minutes). If life in New York City
doesn't provide enough in the way of thrills, those in search of a
vicarious near-death experience can make their way to the Sony Imax
Theater at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street) for a go
at ``Everest.'' There, images of the world's highest mountain _
29,028 feet _ find a frame worthy of the peak's spectacular, lethal
beauty: the eight-story-high, 100-foot-wide screen. This account
focuses mainly on the efforts of three people to scale the peak in
1996 despite yawning chasms of ever-shifting ice, thundering
avalanches, the perils of air so thin that it addles the brain, and
sudden, blinding storms. While this expedition was on the mountain,
as many articles and books were later to relate, other teams made
their way into the so-called death zone, at 25,000 feet, where a
violent storm overtook them. Eight people perished in the worst
single disaster on the mountain. ``Everest'' makes it possible for
armchair adventurers to share the risks and glory of the team's
climb toward heaven (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``54,''  &LR; starring Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell,
Mike Myers, Lauren Hutton and Michael York. Directed by Mark
Christopher (R, 89 minutes). Mark Christopher's botched-up history
of Studio 54, the notorious late-'70s disco and celebrity hangout,
should have been a depraved Manhattan answer to ``Saturday Night
Fever.'' Instead, it is a juiceless mishmash that can't decide if
it's a nightclub history, a comedy ( Myers' crude ``Saturday Night
Live''-style caricature of Steve Rubell) or a contemporary
variation on the fable of the prodigal son. Phillippe, playing a
19-year-old Jersey City nobody who ascends from busboy to star
bartender at the club, does throw off an occasional spark. But the
movie is so afraid to confront the character's self-promoting
bisexuality that he never really comes alive (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``GONE WITH THE WIND,''  &LR; starring Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable,
Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by
Victor Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of robust life
left in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of Margaret
Mitchell's romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it never
existed) just before, during and after the Civil War. Not a great
film but a satisfying one. The performances by Vivien Leigh, Clark
Gable and Hattie McDaniel are ravishing, and there's grandeur in
the meticulous physical production. The movie shows its age most
unfortunately in the uneven quality of the Technicolor prints,
which, though new, go sort of pinkish more often than they should
(Vincent Canby).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``HENRY FOOL,''  &LR;  starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and
Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The
affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look
and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Hartley moves into a
much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art,
trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool (
Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim (
Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the
results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly
sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few
glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's
elegance of vision (Maslin).

<P>
   &UR; ``HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK,''  &LR; starring Angela Bassett,
Taye Diggs and Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan.
(R, 99 minutes). This silly soft-core fantasy in which 40-year-old
Stella (Ms. Bassett) meets and falls in love with 20-year-old
Winston ( Diggs) while on vacation in Jamaica is part Caribbean
travel brochure (fly to Jamaica and meet the hunk of your dreams)
and part diluted Chippendales-in-the-Caribbean strip show floated
on a bathtub full of suds with some light comedy thrown in. Ms.
Bassett brings real fire to the role of a beautiful
divorced-with-one-son San Francisco stockbroker whose resistance to
romance is broken down in the tropics. But Diggs' nearly perfect
boyfriend is a vapid romance-novel fabrication. Ms. Goldberg
shamelessly stirs up the suds as Stella's raunchy best friend, who
is secretly dying of liver cancer (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE MASK OF ZORRO,''  &LR; starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony
Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Martin Campbell
(PG-13, 130 minutes). Travel back to the days when swashbuckling
was serious business, when boyish adventure films still had their
innocence and when the bravado of thrilling stunt work was all a
movie needed in the way of special effects. Hopkins is marvelously
game as the film's dashing senior Zorro. Banderas was born to play
the aging hero's jokey, hotblooded protege. And he meets his match
in the story's heroine, whose beauty is inevitably described as
``beyond compare.'' This robust old-fashioned adventure should
appeal to older children, but beware of a few needlessly grisly
touches (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,''  &LR; starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated, 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria'' has grown dated at all. In a prize-winning and
heartbreaking performance, the star plays a scrappy Roman
streetwalker who drifts almost magically among the film's
astonishingly varied realms. There is more grace and courage in the
famous image of Masina smiling through her tears than in all the
fire-breathing blockbusters Hollywood has to offer (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,''  &LR; starring Christina Ricci, Martin
Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100
minutes). Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully
acerbic comedy finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from
nasty little Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil
twin. Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this
film and announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart
of gold. Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally
skewers preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``OUT OF SIGHT,''  &LR; starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend an afternoon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE SPANISH PRISONER,''  &LR; starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca
Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Written and directed by
David Mamet (PG, 112 minutes). The most engaging of Mamet's
cinematic puzzles begins with an X-ray at an airport security
check. And the audience will wish it had a similar device for
reading the characters' sneaky minds. No such luck: the mystery
here, in a handsome and Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate
con game, stays tricky to the very end. Scott plays the inventor of
a lucrative, stealable scientific process, with Gazzara as the boss
who's in no hurry to compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast
working entirely on the calculating Mamet wavelength, Martin plays
a rich, debonair mystery man who tells the inventor all about his
pretty young sister. In her performance as a pert, unaccountably
off-kilter secretary, Ms. Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's
sleight of hand (Maslin).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE PARENT TRAP,''  &LR; starring Lindsay Lohan, Natasha
Richardson and Dennis Quaid. Directed by Nancy Meyers and written
by David Swift, Ms. Meyers and Charles Shyer (PG, 128 minutes). A
super-cute remake of the old Hayley Mills hit, this time given a
privileged shelter-magazine gloss by the ``Father of the Bride''
team of Ms. Meyers and Shyer. Ms. Richardson and Quaid beam
appealingly as parents who somehow managed to separate their twins
at birth without a twinge of guilt and who seem to have spent all
of the intervening 11{ years shopping. In her dual role as English
and American sisters (one lives in a grand London town house, the
other on a big Napa Valley vineyard; nobody lives in a coal mine),
the spirited Ms. Lohan commandeers the movie as if she had been
taking shrinking-violet lessons from Sharon Stone (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A PERFECT MURDER,''  &LR; starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth
Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107
minutes). The characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a
skillfully plotted update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred
Hitchcock's film) ``Dial M for Murder,'' but the nasty
cat-and-mouse games they play are icily amusing. Douglas, looking
more than ever like a wattled, riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor,
a shady Wall Street bond trader in deep financial trouble who hires
his rich wife's handsome lover ( Mortensen), a con man posing as a
painter, to murder her. It's not as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow,
looking chic and twinkly, is the wife, Emily, a translator at the
United Nations, who has her own agenda. The story takes enough
surprising twists to keep you engrossed, and the high-style
ambiance (especially the Taylors' Fifth Avenue apartment) is
mouthwatering (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``SNAKE EYES,''  &LR; starring Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise.
Directed by Brian De Palma (R, 99 minutes). An assassination, a
fixed heavyweight boxing bout and a perfectly timed hurricane named
Jezebel collide apocalyptically one night in Atlantic City, where
hellfire rains over a hotel and casino appropriately called the
Millennium. Here is where Rick Santoro ( Cage), the sleazy police
detective in charge of security, discovers that his best friend (
Sinise) could also be his nemesis and he has to make hard moral
choices. This entertaining pop fable, which recalls the director's
``Blow Out,'' isn't believable for a second, but it has a pulpy
energy that keeps on chugging (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,''  &LR; starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE TRUMAN SHOW,''  &LR; starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol (PG,
104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and
cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top,
but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie
fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate
edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE,''  &LR;  starring Larenz Tate, Halle
Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon. Directed by Gregory Nava (R,
112 minutes). In this raucous comic ``Rashomon'' of rock-and-roll,
the brief, meteoric career and busy, turbulent marital life of the
singer Frankie Lymon ( Tate) furnish the pretext for a trip through
time to the 1950s and '60s, when much of a generation fell under
the spell of a new kind of music. At its best, this uneven but
often entertaining movie, written by Tina Andrews, manages to
recapture some of the excitement and turmoil of those days, revel
in high spirits and low-down humor and provide a happy sampler of
hits. At its most mediocre, it is built around a farcical battle
for Lymon's estate among three women (Ms. Berry, Ms. Fox and Ms.
Rochon), each claiming to be his wife and the heir to his
royalties. Lymon's career may have been short and sad, but ``Why Do
Fools Fall in Love'' finds the melodrama of his life in the
exciting music of his time and the tumult of his romances (Van
Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``WRONGFULLY ACCUSED,''  &LR; starring Leslie Nielsen, Richard
Crenna, Kelly Le Brock and Sandra Bernhard. Directed by Pat Proft
(PG-13, 85 minutes). No one can accuse this film of a shortage of
jokes. Nielsen and his co-stars keep them coming. Unfortunately
most of them just aren't very funny, and ``Wrongfully Accused,''
which is essentially a parody of ``The Fugitive,'' feels like a
tangle of funny ideas all dressed up with nowhere to go (Anita
Gates).

OBESITY AN ENIGMA, THREAT TO NATIONAL HEALTH  
 (NOTE: SIDEBAR MATERIAL AT END OF STORY) 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   UNDATED - Health specialists are calling it a ``fat epidemic,''
and no wonder with the latest numbers showing that more than half
of Americans are overweight and one out of three adults is obese.
</P>
<P>
   The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into
obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings
linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including
heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being overweight is not just a personal problem but a genuine
public health threat,'' said University of Colorado obesity
researcher James O. Hill in the May issue of the journal
``Science.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet although much has been learned about obesity, it's still a
medical enigma that prompts more questions than there are answers.
</P>
<P>
   What is known: Obesity is caused by a complicated interaction of
environmental and genetic factors. Up until 20 years ago, obesity
was considered less a disease and more the end result of gluttony
and a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Consuming more calories than you burn off is still the primary
factor in most cases of obesity. But geneticists now are
recognizing that heredity plays a salient role also.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been a focal point of considerable research in the
area of obesity and genetics. For the past 30 years, the Gila River
Pimas have agreed to participate in generational studies on
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The Pimas, as a group, have an unusually high incidence of
obesity, which also has contributed to their highest recorded rates
of diabetes in the world. A Gila River Pima man has an 80 percent
chance of becoming diabetic before he's 55, according to Dr. David
Harrowe, a public health officer for the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity researcher Dr. Eric Ravussin, formerly with the National
Institutes of Health in the Phoenix area, has studied the Pimas,
and was the focus of the February '98 ``New Yorker'' magazine
article ``The Pima Paradox.'' He believes the Pimas' plight is tied
closely to their genetic inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As desert dwellers, the Pima evolved ``thrifty'' fat genes as
a survival mechanism to help conserve fat during periods of
famine,'' Ravussin said.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they ate moderately and ate traditional low-fat foods
of cholla-cactus buds, honey mesquite, prickly pears and tepary
beans, squash and white-winged dove, their weight was kept in check
during normal times.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Pimas abandoned their traditional foods and began to
eat like other Americans, and in mass quantities like other
Americans, their thrifty fat genes became a liability. Their new
higher-fat diets were stored rather than metabolized, according to
Ravussin.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticist Murray Brilliant, a professor in the department of
pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said it's not
exactly clear what the Pima studies say about the non-Pima
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, obviously, in every population there are people who have
more thrifty genes than other people,'' Brilliant said. ``If that
wasn't the case, then everybody who ate the same thing would be the
same weight.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also overwhelming evidence that obesity is linked to
hormonal irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity specialist Dr. Donald Robertson of the Southwest
Bariatric Nutrition Center in Scottsdale, Ariz., said the consensus
among researchers is that a fat cell is actually an endocrine
organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a thyroid or adrenal, it produces its own hormone, called
leptin,'' Robertson said. ``Understanding how leptin works seems to
be a key in treating obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   It's generally believed that leptin signals the brain to stop
eating, which creates the sensation of satiation, or feeling full.
However, this signal does not get through properly in some
overweight people. Consequently, scientists have tried to inject
synthetic leptin, hoping this would stimulate the satiation
response.
</P>
<P>
   But preliminary findings indicate the weight-regulating hormone
leptin isn't the miracle fat cure some hoped it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Endocrinologist Dr. Antonio Tataranni worked with Ravussin in
Phoenix at the National Institutes of Health in the study of Pimas
and obesity. His work with hormone anomalies has convinced him that
obesity has a physiological basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that obesity is a
disease,'' Tataranni said. ``It's a matter of understanding how
hormones stimulate different areas of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, obesity research has turned up the unexpected. A
London study in 1995 connected overeating with pathological
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   People who are overweight often say they don't understand their
weight gain because they ``practically eat nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the London study showed that people who are fat dramatically
underestimate their food intake (up to 50 percent), especially the
high caloric, fatty foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it's lying or a subconscious omission,'' said
head researcher Dr. Berit Heitmann.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, researchers in the study concluded that denial
further impedes chances for weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear how big a role genetics and other innate
factors have in the overall obesity package. But Harrowe, the Pima
public health officer, feels emphasizing factors we can't control
does little to help Pimas or non-Pimas who are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't want is people developing this attitude that
there's nothing they can do about it anyway,'' Harrowe said. ``You
have to focus on lifestyle changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Many obesity researchers agree, and believe that the fat
epidemic is primarily the end result of an abhorrent culture that
places inordinate emphasis on quantity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming obese is a normal response to the American
environment,'' said obesity researcher Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit
at the University of Colorado, puts a preponderance of blame for
fat Americans on our culture: Americans have too much food
available; social and work situations encourage overeating;
restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings;
64-ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12-ounce
bottled soda; and technology has made it possible to avoid
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health,
agrees and has come to group these factors into what he calls the
pathoenvironment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if the Pimas' environment had not changed so
drastically, they would not be in their current condition,''
Ravussin said. ``But the same can be said for non-Pimas. Getting
food was hard work until 100 years ago. Now, it's available in
abundance without any activity required to obtain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center, said
he'd like to see our culture put more emphasis on physical activity
and education on nutrition rather than see who can come up with the
largest soft drink under a buck. He said he'd also like restaurants
to be more responsible in the portions they serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to some restaurants and order what you think is a
normal meal and you get enough for three people,'' Robertson said.
``It's obscene. My wife and I now routinely order one entree and
split it.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, obesity specialists want the public to snap out
of it and wake up to the serious health risks associated with being
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Science, they remind us, has yet to find a magic pill that cuts
weight gain without unhealthful side effects, and many researchers
believe that any such drug will have to be combined with diet and
exercise anyway. &QL;

 &QL; 
Are you obese? &QL; 
Obesity is defined clinically as being 20 percent heavier than your
ideal weight. &QL; 
Overwhelming research shows that the risks of heart disease, high
blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, osteoarthritis and even some
forms of cancer start to climb when body-fat levels are above a
rating of 24 BMI (body mass index), but really soar above a BMI of
30. &QL; 
A rating of 25 is overweight; 30 obese; 40 severely obese. &QL; 
To calculate your own approximate body mass index: &QL; 
- Multiply your weight by 700. &QL; 
- Divide the answer by your height in inches. &QL; 
- Divide again by height in inches. &QL; 
It should be noted that these new government guidelines do not take
all factors into consideration, especially muscle weight, which is
heavier and generally more healthful than fat weight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
By the numbers &QL; 
- Fifty-four percent of all American adults are heavier than is
healthy, according to a recent study from the University of
Colorado. About one-third of American adults are obese, which is
defined as being 20 percent over your ideal weight. Twenty-five
percent of people under the age of 18 are considered obese also. &QL; 
- Instances of severe obesity _ not being able to fit in an airline
seat _ have ballooned 350 percent over the past 30 years. &QL; 
- The National Institutes of Health report that obesity is the
second-leading cause (after smoking) of preventable death in the
United States today, and estimate that obesity-related disease
costs the nation about $100 billion a year in direct health-care
expenses or in lost productivity. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Slim-down plan &QL; 
Recommendations by obesity specialists for thinning up America: &QL; 
- Encourage physical exercise, perhaps even reward people with
reduced insurance premiums or additional vacation time. &QL; 
- Encourage restaurants not to use food portions as a competitive
issue. People generally will eat all that they are served. &QL; 
- Increase the sense of urgency about controlling obesity among the
public and health-care workers through government-sponsored
campaigns similar to the ones for anti-smoking. &QL; 
- Require schoolchildren to exercise vigorously at least 30 minutes
daily. &QL; 
- ncrease the availability of low-fat foods such as fruits,
vegetables and whole grains, and make processed low-fat foods as
tasty as high-fat versions. &QL;

<P>
   ``Titanic,'' which was released on Tuesday, swamps all else on
video this week. As for video guides, September is once again awash
with updated and new editions.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest is ``Video Hound's Golden Movie Retriever''
for 1999 (Visible Ink Press, $21.95), a dreadnought of the genre
with 22,000 reviews (1,000 of them new), 200 pages of listings by
film categories and a dozen appendixes indexing the work of 40,000
actors, directors, screenwriters and composers. Digital video disk
titles are included, as is a roster of Web sites for the movie
hunter.
</P>
<P>
   This year, too, in response to the American Film Institute's
list of 100 best American films, the editors have chosen their own
best, which number 290. Make room for ``Caddyshack,'' ``Living in
Oblivion'' and ``Raising Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing the perspective considerably, the new visual arts
video catalog from Facets Multimedia, a mail-order distributor in
Chicago, includes about every video available having to do with
artists and how they work.
</P>
<P>
   This guide lists only feature films _ for example, ``Surviving
Picasso,'' ``Moulin Rouge'' and ``La Belle Noiseuse'' _ that are
about painters and sculptors and their lot in the world. Of the
several hundred titles, some are narrated films of museum and
gallery exhibitions; some are documentaries about artists (``Chuck
Close,'' ``Drawing the Line: A Portrait of Keith Haring,'' the
Maysles brothers' ``Christo in Paris''), and still others explore
movements and styles (``Cubism and Non-Objective Art'').
</P>
<P>
   ``They give you something to settle in with after you get home
from the exhibit,'' said Milos Stehlik, Facets' director.
(Information: (800) 331-6197).
</P>
<P>
   Videocassettes of films customarily precede digital video disks,
but in November HBO is scheduled to reverse the order of things and
release ``From the Earth to the Moon,'' its 12-episode miniseries
about the manned Apollo missions of the '60s and '70s, on DVD
months before the production's general release on videotape. That
won't come until next summer, the 30th anniversary of Neil
Armstrong's first steps on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Right now cassettes of the series, which was nominated for 17
Emmy Awards, which are to be presented Sept. 13, are available only
from Columbia House, which sells to members. (Information: (800)
638-2922).
</P>
<P>
   Columbia House is partly owned by Time Warner, which owns HBO
and Warner Brothers studio. Warner Home Video is a leading
proponent of the DVD format. Some distributors see HBO's scheduling
as an effort to promote DVD with a high-profile title that, unlike
a hot new movie, isn't in such high demand that it needs immediate
general release on videotape. Next month, in fact, ``From Earth to
the Moon'' will be rebroadcast on HBO's Signature channel.
</P>
<P>
   So, come November, DVD gets the first call. The 12 episodes will
occupy three of four disks. The fourth will carry extra features
like tours of the solar system, capsule models, mission objectives,
trivia quizzes and links to related Web sites. The price will be
$119.95.

   Down South there is a governor named Jack Stanton (John
Travolta, left) who is at once so conniving and charming that no
one really knows what is going on with him from one minute to the
next. Jack's mercurial ways, dressed up in good-ol'-boy style and
laced with a little down-home deceit, either help or hurt depending
on the message he's getting across or the indiscretion he's
covering up. Left to pick up after Jack is his smart, stoical wife
(Emma Thompson). Mike Nichols' film, adapted from a novel by Joe
Klein and written by Elaine May, has trouble shifting from
affectionate satire to serious political assessment, becoming a
story, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``struggling with
its own identity crisis.''

   Four Little Girls
</P>
<P>
   In Spike Lee's documentary, gentle friends and relatives offer
thoughts about what life might have been for four little girls
killed in the terrorist bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church
in Birmingham, Ala., on Sept. 15, 1963. ``This was the awakening,''
Walter Cronkite says of the crime that disgusted white America and
galvanized the civil rights movement. Interviews with the girls'
families and older residents reconstruct a powerful sense of what
Birmingham was and how the bombing would change its future. But the
film is most remarkable ``in making the little girls unforgettable
and eliciting the long-buried emotions of those who loved them''
(Maslin).

   Neurois-driven urban romance wobbles along in the extremely
tentative hands of Katie (Marla Schaffel), who becomes indignant
when Ben (Mitchell Whitfield), a friend with whom she's merely but
closely platonic, begins a torrid affair with another woman. That
steers her in the direction of Wrong, whom she meets in an auto
accident and is the type who compares a woman to wine tasting. With
its 25-year-old heroine who is finicky about men to the point of
being a virgin, Julie Davis' film is ``bright, energetic and
obviously eager to please'' (Maslin).

UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS AND PASSION IN THE HALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Elisabeth (Sophie Marceau), a beautiful Swiss governess,
meets Charles (Stephen Dillane), a handsome British aristocrat, for
discreet late-night whoopee sessions at a picturesque little hotel
on the north coast of France, she knows she is not supposed to feel
any pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Their carefully planned dates are just a business arrangement.
In return for money to pay off her father's debts, she is to
conceive and bear Charles the child that his wife, who has been
lying in a vegetative state since being nearly killed in a
unspeakable accident, cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   But when the earth moves for Elisabeth on their third night
together, you can be sure that somehow, somewhere, she and Charles
will reunite even though their deal calls for them never to meet
again.
</P>
<P>
   So begins William Nicholson's movie ``Firelight,'' a lush,
high-toned bodice-ripper set in the late 1830's and well acted by
Ms. Marceau and Dillane. Nicholson, a screenwriter
(``Shadowlands''), making his directorial debut with an original
script, gives this romance-novel hokum a soothingly sensuous
``Masterpiece Theater'' gloss and wraps it in a soundtrack of
glutinous schmaltz.
</P>
<P>
   Although the period is the same as that of Minnie Driver's film,
``The Governess,'' the world of ``Firelight'' is a much more
smoothed-out, soft-focus fantasy of 19th-century British life. Even
in the movie's stormier moments, ``Firelight'' feels like ``Jane
Eyre'' filtered through rose-colored glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping ahead nearly a decade, the film finds Charles the doting
father of a spoiled, tantrum-throwing brat named Louisa (Dominique
Belcourt). The girl is such a handful that she has driven all her
governesses quickly from the premises.
</P>
<P>
   One day salvation arrives in the form of Elisabeth a
proto-Stella Dallas, whose maternal instinct has driven her on a
yearslong quest to locate her dear lost little one. Charles' wife's
sister, Constance (Lia Williams), who runs the household and who is
unaware of Elisabeth's identity, hires the stranger on the spot to
be Louisa's new governess.
</P>
<P>
   When Charles arrives home and meets his new employee, he is
furious that Elisabeth has broken their contract, but he agrees to
let her stay for a month. Not long after that, the earth begins to
move again, as Charles and Elisabeth undertake a clandestine affair
that grows hotter and heavier with each passing whoopee session.
</P>
<P>
   Even Louisa can't help but notice them surreptitiously groping
each other as they pass in the halls of Charles' well-appointed
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   With passion comes a requisite dose of guilt. Charles begins
spending hours at the beside of his comatose wife, wringing his
hands and begging her advice. Would she mind if he figuratively
pulled the plug on her? Meanwhile, the gorgeous, determined, wise,
infinitely resourceful Elisabeth tames the ungovernable Louisa by
devising an ingenious form of psychotherapy and tricking the
rebellious girl into learning how to read.
</P>
<P>
   Will true love conquer all? Or should Elisabeth marry Charles'
nice American friend, John (Kevin Anderson), who is visiting from
abroad and is instantly taken with her? Will Louisa ever discover
that her governess is really her mother? And if so, will she accept
her? And what of the wife who stands in the way of their happiness?
Amid all these questions, financial disaster suddenly looms for
Charles.
</P>
<P>
   But not to fear. Here in the land of pseudo-Victorian suds
flakes, true love usually wins out and little monsters can be
remade overnight into petite, demure princesses. Even the also-rans
in life's romantic sweepstakes accept defeat with a stiff upper lip
and a fond farewell. Isn't love grand? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Firelight'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes some steamy sex. &QL;

</HEADLINE>

 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - I saw him as I looked through my front window,
watching the stream of kids filter through the streets to the
nearby school on the first day of the new year. While other kids
walked in groups, swinging backpacks and laughing, he shuffled his
feet, looking at the ground as he walked. I knew how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been a good starter, either.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered the first day of first grade. I behaved myself
until tragedy announced itself at lunchtime when I noticed that my
Partridge Family lunch box was gone. I was frantic, I had nothing
to eat, I would be hungry. Hungry. HUNGRY. I thought, the teacher
can help me, maybe I can share a lunch with someone, so I tapped on
her arm, managed to utter the words ``I forgot . . .'' and then
vomited all over her shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing I knew I was lying down in the back seat of our
station wagon after the principal called my mom to come pick me up.
</P>
<P>
   By third grade, we had moved to Arizona and I had the chance to
start over again in a new school. We were walking single file to
recess and I was just about to make a new friend when a metal
telephone pole struck me in the head, knocking me to the ground.
The whole class saw my Wednesday underwear with the tear at the
waistband when my dress flew up. This time, my mom got there pretty
fast. After she dropped me off for school that morning, she just
sat in the car and waited in the parking lot. That year, the kids
were old enough to group together and identify me as a scapegoat,
known as the ``Dirty Panty Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   When I transferred to junior high, I already had a major crush
on a Mike Smithfield from my sixth-grade class and had waited all
summer to see him. I spotted him at the trash can in the cafeteria
and rushed over to say hi. He nodded, smiled slightly, and I
gawked.
</P>
<P>
   A tense, long moment passed before he said suddenly, ``Um, want
this Snoball?'' and pointed to the pink, coconut-flecked mound that
teetered on the edge of the tray.
</P>
<P>
   I nodded back, taking it. Knowing that this Snoball gift was a
sure sign of tender affection, I sucked up all of my courage in one
deep breath and said, ``Wanna go with me to the dance on Friday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said simply, but I didn't believe him. I followed him
all the way to his P.E. class at the gym, asking, ``Why? Why won't
you go with me? Why?'' until we hit the baseball field and he just
started running. He ran the entire length of the field, constantly
looking cover his shoulder to see if I was still chasing him. I
stood there for a long time, understanding that Snoballs didn't
always mean love, until Patti Herman, the first girl who smoked at
our school, walked by me and said, ``Hey! Do you think your pants
are tight enough?'' It was she who invented my junior high name,
``Whorie Laurie.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing prepared me for the horror of the first day of eighth
grade. While in choir class, I let a tough girl whom I wanted to be
friends with look in my clutch purse for gum. Instead of finding
Bubble Yum, she emerged clutching my toothbrush (a much-needed tool
since I had just gotten braces) with a massive maxi pad stuck to it
and proceeded to run around the classroom, holding it like a flag
above her head, shouting, ``Guess who has her period! Guess who has
her period!'' I dropped the class the first time she shouted,
``Hey! Kotex Kid! Can I borrow some Midol?''
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't much better in high school. As a new sophomore, I
was adoringly watching Jim Kroeger, a senior, play basketball in
the gym when he called my name for the first time. I turned around
and flashed my biggest, brightest, metal-clad, buck-toothed smile
just in time for him to bounce the basketball right off my head. I
got up, still smiling, and smiled all the way to the nurse, who
looked at the round, patterned welt on my forehead and asked me if
I had walked into a telephone pole. My nickname that year was,
naturally, ``Backboard.''
</P>
<P>
   It's OK, though. In my senior year, Jim Kroeger got Patti Herman
pregnant, married her and then had to get a job cooking hot dogs at
Orange Julius in the foot court at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   And a couple of years ago, I saw Mike Smithfield at Safeway as
he bagged my groceries. ``I want those in a separate bag,'' I said,
interrupting him as he talked about our school days. ``Those need
to be protected. You just can't toss around Snoballs like they were
nothing, you know. They're tender.''
</P>
<P>
   As I watched the little kid shuffle past my house far behind the
pack of other kids on the first day of school, I wondered what was
going to happen to him that day. I decided to give him some
assurance, based on my experience, that everything would eventually
be OK, and went out to the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' I said as he neared the edge of my yard, ``all the
kids that pick on you in school will try to sell you insurance when
you grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   He just looked at me. ``Are you trying to abduct me?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I stuttered. ``You just looked so sad, I was trying to .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind your own business, lady,'' he shot back. ``Don't you have
enough problems of your own?''
</P>
<P>
   He started to walk off, took a few steps and then stopped and
turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``FREAK!'' he yelled as loud as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should've started off by offering him a Snoball. &QL;

THE SOUNDS OF MUSIC: WHOOSH, BUZZ, CLICK ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in ``Modulations,'' a sprawling, informative documentary
survey of electronic music, one of dozens of talking heads compares
its invention to the splitting of the atom. The cutting up and
reassembling of sound, he suggests, is the sonic equivalent of
rearranging matter.
</P>
<P>
   Another pundit goes further by declaring that all sound modified
by an electronic device, be it a microphone, a radio or a
phonograph, is in fact electronic music.
</P>
<P>
   Such intriguing concepts, many of them offered by nightclub disk
jockeys, remixers and turntable virtuosos, fly around
``Modulations,'' which was directed by Iara Lee, the Brazilian
filmmaker responsible for ``Synthetic Pleasures,'' a much talked
about study of artificial landscapes. The movie opens Friday in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of electronic music presented by ``Modulations''
focuses more on its pop manifestations than on its ``classical''
side, although the composers Karlheinz Stockhausen (who observes
that there is ``no absolute silence in the world'') and John Cage
are heard from.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie winds its circuitous way through a jungle of beats,
clicks, buzzes, whooshes and scratches, it offers an informal but
densely packed technological history of electronic sounds and
styles.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques of cutting and pasting sounds that are now done
digitally predate the digital age. The producer Teo Macero, who
worked extensively with Miles Davis, remembers assembling and
editing sounds in the studio by laboriously snipping and
reattaching fragments of audio tape.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Moog, who invented one of the most popular synthesizers,
discusses the dual uses of the instrument as an imitator of
acoustic instruments and as a generator of brand-new sounds. He
says he never intended the synthesizers to be used as an orchestral
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Due respect is paid to Giorgio Moroder, the disco producer whose
groundbreaking hit for Donna Summer, ``I Feel Love,'' was almost
entirely electronic, except for the voice and a bass drum.
</P>
<P>
   The German group Kraftwerk is also frequently mentioned as
having paved the way for electronic dance music with its hugely
influential 1977 album ``Trans-Europe Express.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of more recent electronically oriented dance
styles, like ``house''and its derivatives, is remembered by the
producers and disk jockeys in Chicago, Detroit and London who
invented and promoted them. We learn, among other things, how the
sound known as ``acid house'' evolved from a piece of outdated
equipment that produced a particular sound effect, a spiraling
buzz, that came to define the style.
</P>
<P>
   Others talk about the intimate relationship between drugs and
electronics in nightclub dance music, and the systematic
disorientation that various combinations of drugs and sounds can
induce.
</P>
<P>
   One observer says that an ominous, despairing, subgenre of dance
music was developed to express the negative feelings experienced by
a group of clubgoers who were long-term abusers of the drug
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   And what is the optimum pulse for keeping the patrons of a dance
club on their feet all night long? ``Modulations'' tells us it is
133 beats per minute. Anything faster tends to exhaust people.
</P>
<P>
   As informative as it is, ``Modulations'' isn't terribly well
organized. And when it tries to find trippy visual equivalents for
the weird sounds and beats, it comes up short.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite its shortcomings, ``Modulations'' is an
invaluable primer that begins to make sense of a rapidly changing
sonic world that in many people's minds is only a grating,
intimidating jumble of unwelcome noise. &QL;
</P>

   &UR; The Allure Of Grandparents &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Michael Douglas says he doesn't quite understand all
those newspaper and magazine stories about the spate of summer
movies in which an older man romances a younger woman. What's so
unusual? he asked. ``It must have been a slow Monica week,'' he
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas was speaking over his car phone the other afternoon as
he drove from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara. Yes, the 53-year-old
star was married to 25-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow in ``A Perfect
Murder.'' Just as Jack Nicholson, 61, teamed up with Helen Hunt,
35, in ``As Good as It Gets.'' And Warren Beatty, 61, became
entranced with 31-year-old Halle Berry in ``Bulworth.'' And there
was Robert Redford, 61, and Kristin Scott Thomas, 38, in ``The
Horse Whisperer.'' And the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Douglas, while ostensibly shrugging off Hollywood's
older-man, younger-woman syndrome, has quietly decided to play a
role that seems not only appropriate but a little gutsy, too,
especially for an actor who has specialized in 40-something macho
parts. Douglas is playing a grandfather _ yes, a grandfather _ in a
forthcoming project called ``Still Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, to be made next year by Universal Pictures, is to star
Douglas and Meryl Streep as an unhappily married couple who end a
30-year-marriage just before their daughter and son-in-law die in a
plane crash. Seeking to bring up their young grandchildren and deal
with the tragedy, the couple reunite, tentatively at first, and
rekindle their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a script that moved me,'' said Douglas, referring to
the screenplay by Andrea King, a former journalist for The
Hollywood Reporter. Douglas, who is also producing the film, said
he was not especially aware that the role was a risky one. ``I'm
not conscious of that,'' he said. ``I go with my heart and do
things I like to do. I've never been one to carefully calculate my
career decisions, to sit on the outside looking in. I go with my
passion and what moves me.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Ms. Streep was another incentive to play a
grandparent. ``I've been looking forward to working with Meryl for
a long time,'' he said. ``And if it doesn't bother Meryl to play a
grandparent, it doesn't bother me.'' ( Douglas is hardly tottering
in the film: he plays a charmer who has a brief affair with a
beautiful young woman.) The film is to be directed by Mimi Leder
(``Deep Impact'').
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King said she had the idea for the screenplay while she was
driving one day and saw an older couple crossing the street with
their two grandchildren between them. ``I thought, `Wouldn't it be
interesting to write a movie about that: grandparents having to be
parents again,''' she said. After handing the script to her agent,
she jotted down a list of actors and actresses who would be ideal
for the top roles. She circled the top two names: Douglas and Ms.
Streep. But Ms. King was concerned that stars would shun the roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped the parts were good enough and the story compelling
enough, that it would override their initial fears about playing
the parts,'' Ms. King said. Of Douglas and Ms. Streep taking their
roles, she added: ``That's a very personal transition that actors
have to make. And it takes a very strong belief in oneself and
one's talent to know that they can play parts like these and still
be sexy movie stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the film, Douglas and Ms. Streep are hardly going to
focus on older roles. Douglas, with a laugh, offered no apologies
for his role as a scheming businessman with a very young wife in
``A Perfect Murder.'' ``She was supposed to be a trophy bride,'' he
said. ``And I thought Gwyneth and I looked pretty good, didn't
we?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alphabet City Success &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tamara Jenkins, the writer-director of the comedy-drama ``Slums
of Beverly Hills,'' is not celebrating her success by buying a home
in Bel Air. Far from it. She just moved from a tenement on Avenue B
in the East Village to a larger two-bedroom apartment on Avenue A.
``The trouble is it's the loudest apartment in Manhattan: it's like
a boardwalk,'' Ms. Jenkins said. ``I call people and they say,
`What pay phone are you calling from?' It's my apartment! I can't
wait for the winter to shut my windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she's funny and irreverent, her quasi-autobiographical
film about a teen-age girl living with her brothers and father in a
series of cheap apartments in Beverly Hills in the 1970s is, in
many ways, quite touching and sweet-natured. The film, made by Fox
Searchlight Pictures, stars Natasha Lyonne as the adolescent and
Alan Arkin as her father. In real-life Ms. Jenkins and her three
brothers _ there are only two in the film _ were brought up mostly
by their father, Manny Jenkins, who was a car salesman with a
gambling problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Ms. Jenkins said, the unfancy parts of Beverly
Hills were filled with what she called ``the nomads of divorce
living on the fringes, hoping for the good life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like the Jewish Joads,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jenkins, who is 35, wrote her film, which cost less than $5
million, with the help of a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Sundance
Institute Screenwriting and Filmmakers lab. (Robert Redford, who
founded Sundance, is the film's executive producer.) Ms. Jenkins
had won prizes for a short film at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival
and at the New York University Graduate Film School.

   nn
</P>
<P>
   The success of her film _ it has opened strongly in New York and
Los Angeles to generally good reviews and expanded around the
nation last week _ has not quite gone to Ms. Jenkins' head. As a
result of the movie, she has an agent at International Creative
Management. Scripts are arriving by messenger at her Avenue A
apartment, although most of them are not very good, she said. So
Ms. Jenkins is planning to start writing another movie.
</P>
<P>
   She has no plans to move back to Los Angeles. ``As soon as I
finished the film I got the first flight back to New York,'' Ms.
Jenkins said. ``My relationship to L.A. is very complicated. It's
filled with the ghosts of childhood. And the world of Hollywood _
which I didn't know as a kid _ is very confusing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jenkins, who spoke over the phone from New York, said a
fallout of the film is that producers want to meet her. The
writer-director said she was heading out the door to meet one of
them in a midtown restaurant. ``You get the word, `He looks like
this, and he'll be wearing this and that,''' she said. ``It's like
a strange blind date.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sophie's Choices &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Marceau is not especially well known in the United
States, but her career here seems poised on a rapid take-off. Mel
Gibson's ``Braveheart'' introduced the French star to English
language audiences, and this was followed by the Bernard Rose film
adaptation of ``Anna Karenina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know why you get roles or don't get roles,'' she
said. ``It's very mysterious.''
</P>
<P>
   Her newest released film, ``Firelight,'' a romantic drama set in
the 1800s, directed and written by William Nicholson, opens on
Friday. In the film, Ms. Marceau plays a beautiful and enigmatic
governess who bears the child of an English landowner. But this is
only one of several Marceau films that will be seen over the next
year. She recently completed a slapstick comedy, ``Lost and
Found,'' with David Spade, as well as a turn-of-the-century
``Midsummer's Night Dream,'' with, among others, Kevin Kline,
Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett. ``I was so proud:
Shakespeare! In English,'' she said with a laugh of the Michael
Hoffman film to be released in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marceau has been a French star since she was a teen-ager,
but it was only recently that the American market opened up to an
actress who has exquisite looks, speaks English perfectly and _
unlike many American stars _ doesn't seem to take herself very
seriously. Most of the time she lives in Warsaw with her husband,
Andrzej Zulawski, a writer-director, and their 3-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband got sick of France and decided to go home so I have
one foot in Paris, one foot in Warsaw,'' she said. ``Most of the
time I don't know where I am.'' She's also considering a move to
Los Angeles. ``I cannot imagine staying in Poland forever, America
forever or France forever,'' she said. ``Nothing is forever.
Jumping is what I like.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, she's entranced with Americans. ``I like
Americans,'' she said. ``I like their politeness. They're very
social, very friendly. I don't know if this is superficial or not
but it makes every day life so much easier. I just wish they had
seasons in Los Angeles. I miss seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marceau has been a French star since she was 13 and made her
debut in the box-office hit ``La Boum'' (1980). Two years later,
``La Boum II'' bought her the French equivalent of an Oscar for
``most promising newcomer.'' She also made three films with her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marceau said she had few illusions about her career. ``In
America, I don't know what my future is,'' she said. ``I'm not the
one to decide, am I? There's a system in Hollywood. You have to be
lucky. You have to be there at the right moment. Sometimes it
happens. Sometimes it doesn't. Do American audiences and studios
need me? I don't know. I would like to believe they do.'' She
laughed. ``So far I've been very lucky.''

NET-WISE CONSUMERS CONFRONT BLUEJEANS THAT HURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In various languages around the world, there they are: Levi
Strauss jeans in bright store-fresh blue, unfaded and
unstonewashed, stiff as boards and already cuffed, appearing in TV
commercials with a promise that if you fall the rock-hard denim
won't scuff as soon as your knee will.
</P>
<P>
   In a note of hyperbole, one spot suggests you can saw a board
with a Hard Jeans leg, assuming you want to play carpenter with
your pants off.
</P>
<P>
   What gives, Mr. Strauss?
</P>
<P>
   ``What have we come to when the major selling point of a product
is how (ital) uncomfortable (unital) it is?'' asks a contributor to
an ad-savvy Usenet newsgroup, alt.tv.commercials. The forum members
had various theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads promise that thes jeans are coarse enough to scrape
your skin,'' someone noted, ``then advocate that you wear them
without underwear, presumably to show how macho you are. I figure
Levis screwed up a few million jeans, inadvertently turning them
coarse and rigid, then some ad genius conceived this campaign as a
way to unload them.''
</P>
<P>
   The legendary jeans makers had no quick answer from a recent
enquiry to their e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet user said, ``I had a similar theory, that their
aging-fading process was either too slow or too expensive, so why
not market the `un-aged.' I wonder what it is like to be a fad
maker.''
</P>
<P>
   Fad maker? Users don't have to be very old to recall when all
jeans were cobalt blue and stiff as lumber, so you walked like you
were wearing downspouts. New jeans meant two terrible things:
Back-to-school, or company coming. Only corduroy pants carried a
worse cachet than new, stiff jeans.
</P>
<P>
   And the cuffs were part of the new-boy image, a sign that you
were still growing, which no kid wanted to be if it meant more of
those bruising cheek-pinches from the visiting Aunt Tilly. Cuffs
were also where you carried the two scoops of dirt that emptied
onto Mom's floor at bedtime in revenge.
</P>
<P>
   There was no fad about those jeans. You couldn't wait to put
them through the wash a few times and soften them up, and see them
hang on the line outside and fade. In the retro-fashionable '60s
and '70s the teen magazines were full of bathtub formulae for
quick-aging the beasts, the better to denerdify oneself.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hard Jeans) remind me of jeans from the '50s,'' another
alt.tv.commercials contributor said. ``The best thing that ever
happened to jeans was when they finally wore in. Why would anyone
want to go back?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Spin &AMP; Marty series on the Mickey Mouse Club
(circa 1954)?'' someone else added. ``Remember the episode when
they broke in the new jeans by soaking them, tying them in knots,
beating them on the ground, and dragging them behind a horse?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what Strauss has in mind. Return to the thrilling
days of yesteryear, with weekly burr haircuts, Davy Crockett
coonskin hats and shirts buttoned all the way to the neck. Are '90s
parents supposed to be saying, ``Here, kids, suffer like I did?''
</P>
<P>
   If so, look for wire-bristle toothbrushes to flash into fashion.
Corsets with barbed-wire turnbuckles. Sunglasses with contracting
nose bridges that cut off your breathing and raise welts.
</P>
<P>
   And how about some charmingly leaky fountain pens that gradually
brightened those choir robes during the long sermons?
</P>
<P>
   In these days of $50,000 utility vehicles that never leave
pavement and $125 designer jeans for the club set (can't wait to
see Heidi Fleiss model No Excuses when her sentence is up), why
offer Hard Jeans? Does Detroit sell halftracks? Do soapmakers
promote zits? Will discount airlines offer crate class? Well OK,
the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are playing on the nerd thing,'' another
contributor suggested. ``Just like everything else you wore when
you were a kid ... You felt like some nerdy kid until your
sneakers/baseball glove/jeans/haircut/etc. wore in. Maybe they are
going for the nostalgia thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia, oh yeah. It must have started that day at the
designers' lunch table in the Levis cafeteria when the crewcut kid
tried to trade away the raisins in his Johnny Mack Brown lunchbox
and the kid in the hightop Keds said, ``You guys'll have to jog
without me today. Mom starched my Jockeys again!''
</P>
<P>
   And at the next bench the harried marketing people overheard,
and brightened....

 &HT;    CALIFORNIA HAS TOP HISPANIC AND ASIAN GROWTH
 &HT;    300&AMP;add. With CENSUS-DATA.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California led the nation in the growth of state
Hispanic and Asian-American populations since 1990, while Florida
had the largest black population increase, the U.S. Census Bureau
reported Friday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   California saw an increase of 2.2 million Hispanics and nearly
830,000 Asian and Pacific Islanders between 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's black population increased by 480,255 people between
1990 and 1997, a 27.1 percent gain. That was twice as fast as the
state's total population growth of 13.3 percent, to 14.6 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, New York had the largest black population with 3.2
million, while California had the largest Hispanic population, 9.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia had the highest percentage (63 percent)
of black residents among state or state equivalents, while New
Mexico had the highest percentage (40 percent) of Hispanic
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Among counties, Harris County (Houston), Texas, gained the most
black residents, 73,293, while Los Angeles County, California,
gained the most Hispanic residents, 649,404.
</P>
<P>
   Cook County, Illinois, had the largest black population among
counties at 1.4 million, while Los Angeles County had the most
Hispanics, 4.0 million.
</P>
<P>
   The county with the highest proportion of black residents was
Jefferson County, Miss., with 87 percent, while Starr County,
Texas, had the highest share of Hispanics, 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Census Bureau report is based on population
estimates, said Larry Sink, a bureau statistician who compiled the
report. The estimates factor in birth and death statistics and are
cross-referenced with racial data supplied by the Social Security
Administration and migration data supplied by the Internal Revenue
Service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Stan Smith, director of the University of Florida's bureau of
economic and business research, attributed the increase in
Florida's black population to several factors, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The state's overall rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A higher birth rate among the black population than the white
population.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Social, political and economic changes that have made the
South in general a more attractive place for blacks to live than in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks are increasingly in the migration stream (to Florida),
whereas 40 or 50 years ago _ or even 30 years ago _ they were not
well represented,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the increase in Florida's black population could
be attributed to immigration from the Caribbean particularly Haiti,
Jamaica and the Dominican Republic the Census Bureau's Silk said
the great majority of new black residents to the state come from
elsewhere in the United States.

HOPE DAVIS HAS KNACK FOR PICKING MOVIE WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
 DAVIS-MOVIE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA MORRISON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Hope Davis is a gold-star member of the indie posse.
Like actors Campbell Scott, Julianne Moore, Parker Posey and
Stanley Tucci, she keeps turning up in the kind of low-budget,
high-quality movies that tend to burst out of nowhere to acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest is ``Next Stop Wonderland,'' which got snapped up for
distribution by the formidable Miramax Films at this year's
Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' and her gang's credits sound somewhat incestuous. Davis
got her first starring role in 1996's ``The Daytrippers,'' where
she worked with Posey, Scott and Tucci. She shows up next in the
upcoming ``The Imposters,'' which Tucci directs and in which she
co-stars with Scott. She was in last year's ``The Myth of
Fingerprints'' with Moore _ who, as it happens, was originally
supposed to be in ``Big Night,'' co-directed by Tucci and Scott,
but had to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cast your pals,'' Davis said from her suite in Phoenix's
Royal Palms Inn. ``All those people I know well. . . . They are
very intellectual people who live in New York and like certain
types of art and certain types of expression, and they tend to end
up doing stuff that's labeled indie, and then everyone gets to know
one other.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was in Phoenix to promote her latest indie project, Brad
Anderson's ``Next Stop Wonderland'' (and to hit the Barney's outlet
in New River, Ariz., with her best friend, a doctor at Scottsdale's
Mayo Clinic).
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a bossa nova-inflected love story in which Davis'
character, Erin Castleton, a wry and lovelorn nurse, meets up with
a series of Boston jerks via the personal ads. Meanwhile, she keeps
narrowly missing meeting Alan Monteiro (Alan Gelfant), the guy
obviously meant for her.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's association with ``Next Stop Wonderland'' ensures it
wide distribution and the imprimatur of accessible artsiness by the
same company that brought you ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``The English
Patient.'' Like ``Daytrippers'' and ``The Myth of Fingerprints,''
two of Davis' other starring turns, ``Next Stop Wonderland'' is one
of a handful of independent movies that escape obscurity every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has just been lucky that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how a career goes: Some of it is intentional, most of
is not,'' she says. ``Most of it is what comes to you.
``Daytrippers'' was the first time that I had been offered the lead
in anything. . . . All the others came about because of
``Daytrippers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytrippers,'' directed by Greg Mattola, is about a bickering
Long Island family that bundles into its station wagon for a trip
into Manhattan when Davis' character suspects her husband of
infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is not long for the rarefied indie world. Like her
counterpart Moore, who's alternated blockbuster studio films such
as Steven Spielberg's ``The Lost World'' with independents, Davis
has made two studio movies in the past six months: the political
thriller ``Arlington Road,'' with Jeff Bridges, and ``Mumford,''
the latest ensemble piece by ``Big Chill'' director Lawrence
Kasdan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (they) are of the quality Stanley would approve of,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her poised-over-the-mainstream status, Davis looks much
more like an East Coast habitue than a Hollywood starlet. She's
wearing a plain gray skirt, blue blouse and red Miu Miu loafers.
Her flowing blond hair has been cropped to her chin for a recent
``Vogue'' photography session. She lives in New York (her loft was
a set in ``Daytrippers'') and grew up in Tenafly, N.J., across the
street from Mira Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   Davis started her professional career in Chicago, waitressing
until acting started paying the bills. After small parts in
Chicago-filmed movies such as ``Flatliners'' and ``Home Alone,''
she felt ready for New York. There she hooked up with playwright
Nicky Silver, starring in his plays ``The Food Chain'' and
``Pterodactyls,'' which he wrote for her. She continues to act
onstage, appearing with Kevin Kline in Chekhov's ``Ivanov'' last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Independent films, typically made on small budgets by novice
filmmakers, are a crapshoot. Davis beat the odds by making a series
of good ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's actors who always say there's this danger that the
films that you're having a really great time on . . . end up
bombing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a great time on ``Next Stop Wonderland.'' I was
alone in most of the shooting. I was often shot walking around by
myself, in my house by myself,'' says Davis, who was going through
a divorce at the time. ``It was very lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   She said director/co-writer Anderson, whose debut film was
1996's ``The Darien Gap,'' favored an improvisational approach that
left her uncertain about how the film would ultimately turn out.
</P>
<P>
   The movies she likes to watch are likewise a mix of studio and
independent features. Her favorite films this summer: ``Bulworth''
and ``Buffalo 66.'' She counts ``Lethal Weapon 4'' as a guilty
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Period romances are her favorite. ``I'm a chick,'' she says. ``I
waited and waited for ``The English Patient'' to come.''
</P>
<P>
   At the video store, she catches up on the work of her favorite
actresses: Meryl Streep, Judy Davis, Jennifer Jason Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   And when she has time off from making films, she reads. ``Let's
see, the last thing I finished was the John Irving book ``A Widow
for a Year,'' which was really great. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate seeing movies of books that I have loved. ``English
Patient'' ended up disappointing me because I loved the book so
much. ``Howards End'' was a tremendous disappointment, even though
it's a very beautiful film, because the novel is so much more
complicated.'' She hates the fact that every good book that comes
out now is immediately optioned for a script.
</P>
<P>
   She said she wants to continue combining theater and independent
films with better-paying studio efforts. Although she got her
cinematic breakthrough roles in independent films, she's not a snob
about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tons of garbagy independent films being made,'' she
said. ``I get sent scripts for the most bizarre things:

BARE FISTS NO MATCH FOR SHARP CLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two villains to hate in ``Like It Is,'' and one is
Roger Daltry, who looks fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   Daltrey plays Kelvin, a well-groomed gay recording-company mogul
with a cynical attitude toward love; regular collagen-injection
appointments; an attraction to boys ``who can't count past 10,''
and no redeeming personality traits whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Like It Is,'' which opens Friday in New York City, is not
Kelvin's story. It's a pleasant but unexceptional romance about two
younger, much nicer Englishmen.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning there is Craig (Steve Bell), a very young man
hanging out on the streets of Blackpool, England, looking
sensitive, baby-faced and ripe for picking. And there is Matt (Ian
Rose), a blond, still-young, more worldly sort, a music promoter
visiting from London.
</P>
<P>
   They meet outside a noisy club and after a courtship ritual
consisting of a cigarette, the question ``You want to come back
then?,'' a little music and the question ``Do you want to go up?''
the two go to bed. It is quickly apparent that Craig is a little
conflicted about his sexuality. Luckily he soon gets over this and
turns up in London.
</P>
<P>
   Matt is glad to see him, but others are not. Enter the second
villain: Matt's roommate, Paula (Dani Behr, a British television
host), a beautiful but hard blonde singer who doesn't seem to have
got the message that gay men don't like sleeping with women.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe it's only attention that Paula wants from Matt.
Whatever the case, Craig's arrival has upset their cozy
arrangement. And Paula really needs Matt right now, what with a
tabloid newspaper having just revealed her true age and her record
company asking for 12 new songs for the next album.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's only means of support has been boxing in illegal
bare-knuckles fights back in Blackpool, so when Kelvin (who is
Matt's boss) offers him a job driving his musician clients here and
there, he's thrilled. But the job takes him out of town, and hey,
this is the intoxicating world of cocaine, loud music and expensive
parties. Things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin pretty much pushes Craig into the arms of another man (if
only for a one-night stand). Matt cheats, too, or tries to. Paula
doesn't give Matt his telephone messages from Craig. In a heated
moment, Craig calls Paula a ``stuck-up cow'' to her face.
</P>
<P>
   What will prevail, the fast life or true love? And what's really
more brutal and bloody _ bare-knuckle fighting in alleys or the
music business in London?
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Bell do fine jobs as the lovers, and Ms. Behr is
convincingly arrogant and needy. And through it all, Daltrey, now
almost 30 years from his heyday as lead singer of the Who, is
appealingly devilish. At certain angles, however, he is beginning
to bear a mysterious resemblance to Joe Namath. It's probably just
the lighting. &QL;

MUSEUMS BUILT ON THE PASSION TO COLLECT . . . ANYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Hugh Francis Hicks is a 76-year-old dentist in downtown
Baltimore, with an office on the parlor floor of an old brownstone
diagonally across the street from the Walters Art Gallery. The
other day, he took me into the building's basement to show me a
collection he has been putting together for nearly 70 years. Hicks
collects light bulbs. He has 60,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   You probably won't be surprised to learn that this is the
largest collection of light bulbs in the world. Hicks has
officially turned it into a museum, the Mount Vernon Museum of
Incandescent Lighting. It contains the world's biggest bulb (at
50,000 watts and 4 feet high, it's about the size of a shrub) and
also the smallest, which you see only by looking through a
microscope. A pair of Edison's earliest experimental bulbs are
here, with their original Bristol-board filaments. One of them
works.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bulbs are more or less decoratively arranged in old
glass-and-wood cases, like the ones that turn-of-the-century
museums used to have, the cases containing typewritten labels
explaining, for example, the source of the name Mazda (a
Zoroastrian sun god) and the history of tungsten filaments. A kind
of rabbit warren, the basement includes a room with a big round
table where Hicks serves soda and cookies to visiting
schoolchildren. His museum is open on Thursdays or by appointment.
I phoned ahead. He met me in his office, then turned on the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Why do people collect? I spent a few days poking around unusual
museums and other places, wondering about that. I visited a museum
of trash and the basement of a teetotaler in New Jersey who owns
several thousand miniature liquor bottles and several dozen
miniature Vargas pinups from old cigarette packs. (He doesn't
smoke, either.)
</P>
<P>
   I visited the Nicholas Roerich Museum on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, a shrine to a once-famous Russian mystic or charlatan,
depending on which accounts of him you read. The museum owns a
collection of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   It is taken for granted that art is worth collecting, but
collectors collect pretty much everything, without necessarily
thinking that what they collect has esthetic or monetary value.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Walter Benjamin, who collected books, explained that
``one of the finest memories of a collector is the moment when he
rescued a book to which he might never have given a thought, much
less a wishful look, because he found it lonely and abandoned on
the marketplace and bought it to give it its freedom _ the way the
prince bought a beautiful slave girl in `The Arabian Nights.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``To a book collector, you see, the true freedom of
all books is somewhere on his shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Or on public view, through the collector's benefaction.
Sometimes collectors make museums, maybe because they are
exhibitionists or have a sense of civic responsibility or both, and
these museums can have a fascination that is often
indistinguishable from that of art museums.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean that light bulbs are as compelling as paintings to
look at. I mean that the modern museum, whether it is a collection
of art or oddments, derives partly from the old Kunst- und
Wunderkammern, or art- and wonder-cabinets, and it retains its
original aspirations to wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   Kunst- und Wunderkammern began to proliferate, more or less, in
the 16th century, the result of humanist curiosity, technological
advances in things like optics and engineering, a revival of
interest in antique texts that were preoccupied with the marvelous,
and global exploration, which exposed Europe to what seemed like a
strange new world.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderment came to be perceived as a kind of middle state
between ignorance and knowledge, and wonder cabinets were theaters
of the marvelous, museums of accumulated curiosities, proving God's
ingenuity. They contained whatever was the biggest, the smallest,
the rarest, the most exquisite, the most bizarre, the most
grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   Art, astrolabes, armor _ man-made wonders _ were cheek by jowl
with monkeys' teeth and pathological anomalies like human horns. A
German doctor named Lorenz Hoffman had a typical Kunst- und
Wunderkammer: he owned paintings by Duerer and Cranach, a skeleton
of a newborn, two dozen miniature spoons hidden within a cherry
pit, an armband made of elks' hoofs, mummies and various rare
musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Frederik Ruysch, a Dutch anatomist, concocted wild tableaux made
of flowers, skulls, kidney stones and diseased organs in his
Wunderkammer in Amsterdam. And one of the first museums in the
United States belonged to the Philadelphia artist Charles Willson
Peale. It contained fossils and stuffed birds as well as paintings.
</P>
<P>
   I happened to be talking with a friend about wonder cabinets
while driving to Hicks' when I noticed a sign on the highway for a
decoy museum in Havre de Grace, Md. Havre de Grace is a sleepy
place on the Susquehanna Flats, where the Susquehanna River meets
Chesapeake Bay. It was duck hunter's nirvana until a series of laws
during the 1930s and '40s curtailed hunting. The Decoy Museum, I
discovered, preserves hundreds of duck decoys by local carvers.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, the carvers are also preserved, in life-size,
full-length polyvinylacetate figures, like decoys of the decoy
makers. There's a big tableau, for example, which lights up when
you press a button, a la Madame Tussaud's, showing a bunch of the
local carvers sitting around a stove in one of the town's decoy
shops in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't always tell the difference between the works of R.
Madison Mitchell, a local funeral director, who was, I gather, the
Giotto of Havre de Grace, and the works of Bob McGaw Jr., who
perfected a way of decorating his decoys that is called scratch
painting. But no doubt the distinctions are obvious to the people
who have looked at the decoys a lot longer than I did.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurship, after all, is about making distinctions through
slow, comparative observation, whether it involves paintings or
wooden ducks. Partly it was a desire for a more methodical approach
to collected objects that ushered in a new age of museums two
centuries ago. Museums began to specialize. The balance tipped from
delight toward instruction. The new museums set out to categorize
things, to create order out of the world, or at least to imply that
there is an order. Descartes said that too much wonder can
``pervert the use of reason.'' This was the age of Descartes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of the wonder cabinets never altogether died. Art
museums today, even collections of light bulbs, though they clearly
are not true wonder cabinets, can trace their origins to them:
their function is still to preserve what's marvelous, to show us
what is rare that we can't see otherwise, or at least to make us
see, with heightened curiosity, what is around us.
</P>
<P>
   I came across a reference in a book by Lawrence Weschler, ``
Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder,'' to a place called the Muetter Museum
in Philadelphia, and I decided to look it up. Thomas Dent Muetter,
it turns out, was a Philadelphia surgeon who went to Paris in the
1830s, when it was the medical Mecca. There he saw hospital wards
arranged according to diseases, so that doctors could compare the
conditions of patients suffering from the same things; he saw
collections of tumors, aneurysms, bones and so on. He returned to
Philadelphia inspired by the systematic connection of morbid
anatomy and clinical pathology. Soon he began to build his own
teaching collection of anatomical and pathological specimens for
the benefit of medical students.
</P>
<P>
   He accumulated hundreds of things: air-dried specimens,
specimens preserved in alcohol, plaster casts, papier-mache models,
watercolors and oil paintings, all of which he bequeathed in 1858
to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   I found the museum within a big Georgian building behind a tall
iron gate in the center of the city. It is a two-story calculated
anachronism of polished wood cases, thick burgundy curtains and
brass lamps, and from time to time it organizes shows of topical
interest to keep itself alive and kicking.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the museum had thousands of things on view,
mundane and otherwise. But in recent years it streamlined its
display, somewhat skewing the public's perception of the collection
by showing only what's most striking or unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown over time, the collection has come to include
extraordinary examples of disease and trauma like the connected
livers of the Siamese twins Chang and Eng; a tumor removed from the
jaw of President Grover Cleveland; the skeletons of a 7-foot-6-inch
man and of a 3-foot-6-inch woman; a bound foot from China; the
remains of the so-called Soap Lady, whose corpse decomposed into a
soapy substance called adipocere, and an entire cabinet of more
than 2,000 objects removed from the throats of choking patients,
the objects carefully arranged in narrow drawers according to type:
meat, nuts, pins, buttons.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the college, which oversees the museum, has lately
become a little squeamish about the sensational aspect of its own
collection. For several years, photographers like Joel-Peter Witkin
and the team of Gwen Akin and Allan Ludwig used specimens for
pictures that the Muetter published as wall calendars, until it was
decided, evidently, that less spectacular calendars would convey a
tamer and more sober institutional image.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. I couldn't help seeing much of what was on view in
relation to art: to Gericault's great paintings of severed limbs,
to Kiki Smith's sculptures of flayed figures, to Nayland Blake's
and Damien Hirst's arrangements of medical instruments and, in the
case of the Soap Lady, her mouth wide open, to Zoran Music's
screaming figures. A dried skeleton of a newborn child, hanging by
its outstretched arms, head back (crucifixion pose), even made me
think of Chardin's famous painting of a ray hanging from a hook,
its eyes upturned, as if in a state of spiritual ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to push the connection too far, only to stress how
a place like the Muetter, notwithstanding its serious medical
function, seems neatly to blur the distinction between science and
art by dwelling in the marvelous. Its collection causes us to react
in a way that goes beyond reason and touches our nerves, which is
precisely what art should do.
</P>
<P>
   Was Muetter motivated merely by scientific inquiry? Maybe he
was, but many collections suggest a kind of obsession on the part
of the collector that exceeds practicality. A Manhattan
psychoanalyst, Werner Muensterberger, wrote a book not long ago
called ``Collecting: An Unruly Passion,'' in which he argued that
collecting is, among other things, more or less a form of displaced
childhood longing for parental comfort, the collected objects
becoming, like sucked thumbs, stand-ins for a mother's breast.
</P>
<P>
   I am not a collector. I can't say. Hicks, the light bulb man,
told me that about a dozen years ago two psychiatrists and three
psychologists from Johns Hopkins University came by. ``They were
something,'' he said. ``They didn't blink their eyes. They were
interviewing collectors from all over the world. After spending $4
million, they concluded that collectors collect for the fascination
of an object and for no other reason. Heck, I would have told them
that for $1 million.''

SPORTY MAZDA MARKS 10 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Has it really been 10 years since the Mazda Miata
single-handedly reignited America's enthusiasm for lightweight
roadsters, years after the British had packed up their little
sports cars and gone home?
</P>
<P>
   When the Miata appeared on the scene in 1989, it caused an
absolute frenzy of retro longing, especially among those boomers
who still regretted selling off their MGs, Triumphs and Alfa Romeos
many moons ago. Like today's mania for the New Beetle, Miata was so
sought after that it commanded premium prices far above list.
</P>
<P>
   That list price has moved up a bit, and the frenzy has died
down, but Miata remains a singular expression of sports-car virtue.
Others have tried but missed the mark.
</P>
<P>
   A recent flurry of German roadsters from BMW, Porsche and
Mercedes-Benz may eclipse the Miata in performance, but they cost
twice as much. And they probably wouldn't exist if Miata had not
paved the way.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hot-selling MGB of the '60s, the Miata is moderately
priced, fun to drive and imbued with the same magical charm that
turns any back road into a romp. Of course, I'm somewhat partial to
MGBs, especially the red one in my garage.
</P>
<P>
   A free-revving four-banger hooked to a quick-shift five-speed;
fast, precise steering and agile handling; and that undefinable
feeling of contentment that comes from the sun on your face and the
wind mussing your hair, that's what the Miata has succeeded in
bringing back to life.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 model (there was no '98 model), Mazda engaged in
the dangerous task of tinkering with a proven winner. The challenge
was to upgrade Miata without spoiling its character or obscuring
its image.
</P>
<P>
   Miata drivers are a loyal group, surveys have shown, with
frequent repeat buyers and many Miata clubs cropping up everywhere,
including Phoenix. And they'd squawk loudly if Mazda ruined the
Miata.
</P>
<P>
   But although the sheet metal has been freshened, the front end
changed and the interior redesigned, from any angle, it's still
unmistakably a Miata.
</P>
<P>
   The new look of the front is brighter, with more personality.
The slightly wider back end, with its bigger taillights and tail
flip, looks sharper and more substantial. The scalloped doors and
side panels add to the sporty look.
</P>
<P>
   And the character is still there. No one who loved the old Miata
should dislike the new one. One friend who drives a Miata likes her
flip-up headlights and was disturbed that the '99 has fixed oval
beams. But that was her only complaint.
</P>
<P>
   She loved the way the new Miata drives. Better in every way, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the body freshening, the new car is slightly faster, a
lot stiffer (improves ride and handling), and a bit roomier.
</P>
<P>
   I last tested a Miata in 1993, at which time one important
factor became immediately obvious: I didn't fit. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I'm sort of tall. OK, real tall, 6-foot-6 and mostly legs.
Still, I can find some degree of comfort in 95 percent of the cars
out there, but driving the Miata is the most miserable crunch I've
had in any modern car, including some really teeny stuff.
</P>
<P>
   If only Mazda knew how much tall people appreciate tilt steering
wheels. If the Miata had one, my griping would be over.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miata was so appealing in so many other ways, I soon
forgot my physical pain. This is the kind of car that reminds me
why I like to drive. Eager, quick and responsive, with handling
like a skateboard, it's a pleasure to work the Miata's short, tight
shifter, and throw the little car blithely into turns.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the Miata has a raspy exhaust note that recalls the old
British iron, but our test car had something loose in the exhaust
system that caused a tinny rattle, and nasty smirks from those
within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is tight and jouncy like the old British sports
cars, but unlike them, the Miata will soak up major bumps with
ease. Some small stuff, like lane reflectors, will knock it off
track, but not too badly.
</P>
<P>
   The new interior, other than being too darn small, is nicely
done, with a sporty dash, traditional gauges and supportive seats.
The optional Bose stereo system is just great.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was equipped with the Popular Equipment Package, a
$2,330 set of appearance, convenience and performance options that
pretty much included most of the good stuff. Fifteen-inch wheels
and tires are another upgrade, but our car had the 14-inch alloy
rims with performance tires.
</P>
<P>
   A Nardi steering wheel, a real classic touch in any sports car,
is included in the options package. But I wasn't too impressed by
its look or feel. Certainly not like the classic Nardi wheels I
remember.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible top, which thankfully comes with a glass rear
window instead of the previous vinyl, is operated manually but
raises or lowers so easily, you won't miss a power top, which is so
prevalent in today's convertibles.

   One glitch: the tonneau that covers the stowed top is a
surprisingly chintzy piece of thin plastic that is certain to
disintegrate in short order.

   MOSCOW _ The fading Russian ruble again plunged in value against
the dollar on Thursday as the Kremlin made new but vague overtures
to the Communist-dominated parliament on a power-sharing
arrangement to create a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The political stand-off has fueled growing anxiety in the street
that Russia could be lurching toward social unrest. As the ruble
collapses, prices of consumer goods continue to climb and food
shortages are predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But the Duma, the lower house of parliament, appeared set Friday
to again reject the nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as President
Yeltsin's choice for prime minister. A second vote against
Chernomyrdin would prolong Russia's power vacuum as the economy
continues to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Worried customers continued to crowd the entrances to Russia's
teetering banks seeking, mostly without success, to withdraw their
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hopeless. Russia is crumbling and the people in charge
can only fight among themselves,'' said Yuri Lemankov, as he waited
in a long line outside a Moscow bank.
</P>
<P>
   Angry rhetoric from politicians that Russia's crisis could lead
to rioting in the streets prompted rumors in Moscow and on Western
financial markets that military units were being deployed on the
outskirts of the Russian capital. Russian security officials
refuted the rumors as ``absolutely unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God forbid a repetition of 1993,'' acting Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev said, referring to the political crisis in which
Yeltsin used tanks and troops to crush a rebellion by dissidents in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev warned that Russia's 1.7 million-strong armed forces
``are not in a festive mood,'' worrying as are most Russians about
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Amid warnings of looming food shortages, police in Moscow have
been ordered to fortify their patrols near major food storehouses
and processing plants to guard against theft or illegal shipments
to other regions, the newspaper Sevodnya said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman confirmed the report.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials Thursday attributed the possibility of serious
food shortages, which compound the economic problems, to cuts in
imports caused by the weakened ruble and banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of retail food sales in Russia are imports and
major Russian food processors rely on 85 to 90 percent of their raw
materials from abroad, according to the ministry of economic
relations and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also forecasted a poor domestic potato harvest this
autumn due to an early summer drought followed by heavy rains in
August. The potato is a staple of the national diet; the average
Russian eats six times more potatoes a year than an American.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin served as prime minister under Yeltsin from 1992
until March of this year and is widely blamed for helping to create
the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers continued to demand that Yeltsin seek a new
compromise candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, the Duma can vote three times on a prime
minister's nomination. If rejected, Yeltsin can appoint a prime
minister by decree and dissolve the legislature. New elections then
would take place within three months.
</P>
<P>
   But the angry public mood makes that a dangerous proposition for
both Yeltsin and the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly household income in June was 861 rubles,
about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the same
income of 861 rubles withered to a value of about $64 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble had been trading at 6.2 to the dollar last month
before it began its slide. The official ruble rate fell to 13.5
rubles Thursday, but traders said it was as low as 17.4 to the
dollar on the street.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll taken on Aug. 29 and released Thursday showed
two-thirds of Russians blame Yeltsin for the financial crisis and
believe he should step down.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said the Duma would
proceed with impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin. But it is a
burdensome process under the Russian constitution and unlikely to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a compromise, the Kremlin approached Duma leaders
Thursday with new discussions on a short-lived agreement reached
last weekend that would have had Yeltsin give up some of his
immense powers to the prime minister and parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin allies announced that the acting prime minister
would deliver a ``sensational speech'' to the parliament's upper
house on Friday outlining his broad plans to deal with Russia's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, appointed last month by Yeltsin after the
president fired the previous government, received some good news
when the Duma's third largest faction, the Liberal Democratic Party
with 51 seats, announced it would support him on Friday. The bloc,
led by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, abstained in the
first vote on Monday, which rejected Chernomyrdin 253-94.
</P>
<P>
   He needs 226 votes in the 450-member Duma.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhirinovsky's endorsement wasn't exactly ringing. ``Bad as
Chernomyrdin may be, he has experience,'' Zhirinovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A surgeon who has sent 200 patients to the morgue may cure the
201st,'' he added. ``Of course we have pity for the 200 victims,
but that makes him an experienced surgeon.''

SUMMER'S CRASH, BOOM, SPLAT PUNCTUATED BY SUBTLER FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Hollywood's popcorn season fades into a filet mignon fall and
the explosions of ``Deep Impact,'' ``Armageddon'' and ``Godzilla''
recede into distant background mutterings, what, if anything, have
this summer's movies taught us about ourselves and our tastes in
film?
</P>
<P>
   The most revealing lesson of the last two months, one that is, I
hope, not lost on Hollywood, may be that popcorn doesn't have to
rule the summer box office notwithstanding the $100-million-plus
gross of the tittery gross-out comedy ``There's Something About
Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   The season's biggest hit, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' is the kind
of prestige film that usually opens after Thanksgiving. Its box
office success during the popcorn season has shown that millions of
summertime moviegoers have no problem in going from the beach to a
gory battlefield devoid of soft-focus kisses or smutty jokes.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Saving Private Ryan'' isn't an anomaly. If you pick and
choose carefully, there is an abundance of smaller films, from
``The Eel'' to ``Return to Paradise,'' catering to discriminating
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The two most significant American films to be released this
summer _ ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Your Friends and Neighbors''
_ reflect the paradoxically divided state of the serious American
film. The popularity of Steven Spielberg's World War II epic can be
seen as a convergence of many currents.
</P>
<P>
   It offers us respite from all the endless, demoralizing sleaze
of Washington gossip and transports us back to what feels like a
nobler, cleaner era. Representing Hollywood at its high-minded
best, it promotes the traditional values of heroism, virtue and
patriotic duty with gripping, cinema-verite-style battle sequences
to make it all seem fresh and up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   The cheeky little David critically standing up to Spielberg's
Goliath of a hit is Neil LaBute's devastating followup to last
year's punch-in-the-stomach comedy ``In the Company of Men.'' If
the pop literature tells us that men are from Mars and women from
Venus, LaBute's nasty comic satire suggests that they really come
from warring galaxies light years beyond Pluto.
</P>
<P>
   While it's a safe bet that ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a powerful
but flawed movie, will be revered as a classic decades hence, it's
harder to guess what future generations may make of LaBute's
excoriating study of sexual distress among the yuppie class. Will
it be seen as a black-comic forerunner to an emerging genre of
brutal psychological realism or as a decadent manifestation of
social anxiety, a parasitical infection attached to the balloon of
late-90s prosperity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' has the feel of a moralizing
punishment methodically administered by a filmmaker intent on
communicating harsh truths about sex, power and modern manners.
``Your Friends and Neighbors'' is no realistic slice of life.
</P>
<P>
   Its evisceration of the miserable sex lives of two yuppie
couples in an unidentified Midwestern city and the despicable
behavior of the scornful self-styled stud who manipulates them is
as exaggerated and deliberately mannered and tricky as a David
Mamet play.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, LaBute has professed his admiration for the
brittle, satirical style and pointed banter of English Restoration
drama. Two scenes from ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' are actually
set in rehearsals of a comedy by William Wycherley, the
17th-century playwright whose most famous plays, ``The Country
Wife'' and ``The Plain Dealer,'' treat the same themes _ sex,
friendship and elaborate deception and betrayal _ as ``Your Friends
and Neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of yuppie sex and marriage evoked in the movie is
extremely grim. The sexual revolution and the expectations it has
brought have given both men and women an overwhelming sense of
entitlement when it comes to pleasure. But once men and women enter
the bedroom, the men prove to be little boys playing verbal games
for erotic stimulation, while the women wait for a passion their
selfish partners can't even begin to summon.
</P>
<P>
   Their best friend, played with a grim, sneering arrogance by
Jason Patric (who suggests the comedian Dennis Miller on the
warpath), is an avenging stud and misogynist who when asked to
recall the best sex he has ever had, remembers raping a male
classmate in a high school locker room with his friends. This
monster, who practices his pillow talk into a tape recorder and who
viciously berates a date for staining his finely threaded sheets
with her menstrual blood, is a grotesque caricature of irate
American machismo.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the character's exaggeration, he is an uncomfortably
recognizable type, the worst nightmare of feminists, an
unregenerate, unapologetic male chauvinist whose ruthless honesty
lends him a ghastly kind of integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The women are shown as collaborators in their own bedroom
tragedies. One witheringly berates her lover for having to talk so
much during sex. The other reverts into an incommunicative sulk.
The American bedroom, according to ``Your Friends and Neighbors,''
is a battlefield to which men and women repair with impossibly high
expectations and no guidebook about the rules and etiquette of
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   In an even broader sense, the movie is an icy critique of the
value we place on sex. The utopian rhetoric of the sexual
revolution, combined with the commodification of sex to sell
everything under the sun, have guaranteed that millions of people
conditioned to expect erotic salvation on demand are in for a
bitter disappointment when it isn't delivered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' distills the feisty,
take-no-prisoners style of the small independent movie that has
risen almost as a necessary corollary to Hollywood's phony romantic
schmaltz exemplified by fantasies like ``City of Angels.'' It feels
like a slap in the face, a splash of ice water in a climate
contaminated by scandal-mongering, overheated by talk show
confessions and rampant commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is in its way as powerful a film as
``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' while being diametrically opposite
in style and content. Where LaBute's film is all pointed, parrying
talk, much of the dialogue in ``Saving Private Ryan'' is half
submerged in the roar of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' addresses the moment,
``Saving Private Ryan'' looks back to the past. And except for a
jumbled, embarrassing story that Matt Damon's character tells about
three brothers and a girl in a barn, the movie has no allusions to
sex.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is only the latest example of Steven Spielberg's
genius at recasting Hollywood archetypes to make them seem more
contemporary than they really are and in the process delivering
broad, resonant and comfortingly uplifting cultural messages. Yes,
the battlefield sequences, shot with hand-held cameras, with the
gore flying in all directions and the soldiers forging ahead in a
state of panic and chaos, are the most harrowing and realistic ever
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their horror, they don't, as some critics have
suggested, make ``Saving Private Ryan'' an antiwar movie. World War
II was, after all, America's ``good war.''
</P>
<P>
   The team of American soldiers sent to find the elusive private
is the same carefully selected cross-section _ an Italian, a Jew,
an Irishman, a scared bookish intellectual and so on _ found in the
typical 1940s war movie. While not uniformly virtuous, the group
led by Tom Hanks (playing the same responsible, smart all-American
nice guy embodied in the 40s by an actor like Frederic March), is a
pretty impressive bunch in its solidarity and courage under fire.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's extra resonance has to do with its timing and its
attitude toward war. In the same way that Spielberg's ``Schindler's
List'' acknowledged the Holocaust with a thoroughness and power
that Hollywood never dared before, ``Saving Private Ryan'' feels
like an official act of atonement.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the wounds of the old generation gap are being
tended, as a Hollywood baby boomer apologizes for his peers for not
recognizing the older generation's courage and sacrifice during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Where Hollywood's Vietnam epics had an undertone of absurdism
and American self-hatred, Spielberg's film, which is wrapped in
images of the American flag, is a wholehearted celebration of
American pluck and virtue and honor. But in typical Spielbergian
fashion, the movie goes overboard to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   The one gratingly false note in ``Schindler's List'' has Liam
Neeson breaking into tears at the end of the movie and berating
himself for not doing more to save Holocaust victims. Here, an
elderly World War II veteran weeps at a grave wonders out loud
whether he's been ``good'' enough to deserve salvation. Make no
mistake, this kind of sentimentality is pure Hollywood corn.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a selection of movies playing in New York that also
offer more than popcorn gratification: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Return to Paradise'
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ruben's drama (loosely based on a 1990 French film called
``Force Majeure'') is oddly similar to ``Saving Private Ryan'' in
its emotional tone and concern with heroism and moral choice,
although it isn't nearly as accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   When three friends who have been living high in Malaysia end
their vacation, one (Joaquin Phoenix) decides to remain in the
country. Unbeknownst to his pals, he is arrested, thrown in prison
and sentenced to death for possessing a brick of hashish, which the
three of them had bought.
</P>
<P>
   The only way he can avoid execution is if his two friends, now
back in New York, return to Malaysia, surrender to the authorities,
assume their share of the blame and spend a minimum of three years
each in a hideous Malaysian prison.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Heche is the lawyer who appeals to their consciences and
becomes romantically involved with the feistier of the two friends
(Vince Vaughn). Very well acted and suspenseful, the movie's
examination of the limits of friendship and heroic self-sacrifice
are deep enough to make you seriously question how you would behave
in similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's romantic element and its overwrought subplot,
involving a pushy journalist tracking down the story, are
thoroughly bogus. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `A Merry War'
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bierman's adaptation of a 1936 novel by George Orwell
wittily skewers the London literary world of the mid-1930s. Richard
E. Grant is a poet who the moment his first book is published (and
is favorably reviewed in The London Times by his wealthy and
cynical publisher) quits his job in advertising to be ``free.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely supporting himself with jobs in dingy book shops, he
sinks into poverty, to the exasperation of his long-suffering
girlfriend (Helena Bonham Carter).
</P>
<P>
   The movie presents an amusingly scathing portrait of the young
poet as a self-destructive narcissist (a $50 check from an American
publication gives him disastrous delusions of upper-class grandeur)
and of the inability of someone born into the middle class to
escape a middle-class life no matter how hard he strains to attain
a bohemian sainthood. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Next Stop Wonderland'
</P>
<P>
   Hope Davis gives a wonderfully complex portrait of an
attractive, introverted night-shift nurse making the dating rounds
in contemporary Boston. The movie switches back and forth between
Ms. Davis and Alan Gelfant, who plays the man she was meant for (a
plumber aspiring to be a marine biologist), going about their daily
affairs and nearly colliding on several occasions but never
connecting.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the movie special is its smart, snappy dialogue
(interwoven with a moody bossa nova score) and a group of funny,
acutely observed minor characters (including an assortment of men
Ms. Davis meets through a personal ad). It captures the texture of
urban single life more richly than any other recent film. But its
ending feels tacked on. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Western'
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what its title suggests, this quirky, endearing
French road movie directed by Manuel Poirier has nothing to do with
the American Wild West. A Catalan shoe salesman, stranded on the
road after his car has been stolen by a Russian thief, is rescued
by a woman with whom he ends up having a brief, but intense affair.
Accidentally running into the thief, he beats him up, sending him
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely friendship develops between the two, and when the
salesman's new sweetheart asks him to leave for a three-week trial
separation to test their love, the two men team up and hit the road
for a series of adventures that take them to the coast of Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   Since the wiry love-starved thief can't seem to meet girls, the
two begin posing as poll takers conducting a door-to-door survey
asking French women to describe their ideal man. The movie suggests
a much sweeter and wackier 90s version of Bertrand Blier's 70s
classic, ``Going Places.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The Eel'
</P>
<P>
   In this quirky, symbol-laden Japanese drama, a husband, informed
by an anonymous letter that his wife is having an affair, catches
her in bed with her lover and stabs her to death in a jealous rage.
Released from prison after eight years, he begins a new life as a
barber.
</P>
<P>
   With him he takes a pet eel he raised in prison and which is his
sole confidante. One day near his shop, he stumbles upon the nearly
dead body of a woman who has attempted suicide. He saves her life,
and she becomes his assistant in the shop. But when the jealous
lover who drove her to attempt suicide visits the shop in search of
her, the barber's stable new life and his parole are imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   The serious comedy about passion, violence and the possibility
of redemption is peopled with oddball characters and surreal
touches that give the story an allegorical weight. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The Thief'
</P>
<P>
   It is 1952 in the Soviet Union, and a beautiful young woman
(Yekaterina Rednikova) and her 6-year-old son (Misha Philipchuk)
are riding on a train. When a handsome army officer makes a play
for the woman, she succumbs, and the three set up house together in
a crowded apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But the army officer isn't what he appears. He's really a
professional burglar and liar (he tells the little boy he's
Stalin's son) who befriends the neighbors, steals their possessions
and skips town.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian film, directed by Pavel Chukhrai, focuses on the
relationship between the boy and the thief, who teaches the child
to fight, lie, steal and be tough. Until their final meeting many
years later, the child grows up revering this charismatic bad
influence (beautifully played by Vladimir Mashkov) as a father.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Thief'' can be shamelessly tearjerking, it has an
open-hearted Russian soulfulness that is hard to resist. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The Chambermaid on the Titanic'
</P>
<P>
   Second only to our need for food and water is our hunger for
stories that can help us make sense of our lives and give our
experiences a romantically ennobling narrative shape. That's the
message of Bigas Luna's film (adapted from a novel by Didier
Decoin) about a poor French foundry worker (Olivier Martinez) who
wins an athletic contest that takes him to England to witness the
maiden voyage of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   While in England, he shares hotel quarters with a beautiful,
enigmatic woman who claims to be a chambermaid on the ship but who
has no place to stay. When he returns to France, his friends
pressure him to disclose the details of their night together. He
obliges by inventing a story of a night of grand passion with the
doomed woman that is so spellbinding it carries him from the
foundry to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is directed in a hazy, soft-core style that doesn't
quite gibe with its comic point of view. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The Governess'
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Driver stars in this tale of a Sephardic Jewish woman
from London who in the early 1840s poses as a Gentile to take a job
as governess to a family on a remote Scottish island. Although the
ruse succeeds, the governess finds herself spiritually alienated
and secretly practices Jewish rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between the two cultures becomes more acute when she
falls in love with the head of the household (Tom Wilkinson), a
gentleman scientist whom she helps invent photography.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Sandra Goldbacher, this visually ravishing film
reaches a peak of beauty and thoughtfulness in its photography
sequences. But it is marred by a screenplay whose use of
contemporary slang can be jarringly untrue to the period.

`VOYAGE OF THE NARWHAL': TERROR, GUILT, AMBITION IN ICY HEART OF
DARKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``The Voyage of the Narwhal,'' Andrea Barrett _ the winner
of the 1996 National Book Award for ``Ship Fever and Other
Stories'' _ has given us an old-fashioned 19th-century novel that
brings together the two abiding concerns in her work to date: the
mysterious allure of science and the equally mysterious bonds of
familial love and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Ship Fever,'' ``Narwhal'' showcases Ms. Barrett's gifts
for extracting high drama from the complex world of science and
natural history and for placing her characters in situations that
reveal their fundamental natures. Indeed, ``Narwhal'' is an
adventure story in the way that Conrad's ``Lord Jim'' and ``The
Nigger of the Narcissus'' are adventure stories: the story's
extreme conditions and harrowing experiences, which make for such
gripping reading, are actually moral and spiritual tests that strip
away the characters' public masks and expose their innermost drives
and fears.
</P>
<P>
   On its simplest level, ``Narwhal'' is the story of a fictional
1855 expedition to the Arctic to look for a missing explorer who
disappeared a decade before, an expedition that will cost the lives
of several men and warp the lives of others with memories of guilt
and anger and horror. On another level, it is a story of scientific
hubris and sheer pig-headed ambition, a story meant, in some ways,
to recall such disparate works as Mary Shelley's ``Frankenstein''
and Melville's ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the immensely talented Ms. Barrett succeed in fulfilling
her own large ambitions? The answer is: up to a point. For
three-quarters of her tale, she does a masterful job of weaving her
philosophical subtext into a glistening narrative, crammed full of
rich, pictorial description and tingling suspense. Only in the
novel's final pages does drama give way to melodramatic contrivance
and genuine moral dilemmas to easy, sentimental resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of ``Narwhal'' are two compelling heroes: Erasmus
Wells, a middle-aged naturalist who hopes to use the voyage of the
Narwhal to vindicate himself, to erase his bitter experience of an
earlier journey to the Arctic; and Zechariah Voorhees, Erasmus'
brother-in-law-to-be, who hopes to win glory and fame as commander
of the Narwhal expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The two men could not be more different. Erasmus is shy,
cautious and introspective; Zeke is charismatic, cocky and
impulsive. Erasmus, still mourning the death of the woman he loved,
sees himself as an unconfidant loner; Zeke, certain of the devotion
of Lavinia (Erasmus' sister), comes across as a charming rake.
Before leaving home, Erasmus promises Lavinia that he will keep an
eye on the impetuous Zeke, and make sure that he returns home
safely.
</P>
<P>
   In narrating the long, hazardous journey of the Narwhal (from
Philadelphia to Greenland to the perilous waters near the pole) and
the crew's subsequent travels through the snow and ice, Ms. Barrett
does a superb job of conjuring up the hermetic life on board a
ship, and the magic and terror of the Arctic. Combining a
naturalist's eye with a novelist's imagination, she gives us
descriptions of the polar region reminiscent at once of the
real-life wonders chronicled by Barry Lopez in ``Arctic Dreams''
and the metaphysical landscape of Poe's ``Narrative of A. Gordon
Pym.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Barrett nimbly sketches in the
personalities of the Narwhal's crew. Besides Erasmus and Zeke,
there are Captain Tyler, a foul-tempered, heavy drinking bully who
resents Zeke's authority; Ned Kynd, the ship's youthful cook, a
cheerful, hardworking man who fled the Irish famine for a new life
in the States; Jan Boerhaave, a doctor and naturalist who shares
Erasmus' passion for knowledge, and an assortment of other officers
and seamen.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Narwhal has reached the polar waters, made
hazardous by icebergs and shifting pack ice, there are portents of
yet more trouble to come. The sled dogs have died of a mysterious
illness, and one of the sailors has succumbed to lockjaw. The crew
has split into factions, and Zeke has grown increasingly moody and
autocratic. It seems that he is not content with the information he
has collected from the local Eskimos about the missing explorer; he
is determined to push ahead, even as winter closes in, to try to
discover what he believes is an open (that is, ice-free) polar sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my NAME on something,'' he tells Erasmus. ``Something
BIG _ is that so hard to understand? I want my name on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeke's ambition has terrible costs: it leads to at least one
more death and causes incalculable suffering to the remainder of
his crew. Caught in the freezing water and hemmed in by ice on all
sides, the Narwhal is unable to return home, and the men are forced
to spend an entire winter in the arctic with dwindling supplies of
food.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, when Zeke leaves on foot to look for his polar sea
and fails to return, Erasmus is faced with making a fateful
decision: to wait for Zeke and thereby face the prospect of making
the crew spend a second (and no doubt deadly) winter in the Arctic,
or assume that Zeke is dead and try to take advantage of the
opportunity afforded by the summer thaw to try to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Erasmus' decision will have lasting
consequences, not only for Zeke but for Lavinia and for himself.
Indeed, he will be haunted by his decision, much as Lord Jim was
haunted by his, for the remainder of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few sections of ``Narwhal,'' Ms. Barrett's fluent
plotting gives way to a flurry of increasingly contrived events
that seem to belong more to a big Hollywood movie than to the
foregoing portions of this novel.
</P>
<P>
   Although these developments make ``Narwhal'' feel like a
slighter, slicker work than it means to be, they do not tarnish Ms.
Barrett's very real achievements: her ability to convey to the
reader her psychological insights into her characters, her
understanding of the fickle role that chance and luck play in
people's lives, and her appreciation of the raw, unaccommodated
power of nature. She has written a powerful and gripping _ if
finally, flawed _ novel.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As paranoid as it sounds, David McCallum is absolutely certain
he is being shadowed by a Russian agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's there every day,'' McCallum said in a stage whisper as he
peered over a pair of sunglasses. ``I mean, it's been 30 years, but
I can't escape him. Illya Kuryakin is there 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   McCallum's suspicions may be correct. For nearly 50 years, he
has been an almost constant presence in television, film and
onstage, a lifelong character actor whose career ranges from Ibsen
to B-movies and who has played parts from Judas Iscariot in the
biblical epic ``The Greatest Story Ever Told'' to a kindly uncle in
the upcoming independent film ``Cherry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the role for which most fans remember him is that of
Kuryakin, the brooding, mysterious Russian operative in the 1960s
joke-and-dagger spy series ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was that you knew nothing about him: gay or
straight or married, who knew?'' McCallum, now 64, said. ``I
suppose it was effective.''
</P>
<P>
   McCallum's current assignment is playing Harold Palmer, the
befuddled security guard in Alan Ayckbourn's comedy ``Communicating
Doors'' at the Variety Arts Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The play is McCallum's second in a New York theater this year
after an absence of nearly a decade; in May he appeared in a
revival of ``Nasty Little Secrets'' at Primary Stages.
</P>
<P>
   For an actor whose reputation is so tied to a role he played
long ago, it comes as no small amusement to McCallum that the
primary device of ``Communicating Doors'' is time travel, with
characters jumping back and forth in 20-year intervals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really fell in love with Harold, because to an extent, he's
the only character that doesn't change at all,'' McCallum said,
explaining his method for conveying the character's aging: ``It's
really stomach in, stomach out. Acting by midriff.''
</P>
<P>
   As has often been the case in his career, McCallum has received
positive reviews despite critics' generally mixed feelings about
the production. Of McCallum's performance in ``Communicating
Doors,'' Peter Marks wrote in The New York Times: ``You find
yourself wishing that he could have played all the male parts.''
</P>
<P>
   McCallum's ability to stand out has served him well in a career
spiced with B-movie credits like ``Frankenstein: The True Story,''
``The Screaming Skull'' and something called ``The Haunting of
Morella.'' Still, barely a review goes by that doesn't mention his
former life as a secret agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I just put the last couple of years in my theater bio,
people object and think I'm hiding him, hiding Illya,'' he said
with a note of wonder. ``It's not that at all. I'm not listing
stuff from three decades ago. I mean, there's limited space.''
</P>
<P>
   His current biography does not refer to the show, but that
hasn't fooled audiences. On opening night, at least one older fan
showed up clutching an Illya Kuryakin T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen the show, so I wasn't prepared for the
phenomenon,'' said Mary Louise Parker, McCallum's co-star in the
play. ``He's this quiet, thoughtful, sweet man with this perfect
air of refinement. But when he comes onstage, the ladies in the
front row literally start to swoon.''
</P>
<P>
   A native Scotsman, McCallum trained as a teen-ager after World
War II at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London before being
drafted into the British Army and serving in West Africa in the
Gold Coast, now part of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   After his tour, he returned to London and quickly signed a
contract with the Rank organization, the venerable British
production company, where he estimates he played ``52 roles a
year'' in live televised plays.
</P>
<P>
   He also began a fledgling film career. By 1963, he had an
impressive resume, including parts in ``The Great Escape,''
``Robbery Under Arms'' and ``A Night to Remember,'' a role that led
to voice-overs on Titanic documentaries and other suitably spooky
material.
</P>
<P>
   It also led to ``U.N.C.L.E.'' For the uninitiated, ``The Man
From U.N.C.L.E.'' was a stylish takeoff on James Bond that was
broadcast on NBC from 1964 to 1968. The series starred Robert
Vaughn as Napoleon Solo and McCallum as his partner, both agents at
the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement who continually
did battle with the evil forces of T.H.R.U.S.H. (the acronymically
fantastic Technical Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and
the Subjugation of Humanity).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There were also many gadgets and attractive guest stars. Solo
wore a suit; Kuryakin, a black turtleneck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never heard of the word sidekick before,'' McCallum said,
recalling the early days of the program. ``The first episode I had
about four lines and an accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite lukewarm reviews, the show was a success with audiences;
McCallum, meanwhile, managed to lend gravitas to lines like:
``Almost. Almost is a word that sticks in the throat like
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming hard on the heels of the British music invasion,
McCallum's mod-dish head of blond hair and pale blue eyes struck a
chord. ``He's an intellectual Beatle,'' wrote one fan in a letter
published in TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, at the peak of the show's popularity, McCallum was
stampeded by 2,000 students at Louisiana State University and had
to be evacuated by a phalanx of police officers. Another time,
15,000 fans screaming ``We Want David!'' tore apart two floors of
Macy's clamoring for a look at McCallum.
</P>
<P>
   And TV Guide reported an alarming incident in Springfield, Ill.,
when 500 teen-age fans cheered McCallum's entrance as Judas in
``The Greatest Story Ever Told,'' released in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum was stunned by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cartoon around then with me in it, saying I was
the greatest thing since peanut butter and jelly,'' he said. ``Can
you imagine higher praise?''
</P>
<P>
   The role earned McCallum two Emmy nominations, and he appeared
in the six feature films based on the series. The show also led to
one short-lived spinoff, ``The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.,'' and
too-many-to-remember requests for McCallum to play spies. ``It was
all Russian accents, gray suits and soft gray shoes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the show was canceled, McCallum was burned out. His
nine-year marriage to the actress Jill Ireland ended in divorce in
1967, and a year later, with a new wife, Katherine, he moved to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd made enough of a spectacle of myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly his life and career returned to normal with a string of
steady if less glamorous acting assignments, voice-overs and
television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum and his wife still live in Manhattan. They have two
grown children. McCallum also had three children with Ms. Ireland;
one, Jason, died of a drug overdose in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   His child's addiction was chronicled in a book by Ms. Ireland
called ``Life Lines,'' which was made into a television movie in
1991. ``Some things are sent simply to test you,'' he said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   While he has worked steadily in regional theater, before this
year he had not acted on stage in New York since 1988, when he
appeared in Ibsen's ``Ghosts'' at the Roundabout Theater.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, McCallum said, he didn't like talking about
``U.N.C.L.E.,'' but he has relented. The show, too, has had
something of a comeback since the cable network TNT began showing
late, late night installments, or ``Affairs,'' as they're known to
devotees of the show. There's even talk of a feature film based on
the series, directed by Quentin Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCallum is stumped by Illya's continuing appeal, he
finds the craft of acting less mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the part, you learn the lines and in the theater you
listen to the other actors more than you talk,'' he said. ``And
then when you get onstage, you listen to the audience. Beyond that,
I don't think there's really much else.''

   &UR; SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Falcons at Panthers
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves is 0-3 against Carolina
Coach Dom Capers.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Many are picking the Falcons to make the playoffs this
season. If they are going to, this is a game they need to win.
True, saying the first game of the season is a big one is a tad bit
overdramatic but the Falcons got off to a poor start last season
and a repeat would kill any postseason hopes. They will look to
quarterback Chris Chandler to lead them to postseason, he of the
90.6 passer rating in September over the past five years. Capers
wants to see two things: That his defense and quarterback Kerry
Collins get back to their old selves. Not yet, Dom. Falcons, 22-10.
</P>
<P>
   Lions at Packers
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: With 100 yards rushing, Barry Sanders can extend his
league-record streak to 14 consecutive 100-yard games. Sanders
needs just 222 rushing yards this season to join Walter Payton as
the only players with 14,000 career rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Very quietly, Packers quarterback Brett Favre has had
a strong preseason. He is just picking up where the team left off.
Green Bay finished last year with the conference's No. 1 pass
offense (231 yards a game) and Favre's 89.3 career passer rating is
one of the best in the league. The Pack will be back, probably in
the conference title game. The Lions, meanwhile, are back to where
they have always been: relying on Sanders and crossing their
fingers that this will be the year quarterback Scott Mitchell comes
out of his coma. They'll keep waiting. And waiting. And waiting.
And waiting. Packers, 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars at Bears
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Bears were 0-4 in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Last season the Jaguars scored a league-high 300
points on 63 trips into the redzone. That offense could be even
better this year. The Jaguars have more depth and the defense is
Super Bowl caliber. They look like champions already. Then there
are the Bears, nothing but bad news. They've won 12 of the past 14
openers and if they win eight games this year, Coach Dave Wannstedt
should be named coach of the decade. Jaguars, 27-0.
</P>
<P>
   Saints at Rams
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Saints open on the road for only the seventh time in
32-year team history.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The battle of the old coaches. Dick Vermeil, though,
is 7-0 lifetime against Mike Ditka. The former Bears coach may have
lost control of his team, with players being hazed by other players
like they're pledging a fraternity, but they play hard for him. As
for Vermeil, this could be a solid season. His quarterback, Tony
Banks, has dedicated himself more than ever, wide receiver Isaac
Bruce is back from a knee injury and tackle Orlando Pace is slimmer
and meaner. After Ditka loses this opener, maybe the players will
haze him. Rams, 14-6.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers at Ravens
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: The Ravens open at their new 68,400-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Pittsburgh has won the last four division titles, but
there may be a new sheriff in town and it is the Ravens. They could
end up being one of the surprise teams in the league. The Steelers
are good but Baltimore now has enough offensive and defensive
firepower to keep up with each team in the division. Watch
cornerback Rod Woodson, now with the Ravens and formerly with
Pittsburgh. He is looking to prove that the Steelers made a mistake
in releasing him, which is good for at least one interception.
Ravens, 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks at Eagles
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Seattle's 247.4 yards passing a game was best in the
NFL last year.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Because of poor drafting and almost nonexistent
spending on free agents the Eagles find themselves in the middle of
a talent drought. The Seahawks, meanwhile, are swimming in good
players, especially offensively with Warren Moon at quarterback and
former Eagle Ricky Watters at running back. Seattle should win this
game without breathing hard. Seahawks, 21-0.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers at Vikings
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: The Buccaneers are going for back-to-back playoff
years for the first time since the 1981-82 season.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Tampa Bay has a great coach, a great running game and
a solid defense, all the ingredients to make another strong playoff
run. But can they make a super run with average quarterback Trent
Dilfer at the helm? The answer is no and it is the same reason why
they will lose to Minnesota. The Vikings have everything the
Buccaneers do but quarterback Brad Johnson has a 94.5 passer rating
in September and is healthy. He's the difference. Vikings, 35-20.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers at Bengals
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Tennessee guard Bruce Matthews makes his 166th
straight start, the NFL's longest active streak.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: With the steady Neil O'Donnell at the helm and a solid
running game behind him in back Corey Dillon, the Bengals will do
some damage offensively. But these are two closely matched teams.
Wide receiver Yancy Thigpen gives Tennessee some much needed deep
help and he'll be the difference. Oilers, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins at Giants
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: In 1997 the Giants were the first ever NFC East team
to go undefeated in the division with a 7-0-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The last time the Giants and Redskins met was last
December, when New York's defense recorded eight turnovers,
including a 35-yard interception return by cornerback Jason Sehorn.
Of course, Sehorn is out for the season with torn ligaments in his
knee but the Giants' defense is still one of the best in the
league. The Redskins have a solid running game and good receivers
but with Gus Frerotte at quarterback the Redskins can only go so
far. The Giants' secret weapons are Coach Jim Fassel and defensive
coordinator Jim Fox. They always seem to find ways to cover up
weaknesses. Giants, 20-13.

</P>
<P>
   Cardinals at Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Cowboys have won 14 of past 15 games against
Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The common thought is that the Cowboys have taken a
step back and the Cardinals two forward. True, Arizona quarterback
Jake Plummer is hot, finishing preseason with a 105.1 passer
rating, but the Cowboys, winless in preseason, will make one last
run. It may be a run to mediocrity but it won't be to the basement.
They'll kick off the season with a big win over a club they always
seem to dominate. Cowboys, 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bills at Chargers
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Bills are 24-7 in September in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The chest thumping you've heard for the last month is
Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf after he's zipped a touchdown pass
or thrown for a first down. He has been brilliant in preseason and
at times has been so cocky he looks like a five-year veteran. The
Bills spent a first round pick in prying Rob Johnson away from the
Jaguars and he looks like he's worth it. This game should feature
some solid quarterback play. The Chargers get the edge because
they're at home. Chargers, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins at Colts
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Team is 17-3 under Coach Jimmy Johnson when a runner
has 25 or more carries.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Quarterback Peyton Manning, at 22 years, 5 months and
13 days, is the seventh youngest starting quarterback in NFL
history. Guess who is before him at 22 years and 4 months? His
father, Archie. Thus Peyton begins the trek of following in his
father's footsteps and like his father's early years in New
Orleans, baby Peyton's will be rough. His offensive line isn't very
good and he opens with a hungry Miami team. Where's dad when you
need him? Dolphins, 30-10.
</P>
<P>
   Jets at 49ers
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Jets' 8-win turnaround, from 1-15 to 9-7 last season,
is tied for third-best in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: For this game Jets Coach Bill Parcells is basically
playing with house money. If he wins, he is seen as a genius for
going to the 49ers home turf and beating them. If he loses, no one
expects him to win, anyway. This might be a game he can steal. As
great an athlete as wide receiver Jerry Rice is, he is still coming
off a devastating knee injury. He won't be 100 percent and the
49ers without Rice just aren't the same team. Jets, 21-20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Raiders at Chiefs
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: Chiefs are 7-1 in last 8 openers.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Raiders seem to be back on track with young rookie
head coach Jon Gruden in control. Their practices have been sharper
and the defense, much maligned in recent years, is stronger with
the addition of cornerback Charles Woodson. The Chiefs are dominant
in the regular season and since they hate the Raiders, this will be
a spirited game, won by the Chiefs. Chiefs, 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Patriots at Broncos
</P>
<P>
   Key stats: First all-AFC Monday Night Football season-opener
since 1981 when San Diego played Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: It's always gloom and doom with the Patriots. They
don't have a running game. Their defense isn't tough enough. Blah,
blah, blah. But quarterback Drew Bledsoe is what makes the team go.
The Patriots will find some way to run the ball and their defense
is better than it has been in years. Look for New England tight end
Ben Coates to have a big game and the defending Super Bowl
champions to get an early season shock at home. Patriots, 17-14.

THE ENDURING ATTRACTION OF EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Egyptian Revival style has been rearing its
sphinxlike head for more than 2,000 years. And, like the sphinx, it
maintains a mysterious allure.
</P>
<P>
   The style was in fashion during the reigns of Emperor Hadrian,
Louis XVI, Napoleon and the English Regent, as well as during the
British Esthetic Movement in the 1870s and the Art Deco period in
the 1920s. And it seems to be transfixing us today.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Revival pieces are some of the standouts in the
Christie's sale of French and Continental furniture on Sept. 24 in
New York. Christie's is auctioning an elegant circa 1785 Italian
neoclassical settee whose sides are flanked by Egyptian female
caryatids with golden Egyptian wigs. Two matching chairs have
armrests on charming, sleepy, sphinxlike lions. The estimate for
the suite is $30,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's is also selling a circa 1800 Italian neoclassical
console (estimate: $40,000 to $60,000), whose frieze is supported
by two gilded Egyptian male statues.
</P>
<P>
   Will Strafford, the vice president for European furniture at
Christie's, said the figure is Antinous, Emperor Hadrian's favorite
companion. Antinous drowned in the Nile on a visit to Egypt with
Hadrian. The bereft Hadrian gave him a demigod's burial in Rome,
then built an Egyptian pavilion to display his Egyptian sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The uprights on Christie's table are derived from the antique
sculpture of Antinous rediscovered at Hadrian's villa in Rome in
1740, Strafford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the fascination for Egyptian style is that it is so
otherworldly,'' Strafford said. ``It has a lot to do with the
afterworld and obsession with death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the Romans often appropriated the Antinous
image in the 18th century, as seen in the Egyptian Salon in the
Palazzo Massimo and the Egyptian Hall in the Villa Borghesi. Even
Piranesi published Egyptian decorative schemes, in 1769 in his
``Diversi Manieri de Ornare i Cammini.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sale of 19th-century furniture on Oct. 28 features
later Egyptian Revival pieces: a pair of French chenets (fire dogs)
with sphinx heads, circa 1880 (estimate: $3,000 to $5,000), and two
chairs with bone and wood inlays whose low backs are in the form of
birds (estimate: $8,000 to $12,000 each).
</P>
<P>
   There are also some small circular side tables decorated with
hieroglyphs (estimate: $4,000 to $6,000 apiece).
</P>
<P>
   ``They are literally covered from top to bottom,'' said Elaine
Whitmire, head of 19th-century furniture at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Egyptian Revival's time has come again.
</P>
<P>
   The New York architect Peter Marino has designed an
American-style Egyptian Revival apartment in New York for Pierre
Berge, the French fashion titan. Marino said the first revival of
the style goes back to the first century B.C., when the Romans took
control of the Nile. ``The Romans wanted their empire to last as
long as the Egyptians' dynasties, so they borrowed their symbols,''
Marino explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our modern lives, we want a connection to the most ancient
things we can think of,'' he said. ``Egyptian style is enduring,
and we all want our work to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariane Dandois, a Paris antiques dealer now in her 25th year in
business, is selling several Egyptian Revival antiques at the Paris
Biennale des Antiquaires, from Sept. 18 to Oct. 4. In her booth she
will have a pair of Empire-style Spanish mahogany and gilt wood
armchairs, circa 1820, with padded backs and seats flanked by
crouching winged sphinxes.
</P>
<P>
   The sphinxes are not unlike models designed by Percier and
Fontaine, the great Empire-style decorators who did so much work
for Napoleon at Fontainebleau and Malmaison.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dandois says she thinks the chairs, one of which is banded
with the initials CMF, were made for a royal palace in Spain during
the reign of Ferdinand VII, 1813-1833. His wife was Marie-Christine
de Bourbon, and Ms. Dandois speculates that CMF may be her
monogram. She is selling the chairs for 950,000 francs, about
$190,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egyptian taste has been in demand since Europeans discovered
the first temples in the sand,'' Ms. Dandois said. She noted that
Napoleon took mathematicians, engineers and astronomers, along with
54,000 soldiers, on his Egyptian Campaign of 1798. Within months he
founded the Institut d'Egypte there, to study Egyptian
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in Egypt goes beyond wars and power,'' she said.
``For a culture to have so great an influence, it has to appeal to
scientists, artists, writers and architects. It's so totally
intellectual. After Napoleon, everyone started to be interested and
reinvented Egyptian style according to the discipline of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dandois is selling a circa 1800 clock in the shape of an
obelisk that rests on four crouching lions. The case is attributed
to Ferdinand Schwerdfeger, one of Marie-Antoinette's favorite
cabinetmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dandois said she thought the clock was probably made by
Jean-Baptiste Thiery, who did an obelisk model in marble that is
now in the Louvre. The lions, Ms. Dandois said, were inspired by
the Egyptian lion statues at the base of the staircase at the
Capitoline Hill in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, at least three antiques dealers are now showing
Egyptian Revival pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Newel Art Galleries has several late-19th-century British
examples, including an etagere incised with Egyptian motifs
($12,500), a gilt and polychrome throne chair with Egyptian figures
($15,000) and an Art Deco love seat with bronze caryatid armrests
by Jean Pascaud ($21,000).
</P>
<P>
   Florian Papp Antiques has several Egyptian Revival pieces in
stock, including an unusual Italian mirror, circa 1810, that is
surmounted by coiled snakes and has Egyptian figures with carved
and gilded heads and feet ($28,000).
</P>
<P>
   Two Regency pieces are elegantly embellished with Egyptian
pilasters: an open bookshelf ($18,500) and a chiffonier with glass
doors ($36,000).
</P>
<P>
   Roger Prigent, the owner of Malmaison Antiques, is a longtime
aficionado of the style. He is selling a pair of mahogany bergeres
signed Jacob Freres, circa 1803, with armrests in the form of
Egyptian female heads ($20,000 each), and a gilded bronze lamp that
has two kneeling Egyptian women ($25,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wearing the Cleopatra wig, just like Elizabeth
Taylor,'' Prigent said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Revival style is as enduring as Cleopatra. ``The
mystery of Egypt lives,'' said Madeleine Deschamps, the author of
one of the best books on the subject, ``Empire'' (Abbeville, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the French artists Patrick and Anne Poirier created an
eight-foot-long biscuit porcelain centerpiece for Sevres that was
probably inspired by the style of Luxor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egyptian art didn't change for 2,000 years; the shapes are
both austere and eternal,'' she said. The Poiriers' temple will be
on view at the American Craft Museum in New York in January.

MR. PEANUT MAY BE GETTING RUDE RECEPTION ON AIRLINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Mr. Peanut cuts a first-class figure with his top
hat, monocle and cane, but he could be banished to the back of the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Out of concern for airline passengers with severe peanut
allergies, federal transportation authorities have ordered airlines
to create ``peanut-free buffer zones'' on their flights.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department order, issued two weeks ago and
already in effect, cited the Air Carrier Access Act, which
prohibits discrimination against disabled passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines must not serve peanuts in an allergic passenger's row
or in the rows immediately in front of and behind him, the
Transportation Department states in a letter sent to the nation's
10 largest carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that providing such a buffer zone is an adequate
modification to a carrier's normal in-flight food service and a
reasonable accommodation for the disability,'' the letter states.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the snack had a few salty words on the subject, and one
industry group _ the Peanut and Tree Nut Processors Association in
Potomac, Md. _ said it has already rallied the Washington legume
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more meddling and more loss of freedom of choice,'' said
Jack Darrett, mayor of the southeast-central Oklahoma town of
Holdenville, which billed itself as the Peanut Capital of the World
until private prisons and pork outpaced peanuts as its main
industry in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There was some applause from the peanut gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is potentially life-saving for the estimated 1
million to 2 million Americans who suffer from peanut allergies,
said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder of Food Allergy Network in
Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although most allergic people have to eat a peanut to have a
reaction, inhaling the airborne protein can be enough to affect
some, she said. That is especially true in an airplane, where
quarters are close, the air is recirculated and hundreds of people
are ripping open pressurized peanut packs at more or less the same
time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been reports in classrooms of children having
reactions to another kid having a peanut butter sandwich,'' said
Dr. Wesley Burks, a pediatric allergist in Little Rock who has
researched peanut allergies for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Burks called the order ``a reasonable guideline.''
</P>
<P>
   But the same measures do not need to be taken for other foods
that people are allergic to, such as milk or eggs, because those do
not cause airborne reactions, said Dr. Moonhee Lee, an area
allergist.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are not complaining, at least publicly. Fort
Worth-based American Airlines wasn't saying much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rarely serve peanuts on our flights. We really don't have
any other comment since we don't serve them that often,'' said a
woman in the airline's corporate communications office, who
declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Southwest Airlines was handling the snack snag with
panache worthy of Mr. Peanut himself, despite the budget carrier's
special link with the legume. Southwest ads have pictured peanuts
and stated: ``This is what our snacks look like. It's also what our
fares look like.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a passenger request, Southwest started banning
peanuts last year on any flight carrying an allergic passenger,
said Ginger Hardage, a spokeswoman. Passengers on those flights get
raisins instead.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest opted against restricting peanuts in seats around
allergic passengers because they could feel singled out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that guy in Row 12, that's why'' you can't have peanuts,
Hardage said with a laugh. ``We would never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the carrier still gets across its message of peanut pride.
Even on peanut-free flights, crews have handed out the nuts as
passengers deplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our culture,'' Hardage said. ``You can have your
peanuts to go.''

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The presidents of the United States and Russia, who recently met
in Moscow, are both in trouble. Some have called their meeting a
lame-duck summit.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, I believe the decision to meet was a sign of
responsibility. Dialogue must not be broken off, particularly at
such a difficult time.
 &HT;    Too bad the summit produced no tangible results. But the reason
for this failure is all too clear: Each man is politically weakened
because neither was able to engage in the kind of serious
self-criticism that was necessary.
 &HT;    It is also clear that both presidents bear a lot of
responsibility for Russia's plight. The West, and Bill Clinton in
particular, liked the Russian president, who had put an end to
communism and the USSR.
 &HT;    Yeltsin, in exchange for his reforms, expected mountains of gold
_ and, of course, ironclad political support. The West and Clinton
spoke of their support for democratic reforms and market
transition. In reality, as we now see, the democratic character of
those reforms was doubtful at best, and the so-called free market
has degenerated into a paper pyramid.
 &HT;    I doubt that no one was aware of this. Some in the West may have
hoped to benefit from a downwardly spiraling Russia in some way.
They now see that Russia does not suffer in isolation: Stock
exchanges throughout the world have taken some bad hits _ in part,
no one disputes, because of the Russian crisis.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, many Westerners, both those who have gained and those
who have lost, are ready to pack their bags and leave Russia. They
think that Russia cannot be trusted.
 &HT;    Well, they had better look in the mirror and think again. After
all, it was they who thought Russia could be treated like a
streetwalker. True, they were encouraged to do so by the Russian
leaders themselves, who took the country through ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    Others, apparently including President Clinton, believe that
Russia should not now be abandoned to face its troubles alone. This
is wise, although the realization came too late, after years of
pushing Russia down the path that has taken it to the brink of the
abyss.
 &HT;    Many are afraid that Russia could collapse into chaos. This fear
is not without reason. But it is essential to understand that
cooperation with Russia is in the best interests of the West.
 &HT;    Sooner or later _ I would say, sooner _ Russia will have a new
leadership that will not meekly accept prescriptions from others
and will have to be treated with respect. It will take decisions
consistent with Russia's national interests, which does not,
however, mean it will choose to ignore the ``rules of the global
market'' or tear up its obligations.
 &HT;    Remember that the Gorbachevs, Clintons, Yeltsins and others come
and go while the people of Russia, America, France, Italy, Mexico
and other nations remain, with their own history, traditions, and
all their merits and drawbacks.
 &HT;    I do understand that today it might seem odd to speak of
relations of equality with Russia, torn as it is by the economic
and moral crisis. But the past seven years have demonstrated that
America's biggest mistake would be to try to exploit its position
now as the only superpower. Fortunately for everyone, including
Americans, the coming century will not be an ``American century.''
 &HT;    The situation is at a breaking point; it can't go on like this.
For the second time in six years the Russians' incomes have been
cut in half. A chasm is widening between the small group of ruling
oligarchs and the people, who no longer trust anyone _ certainly
not the president, not his candidate for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin; nor does the Duma have much credibility.
 &HT;    This is a political crisis: the collapse, the agony of the
ruling regime. No behind-the-scenes dealings, no attempt to mend
matters through some intrigue, can succeed. Neither the bankrupt
politicians nor the tired, out-of-touch president can now save us.
 &HT;    I insist that the only way out is through simultaneous early
elections of the president and the Duma, coupled with a referendum
to amend the Constitution in order to reallocate powers between the
branches of federal government. Yeltsin's voluntary resignation
would open the way to a compromise allowing the formation of a
government of national salvation, capable of coping with the
emergency.
 &HT;    The choice is now stark. If early elections are not held, the
crisis will be resolved by street protests. Even setting the date
for elections would calm people, who would see in it the prospect
to express their will by civilized means.
 &HT;    The alternative to a peaceful course of events is chaos. I hope
the president understands that and is aware of the danger
confronting us all. His era is over, but he has a great chance to
go down in history by moving quickly to call early elections. The
longer he and his entourage cling to power, the greater will be the
danger of the country sliding into total chaos.
 &HT;    Commentators are saying that Russia lacks the caliber of people
who would be capable of restoring order without destroying
democracy or retreating from reforms. That is false. A ``new
center'' that rejects both orthodox communism and radical economic
liberalism does exist.
 &HT;    Its leaders, such as Yuri Luzhkov, Yegor Stroyev, Gregory
Yavlinski and some regional governors, enjoy a lot of public
support _ not in the shape of what would be a Western-style middle
class, but still an impressive array of social forces capable of
winning the elections.
 &HT;    The bodies of federal government formed by this new centrist
front, with the trust and support of the people, could lead Russia
out of our deteriorating crisis.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The presidents of the United States and Russia, who recently met
in Moscow, are both in trouble. Some have called their meeting a
lame-duck summit.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, I believe the decision to meet was a sign of
responsibility. Dialogue must not be broken off, particularly at
such a difficult time.
 &HT;    Too bad the summit produced no tangible results. But the reason
for this failure is all too clear: Each man is politically weakened
because neither was able to engage in the kind of serious
self-criticism that was necessary.
 &HT;    It is also clear that both presidents bear a lot of
responsibility for Russia's plight. The West, and Bill Clinton in
particular, liked the Russian president, who had put an end to
communism and the USSR.
 &HT;    Yeltsin, in exchange for his reforms, expected mountains of gold
_ and, of course, ironclad political support. The West and Clinton
spoke of their support for democratic reforms and market
transition. In reality, as we now see, the democratic character of
those reforms was doubtful at best, and the so-called free market
has degenerated into a paper pyramid.
 &HT;    I doubt that no one was aware of this. Some in the West may have
hoped to benefit from a downwardly spiraling Russia in some way.
They now see that Russia does not suffer in isolation: Stock
exchanges throughout the world have taken some bad hits _ in part,
no one disputes, because of the Russian crisis.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, many Westerners, both those who have gained and those
who have lost, are ready to pack their bags and leave Russia. They
think that Russia cannot be trusted.
 &HT;    Well, they had better look in the mirror and think again. After
all, it was they who thought Russia could be treated like a
streetwalker. True, they were encouraged to do so by the Russian
leaders themselves, who took the country through ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    Others, apparently including President Clinton, believe that
Russia should not now be abandoned to face its troubles alone. This
is wise, although the realization came too late, after years of
pushing Russia down the path that has taken it to the brink of the
abyss.
 &HT;    Many are afraid that Russia could collapse into chaos. This fear
is not without reason. But it is essential to understand that
cooperation with Russia is in the best interests of the West.
 &HT;    Sooner or later _ I would say, sooner _ Russia will have a new
leadership that will not meekly accept prescriptions from others
and will have to be treated with respect. It will take decisions
consistent with Russia's national interests, which does not,
however, mean it will choose to ignore the ``rules of the global
market'' or tear up its obligations.
 &HT;    Remember that the Gorbachevs, Clintons, Yeltsins and others come
and go while the people of Russia, America, France, Italy, Mexico
and other nations remain, with their own history, traditions, and
all their merits and drawbacks.
 &HT;    I do understand that today it might seem odd to speak of

America's biggest mistake would be to try to exploit its position

<P>
   The house I would most love to go home to is Sagamore Hill. As
an ardent visitor to museum-houses that offer glimpses of the
personal daily lives of their revered occupants, I feel that
Theodore Roosevelt's beloved estate in Oyster Bay on New York's
Long Island, more than any other, seems the perfect home in which
to have grown up.
</P>
<P>
   This rambling brick, stone and wood house close to Long Island
Sound is a storybook set piece of eaved attic aeries, bay windows,
rainbow glints of stained glass, and surprise rooms whimsically
tucked into unexpected corners across three floors. A child could
feel luxuriously lost and unobserved in one of those rooms yet
totally secure, with instant companionship or genuine help within
easy shouting distance.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a hilltop and completed in 1885, TR's favorite home, the
summer White House from 1902 to 1909, feels not only nurturing and
comfortable but also vaguely mysterious, what with its miles of
books, dark wood paneling, massive furniture and the hundreds of
exotic artifacts collected by a staunch family man who was a
politician, a rancher, a reader and writer; a naturalist and a
conservationist yet also a big-game hunter; a Nobel Prize-winning
peacemaker and a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   It was because of Colonel Roosevelt's role as an organizer of
the Rough Riders cavalry unit during the Spanish-American War in
1898 that I was reminded of Sagamore Hill. The 100th anniversary of
that conflict has been commemorated by several exhibitions this
year, including two on the Rough Riders in Montauk, where 28,000
U.S. troops were quarantined on their return from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After roughly an hour-and-a-quarter drive from Manhattan to the
estate, my husband and I found it refreshing to walk the winding
path to the front door of the house, past rolling lawns and a
windmill that provided power when this was a working farm, taking
seriously the Roosevelt family motto, ``Qui plantauit curabit.''
(``He who plants, preserves.'') There are majestic shade trees that
include red-blossoming chestnuts and a monumental copper beech at
the house entrance, planted about 1894, perhaps under the eye of TR
himself.
</P>
<P>
   With 90,000 visitors to the estate each year, the National Park
Service has developed hourly tours conducted by well-trained
guides. We had the pleasure of a private tour with Amy Verone, the
amiable and impeccably informed curator. In addition, having reread
portions of ``Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography,'' I felt as
though he were whispering hints about his favorite spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love all the seasons,'' he wrote, ``the snows and bare
woods of winter; the rush of growing things and the blossom-spray
of spring; the yellow grain, the ripening fruits and tasseled corn,
and the deep leafy shades that are heralded by the `green dance of
summer'; and the sharp fall winds that tear the brilliant banners
with which the trees greet the dying year. . . . We have great
fireplaces, and in them, the logs roar and crackle during the long
winter evenings. The big piazza is for the hot, still afternoons of
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Picturing Roosevelt
</P>
<P>
   It is in summer on that expansive gray porch he called a piazza
that I picture the bombastic Roosevelt, comfortably seated in a
rocker, sipping a cool drink to the sound of low voices, in
conversations with his wife or children or, often in the long,
light evenings, with his staff members and guests. That porch was
also the stage from which TR addressed gathered visitors: foreign
dignitaries, Boy Scouts and, during political campaigns, neighbors
who were potential voters. All would gather on the big lawn that
stretched back to a daisy field, which Ms. Verone said is soon to
be restored. Alas, the former view of the Sound cannot be had, as a
forest of trees obscured it long ago.
</P>
<P>
   To a reader, Sagamore Hill is still a paradise, with about 6,000
of the family's original 9,000 titles safely in residence.
Roosevelt had strong views on books and objected to recommended
reading lists in a way especially pertinent now. ``I have no
sympathy whatever with writing lists of One Hundred Best Books,''
he wrote. ``There is no such thing as a hundred books that are best
for all men, or for the majority of men, or for one man at all
times.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as books were loved at Sagamore Hill, TR notes that
``children are even better.'' He must have loved children to
contend with not only his own 5, but the 16 cousins who often
visited, including, on occasion, the young Eleanor Roosevelt, who
stayed in a second-floor guest room.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of Sagamore Hill's attractions is the colorful,
ebullient McKinley era it evokes. That period's style and tone
extended beyond the assassination of President William McKinley in
1901, when, as vice president, Roosevelt took office. He then won
another four-year term in 1905. It was a time of opulent high
living, at least for the rich, and a feast for food lovers. Women
were admired for curvaceous hourglass figures, typified by Lillian
Russell; and the trencherman Diamond Jim Brady reportedly primed
his appetite for dinner with three dozen oysters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a period epitomized by ``Life With Father,'' which opened
in 1939 and was the first Broadway play I saw. Written by Howard
Lindsay and Russel Crouse, its seven-year run remains the longest
for a nonmusical show in Broadway history. It was set in a
Manhattan town house that could have been inspired by the one at 28
E. 20th St., where Theodore Roosevelt was born on Oct. 27, 1858. He
is the only New York City native to become president. The town
house is now also a museum, a faithful 1923 reproduction of the
original 19th-century Roosevelt home filled with ornate furnishings
and bric-a-brac, much like those in the ``Life With Father'' stage
sets.

 &HT;    CLINTON TELLS IRISH TO SEIZE CHANCE AT PEACE, RECEIVES WARM
WELCOME
 &HT;    With IRELAND-PEACE-0904; IRELAND-PRIMER-0904.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland _ President Bill Clinton on Thursday
called upon the people of Northern Ireland to seize the fragile
hope of peace before it fades away.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to business and political leaders in Belfast,
Clinton described the opportunity for peace as a fleeting moment.
``Do not let it slip away,'' he said. ``It will not come again in
our lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between the perplexing economic crisis in Russia and
an uncertain return home, the trip to Ireland must seem a tonic to
the besieged president. Clinton spent his first of three days here
revisiting the city of perhaps the high point of his presidency. He
plans to end it Saturday with a round of golf before heading back
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He began the day with the warmly received speech before a
friendly Belfast crowd and ended it shaking hands at a festive
gathering in the heart of this small town.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a day touched by sobering realities. The biggest
threat to the still-fragile peace process came last month in the
small town of Omagh, where members of a splinter group known as the
Real IRA detonated a 500-pound car bomb in the busy market center
killing 28 and wounding more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton visited Omagh in the
afternoon and spoke to families of the victims. People stood six
deep along the route of the presidential party, and some children
waived American flags. The Clintons visited the bomb crater on
Market Street, and laid a wreath and presented a plaque to the
bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   George Maxwell, his daughter on his shoulders, stood in the
crowd and marveled at the moment. ``He's here because 28 people
were butchered, two baby girls, a mother heavily pregnant with
twins, children -- so many children,'' Maxwell told the Associated
Press. ``It's an amazing moment, wrapped up in all this unspeakable
horror. You're pleased he's here. You wish he'd no reason to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recreation hall gymnasium that served as a makeshift crisis
center immediately after the bombing, Clinton expressed sympathy to
about 500 relatives of victims. He spoke privately to a 14-year-old
girl who was blinded in the attack and her mother, a radiologist
who was on duty the day of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all of you, we thank you for standing up in the face of
such a soul-searing loss and restating your determination to walk
the road of peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that the bombing, rather than undermining the
peace process, actually bolstered it. ``By killing Catholics and
Protestants, young and old, men women and children, even those
about to be born, people from Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic and abroad, it galvanized, strengthened and humanized the
impulse to peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, Clinton was praised for his role in laying the
foundation for peace. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that
no other American president has contributed so much to securing
peace for the troubled island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no president of the United States of America that has
done more for peace than you,'' Blair said. ``The people of
Northern Ireland owe you a debt, a deep debt of gratitude. And if
this process ends where we want it to end, in lasting peace in
Northern Ireland, then when the history of that peace is written,
your place in it will be assured.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke in the gleaming new Waterfront Hall, which has
been constructed on what in the president's 1995 visit was a
derelict district of the city by the River Lagan. The hall is
regarded as a symbol for the renaissance of Northern Ireland after
30 years of sectarian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was greeted warmly at each stop, nothing matched
the electricity in 1995 when tens of thousands filled Donegal Place
in front of Belfast City Hall to watch Clinton light the city's
Christmas Tree.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest thing came in Armagh, the spiritual heart of
Ireland, where he seemed to draw energy from the enthusiastic crowd
of 20,000 gathered on a cricket field to hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding almost as a candidate on the stump, Clinton's voice
lifted as he recited the world's intractable conflicts -- those in
the Middle East, Kosovo and Africa -- and said they could all learn
from the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not tell me it has to be this way,'' he said. ``Look at
Northern Ireland.''

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC CRISIS CONFIRMED THE BAD NEWS FOR
INVESTORS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-POLITICS-0904.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than a year after the Asian economies of
Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand were sucked into a
tailspin, Wall Street mostly yawned, shrugged and continued to
spiral upward.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did the collapse of Russia's $360-billion economy --
roughly the economic output of the Netherlands -- finally trigger
the Dow's devastating late summer slide?
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound, but the long and short of it is that the Dow
was overdue for a fall and Russia's woes, serious as they are,
merely confirmed for increasingly skeptical investors that the
world's emerging markets -- abetted by systemic and chronic ills in
Japan -- are undergoing a painful shakeout not likely to resolve
itself soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 17 months, after all, since Federal Reserve Board
chairman Alan Greenspan issued his now famous warning that the
stock market was experiencing ''irrational exuberance.'' That's
central banker talk for: Wall Street's shifted from an investment
pool to a casino, and anyone who throws money at it now is acting
more on faith than on reasoned analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's slide from its mid-July highs has been a reminder
to some that investors are paid for putting their money at risk.
What goes up can indeed come down.
</P>
<P>
   The slide had already begun, cautiously to be sure, weeks before
the Russian ruble collapsed on Aug. 17. In the days that followed,
though, investors became increasingly agitated, not only by the
promise of unpaid Russian debts and economic strife in Moscow, but
also by the threat of social and political chaos in a country that
saw its entire system evaporate less than eight years ago and, for
the past 11 days, has been limping along with a sharply divided
parliament and without a government.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of anarchy in a former superpower that still
maintains the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal tends to set
people's teeth on edge -- considerably more so than the prospect of
default on Russian loans.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Russia's economy become the next domino to fall in the
global financial crisis, however, is disconcerting news to
investors who have predicated much of their risk on the premise of
ever-growing world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors tend to buy stocks on the prospect of good news.
Scanning the emerging markets -- from Asia to Latin America, to
Africa and to the former Soviet States -- many have concluded that
there's more bad news at the moment than good.
</P>
<P>
   The next shoe to drop, moreover, could well be in China, where
export-driven growth is threatened by its neighbors' currency
devaluations. The 800-pound gorilla of the region, China could send
all of Asia tumbling further into the economic basement by
devaluing its own currency, the renminbi, though Beijing has
repeatedly vowed not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling emerging markets out of their torpor is a job for the
engines of the industrialized world. And while the economies of the
United States and Europe are healthy, the sick man, Japan, is very
sick indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Its economy, the second-largest in the world, has been flat for
seven of the past eight years and is now in recession.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed to pull it out are dramatic reforms Japanese
politicians have been ducking for decades that would tip the
balance of power away from producers and toward consumers, thereby
encouraging domestic-led growth.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in Washington, a man named Keizo Obuchi, then Japan's
foreign minister, chuckled when reporters asked him whether Japan
was concerned that the falling yen would spike the annual trade gap
-- more than $50 billion in Japan's favor -- that has caused so
much friction between Tokyo and Washington over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan would simply export its way out of its woes, Obuchi said,
noting wryly that the United States was plenty rich enough to
absorb the added imports that strategy would imply.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the yen has slumped further, and Obuchi is now the
country's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   His recommendations of the last year will doubtless come under
scrutiny Friday night and Saturday, when his finance minister,

 UNDATED: stage sets.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treats and Treasure
</P>
<P>
   No rooms at Sagamore Hill suggest the spirit of good living more
than the big homey kitchen and the inviting dining room in which it
would be fun to cook and then eat a Thanksgiving dinner. Its
wood-paneled pantry holds an iron safe that once protected jewelry,
state papers and the household sugar. With a wood- and coal-burning
stove set into a fireplace opening, the kitchen would send forth
the tantalizing aromas of roasting meats and buttery baking pies.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room, light from opalescent glass sconces sparkles
against vermilion walls to light the carved wood Florentine table,
sideboard and Dante chairs. I imagine the large family happily and
hungrily wandering in from the cozily lighted entrance foyer, which
was the living room before the house was expanded, or from the
cavernous north room with its beamed ceiling and an entrance arch
formed by two soaring elephant tusks.
</P>
<P>
   This last addition to the house, with its snug alcove study,
holds some of the cherished gifts Roosevelt noted in his
autobiography: a bronze Remington sculpture, ``The Bronco Buster'';
a Tiffany silver vase; a Japanese suit of armor from Admiral Togo,
``a favorite hero.'' There are also rare books, paintings and
prints, and a gruesome collection of animal trophies, including
mounted heads, a rhino-foot inkwell and an elephant-foot
wastebasket.
</P>
<P>
   More cheerful are a mantelpiece, desks and chests of darkly
gleaming Philippine wood sent by Army friends, and, as a gift from
the City of Philadelphia, a copy of the chair George Washington
occupied during the Constitutional Convention. Even more
spectacular is the dark, thronelike governor's chair that Roosevelt
used in Albany and took home with him.
</P>
<P>
   If a well-mannered sherry was served before dinner, it might
have been in the only really feminine and delicate room in the
entire house: the blue-and-white drawing room. (``Is drawing room a
more appropriate name than parlor?'' TR asks in his autobiography.)
</P>
<P>
   This was the preserve of his second wife, the elegantly graceful
Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt, and is furnished with her family
pieces. No one could enter this room uninvited, with the exception
of pets stopping by for water from the wide blue Delft bowl always
beneath Mrs. Roosevelt's writing table.
</P>
<P>
   Soup to Nuts, in Style
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Sagamore Hill Thanksgiving menu, as recorded in
``The American Heritage Cookbook'' (1964), began with oysters,
celery, olives and radishes; went on to consomme, and then
proceeded to not only turkey with stuffing and giblet gravy but
also roast suckling pig, which was a favorite of Roosevelt and his
eldest daughter, Alice. Garnishes included relishes, four
vegetables and salad. Desserts were mince and pumpkin pies, ice
cream, nuts, fruits and chocolate dragees.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Roosevelt was dubbed a gourmand in a magazine article,
a charge to which he responded, ``When anyone desires to make a
widespread impression that the president and family sit down to a
4- or 5-course breakfast, a 6- or 7-course lunch and a 10-course
dinner, the president feels that a denial is not inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   As innocent as such a presidential denial seems by today's
standards, it did not stop counteraccusations of gluttony. There
were reports that a simple meal for TR might be a whole chicken and
a quart of milk, and that ``chicken and milk were by no means the
only things served,'' while others recalled the president stoking
up as prodigiously as a machine and putting seven lumps of sugar in
the presidential coffee, served in a cup that his son Theodore Jr.
described as ``more in the nature of a bathtub.''
</P>
<P>
   An Unusual Hideaway
</P>
<P>
   What I can also imagine is falling asleep after such meals,
perhaps on the sofa under the sloping ceiling of the attic gun
room, TR's hideaway workplace (he thought it had the loveliest view
in the house and the most books), as the late afternoon sun casts a
deep golden glow over walls and shining gun cases. Or perhaps I'd
nap in the comforting rocker in the hushed library as a fire
sputtered in the low, wide fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   On the walls, etchings and paintings depict William and Henry of
Orange and Erasmus, heroes to Roosevelt, whose ancestors were
Dutch. They also appear to be nodding off, although one wide-awake
stalwart is TR's father, Theodore Roosevelt Sr., whom his son
considered ``the best man I have ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other accomplishments, the senior Roosevelt was the
driving force behind the establishment of the American Museum of
Natural History in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   TR himself might have gone up to the master bedroom, there to
catch 40 winks in his massive bed, whose head- and footboards of
honey-gold bird's-eye maple, hand carved with stylized stars and
sunflowers, look peculiarly Hawaiian, although they were made in
Philadelphia. These was among the treasures Roosevelt took to
Sagamore Hill from his family's home at 6 W. 57th St. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a smaller, peaceful bedroom that Theodore Roosevelt
died at 60, on Jan. 6, 1919, a day after saying to his wife, ``I
wonder if you will ever know how I love Sagamore Hill.'' Apparently
Mrs. Roosevelt felt the same way. She lived on in the house for
another 29 years, dying there in 1948 at the age of 87.
</P>
<P>
   A woodsy path leads to the Old Orchard Museum, displaying much
memorabilia, both personal and presidential. It is all well
arranged in the Georgian-style house, built in 1938 as the home of
Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., including the Nobel medal TR was given
for his role as peacemaker in the war between Russia and Japan in
1905, his Rough Rider hat and sword, childhood chocolate pot and
toys, political posters and banners for his Republican and
Bullmoose campaigns, as well as a worn piece of stationery on which
he scribbled his ideas for the Sagamore Hill house.
</P>
<P>
   He originally planned to name the house Leeholm, for his first
wife, Alice Lee. Tragically, she died after giving birth to their
daughter, Alice, in 1884, a year before the house was finished. TR
then decided to honor Sagamore Mohannis, a local Indian chief who
signed away his tribe's rights to the land.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the parking lot, we browsed through the neat
little bookstore in the gatehouse with its books, pamphlets, games
and souvenirs, which included cuddly stuffed teddy bears, named for
Theodore Roosevelt. Behind the shop is a pleasant picnic area that
made us regret not having brought a modest box lunch.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile down the road from Sagamore Hill is the grave site
of TR and Edith Roosevelt in Young's Memorial Cemetery. It is a
pretty walk up a small hill, past worn, aging headstones, ending at
the gated, leafy grave with its modest markings.

LATIN LOVED: FANS WORSHIP `IDOL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Frank Sinatra remains the Chairman of the Board.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen is the Boss.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Latin music world, one man overshadows them both.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gabriel is known as nothing less than ``El Idolo de las
Multitudes'' _ the Idol of the Multitudes _ to legions of fans
spanning North, Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   How big is his star? ``Gigante''.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel drew 75,000 fans to the Pasadena Rose Bowl for a concert
in 1994, and he's outsold crossover star Gloria Estefan in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A legendary showman, Gabriel's signature is a Vegas-proportioned
shows backed by an orchestra and mariachi band.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the few artists who injects a great enthusiasm
into the audience. From the first song, they start to dance,'' says
Humberto Preciado, a radio host for Spanish-language KSUN-AM (1400)
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Just shy of 50, Gabriel maintains the dimpled smile of an aging
cherub and delivers a dramatic, energy-packed show befitting a
Latin legend. Partial to glitz _ rhinestones and fur a la Liberace
_ he sends audiences into a frenzy as he camps it up onstage.
</P>
<P>
   But it's his songs, some spun of passion, others filled with
feel-good rhythms, that have pulled in the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``His music gets you right at the ``corazon'' (heart),'' says
Sonia Moreno, a Phoenix receptionist, explaining her idol's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel does pour sentiment into much of his music. Songs like
the emotion-packed ballad ``Amor Eterno'' (``Eternal Love''), which
Gabriel wrote in memory of his mother, and ``Hasta Que Te Conoci''
(``Until I Met You'') have become Mexican standards.
</P>
<P>
   But his superstar status is due to more than just a few
tear-jerkers. The Mexican-born Gabriel is also adored as one of
Latin America's most versatile and accomplished songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   During his 27 years on the charts, Gabriel has penned more than
500 songs ranging from love ballads to pop tunes to mariachi songs.
</P>
<P>
   It's the variety of his music that's helped Gabriel attract a
loyal following spanning several generations.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel grew up just across from Texas in the border town of
Juarez. He was the youngest of 10 children raised largely by his
mother, who worked as a housekeeper for a rich family in town.
Gabriel now owns the mansion she worked in.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Gabriel got his start in nightclubs on Juarez's
seedy downtown strip. A shrine to Juarez's famous son now adorns
the window of El Noa Noa, the bar made famous by a Gabriel hit tune
that recalls the early days when he'd sing while patrons danced.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel's first hit in 1971 was ``No Tengo Dinero'' (``I Have No
Money'').
</P>
<P>
   His rise to stardom from obscurity has contributed to the
Gabriel mystique. Now, his fans say Gabriel has assured his place
among the biggest names in showbiz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is part of our culture,'' Elias says. &QL;

<P>
   Adjacent is the bird sanctuary, which no doubt Theodore
Roosevelt would have approved of. It is the oldest Audubon bird
preserve in the United States, with buildings housing natural
history specimens dear to the heart of TR, aviaries with birds of
prey and 12 acres of sanctuary trails.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Anne-Style Office
</P>
<P>
   There are a few more evidences of Roosevelt in Oyster Bay, a
surprisingly shabby and lackluster town considering its history
dating back to pre-Revolutionary days and the wealth of the
surrounding community.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is the ramshackle little Earle-Wightman
House, with its original room dating from about 1720. In it are the
very casual offices of the Oyster Bay Historical Society, where we
found the useful booklet ``A Walking Tour of Oyster Bay'' as well
as other pamphlets, maps and information.
</P>
<P>
   Thus armed, we began at one of the better kept sights, the Moore
Building, a turn-of-the-century office building in the late-Queen
Anne style with a witch's hat tower. Its second floor served as
secretarial offices for President Roosevelt from 1903 to 1908, when
telephone and telegraph hot lines were linked to the White House
and Sagamore Hill. In the enticing Book Mark Cafe on the street
level, one can browse among new and used titles and have a
restorative light meal, outdoors or in.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting old house in the town proved to be Raynham
Hall, built in the saltbox style for the Townsend family in 1738.
An Italianate-Victorian wing was added in the late 19th century by
a grandson, Solomon. There is also a 1916 photograph of Theodore
Roosevelt, who was a friend of Maurice Townsend, the last family
member to live in Raynham Hall. Engaging rooms from both periods
are fairly well preserved, and there are many documents testifying
to the considerable role the Townsends played in several espionage
intrigues of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After Sagamore Hill, the most enchanting sight in Oyster Bay is
the Planting Fields Arboretum, a magnificent botanical garden with
400 acres of lawns, flower beds and woodlands, a celebrated heather
garden and greenhouses, one of which is said to hold the largest
collection of camellia specimens in North America, with blooms at
their peak from late February through early April. Other lovely
greenhouses are dedicated to cactus, orchids and African plants.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a quintessential Gold Coast estate, begun in 1904 and
purchased by William Robertson Coe in 1913, the grounds were
landscaped mostly by the Olmsted Brothers firm. Now a state
historic park and on the National Register of Historic Districts,
the arboretum includes gift shops (one in the stunning stone
Tudor-Revival Coe Hall), plant shops, lectures and classes for
adults and children, as well as jazz, pop and classical concerts
throughout the year. Calling on the Vanderbilts
</P>
<P>
   To make a really full day on the beautiful North Shore with its
bays, marinas and wooded thickets, and because we wanted to try an
early dinner at the highly touted Mill River Inn, we decided to see
another museum house, one that recalled a life style totally
different from that of Sagamore Hill. We drove east to Centerport,
about 30 to 45 minutes from Oyster Bay, to the Vanderbilt Museum
Historic Mansion and Planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   Built in stages between 1906 and 1936, this lavish
strawberries-and-cream architectural confection typified the excess
of the Gold Coast during its Roaring '20s heyday. It was the summer
home of William K. Vanderbilt II, great-grandson of Commodore
Cornelius Vanderbilt, the founder of the family fortune, and was
named the Eagles' Nest.
</P>
<P>
   The house and its surrounding grounds overlook Long Island
Sound, where Vanderbilt could gaze at his favorite yacht, Alva. The
estate is adorned with columns from the ruins of Carthage, Belgian
blocks salvaged from New York City streets for a driveway, carved
Spanish doors, Portuguese tiles, Flemish chairs, French needlepoint
and, in the romantic courtyard where plays and concerts are held in
summer, a rococo 19th-century bell tower from Russia. It is a
fantasy of a Spanish-Mediterranean villa and, surprisingly, all of
the rooms are so eminently livable that if I had grown up at
Sagamore Hill, I might choose an easygoing change of pace and spend
my adult summers here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the graceful, comfortable family parlors and
bedrooms and the gloriously moderne bathrooms, there is a large
natural history museum on the ground floor of the house, displaying
the marine life Vanderbilt assiduously collected. Other buildings
hold animal models, more sea specimens in the Hall of Fishes, and
an insect collection near the gift shop. We walked through gardens
back to the entrance and the planetarium, disappointed that no sky
show was scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I left wondering what it would be like to join one of the
afternoon teas held in the mansion, where the paying audience
nibbles and sips while actors portray Vanderbilt family members and
contemporaries. Among the characters scheduled to appear in
September and October are Rosamond, William's second wife, chatting
with his sister, Consuelo, who became the Duchess of Marlborough,
and, later, Mae West, the last person one would expect to see
raising a pinky at a tea party.

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC CRISIS CONFIRMED THE BAD NEWS FOR
INVESTORS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-POLITICS-0904.

categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than a year after the Asian economies of
Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand were sucked into a
tailspin, Wall Street mostly yawned, shrugged and continued to
spiral upward.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did the collapse of Russia's $360-billion economy --
roughly the economic output of the Netherlands -- finally trigger
the Dow's devastating late summer slide?
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound, but the long and short of it is that the Dow
was overdue for a fall and Russia's woes, serious as they are,
merely confirmed for increasingly skeptical investors that the
world's emerging markets -- abetted by systemic and chronic ills in
Japan -- are undergoing a painful shakeout not likely to resolve
itself soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 17 months, after all, since Federal Reserve Board
chairman Alan Greenspan issued his now famous warning that the
stock market was experiencing ''irrational exuberance.'' That's
central banker talk for: Wall Street's shifted from an investment
pool to a casino, and anyone who throws money at it now is acting
more on faith than on reasoned analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's slide from its mid-July highs has been a reminder
to some that investors are paid for putting their money at risk.
What goes up can indeed come down.
</P>
<P>
   The slide had already begun, cautiously to be sure, weeks before
the Russian ruble collapsed on Aug. 17. In the days that followed,
though, investors became increasingly agitated, not only by the
promise of unpaid Russian debts and economic strife in Moscow, but
also by the threat of social and political chaos in a country that
saw its entire system evaporate less than eight years ago and, for
the past 11 days, has been limping along with a sharply divided
parliament and without a government.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of anarchy in a former superpower that still
maintains the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal tends to set
people's teeth on edge -- considerably more so than the prospect of
default on Russian loans.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Russia's economy become the next domino to fall in the
global financial crisis, however, is disconcerting news to
investors who have predicated much of their risk on the premise of
ever-growing world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors tend to buy stocks on the prospect of good news.
Scanning the emerging markets -- from Asia to Latin America, to
Africa and to the former Soviet States -- many have concluded that
there's more bad news at the moment than good.
</P>
<P>
   The next shoe to drop, moreover, could well be in China, where
export-driven growth is threatened by its neighbors' currency
devaluations. The 800-pound gorilla of the region, China could send
all of Asia tumbling further into the economic basement by
devaluing its own currency, the renminbi, though Beijing has
repeatedly vowed not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling emerging markets out of their torpor is a job for the
engines of the industrialized world. And while the economies of the
United States and Europe are healthy, the sick man, Japan, is very
sick indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Its economy, the second-largest in the world, has been flat for
seven of the past eight years and is now in recession.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed to pull it out are dramatic reforms Japanese
politicians have been ducking for decades that would tip the
balance of power away from producers and toward consumers, thereby
encouraging domestic-led growth.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in Washington, a man named Keizo Obuchi, then Japan's
foreign minister, chuckled when reporters asked him whether Japan
was concerned that the falling yen would spike the annual trade gap
-- more than $50 billion in Japan's favor -- that has caused so
much friction between Tokyo and Washington over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan would simply export its way out of its woes, Obuchi said,
noting wryly that the United States was plenty rich enough to
absorb the added imports that strategy would imply.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the yen has slumped further, and Obuchi is now the
country's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   His recommendations of the last year will doubtless come under
scrutiny Friday night and Saturday, when his finance minister,
Kiichi Miyazawa, meets in San Francisco with Greenspan and U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   If the three most powerful finance officials in the world can't
come to terms with a way out of the global economic crisis, there
could be more dark days ahead for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   As Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa told the Associated
Press on Friday, ''We're all holding our breath.''

   Visiting TR's Turf
</P>
<P>
   Here is information about visiting Sagamore Hill in Oyster Bay,
N.Y., and other Long Island attractions nearby, as well as the
Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace in Manhattan. ``Theodore Roosevelt:
An Autobiography,'' first published in 1913 and then again in 1985
by DaCapo Press, is a loving, welcoming guide to both Roosevelt
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island Attractions
</P>
<P>
   SAGAMORE HILL, 20 Sagamore Hill Road, at Cove Neck Road, Oyster
Bay, (516) 922-4447. Theodore Roosevelt's much-beloved home (with
95 percent of its furnishings original) was built in 1885 at a cost
of $16,975 and served as the summer White House from 1902 to 1909.
Today it attracts some 90,000 visitors a year. With 23 rooms
rambling through three floors, it is the epitome of the
turn-of-the-century American home of the privileged, filled with
books, big-game trophies, commodious furniture and intriguing
personal and Presidential souvenirs. The Old Orchard Museum on the
grounds is attractively laid out in the 1938 Georgian-style home of
TR's son Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. There is a gift shop and a
picnic area. Hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., daily from April through
October; Wednesdays through Sundays the remaining months. Closed
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Guided tours begin
every half-hour, starting at 10 a.m., with the last one leaving at
4 p.m. Admission: $5; free for those 16 and under.
</P>
<P>
   THEODORE ROOSEVELT GRAVE SITE AND SANCTUARY, 134 Cove Road, at
Cove Neck Road, Oyster Bay, (516) 922-3200. About one mile down the
road from Sagamore Hill, the graves of President and Mrs. Roosevelt
are peacefully set behind an iron gate in hilly, leafy Young's
Memorial Cemetery. Adjacent is the country's oldest Audubon bird

Robertson Coe family in 1913 and was landscaped between 1918 and
1944. It is now a verdant state historic park of more than 400

   OYSTER BAY HISTORICAL SOCIETY, Earle-Wightman House, 20 Summit
St., Oyster Bay, (516) 922-5032. Dating from about 1720 (and much
in need of sprucing up), this house has two minimally interesting
period rooms, one from about 1740, the other an 1830's addition.
There is a research library with material about the area, as well

   RAYNHAM HALL HISTORIC HOUSE MUSEUM, 20 West Main St., Oyster
Bay, (516) 922-6808. Dating from the American Revolution, with a
Victorian addition from the late 19th century, this is a charming,
low-key museum of period rooms. Documents and artifacts go back to

confection of a Spanish villa, was the summer home of William K.
Vanderbilt 2d, built between 1910 and 1935. Devoting himself to
marine biology, Vanderbilt collected the specimens of sea life
displayed here. There are other natural history specimens in other

</P>
<P>
   Places to Eat
</P>
<P>
   BOOK MARK CAFE, 1 E. Main St., Oyster Bay, (516) 922-0036. An
inviting and well-stocked bookstore with new and used titles is the
setting for a friendly cafe serving lunch, tea, dinner and weekend
brunches. Suitably light sandwiches and salads are preferable to
more ambitious cooked dishes. Save room for the homespun fresh
berries with whipped cream heaped onto scones. The cafe is in the
Moore Building, with a late-Queen Anne tower and mansard roof
dating from 1902. The second floor served as the secretarial
offices of TR's summer White House from 1903 to 1908. Lunch for two
with tip came to $23.
</P>
<P>
   MILL RIVER INN, 160 Mill River Road, Oyster Bay, (516) 922-7768.
About five minutes from the arboretum, this formal, atmospheric
restaurant with mellow lighting and decorative floral photographs
is an option for anyone who wants to have a restful early dinner
before heading home. Food is stylishly modern and, if not quite up
to the rave reviews it has enjoyed, above average, especially in
this area. Good choices included a creamy asparagus soup,
satisfying smoked duck with Asian garnishes, credible roast lamb
and an apple-raisin tart. An appetizer of tiny crab cakes with a
potato pancake would have been fine if served properly hot. Service
is efficient but coolly detached. Dress ranges from jackets and
ties to what the management calls ``neat casual,'' so throw a
jacket and a pair of dress shoes into the car for a
post-sightseeing costume change. A three-course dinner for two,
with two glasses of wine, came to about $145 with tip. Dinner from
6 p.m. to about 9 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays; from 5 p.m. on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>

belonging to close relatives. A gallery in an adjoining building
holds personal and presidential memorabilia. Saturday, Sept. 5, at
2 p.m. there will be a chamber music concert, free with admission.

<P>
   UNDATED - There is a fine line between devotion and obsession.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeanette Lee, upon that line is balanced a cue stick. Every
day, every hour it hovers precariously between healthy enthusiasm
and destructive fixation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is one of the best pool players in the nation, in the world
for that matter. She prowls that small patch of green felt like a
tiger smelling fresh meat _ and will do just so at the Penn Ray
WPBA Phoenix Classic, running today through Sunday at Bucky's
Casino in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been dubbed the Black Widow not only because of her
preferred color in fashion, but also because of the killer instinct
that takes over once she looks down the shaft of a cue.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell the first person she nearly destroyed at a
pool table was herself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Lee, born and raised in New York City, was a typical
18-year-old who had no idea what she wanted to be when she grew up.
After landing a job at a software company, she thought about
attending college and becoming a teacher. Or maybe not. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   That was before colleagues insisted she join them at a new pool
hall in town. It was big and oh so trendy.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how a night out can alter the rest of your life. Not one
detail of that visit has escaped Lee's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I walked into this incredibly crowded pool room, an
old man caught my eye,'' Lee says from her offices in Cincinnati.
``As I watched him, the people and the music faded away. Pretty
soon all I could hear was the sound of his breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so mesmerized by everything he did, the way he lined up
his shots, how one shot led perfectly to another. Everything was so
simple and yet so perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee never picked up a cue stick that evening. It would be the
last pool-free night of her life.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the pool hall the next day and spent a few hours
learning the felt-covered ropes. It was long enough to know she'd
found her passion. It wasn't long before it was an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Nights at the pool table stretched into early mornings. At one
point she played 37 hours straight before collapsing. Friends had
to carry her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something there, a chemistry,'' Lee says. ``My life
became pool. Nothing else mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   One day led to another. Lee can't remember times she didn't have
a cue in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   It started to take a toll. Lee suffers from scoliosis, and at
times her back pain became insufferable. She became sick for days
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was play pool,'' Lee says. ``I didn't eat, I didn't
sleep. Finally I said, `OK, I've got to stay within reality here.'
I had to take care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first few years, she gave no thought to money or a
career. Until she entered a regional tournament and won. And won
another. And another.
</P>
<P>
   Doors she never knew existed opened to her. In 1993 she
qualified for the Women's Professional Billiards Association tour.
She'd become incredibly good incredibly fast.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years Lee has won several WPBA tournaments
and has become one of the tour's most popular players. Ranked third
on the tour, she is as busy making personal appearances as she is
competing. She maintains her own Web site (www.jeanettelee.com) and
heads the Jeanette Lee Foundation, a charitable organization.
</P>
<P>
   As busy as she is traveling and meeting fans, she still has a
hobby _ playing pool. In her spare time she likes to play pool. To
relax, she plays pool.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love the game,'' Lee says. ``I'd rather play than go to
a movie or go dancing or whatever. It's just that now I no longer
play to exhaustion.'' &QL;

CAPTAIN'S LOG: WE'RE BACK AND, BOY, ARE WE YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past, the future looked different. It was simpler than
the present future, with brighter colors.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can again experience the past future, thanks to the
return this week of the original ``Star Trek'' series. It never
really went away. For more than 30 years, those episodes have been
careering across the television galaxies, with the crew of the
starship Enterprise doomed to repeat (and repeat and repeat) every
one of its 79 adventures. Eighty, if you count the pilot, which was
not shown but soon will be.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is this: The Sci-Fi Channel has dusted off the
original three seasons of ``Star Trek,'' replacing the minutes lost
to extra commercials during the years of syndication and adding new
introductions by the series' star, William Shatner (whose voice has
mysteriously dropped three octaves in three decades), and some
brief comments by other people who worked on the shows.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Sci-Fi began showing those episodes, first broadcast
on NBC from 1966 through 1969, in their original order, one each
weeknight at 7:30. (After showing the pilot, which had a mostly
different cast, the channel will offer all the shows again, with
Shatner's co-star, Leonard Nimoy, as host.)
</P>
<P>
   Friday night brings the fourth episode, ``The Naked Time,''
which Shatner says is revered by ``Star Trek'' devotees for the
dramatic scene in which he, as Captain Kirk, and Nimoy, as his
invaluable aide, Spock, grimly smack each other in the face.
(They're under the influence of a dread space disease that strips
its victims of their inhibitions and causes profuse sweating and
waves of ponderous overacting.)
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly enough, it is also the episode in which, during a
desperate effort to escape an imploding (or is it exploding?)
planet, the Enterprise for the first time experiences a speed so
fast that the ship can outrun time.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has, despite obstacles more frightening than that
space disease. Like critics.
</P>
<P>
   As Shatner notes with a wry laugh in his introduction to the
first episode, ``The Man Trap,'' ``Star Trek'' was hardly a hit in
1966. One of the unimpressed reviewers called it ``a dreary mess of
confusion,'' Shatner notes, but ``like so many critics, they're
gone, and we're still here.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's original opening sequence said the Enterprise was on
a five-year mission of exploration. Wishful thinking. The journey
lasted three years. When the show could not draw a big enough
audience against competitors like ``My Three Sons'' and ``Gomer
Pyle, U.S.M.C.,'' NBC pulled the plug.
</P>
<P>
   But if the show's audience wasn't huge, it possessed
unparalleled loyalty. In time, that original series, created by
Gene Roddenberry with a real-life crew that included the art
director Matt Jeffries, inspired nine feature films and four
television series (one was a cartoon based on the original) as well
as an unending meteor shower of books, collectibles, conventions
and other profit centers, including the current Sci-Fi Channel
compilation. (The 90-minute format allows ample time for
advertising.)
</P>
<P>
   Many people who will watch the series already know each episode
by heart. For them, the attraction may be the new material, labeled
`` `Star Trek' Insights.'' After one scene _ in which that disease
drives a crew member to reveal his doubts about the ethics of space
exploration that risks harm to the explorers and the environments
they unwittingly pollute, and makes him declare, ``I don't deserve
to live!'' _ the actor who exclaimed that line, Stewart Moss,
recalls the experience.
</P>
<P>
   The script, by John D.F. Black, ``had a lot of purple prose,''
Moss says. ``It had a lot of heavy emotional dialogue. It scared
me.'' He continues: ``I remember I killed myself with a butter
knife. I was the first man in the history of television to do
that.'' Talk about milestones.
</P>
<P>
   But the real business at hand is the episode itself, complete
with the familiar presence of DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy), James
Doohan (Scotty), Nichelle Nichols (Uhura) and George Takei (Sulu).
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned viewers will know that the platinum-blond Yeoman Janice
Rand, played by Grace Lee Whitney, was a regular for the first
season, but the character was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Those with a history of more casual ``Star Trek'' viewing (or
none at all) may be surprised at how different these dramas are
from today's television fare. Look at the simple sets in those
bright Crayola reds and yellows (perhaps to complement the purple
prose) and the costumes: double-knit pajamas and high-heeled black
boots. Protective suits are bright orange, made (it is now
revealed) of shower-curtain material.
</P>
<P>
   These episodes are closer, in chronology and spirit, to 1940s
serials than to anything being created today. Life (and its
fun-house mirror, television) is so packed with ambiguity and
cynicism that entertainment like this, assembled without those
elements, would be rejected as sappy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ``Star Trek'' comes from another era, when being
naive was not a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   These linear stories _ nearly free of the interlocking subplots
of 1990s prime-time fare _ move slowly through their twists, turns
and brushes with low-key philosophy until everything is resolved in
the final moments. Then everyone on screen holds a sadder-but-wiser
expression for the final fade-out.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the appeal? Doctoral dissertations have grappled with
the question. Sociologists, psychologists and other -ists have had
their say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this may be part of the answer: These hopeful, low-tech
presentations seem to be the work of individuals with ideas, not
committees with polling data. On their own terms (from their own
time), the shows work. And if those individuals didn't produce
great art, they did come up with some earnest entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're not ready to structure your life around these
souped-up reruns, you might enjoy a couple. So go, boldly, into the
future by visiting the past. It's not hard to take. Back then, warp
speed wasn't nearly as fast.

<P>
   Does Russia matter any more? It is tempting to say no. Once a
superpower with a mighty military machine and a driving belief in
its destiny as the only great nation straddling Europe and Asia,
its economy is now on a par-- in size if not quality -- with
Spain's and only two-thirds as big, by some measures, as
Indonesia's.
</P>
<P>
   Good riddance, then, to the pretensions of a once-proud nation?
And good riddance to its once-heroic but fast-crumbling leader,
Boris Yeltsin?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite yet. Russia still matters hugely by virtue of its
sheer geographical size, lumbering across 11 time zones, with a
large and well-educated population of 147 million, and endowed with

</P>
<P>
   That its human and material potential remains so vast only makes
its latest plunge to ruin all the more regrettable. And it still
boasts an array of nuclear weapons, some of which, though unlikely
to be used, could yet be lost as internal chaos spreads. Meanwhile,
its capacity for political mischief is immense.
</P>
<P>
   As for Yeltsin, his era is drawing to an early close, whether or
not he formally bows out. His second term of office has been little
short of disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   But, given the grisly list of flawed candidates who might
replace him, he may be able to perform one last service -- by
hanging on as a last-gasp president to give a breathing space for a
new order, one with parliament and a coalition government making
the running, that might halt the slide into total anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, something nastily authoritarian, perhaps even a
thoroughgoing tyranny, could ensue.
</P>
<P>
   The West's ability to help shape a better Russia -- whether
economically or politically -- is limited, as President Bill
Clinton no doubt ascertained during his visit to Moscow this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is one area where America and its European friends can
continue to make a difference: security. American efforts to cajole
Russia into signing the START-2 nuclear arms-cutting treaty, held
up by a recalcitrant Duma, need to go on. In its own interests, the
West should go on buying up surplus nuclear material and ensuring,
by bribery if need be, that underpaid Russian scientists do not
sell their skills to rogue countries trying to build nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   On a more conventional plane, as the delicate business of NATO's
enlargement proceeds, the alliance needs to offer every sort of
inducement to Russia to maintain and extend the sort of cooperative
partnership that is already under way.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it must be made plain, to whomever rules in
the Kremlin, that any Russian bullying of small neighbors such as
the Baltics or bigger ones like Ukraine will not be tolerated. As
Russia wobbles, the West must try harder to bolster the countries
on Russia's fringes.
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, even if Russia turns sulkily inward, it
must be kept as strategically engaged with the West as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In economics, the kind of engagement of recent years must,
perforce, cease. For the time being at least, Russia has forfeited
hopes for help. The West took a big but reasonable gamble by
lending money to Russia when it was led by a team of reformers
trying to do roughly the right thing. But the Russians have now
flouted just about every condition for getting help from outside.
</P>
<P>
   When, in its own good time, Russia has made real reforms and
something of a civic order, built a tax base and solid
institutions, and learned that honesty in business pays, then the
West should come back in. Not now. And things may well have to get
a lot worse before then.
</P>
<P>
   It is even less wise for the West to play politics: picking
Russian winners is a fool's lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The real reformers -- the likes of Boris Nemtsov, who sadly
failed to achieve much in Russia's recent string of
down-the-rabbit-hole governments -- are simply not going to be
elected. Their sponsorship by the West could make them even more
disliked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if elections to parliament and the presidency were held
tomorrow, none of the possible winners -- Communists in league with
nationalists, crony-capitalists, ex-military strongmen -- would be
able to save Russia from further ruin. And the drift during the
three months that would have to elapse before people got to the
polls could harm Russia further.
</P>
<P>
   Better, perhaps, if a government of national unity could be
cobbled together, including the Communists, so that an
all-but-neutered Yeltsin and it is to be hoped a more responsible
parliament could stagger on.
</P>
<P>
   Russians, however, may think otherwise; and one could hardly
blame them.

   Does Russia matter any more? It is tempting to say no. Once a
superpower with a mighty military machine and a driving belief in
its destiny as the only great nation straddling Europe and Asia,
its economy is now on a par-- in size if not quality -- with
Spain's and only two-thirds as big, by some measures, as
Indonesia's.
</P>
<P>
   Good riddance, then, to the pretensions of a once-proud nation?
And good riddance to its once-heroic but fast-crumbling leader,
Boris Yeltsin?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite yet. Russia still matters hugely by virtue of its
sheer geographical size, lumbering across 11 time zones, with a
large and well-educated population of 147 million, and endowed with
the richest natural resources in the world.

MONTICELLO: JEFFERSONIAN GENIUS IS HELD SELF-EVIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIANNE SZEGEDY-MASZAK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ Nichole Wilder was arguing with her
sister Samantha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Mount Vernon,'' said Nichole, 16. ``The family needed
slaves, they were a part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' acknowledged Samantha, 8. ``But Washington freed his
slaves. Jefferson never let his slaves go free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson died in debt,'' Nichole countered. ``And
Washington's wife had lots of money, so he didn't have to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wilder sisters, from Winchester, Va., were here with their
parents to visit Monticello, the house that Thomas Jefferson built.
And they had come up against the central contradiction that
historians have worried over for years (and volumes): How can the
man who wrote in the Declaration of Independence that ``all men are
created equal'' have been a slave owner all his life?
</P>
<P>
   When I was Samantha's age, growing up in Washington in the
1960s, I visited Monticello with my Girl Scout troop. But the
questions that came so naturally to the Wilder girls did not occur
to us then. We were told that ``servants,'' not slaves, worked in
the house and fields, and the private lives of presidents were
nobody's business. Monticello told the story of a great patriarch,
a talented polymath and frontier genius; it was a shrine to a Great
White Man.
</P>
<P>
   A recent weekend in Charlottesville proved that a historical
site _ indeed, history _ is viewed through different prisms at
different times. Today, movies like ``Jefferson in Paris,'' an
exploration of his relationship with a slave, Sally Hemings, or the
recent ``Primary Colors'' frankly confront issues of character. The
president as flawed human being has become a more compelling image
than the president as secular saint.
</P>
<P>
   And so Monticello now tells a more ambiguous story, in line with
our thinking about both Thomas Jefferson and William Jefferson
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A Son of Albemarle
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was born in Albemarle County on April 13, 1743, at his
family's estate on the Rivanna River; his father was one of the
first settlers in the county. When the elder Jefferson died in
1757, he left 5,000 acres to the future president, who was then 14.
These became the site of the Monticello plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson attended the College of William and Mary in
Williamsburg from 1760 to 1762, then studied law. He served in the
Virginia House of Burgesses, as the state's governor, as a U.S.
congressman, as minister to France and as secretary of state. He
was elected president in 1801 and re-elected in 1804.
</P>
<P>
   But Jefferson is equally famous for his many accomplishments and
interests outside public service: in architecture, botany,
winemaking, agriculture, music and literature. And his expertise in
these areas is fully evident on a visit here.
</P>
<P>
   In what he described as his ``essay in architecture,'' Jefferson
designed the main house at Monticello. He also planted its
vineyards and created the sumptuous gardens. His violin is on
display at the house, as are many of the books he bought to
replenish those he donated to the new country; they became the core
of the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on Monticello began in 1768. When Jefferson
returned from France in 1789, after his stint as minister, he
redesigned the house. It was not finished, and Jefferson did not
live there until after he retired from public life in 1809.
</P>
<P>
   He died on July 4, 1826, $100,000 in debt. In January 1827, a
poster put up in the area announced that ``130 valuable negroes''
were offered in the executor's sale of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   History and Merchandise
</P>
<P>
   As we approached Charlottesville, named for George III's wife,
Charlotte, I referred to the classic WPA guide to Virginia, which
describes the city, also home to the University of Virginia, as ``a
natural bowl'' and ``an immense many-pavilioned garden.'' The bowl
shape gives a visitor the nagging feeling of driving around in
circles, but the road is well marked, and we easily found
Monticello's winding entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pouring rain and cool weather, the parking lot was full;
people waited patiently for the buses to take them up a hill to the
house. We hurried past the crowded gift shop, with its Monticello
slide sets, Monticello architectural ornaments, Monticello Riesling
and Chardonnay, Monticello Wedgwood, Monticello stemware and a
collection of tchotchkes and books that ranged from a red quill
ballpoint to monographs written by Monticello scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The private, nonprofit Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation has
run the estate since 1923. Its president, Daniel Jordan, a dapper
and effusive Southerner, has a doctorate in history from the
University of Virginia and during his 14 years of work at
Monticello has overseen an aggressive fund-raising campaign to
expand its educational component.
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of the Monticello staff hold Ph.D.'s, and
throughout the year more than 400 academic researchers visit. For
the 500,000 regular tourists, the guides are unusually well
informed and offer as much information about the lives of the
slaves who lived on the estate as they do about Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, and during some weekends throughout the year,
visitors can take special tours of the plantation that explore
slave life exclusively. ``There has been increased attention paid
to this theme over the last decade,'' explained the head guide,
Elizabeth Dowling Taylor. ``It is a gradual awakening to the
process of being enlightened and telling an inclusive story and
telling it from a wide perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the special tour was not available when we visited, our
guide, Betty Hopson, began her remarks to us by explaining,
``Monticello was a home to many families including Jefferson's and
his daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Jefferson inherited his slaves from his father and
father-in-law, and that the slaves worked in the fields farming
tobacco and wheat. Ms. Hopson also talked freely about members of
the Hemings family who worked in the house during Jefferson's
lifetime and were freed when he died.

 &HT;    Battle brews in Macon cemetery over resting place of 2 rock
stars
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga._It's probably a good thing the Allman Brothers'
``Homecoming'' stop in Atlanta this week isn't in the Georgia town
band members called home. There's trouble here. And Candace Oakley
has pictures to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Page after plastic-sheeted page in Oakley's blue photo album
attests to what she calls ``the freak show'' that has played for
years at the side-by-side graves of her brother Berry and fellow
Allman Brothers founder Duane Allman. Both musicians died in Macon
motorcycle accidents _ Allman in 1971, Oakley in 1972. ``Look,
here's the one where they've left the butts of two marijuana
cigarettes,'' Oakley says.
</P>
<P>
   She flips the page.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the beer cans they leave, empty,'' she continues.
``Usually everything is empty or used. I mean, I don't understand
the whole `tribute' thing to begin with. If they're expecting Berry
and Duane to get up at night and enjoy their `tributes,' why not
leave a full beer?''
</P>
<P>
   Flip.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's candid spirit should help her as she fights a battle on
two fronts _ City Hall on one, some Allman Brothers fans on the
other. All parties converged a week ago when Macon Mayor Jim
Marshall had an 8-foot chain-link fence topped with razor wire
removed from around the graves less than two months after Oakley
installed it to thwart fans.
</P>
<P>
   Now Oakley is considering building a mausoleum. The mayor is
being rigid about what she can do next with the plot in the
city-owned Rose Hill Cemetery, where deed owners don't have total
title to the property. And the larger fan organizations in Macon
simply want ``Candy'' _ as many refer to her _ ``to just get a
grip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh I've got lots of, um, fans around here,'' snarls Oakley,
48. Retired from many years in retail, the departed Oakley's
younger sister won't explain what her current source of income is.
``It's not the point,'' she insists. ``It shouldn't be the focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what: I don't run tours and I don't make any money
off of Allman Brothers marketing,'' she does say. ``I've been
taking care of me and Berry's father most of this decade. (He died
last Oct. 19). Just trying to live a quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shunned the press for so long,'' continues Oakley, who
awoke this recent afternoon to a call from The Wall Street Journal.
The next day she had her morning Coke as she listened to her
dilemma being discussed on Peach State Radio. ``I guess a sister
just trying to protect her brother's grave has struck a nerve,
huh?'' she giggles slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, hun, look at this. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   More pictures.
</P>
<P>
   There's one of pebbles fashioned into a heart on the white
marble crypts.
</P>
<P>
   There's another showing how someone has filled one of the
guitars etched into the two tombs with blue crayon.
</P>
<P>
   And yet another in which a visitor has kissed Oakley's headstone
``with the brightest, reddest, ugliest lipstick she could find,''
his only sibling believes.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes more cleaning work for Oakley and her
husband, Buford Birdsey, 56. Oakley is the only Allman Brothers
family member in Macon. Allman's daughter Galadrielle lives in
California. And Oakley's widow, Linda, and daughter Brittany reside
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's basically us out there on our hands and knees with
soap and water brushing off the mess,'' sighs Birdsey, a retired
boat captain who ran charters in Florida and the Bahamas. Now he's
the principal photographer on the couple's grave patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, at the Macon Parks and Recreation Department's
suggestion, Oakley and Birdsey put up a 3-foot fence to protect the
site. It was pulled up and tossed aside in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Then in July, Oakley and her husband discovered a hole where
someone was apparently digging to get into the graves. ``That's
when we said, `Enough is enough,' and we put up the big fence,''
Oakley explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really thought, wrongly, that three days of work (putting
up the 8-footer) that cost about $4,000 might just stop some of
this trouble,'' adds Birdsey.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, ``trouble'' to them may be considered a fitting
tribute to a fan of the polyrhythmic rock band, which is
approaching its 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candy really needs to get a grip and listen to the Allmans'
records again,'' says Margo Murdock, 52, owner of a one-chair
barber shop that offers ``alternative therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the joke side of me wants to say, `What does she think
they did down there at Rose Hill?' Come on now, what did (the
single) `In Memory of Elizabeth Reed' really mean? It was about a
nice flat spot near her grave to smoke, drink and do whatever.
Excuse me, pardon me, did I miss something about the '70s?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever went to defile anybody else's grave,'' continues
Murdock. ``It's the Allman Brothers' spirit and essence that people
are coming to take in. She can move the bodies, build a mausoleum
or whatever. People will come. Princess Di isn't in that tunnel
anymore but people still go.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdock is also a founding board member of the Macon-based
Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association, an organization, Oakley
says, that's ``basically inviting people to go down to Rose Hill
and dance on their graves.''
</P>
<P>
   Her other cause of anxiety is known as stop No. 19 on the
association's ``In the footsteps of the Allman Brothers Band'' map
_ the Big House. It's the former residence of Duane Allman, his
girlfriend Donna, their daughter, Berry Oakley, his wife, their
daughter and Candace Oakley. Nobody lives there any more: the house
at 2321 Vineville Ave. has been turned into a stately looking
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to help (fans) be as much of a part of the Allman
Brothers as they can,'' offers a hesitant Kirsten West. Her husband
Kirk, the band's tour manager, now owns the Big House. Oakley
refers to him ``as one of the pied pipers of this fanatic
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Candy's motives, I really don't want to get into,'' adds West,
rushing to lock up so she can make the 90-mile drive to Atlanta to
see all five Allman shows. ``I do feel comfortable saying an ugly
razor-wire fence is not an appropriate tribute to Duane and Berry's
spirit. Lighting a candle or lighting whatever seems like the
tribute you'd expect at the grave of two rock legends who died at
24.'' Other such dubious tributes can be found as far as the
often-littered resting place of Doors singer Jim Morrison in Paris
and fellow rocker Jimi Hendrix in Seattle. Otis Redding's widow in
Macon has his remains on her farm, inaccessible to the public. But
even the lesser known people in Rose Hill have graves that are
picked at and painted on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are enhancing security at Rose Hill,'' says the mayor. ``In
fact, before I called for the `Stalag 17' compound to be removed, I
called some people for some private funding to specifically secure
the Allman grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Walden, founder and owner of Atlanta-based Capricorn
Records, says he'd help monetarily if asked. ``I'm sympathetic to
all parties involved,'' says Walden, whose former Macon label was
made famous by the Allmans.
</P>
<P>
   Current band members have said nothing about the issue. Singer
Gregg Allman, Duane's younger brother, issued a ``no comment'' this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident this will all be worked out soon,'' the mayor
continues. ``There are plans for more foot patrols now. And in the
long haul, I expect that we'll reach an agreement with the family
about some appropriate treatment like fencing, maybe electronic
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it won't be is a prisonlike compound,'' he adds. ``This
is a public cemetery with historic character used by thousands of
people. And we want people to feel like Duane and Berry did:
Welcome to come into a serene and peaceful and comfortable place.
We don't want something that says, `Get out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   He might be wise to start with Oakley's fierce stare.
</P>
<P>
   This week, she was standing near the graves when two out-of-town
fans approached. Architecture student Rob Shortt and his companion,
Liza Jerome, both 29, had traveled from Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   A grimace greeted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of paper you have in your hand, just enough for
two graves, huh?'' Oakley asks. They freeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plan to do some rubbings?''
</P>
<P>
   Shortt nods in the affirmative. Still in the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charcoal,'' he responds.
</P>
<P>
   Without identifying herself, Oakley squinches her face sternly
and shakes her head no.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, when Shortt is told who Oakley is and what she's
been dealing with, he explains that he ``didn't want to make any
more trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just paying my respects,'' he says, headed for the Allman
Brothers opening night concert in Atlanta. ``Just wanted to take
something home with me, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should have settled for a picture.

DEMOCRATS FEAR DESERTION OF WOMEN THIS NOVEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It ranks high among the Democrats' worst nightmares
this November: Women voters, a key component of the party's base,
stay home out of disgust over the Bill-and-Monica debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge that President Clinton's lying about his
sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
could jeopardize the party's hope of making a net gain of 11 seats
needed to take the House of Representatives away from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many Republicans are predicting a GOP gain of a dozen
or more House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of the scare scenario: If Democratic women avoid
the polls and Republican voters are energized, the GOP could rack
up a 60-vote filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Now its lead
is 55 to 45. Such a victory would solidify Republican control on
many crucial legislative issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that women within the party want to get past this
and go on,'' said Linda Cacchione, Colorado Democratic Party vice
chairwoman. ``But I think there is a real dismay among women that
this (the Clinton scandal) has gone on so long and they find
themselves having to explain things to young children that they'd
rather not.''
</P>
<P>
   Cacchione expressed optimism that in Colorado at least, women
will turn out to vote for two female Democrats running for major
offices, U.S. Senate candidate Dottie Lamm and gubernatorial
candidate Gail Schoettler.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman for Emily's List, which raised $6.5
million in the 1996 election cycle for Democratic women candidates
who favor abortion rights, said, ``I don't think anyone believes
voters will go into the polls and vote on the basis of Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she added, the brouhaha over Clinton's seven-month
denial of the Lewinsky affair followed by his admission that he had
lied may drown out discussion of other issues. ``If voters are not
aware of what the debate (on these issues) is about, there's not a
lot of incentive to go to polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Metcalf, vice chairwoman of the Democratic Party in
Vermont, sees a division on Clinton among women voters that she
describes as ``a generational thing.'' Older women are more
astonished and disheartened by Clinton's behavior, she said. But
middle-aged and younger women, ``who grew up when things were much
looser, are more `been there, done that,''' she said. ``So they're
quicker to say, `Let's put this behind us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are looking at how Clinton's troubles might help
them. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said a survey he took
since Clinton's Aug. 17 admission showed a 4-percentage-point drop
among women respondents, Republicans and Democrats, when asked
whether they are likely to vote this November.
</P>
<P>
   In that survey, 53 percent of women said they were likely to
vote, compared with 57 percent in a poll taken before Clinton's
confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see women voting Republican who otherwise would have
voted Democrat,'' Luntz said. ``But I do see women staying home
rather than voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Stone of Republicans for Choice, which during the 1996
election cycle raised $1 million for moderate Republicans who
support abortion rights, sees a possible benefit for centrist GOP
candidates. ``If Clinton-type voters are going to get discouraged,
the only Republican they'd vote for is our kind,'' she said. ``So
if they turn out at all, it's to our benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnout in off-year national elections has for the most part
dropped steadily since 1966, when it reached its high mark of 48.8
percent of the voting-age population, according to Curtis Gans,
director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
Gans said he expects turnout this November to be no higher than 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In small-turnout elections, a party that energizes its base of
support can expect to do well, but its chances can be doomed if a
key part of its base stays home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, women's votes gave Clinton a second term, even though
Democrats failed to retake the House and Senate that the
Republicans had captured in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidate Bob Dole won 44 percent of the male vote, and
Clinton took 43 percent, a gap of only 1 point. But Clinton rolled
up the female vote by a whopping 54 percent compared with Dole's
meager 38 percent, a 16-point gap.
</P>
<P>
   Women voted for Clinton because of his support for abortion
rights, his appointment of women to high government posts and his
leadership in passing the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, which
gives employees up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for medical emergencies
and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   But relations between women and Democrats have not always been
solid. Some analysts attribute the GOP's 1994 congressional victory
to women staying home out of disappointment over Clinton's botched
health care plan and charges by Paula Corbin Jones that he had
sexually harassed her when he was Arkansas governor and she was a
low-ranking state employee.
</P>
<P>
   That year 38.8 percent of the voting age population went to the
polls, with 54 percent of women supporting Democratic candidates
and 46 percent voting for Republicans, according to exit polls
cited by Carll Everett Ladd of the Roper Center for Public Opinion
Research.
</P>
<P>
   That was only an 8-point gap. Meanwhile, 57 percent of men voted
for Republicans and 43 percent voted for Democrats _ a 14-point
gap.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson appears to be that whichever side gets a lion's share
of either gender's vote is the winner. For Democrats, there is no
chance for victory without big support from women.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, other national and international issues _ terrorism,
gyrations on Wall Street and the impact of Russian and Asian
financial turmoil on the U.S. economy _ could cloud the electoral
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton-Lewinsky matter remains the Democrats' biggest
headache. Former Democratic Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado
said, ``My first gut reaction is that none of this should fall out
on members of Congress. What were any of them going to do about it?
They aren't hall monitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she added, ``If congressional Democrats paid the
price in '94, who's to say you don't have a rerun in '98?''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Sweet tea and bananas: That's Mobile
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not that I wanted a glass of sweet tea. I really prefer it
half-and-half, and most restaurants gladly mix it for you.
</P>
<P>
   But I had to go to the Sweet Tea Sip-Off in Mobile, Ala. because
my friend Jay Greland, the Mobile Register columnist, and the
newspaper itself organized and sponsored it.
</P>
<P>
   I think sweet tea is regarded as more typically Southern than
just plain iced tea. At least you get that impression from the
legions gathered at Cottage Hill Park to compete and celebrate the
sweet stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For five years this fete has been going on, with women bringing
their iced tea to the park to be judged and rewarded. This year,
Jay added banana pudding to the competition, and if you think there
are not scores of ways to zip up this old Southern favorite, you
haven't looked around. I asked what you could do to a banana
pudding that is different from the recipe on the vanilla wafers
box, which has always been my authority.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't get to talk to the winner, Roxanne Vick, nor to Nan
Strickland, who drove 80 miles to enter her pudding. But some
contestants suggested handsome variations, like banana pudding
laced with sherry. One woman suggested fresh peaches to add a
little spirit to the otherwise bland bananas.
</P>
<P>
   We got to the sip-off after lunch at the old Mobile drive-in,
the Dew Drop Inn, where countless couples have courted each other
and indigestion, caused by hot dogs. Our friend and guide Velma
Lassiter Croom thought my daughter, whose father considered the Dew
Drop the equal of the Varsity, should experience that long-loved
eatery. So we stoked up on food before the sip-off, and I have no
personal evaluation to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a very pleasant party, anyhow. Held under a picnic
shelter, it drew families with folding chairs and a lively band,
headed by a singer and guitarist from the Register's circulation
department. When we arrived, they were playing, and one of their
number was caroling ``Stars Fell on Alabama'' at top volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember that song?'' I asked my daughter. She said she
did, but I doubted it. Its heyday followed the publication of Carl
Carmer's book of the same title in the mid-1930s. As I remember,
Mr. Carmer hated the song and felt it had somehow cheapened, as
well as exploited, his book.
</P>
<P>
   I loved it. And it did sound fine out there under the big trees,
with the aroma of bananas, long a Mobile specialty, rising from the
picnic tables. In the shade around the shelter, grown-ups lounged
in lawn chairs, babies played on blankets and at least one couple
danced to the band music. Jay and his wife, Cindi, tabulated the
tea and banana pudding entries.
</P>
<P>
   As a sop to the literary life, Jay set up a table for book
autographing by a couple of Alabama authors. Eight or 10 people of
all ages, including a young woman who serves on the Mobile City
Council, lined up to compete for the baby bottle prize, which
rewarded the tea sipper who could sip a baby bottle empty the
fastest. It didn't look like a pleasant way to get your tea, I
thought as I watched their efforts, but they seemed to have
practiced and were in good form.
</P>
<P>
   The councilwoman remarked that she hadn't practiced, but it
seemed a jolly thing to do. ``She's a good sport,'' Jay told me.
</P>
<P>
   I think they all were, and it was a more pleasant event than one
our newspaper has sponsored to raise United Way funds. Some of our
executives have been required to kiss a pig.

 CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.: he died.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historians have long debated the nature of Jefferson's
relationship with Hemings. The estate's brochure on slave life
explained the controversy this way: ``Sally Hemings' name became
linked to Jefferson's in 1802 when a Richmond newspaper editor
claimed that she was Jefferson's mistress and had borne him a
number of children. The story, which still can be neither refuted
nor clearly substantiated, continues to capture the public
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Jefferson's biographers, like Dumas Malone, have
discounted the story, but recently others have acknowledged its
plausibility; the results of a DNA test being performed on Hemings'
descendants may provide a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that we are uptight about Sally Hemings or
slavery,'' Jordan said. ``But we are not. We deal with it every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Man of the Enlightenment
</P>
<P>
   Much of what I remembered from my childhood visit remains; the
image of Jefferson as the avatar of the Enlightenment man is
secure. We learned that he could read seven languages and that all
are represented in his library. We heard of his garden plan, which
included 20 oval-shaped flower beds at the four corners of the
house and a garden with more than 250 varieties of vegetables and
herbs. We saw the several clocks he designed, among them an obelisk
clock in his bedroom; its dial is supported by two black marble
obelisks. We also saw his famous plantation clock that shows the
month, day and time.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles from Monticello is Ash Lawn, the home of another
Founding Father, James Monroe. But who other than the sturdiest
academic contemplates Monroe? Jefferson continues to be
compulsively interesting, and though his breadth and genius are
surely part of the reason, his flaws are also compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, the civil rights leader who is a professor of
history at the University of Virginia and at American University
and serves on a committee on African-American interpretation at
Monticello, offered this view: ``Jefferson talked about slaves as
`my family.' Obviously if some family members owned other family
members, it is not a family in a traditional sense. You keep having
to answer the question, was Jefferson a good slave master? That's
an oxymoron. There are no good slave masters.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Bond continued: ``He is universally admired for
everything that he did and that he stood for. There is a desire to
lift him out of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, we visited the University of Virginia.
Jefferson designed the grounds in 1817 and was involved in all
aspects of its construction as well as in designing its educational
approach. His intent was to create a small scholarly community in
which students and faculty members lived and worked side by side.
This was revolutionary at the time, because a college was typically
one large building, and students and teachers went their separate
ways after class.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the university was not quite complete when
Jefferson died, although 40 students entered in 1825. Today, there
are more than 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Buljancevac, a junior, led our tour through the
campus, which Jefferson referred to as his ``academical village.''
His accomplishments as an architect were in evidence as we
contemplated the long lawn with the elegant rotunda, flanked by 10
pavilions, more lawns, and the east and west ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery did not enter any discussions here, until I asked Cliff
and Janet Raynor and their two sons, Alex, 7, and Michael, 5, from
Raleigh, N.C., their impression of Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that we took away from Monticello was this dichotomy
between his private and his public life,'' said Raynor, 38, who is
a manager for Interpath, an Internet service company. ``And it's
something that most of us face: We say one thing and we do another.
We tell our kids not to lie, and then they catch us making an
excuse that isn't true. And here he made these public philosophical
statements about slavery being evil, and at the same time he held
slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Charlottesville, we went to the new Visitors
Center to see the exhibit ``Getting Word,'' about an oral history
project, three years in the making, on Monticello slaves and their
descendants. Pictures of the reunion were on one wall, with
quotations from some of the slaves blown up next to them. The
impression is solemn but not painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the visitor coming out of Monticello should be
chastened in the way that those who visit the Holocaust Museum are
chastened,'' the historian James Loewen said in a interview.
``People should come out of Monticello with tears in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw no tears at Monticello. But for me, the figure of
Jefferson can no longer exist as a calm and distant historical
icon. And even without tears, the focus on slavery, the efforts to
bring to life all those who lived on the mountaintop, bring that
world a bit closer to earth.

 &HT;    Pokemon: TV monsters gobble big bucks
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think Tamagotchi ``virtual pets.'' Think Beanie Babies. Think
video games. Think TV.
</P>
<P>
   The latest monster from Japan, a potent blend of pop culture
fads, arrives Monday. If you haven't heard of it yet, just wait.
You will.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``Pokemon,'' short for ``pocket monsters,'' a
plethora of pint-sized critters that will soon materialize on TV,
in video games and in toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may see ``Pokemon'' as a monster that attacks
pocketbooks _ and given its success in Japan, they'd be right.
There, ``Pokemon'' products have sparked $4 billion in sales in the
past two years. More than 9 million copies of software have been
sold for Nintendo's Game Boy hand-held video game.
</P>
<P>
   To prime the American market for similar sales, Nintendo and the
fast food restaurant KFC, which plans a plush toy promotion in
November, are spending $25 million to introduce ``Pokemon'' here.
That includes sending a Volkswagen Beetle decorated like Pikachu,
one of the monsters, to 10 cities this week, including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally we would launch a piece of Nintendo software and hope
to sell it for 12 to 16 weeks, and then, like a movie, it's over,''
says George Harrison, a Nintendo America spokesman. ``We're
spending a lot more this fall than we would if we were just trying
to sell a half-million Game Boy games.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic story: Ash, a young boy, aspires to become the world's
greatest Pokemon master by catching and training 150 monsters.
``Pokemon'' creators hope American kids will emulate Ash in trying
to collect and trade the monsters, as real toys or in virtual form
in video games.
</P>
<P>
   The syndicated animated kids' show starts Monday. Two $29.95
Game Boy cartridges arrive Sept. 28. And in November, just in time
for Christmas, comes a line of toys, including action figures and
bean-filled Pokemons, that, like Beanie Babies, will be
periodically retired to enhance their collectibility.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works: comic books, trading cards and a clothing
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's been so huge in Japan, there's more cause to
think it may take off here in the same way,'' says Ira Mayer,
publisher of Entertainment Marketing Letter. But success in one
country doesn't necessarily translate into a U.S. smash because of
cultural differences, he cautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon's'' initial round of publicity in the United States
was negative. In Japan last December, 700 kids suffered seizures
while focusing intently on flashing lights in one TV episode, and
the story was widely reported.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the TV show has been edited to eliminate the special
effects suspected of triggering the seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, could too much ``Pokemon'' on TV or in the Game Boy turn
kids into monster couch potatoes? Don't worry, there's a product
for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   An electronic ``pet'' called Pokemon Pikachu, coming in November
for $19.95, prods its owner to exercise by keeping track of how far
he walks. The greater the distance, the greater the friendliness
the interactive pet displays to its owner.

 &HT;    23 years after the Vietnam war, a visitor finds a bustling,
friendly nation that welcomes Americans
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 6: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam_There's only one country in the world where you
come face to face with the reality of the United States not winning
a war. That reality hits home, more than any other place, at the
Army Museum, a former colonial citadel in Hanoi that follows the
Vietnamese through centuries of war against the Chinese, the
Japanese, the French and the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the museum, you come to a courtyard that appears
to be heaped with junk. Walking closer, your heart sinks as you
realize what the scrap metal is. Rusting fuselages. Battered jet
turbines. Wings with jagged edges where they used to join airplane
bodies, like arms ripped out of sockets. The junk, piled high under
a shade tree, is an assemblage of bombers and fighters who crashed
or were shot down over North Vietnam during the wars against France
and the United States. Small signs identify the remains
dispassionately, as if they were dinosaur bones in a natural
history museum. There's a French Hellcat hit in 1954, an American
F-4 shot down in 1967, a B-52 brought to earth in 1972. You wonder
who died when they fell. You wonder who died when they flew.
</P>
<P>
   You are outside the museum a few minutes later, feeling bruised
and agitated, when a school bus pulls up. A framed portrait of Ho
Chi Minh sits on the dashboard, propped against the windshield.
Children pour out the door and run toward the only Westerner in
sight. The tourist has become a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You American?'' one asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good afternoon!'' says another, overenunciating the syllables
as he practices the tongue that has replaced French as Vietnam's
second language.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen students gather around to recite their English drills
and pose for pictures with the visitor. His homeland was their
homeland's enemy many years ago, before any of them were born. To
them, the planes and destruction are history. The Westerner,
standing among them with guidebook and camera, is the reality.
</P>
<P>
   Drink Pepsi, comrades
</P>
<P>
   Before I visited Vietnam this spring, I punched up the World
Wide Web site of the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington. The
Vietnamese must have thought that some re-education was in order
when the nations resumed diplomatic ties in 1995, because one of
the first sentences that appeared on my screen was, ``Vietnam now
is a country, not a war.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to keep that in mind as the Cathay Pacific airliner
crossed the South China Sea and the shoreline materialized,
followed by pastel green fields and flashes of sunlight glinting
off flooded rice paddies. Vietnam is indeed more than the sum of
its battles. It is an ancient country with a fertile culture and a
tropical beauty that runs from mountains to vast river deltas to a
serpentine coast that has more beachfront than California. Vietnam
would be worth touring even if the best and the brightest in
Washington had never sent a single American there.
</P>
<P>
   But they did _ 3 million of them over 20 years _ and it doesn't
take long to be reminded of it. As the plane started its final
descent into Ho Chi Minh City, I looked up from my guidebook and
saw ranks of half-pipe concrete bunkers sitting abandoned beside
the runway. The airport, Tan Son Nhat, was an enormous U.S. base
during the war. It looked as if the bunkers hadn't been touched
since the last Americans fled before advancing Communist troops 23
years ago. A few minutes later, sobered by these monuments to
futility, we were met on the tarmac by a shuttle bus that urged us,
with every inch of its sides, to DRINK PEPSI!
</P>
<P>
   It's like that all over Vietnam. Just when you remember that
it's a country, not a war, you pass a bomb crater or a crippled
veteran or a Viet Cong cemetery with its red flag streaming over
white markers mustered in an eternal close-order drill. Then you
pass a Ford truck, a billboard for Kentucky Fried Chicken, a
roadside stand selling Coca-Cola, and you remember that it's not
just a country, but an economy. Vietnam remains a socialist state,
but in recent years it has taken tentative steps toward capitalism
and has opened itself to foreign investment. The Cold War has
become the Cola War.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Vietnam has enshrined the war and begun to
capitalize on its tourism potential. There are battlefield parks
and memorials, war museums and art galleries, military reunions and
tours _ there's even a chain of meat-market bars called Apocalypse
Now. Many souvenir shops sell reproduction Viet Cong gear and old
U.S. Army surplus. Of all the war keepsakes I saw, the unlikeliest
was in an airport gift shop; next to the cheap busts of Ho was a
plastic model of a U.S. helicopter piloted by an action figure
named Major Hoss Jones. The shop took American Express.
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing, given the bitter history, is how the
Vietnamese seem to have welcomed the Americans back. They need the
dollars, of course, but it's still a remarkable attitude when you
consider the resentment and hatred that linger after most civil
wars. Look at ours; some people still haven't forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese seem more curious about Americans than resentful
of them. At least that's the impression I got during two weeks in
the country, most of it spent touring and talking to people in the
former warring capitals of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The two
largest cities, they're as different as Los Angeles and Boston. As
I explored them, I drew smiles and questions and more than a few
beggars, but no outward rancor. There was much to see and
experience, most of it unrelated to the war, yet I found myself
drawn to the ashes again and again, the way you can't help but look
over a cliff into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting paper tigers in the South
</P>
<P>
   The government calls it Ho Chi Minh City. The people call it
Saigon. The airline monitors say ``HCMC,'' while the luggage tags
say ``SGN.'' Whether it's referred to by its old name or its
conquered name, the city that was the capital of South Vietnam has
become the hustling economic heart of the reunited nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh City is Vietnam's largest, with more than 5 million
people, and it seemed as if most of them were in the streets as I
was driven to my hotel. Vietnamese traffic makes Atlanta's
Perimeter look stately. Motorbikes and bicycles crowd the laneless
boulevards 15 abreast. Many of them carry impossibly large cargoes
balanced on poles. I saw one bicyclist ferrying what appeared to be
an entire dining room set _ he looked like an ant carrying a
grasshopper.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers of the hopelessly outnumbered cars honk their horns
constantly, creating a manic soundtrack that continues to beep in
your ears after you turn out the lights at night. The dreams are
even more vivid if you take a ride in a cyclo, a bicycle with a
front-mounted passenger seat that throws you face-first into the
traffic melee. It's like being strapped to the bumper of a
Manhattan taxicab.
</P>
<P>
   Saigon went through some hard times after the North Vietnamese
captured the city and renamed it in 1975. Thousands fled or were
imprisoned. But when the government decided to allow the beginnings
of a market economy in the late 1980s, Saigon _ always the
country's most Westernized city _ was the chief beneficiary.
Skyscrapers have begun to rise above the tamarind trees. Hotels
have opened. Prostitutes on motorbikes have returned to Dong Khoi,
the main drag, which runs from the twin spires of Notre Dame
Cathedral to the clamorous bank of the Saigon River.
</P>
<P>
   I am not a Vietnam War veteran, but I followed a veteran's
itinerary. I saw the former U.S. Embassy, the scene of the frantic
helicopter evacuation that signaled the war's end; it was vacant,
still guarded by a rusty barbed wire fence. I had a beer on the
roof of the Hotel Majestic, a French colonial confection on the
riverfront that was a favorite of war correspondents. I visited the
Rex Hotel, where the American military brass used to stage the
body-count briefings that reporters caustically called the ``5
o'clock follies.'' The rooftop garden is one of the most outlandish
places in the city, with palm trees and statues of elephants and a
crown-shaped marquee that lights up the Asian night like something
from Las Vegas. Downstairs, a sign in the lobby welcomed a meeting
of ``the U.S. Army Colonels Delegation.'' It seemed like old times.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh City's most popular tourist stop is said to be the
War Remnants Museum, formerly called the War Crimes Museum. The
name has changed, but the spirit hasn't. It's a guilt bath for
foreigners, with an onslaught of grisly pictures and artifacts of
war atrocities. I couldn't stomach it for long.
</P>
<P>
   The other big war attraction in town is Reunification Hall, the
residence of South Vietnamese presidents from 1966 to 1975. The
rambling mansion couldn't feel more frozen in time if it were a
villa in Pompeii. The game room has beer keg chairs, like some den
in Kalamazoo circa 1970. The shelves in the study have titles that
somehow eluded the socialist censors (``The Green Berets''?). The
war rooms in the basement _ a mini-Pentagon _ have yellowed
troop-strength charts and an exhaustive collection of clunky
gray-metal U.S. Army military furniture. Your tax dollars at work.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of the city, there's another tourist stop that
shows how the other side operated. Viet Cong guerrillas started
digging the Cu Chi Tunnels in the early '60s, and by 1973 they had
burrowed 200 miles of passageways under what had been a rubber
plantation. Up to 5,000 guerrillas were stationed there, hiding
like moles by day and slipping out at night to infiltrate and
attack. The U.S. Air Force dropped half a million bombs on Cu Chi,
turning it into a lunar wasteland of craters, but the explosives
didn't exterminate the Communists, and the site has been preserved
as a national park. It is to the Vietnamese what Valley Forge is to
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide, Le Van Tung, a wiry young man with an easy smile,
ushered my group into the earthen tunnels through openings that
seemed scarcely big enough for a groundhog. The entrances were even
tighter during the war, to discourage American GIs from pursuing
the thinner Viet Cong into their lairs. ``If we hadn't enlarged the
holes,'' Tung said, looking me over, ``I'm not sure you could get
in.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour, we crawled through suffocating passages,
toured underground barracks and hospitals, sampled the guerrillas'
meager rations of cassava root and green tea, and felt the point of
a bamboo-stick booby trap.
</P>
<P>
   On the way out of the park, I was startled to hear automatic
weapons fire. It came from something called the National Defense
Shooting Range, where you can pay a few bucks and test your aim
with the infantry rifles used during the war. I bought a clip of
five rounds and trained a U.S. Army M-16 at a target _ a paper
tiger _ across the field. The rifle kicked, and all five shots
sailed high. I pulled out another Lincoln and bought a clip for an
AK-47, the smaller, lighter, Soviet-made weapon preferred by the
North Vietnamese. I riddled the tiger and was awarded a prize, a
black-and-white checked scarf. I asked the attendant whether it had
any significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a Viet Cong scarf,'' he said, placing it around my neck
with a big grin. ``You're a Communist now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilling with Ho in Hanoi
</P>
<P>
   The real Communists are where they've always been, in the north,
especially Hanoi. In some of the capital city's neighborhoods, you
can still hear party propaganda broadcast over loudspeakers on the
street. But even here, in the heart of redness, things are
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi is a city of layers. Riding in from the airport, I saw
vestiges of the Soviet domination of the 1970s and '80s, as the
Russian-built highway passed ugly monuments done in the
bow-before-me style of Leonid Brezhnev's Moscow. Once in the city,
the driver skirted the Old Quarter, a typically Asian warren of
crooked streets and cramped shop stalls, passed a Buddhist temple,
then entered the French Quarter, a district of spacious boulevards
and beaux-arts buildings _ all painted yellow _ that recalled the
era when this was the capital of French Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, I passed the most dramatic landmark of the
dawning era of global capitalism. The ``Hanoi Hilton,'' the prison
where American prisoners of war were held and tortured, has been
demolished and replaced by the Hanoi Towers, 20 stories of polished
marble that would be at home in any American city.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi is smaller than Ho Chi Minh City _ about 3.5 million
people _ and it seems more charming, with its air of history and
its varied architecture, shady parks and placid lakes. Ho Chi Minh
City crackles with business energy, but there's more cultural
bedrock in Hanoi and its museums, monuments and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Vu Quy Trung, a graduate student, agreed to show me around his
hometown. I met him one overcast morning (the only kind in Hanoi)
at Hoan Kiem, the emerald lake in the heart of the city. An hour
before, the shore had been crowded with Vietnamese starting the day
with tai chi exercises. They had been replaced by street vendors
selling postcards and paperback books with hawkish persistence. One
of them waved a copy of Graham Greene's Vietnam novel ``The Quiet
American'' in my face. I made the mistake of inquiring about the
price, and he dogged us around the lake chattering, ``You buy! You
buy!'' When we finally shook him, he snarled something in
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he say?'' I asked Trung.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberated from the young capitalist, we hopped into a taxi for
Hanoi's best-known landmark, the tomb of Ho Chi Minh. The
Vietnamese revere Ho the way Americans once revered George
Washington _ only they call the father of their country ``uncle,''
as in ``Uncle Ho.''
</P>
<P>
   We joined the line of pilgrims outside the mausoleum, a massive,
stepped concrete structure that looks like a cross between a Mayan
temple and a high school football grandstand. A red carpet led into
the edifice, up 33 steps and around into a darkened chamber that
was as chilly as a meat locker. I started to say something, but a
guard, standing stiffly in the green-and-red uniform of the
Vietnamese army, fired an admonishing glare in my direction. I kept
the sacred silence.
</P>
<P>
   And then we beheld him, Ho Chi Minh, the wispy-bearded
revolutionary who led his compatriots against four enemies through
four decades of fighting that claimed the lives of millions of
Vietnamese. He lay propped on a wooden bier, enclosed in glass, his
waxy hands cupped on black covers.
</P>
<P>
   Ho wanted to be cremated, but the powers disregarded his wish
and made an icon of his remains after he died in 1969. He's been
here ever since, except for annual trips to Moscow to recondition
the corpse. The Russians, of course, perfected the art of
preserving Communist mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the mausoleum, I asked Trung what he remembered from his
visits to Uncle Ho, expecting some patriotic sentiment. Instead, he
said, ``Best air conditioning in Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
   After touring Ho's modest residence _ a three-room house on
stilts that would fit into the presidential game room in Saigon _
we stopped for lunch. Over spring rolls and beer, Trung gave me an
idea of what middle-class life in Hanoi is like. He still lives
with his parents, four of them in three rooms, sharing a bathroom
with several other families. ``It's nice,'' he said, and I imagined
it was, compared to the poverty that weighs down so many
Vietnamese. When I picked up the bill _ $15 _ Trung was deeply
grateful. ``That's more than I spend on food in a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop, the Army Museum, was many blocks away, so we
climbed onto Trung's motorbike and braved the Hanoi traffic, which
is almost as crazy as Ho Chi Minh City's. Trung had to go to work,
so we parted at the museum. I spent the rest of the afternoon
wandering from exhibit to exhibit, feeling alternating stabs of
pain over what my country had done and surges of resentment over
the lopsided way it was often being presented.
</P>
<P>
   The captions were in Vietnamese, French and English. I noticed
something in them that hadn't dawned on me until then, and it
served as a reminder that wounds haven't healed just because they
are unseen. The Vietnamese don't refer to the bloodletting of the
1960s and '70s as the Vietnam War. They call it the American War.

 &HT;    AMC plans 2 days of monkey business
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year before man first landed on the moon, Hollywood
unleashed ``Planet of the Apes,'' a decently filmed sci-fi thriller
with Charlton Heston as, well, Moses in a spacesuit going mug to
mug with humankind's newfound superiors: chimps, gorillas and
orangutans.
</P>
<P>
   For every dollar it cost, ``Apes'' earned back more than four.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood then did what it always does when money's floating
around. It vowed to run the whole concept into the ground. ``Apes''
sparked four sequels and two TV shows, nary a one of them even
barely watchable.
</P>
<P>
   But with little else to do for a holiday weekend, AMC on Sunday
and Monday is trotting out all five films in a kind of
30th-anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 1968's ``Planet of the Apes,'' you can watch
1970's ``Beneath the Planet of the Apes,'' 1971's ``Escape From the
Planet of the Apes,'' 1972's ``Conquest of ...'' and 1973's
``Battle for ...'' There's even a new two-hour special _ ``Behind
the Planet of the Apes'' _ for those who ``Can't Get Enough of the
Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe only Einstein could figure out why, but when AMC starts
its ``Apes'' marathon at 9 a.m. Sunday the films will first run in
near reverse order. Chicken to the egg, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a life will likely consider watching only the
original ``Planet'' (3:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. Sunday, 3:30 p.m. and
5:30 p.m. Monday).
</P>
<P>
   But there are reasons to also catch the first hour of ``Behind
the Planet of the Apes'' (5:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Sunday, 11 p.m. and
4 a.m. Monday). It's full of gee-whiz facts about the original film
you never even knew you needed to know.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who's behind that mask? Edward G. Robinson was hired first to
play the orangutan Dr. Zaius. He even performed in a $5,000 makeup
test used in March 1966 to determine whether the filmmakers could
pull off actors in ape gear without audiences laughing at them.
Robinson later pulled out of the project for health reasons. That's
when Maurice Evans joined up.
</P>
<P>
   -- The prosthetics pro: John Chambers, who created prosthetics
for ``The Munsters,'' ``The Outer Limits'' and ``Lost in Space,''
was the makeup guy, turning 200 actors into apes. He was awarded a
special Oscar. His other claim to fame: Spock's pointy ears for
``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Where'd they find the lovely Nova? Heston's nonspeaking
girlfriend in the film was played by Linda Harrison, a former
beauty queen. She was under contract at the studio but had little
if any acting experience. She also happened to be dating studio
chief Richard Zanuck, the exec who green-lighted the film.
</P>
<P>
   -- It didn't make the cut: Trimmed from the original film was a
sequence shot revealing that Nova was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   -- The sound of the fury: Jerry Goldsmith wrote the music score
and got an Oscar nomination. The score's unusual sounds came from
banging metal mixing bowls, a ram's horn and a Brazilian instrument
that emitted sounds similar to ape vocalizations.
</P>
<P>
   -- The bottom line: ``Planet'' cost $5.8 million to make. It
grossed $26 million.

 &HT;    Places to see in Vietnam
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 6: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a world of things to see in Vietnam, many of them having
nothing to do with the war. Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   -- Cao Dai Cathedral: Cao Dai is an indigenous religion that
mingles Eastern and Western faiths and claims 3 million followers.
Its seat, an ornate, exuberantly colored cathedral northwest of Ho
Chi Minh City, has to be the strangest sites in Vietnam. The
novelist Graham Greene called it ``a Walt Disney fantasia of the
East,'' with dragons and enormous eyes staring out from windows and
green snakes slithering down pink columns. The daily noon Mass
makes for quite a show.
</P>
<P>
   -- China Beach: Vietnam has scores of great beaches. The
best-known, thanks to the late-1980s television show of the same
name, is China Beach, a gorgeous crescent of sand set against the
backdrop of the Marble Mountains. During the war, American GIs
based in nearby Danang made the beach their favorite recreation
spot. Now, foreign investors are building Western-style resort
hotels in an effort to turn it into Vietnam's Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   -- Halong Bay: You've probably seen it even if you haven't been
there. More than 1,500 islands rear their limestone heads out of
the Gulf of Tonkin east of Hanoi, a dramatic stretch of coastline
that's been feaured in movies from ``Indochine'' to the latest
James Bond installment. Most visitors see the bay on land-sea tours
out of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hoi An: This small town, a few miles from Danang, was once
one of the great ports of Southeast Asia. In the late 1700s the Thu
Bon River silted up, slowing commerce, but the old Asian atmosphere
of narrow streets remains. The centuries-old architecture somehow
escaped this century's wars.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hue: After Vietnam threw off Chinese rule 200 years ago, the
country was united under a monarchy that established its seat in
this small city on the central coast. During the 1968 Tet
Offensive, Hue fell to the Communists and then was retaken in a
battle that some historians regard as the war's worst. The city has
rebuilt, however, and provides a glimpse of an older Vietnam.
Tourists visit to see the temples, the imperial citadel and the
mausoleums of the emperors along the Perfume River.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Mekong Delta: South of Ho Chi Minh City, the country
becomes a vast flatland punctuated by outlets of the mighty Mekong
River, the lifeline of Southeast Asia. This is Vietnam's
breadbasket, with rice and orchards and more tropical fruits than
you've ever seen. Boat tours are booked out of Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   -- My Lai: There were atrocities on all sides during the war;
this hamlet on the central coast is where ours happened. The
Vietnamese have built a memorial park and museum on the site where
U.S. troops massacred several hundred unarmed civilians in 1968.
Visiting is a very sobering experience.

 &HT;    Alliance gives peek at `Lives'
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Atlanta heard the first of Elton John's new music
Thursday and got a sneak peek of the dance and romance in the Walt
Disney musical ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,'' which gets
its world premiere this month at the Alliance Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in a rehearsal room of the Woodruff Arts
Center, Alliance Theatre artistic director Kenny Leon and Disney
executive Tom Schumacher introduced two passion-stoked production
numbers from the upcoming joint production, the first Disney stage
musical not based on an animated film. Both pop-rock numbers showed
impressive tightening since early rehearsals last month in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening, a biracial cast of about 20 _ without sets and
costumes _ sang and danced through the back story of the legend,
the conquest and enslavement of the black Nubian people (including
Princess Aida) by the white Egyptian empire. In a love duet, Aida
(Heather Headley of Broadway's ``The Lion King'') and her Egyptian
soldier lover, Radames (Hank Stratton, a guest star of ``Beverly
Hills, 90210''), sang of their forbidden romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a long, delicate process,'' Schumacher said,
``especially because `Beauty and the Beast' and `The Lion King'
already had lots of development time (in animated films) before
they reached the stage. This is a bigger challenge. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``(Disney) chose the Alliance,'' Schumacher continued, ``after a
national survey of regional theaters ... not just for the facility
but because of Kenny Leon ... and the audience he's cultivated for
new work.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon said that in his first meeting with Disney execs, ``we
satisfied each others' nervousness'' about forming the kind of rare
partnership of commercial producer and nonprofit arts organization
that also created ``The Who's Tommy'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John, who teamed with lyricist Tim Rice on the songs, was
not present but is expected to attend a late rehearsal of the show,
which begins previews Sept. 17. Disney Chairman Michael Eisner will
reportedly be ``in and out of Atlanta'' to track the show's
progress and rule on its readiness for Broadway in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the appropriate viewer age for this sexily
costumed musical _ sophisticated by the standards of a Disney
family show _ Leon recommended ``9 or 10'' as a starting point.
Schumacher refused to name such a limit, saying, ``It depends on
your children. ... Are they ready to see `The King and I'?''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are selling briskly but are available (404-733-5000),
mainly in the second half of the eight-week run.

lately. (Dempsey, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    Showcasing a communal tradition
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Asha Tyler is only 5 years old, but she already knows to
get out her sewing basket whenever her mother, Darlyne Dandridge,
sits down to work at a quilt.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't realize it yet, but the thread in her needle will
link her to hundreds of African-American quilters across time and
geography. Many of them peer out of photographs taken by the
indefatigable Roland Freeman and displayed in ``A Communion of the
Spirits: African-American Quilters, Preservers and Their Stories''
at the Atlanta History Center. (His book of the same name _$34.95,
Rutledge Hill Press _ is available in the center's shop.)
</P>
<P>
   In a heroic 20-year effort that took the Washington, D.C.,
photographer from coast to coast, he has documented
African-American quilters and their quilts in all their diversity.
His odyssey took him to Mississippi shacks and the homes of
celebrities; it encompassed rural grandmothers and young, urban
sophisticates.
</P>
<P>
   The 130 photographs, each framed in a quilted mat that reflects
something about the quilting club or individual depicted, dominate
the show. The sheer number makes them overwhelming to look at, but
that makes a point as well. Clearly, the desire to make or own
quilts knows no economic, educational or age barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The photos are interspersed with miniature tableaux of quilting
activity, as well as actual quilts. The presence of the real thing
adds immeasurably to the show. They span the spectrum from
traditional geometric patterns and story quilts to the exuberant
syncopated riffs on the old patterns often associated with
African-American quilt making. Some are clearly utilitarian, while
others are intended as works of art to hang on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge's own quilt history is a microcosm. ``I have
progressed from traditional patterns to using those patterns with
African fabrics to expressing my own ideas, often about African
womanhood,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   If the figurative quilts are more obviously narrative, even the
abstract designs are rife with meaning. The best example in the
show is a poignant old, worn quilt whose maker elongated the
traditional double wedding ring pattern and called it ``the slave
chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge, who started a quilting club in Los Angeles, founded
West End Quilters after moving here in 1991. Clearly, quilting
serves an important social function as a great excuse to gather and
share in something.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Roland says that quilts keep you warm,'' Dandridge says,
``he doesn't just mean physically. He means warm at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Communion of the Spirits: African-American Quilters,
Preservers and Their Stories''
</P>
<P>
   Through Oct. 6. 10 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays; noon-5:30
p.m. Sundays. $7; $5 senior citizens; $4 ages 6-17; under age 5
free. Atlanta History Center, Atlanta, Ga . 404-814-4000.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: As Roland Freeman's documentary photographs attest,
quilting is a national passion.

CLONING OF PET AN INSULT TO NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA VALDEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The people who put up $2.3 million to have their dog
cloned provided comics with a deep vein of yuk-yuk material.
</P>
<P>
   But this is more than a high-tech version of what Roy Rogers did
to Trigger.
</P>
<P>
   It's the trivialization of both science and life.
</P>
<P>
   And a sorry demonstration of what researchers will do to get
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified owners of a collie-husky mix named Missy have
``hired'' a team of about 10 researchers to clone their 12-year-old
pooch. Dr. Mark Westhusin, an associate professor of veterinary
physiology at Texas A&AMP;M University, will head up the group.
</P>
<P>
   He told the ``New York Times'' that the project would yield lots
of valuable information about reproduction in dogs, a
little-studied subject.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say ``spay'' and ``neuter''?
</P>
<P>
   Doggie birth control is not what this is about.
</P>
<P>
   This is about a desire to prolong a friendship. It happens to
all pet lovers when Buster or Boots starts getting gray around the
muzzle.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to me when I was 5 years old and my dog, Shiner, got
hit by a car. He was patient enough to let me dress him up.
Ferocious enough to keep door-to-door salesmen away.
</P>
<P>
   If I could have cloned him, I would have.
</P>
<P>
   But then I never would have known Sheba, the dog who sat on a
footstool by the picture window and waited for me to come home from
school. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   I would have cloned her, too.
</P>
<P>
   But then I never would have met Carmel, who was also the best
dog in the world. If I'd cloned him, I never would have met Max or
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   They were all treasures.
</P>
<P>
   All different.
</P>
<P>
   Like people. Or leaves. Or snowflakes.
</P>
<P>
   Missy's owners are rich enough to indulge the natural desire to
duplicate a good dog. And foolish enough to think it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Their ``Missyplicity Project'' will fail because an individual
is more than its genes. Environment and experience are powerful
personality shapers. No matter how well the scientists succeed in
engineering another Missy, they will never succeed in creating
another Missy.
</P>
<P>
   They (begin ital) will (end ital) create a nasty distraction
from more important matters.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic research holds great promise. But to get to those
anticipated cures and other healing wonders, we have to negotiate
our way around an ethical abyss. Should a drowned child be cloned
back to life? Should parents be able to design the perfect baby?
Should brilliant minds be replicated? Should semihumans be
engineered and duplicated to do our dirty work?
</P>
<P>
   We need to consider such questions before we go much further
down DNA's Yellow Brick Road.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't decided what genetic engineering should be. But it
probably shouldn't be about cloning sheep, like last year's
Scottish Dolly. And it certainly shouldn't be about cloning dogs on
demand for people who have more money than sense.
</P>
<P>
   The uniqueness of natural creations _ dogs, people, snowflakes _
is sacred and miraculous. Turning the impressive advances of modern
science to the task of recreating a pet furthers the illusion that
it isn't. &QL; 
And that's a doggone shame. &QL;

   BBO-MARIS-MAIN _ It is considered the most magical number in
sports. But when Roger Maris hit his 61st home run in 1961, it was
almost anticlimatic. It was the first year of expansion and
Commissioner Ford Frick had ruled that to break Babe Ruth's record
of 60 homers, it had to be done in 154 games, not the new 162.
Maris, at 59 after his 154th completed game, finally hit No. 61 on
the final day of the season. Only 23,000 were on hand at Yankee
Stadium when Maris connected off Tracy Stallard of Boston. Most of
the media horde that had made Maris' life difficult were gone by
then, but the pressure continued to hamper Maris. He was never the
same on or off the field. He died at age 51 of cancer in 1985.

   BBO-MARIS-MUSEUM _ Harried shoppers hurry past, most oblivious

It's hard to find time for history when you have school clothes to
buy. But as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa get closer to 61 home runs,
more people are starting to stop and stare in amazement at the New
York Yankees uniform with No. 9 on the back or at the historic
baseballs or the grainy black-and-white film. The West Acres
Regional Shopping Center in Fargo, N.D., is home not only to Sears

home plate.
</P>
<P>
   He'll need his bat. Manager Jack McKeon is adamant that McGwire
won't be served any bowls of soup when he faces the Reds tonight,
Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon in Busch Stadium. When
Chicago's Sammy Sosa hit two home runs in three games this week
against the Reds, the team's office switchboard lit up.
Paraphrasing most messages - and removing the expletives - the

   BBO-MARIS-MAIN _ It is considered the most magical number in
sports. But when Roger Maris hit his 61st home run in 1961, it was
almost anticlimatic. It was the first year of expansion and
Commissioner Ford Frick had ruled that to break Babe Ruth's record
of 60 homers, it had to be done in 154 games, not the new 162.
Maris, at 59 after his 154th completed game, finally hit No. 61 on
the final day of the season. Only 23,000 were on hand at Yankee
Stadium when Maris connected off Tracy Stallard of Boston. Most of
the media horde that had made Maris' life difficult were gone by
then, but the pressure continued to hamper Maris. He was never the
same on or off the field. He died at age 51 of cancer in 1985.

It's hard to find time for history when you have school clothes to

more people are starting to stop and stare in amazement at the New
York Yankees uniform with No. 9 on the back or at the historic
baseballs or the grainy black-and-white film. The West Acres

against the Reds, the team's office switchboard lit up.

<P>
   The global economic crisis continues to deepen. The latest
horror, Russia's collapse, may be insignificant judged by that
economy's puny weight in the world, but it was nonetheless a
turning-point: the sickness that started in Asia is spreading
still, claiming victims far beyond its source.
</P>
<P>
   Investors cannot find time to count their mounting losses, so
busy are they trying to guess where the plague will strike next.
The recent extraordinary (and mainly downward) gyrations in
stockmarkets bear witness to the new surge of fright and
confusion_and to mounting concern that the turmoil in emerging
markets will end in worldwide depression.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time when anyone would be grateful for reassurance. Yet
the best the world's leaders could do was a tragicomic meeting of
Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, the first destroyed by political
enemies and forces beyond his control, the other crippled by his
own weakness of character. Was ever a ``summit'' so likely to be
prologue to disaster?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the early 1980s, global slump is a
thinkable, even plausible, outcome. Indeed, in some ways the danger
now is greater than it was then. Much of the world is already deep
in recession; the chances are that the worst is not yet over for
many big emerging-market economies (as we will continue to call
them for now), not to mention for a handful of rich-country
commodity producers, whose export revenues have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   What mainly stands between the world and an economic setback
worse than anything since the Great Depression of the 1930s is the
present momentum of growth in America (above all) and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Can that momentum be relied upon? Mid-week, Wall Street stood
some 15 percent lower than at its peak in July. Yet at these prices
American equities are still dear.
</P>
<P>
   If the market were to fall another 20 percent, say, the shock to
American consumers might be enough to bring the country's long
expansion to an end. With it would go any hope that the United
States could pull the world out of its troubles.
</P>
<P>
   With luck that will not happen. With luck Wall Street will take
its losses and stabilize. And if share prices do fall further, or
if demand in America slows abruptly for some other reason,
effective remedial action is still possible: the Fed could cut
interest rates (as it did, too much so as it turned out, after the
stockmarket crash of 1987) or Congress could cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to get from here to recession in America, and
thence to global slump, is likely to require not just bad fortune
but also bad judgment. Perhaps that thought is not as consoling as
it should be: when things get tough, judgment all too often seems
to go out of the window.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly dangerous, though by no means unexpected, form of
bad judgment is abroad just now. It is the kind that says: ``See,
that's what free-market capitalism does for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Using more or less those words, Malaysia's leader, Mahathir
Mohamad, announced Sept. 1 a bold initiative to put the country on
the path to recovery: an array of severe controls on cross-border
flows of capital. Malaysia must insulate itself from the global
market, he said; it will no longer place its fate in the hands of
currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the answer? In the past few weeks, the pundit consensus,
such as it is, has swung behind the idea that ``capital controls''
make sense. Unfortunately, as it stands, this is hardly more
illuminating than it would be to say ``monetary policy makes
sense.'' As with many things, it depends what you mean.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme, governments might try merely to regulate their
banks' exposure to currency risk: whether that is ``capital
controls'' or ``prudential supervision'' is a question of semantics
over which there is no need to shed ideological blood.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme is a conscientious attempt to create a kind
of financial autarky, a space in which the government can steal and
squander its citizens' wealth without the inconvenience of allowing
them any alternative.
</P>
<P>
   When the range of possibilities runs so widely, from the
defensible to the insane, it is well to make some careful
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's plan appears to be somewhat toward the crazy end of
the spectrum. By trying so hard to discourage capital outflows, the
government could end up, net, increasing them.
</P>
<P>
   Draconian capital controls do not stop capital flight (Latin
America in the 1980s, passim); what they may well stop is private
capital inflows -- and not just the volatile, short-term sort. An
abrupt and exaggerated slowing of inflows brought Malaysia and the
other ex-tigers to their present state. The best way back includes
a resumption of those inflows. Mahathir seems to be ruling this
out.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, a lot of hard thinking needs to be done about
the international financial system -- and, even more important,
about the domestic financial systems of emerging economies that
wish to avail themselves of the global capital market. Although the
economic pain that is being inflicted on Russia and the ex-tigers
is out of all proportion to the policy errors of their governments,
the fact remains that the vulnerability to financial crisis was
created not by international speculators and other bogeymen but by
woefully inadequate oversight of domestic finance, private, public
and quasi-public.
</P>
<P>
   But the governments concerned were not the only ones who failed
to realize that. They had many willing helpers in screwing things
up. There is plenty of blame to go around.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sentiment that it is not merely the international
capital market but the basic principles of capitalist economics
that need to be questioned, one can only despair that the thought
has even surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, China and India, which for years have been far less
connected to the global capitalist system than South Korea and the
others, have fared much better in this crisis. There are doubtless
lessons to be learned from this. But can it seriously be contended
that they chose the right path? Even if the tigers' troubles get
much, much worse before they get better, China and India after
their years of relative isolation will still be far, far poorer at
the end of it all.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the task now is to ensure that things do not in
fact get much worse. The heaviest burden of responsibility lies
with Japan, whose government could do a great deal to make the
world a safer place if at long last it took steps to repair its
broken banks, and began to act as a stabilizer for Asia (as the
United States was for Mexico after the peso crisis of 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, unless demand slows enough in America to justify
action by the Fed (which hasn't happened yet), it is a question of
avoiding mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   That should not be too difficult. Yet Malaysia has already made
one big error. And quite soon America's Congress threatens to make
another -- by failing, out of a mixture of exhaustion and
disapproval, to replenish the IMF's depleted resources.
</P>
<P>
   Two varieties of economic isolationism, of hoping that the world
and its troubles will go away. Come to think of it, there was a lot
of that in the 1930s.

ART REVIEW: QUIRKY DEALER WITH SHARP EYE FOR MASTERS OF OFFBEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Julien Levy: Portrait of an Art Gallery'' at the
Equitable Gallery, is the ideal end-of-summer show. It is a tumult
of ideas, every one of which has been picked over for the occasion
by two gifted and youthful enthusiasts, Ingrid Schaffner and Lisa
Jacobs. There is a great deal to see, almost all of it is worth
looking at, and none of it goes on for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than the portrait of an art gallery, it is the
portrait of an art dealer. Levy, who died in 1981, did not choose
with an eye to the market, though the market in time got the point
of what he had done. He chose by instinct, and to satisfy a
curiosity that never flagged. Adventure, not calculation, governed
his every move.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled fast, he traveled light, he went straight to the
sources of what he wanted, and he was lucky in his timing. When in
Paris in 1927, he asked Man Ray how he could get some of the
photographs in which Eugene Atget had recorded Paris as a
motionless and almost unpopulated dream city. Levy at that time
regarded photography as ``the supreme expression of our epoch,''
and Atget as its great old master, by then barely alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy,'' said Man Ray. ``Atget lives just up the road. Go and
knock on his door.'' Atget at that time did not have many requests
for his work, and he was delighted to see Levy. He lived as if
walled up among thousands of his photographs, and he was ready
(according to Levy's memoirs) to sell him prints for 40 cents
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   When Levy opened his gallery at 602 Madison Ave. in November
1931, it was at first devoted almost entirely to photography as a
high art. Very few people at that time wanted to pay real money for
a photograph, but within a year, Levy had presented everyone: Nadar
and Atget in 19th-century Paris, Americans from Paul Strand, Alfred
Stieglitz and Clarence John Laughlin to Walker Evans and Berenice
Abbott, and an elite born or based in Europe that included Man Ray,
Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Henri Cartier-Bresson (who made his American
debut with Julien Levy).
</P>
<P>
   This initial obsession with the camera could have overbalanced
the present show, which in point of fact comes in many guises and
succeeds in nearly all of them. It was therefore an inspiration on
the part of the curators to divide the available space with the
curved inner wall that Levy had had in his gallery.
</P>
<P>
   No one before had ever shown works of art on a wall that snaked
its way along the middle of the room, but Levy is said to have
liked it for two reasons. First, the curve reminded him of the
shape of a painter's palette. Second, it allowed him to make the
images follow one another with the effect of a cinematic narrative.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the present show takes on an intimate character. If
works whisper to us, we can hear what they say. Furthermore, they
have for the moment our entire attention, as distinct from the
sliding glance that a long flat wall often encourages. The subject
matter may change in a flash from photographs to paintings and
collages, or from surrealist objects to newspaper cartoons, or from
stage designs to plans for photo-murals as big as a house, and
onward to the books and magazines that made magic in Paris in the
1920s and 1930s. (The iconography of chess is not forgotten,
either.)
</P>
<P>
   It could feel jumpy, but the transitions give us a smooth ride.
Multitudinous as the choices may be, they literally ``hang
together'' as the products of a single highly energized fancy.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the honor roll of living artists was still being
tabulated, Levy got in early with one after another among them.
Almost all of them had links of some kind or another with
Surrealism. Levy showed sculptures by Giacometti in 1935, when they
started at $100. (Nothing was sold.) He also showed Max Ernst,
Dali, de Chirico and Magritte when no one else in New York was
making a fuss over them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the paintings were monumental by the standards of the
day. Ernst's ``Stolen Mirror'' (1941) shows him in his most
imperious form. ``The Tramway'' of 1946, by the Belgian painter
Paul Delvaux, has a grand, stubborn weightiness. Once we have seen
it, the Brussels tramways will never look the same again.
</P>
<P>
   With new artists, Levy had phenomenal luck. A nondescript young
man who hung around at his first show turned out to be Joseph
Cornell, a soft-spoken magician who was before long to make some of
the most memorable objects _ among them the portrait of Levy _ in
the present show.
</P>
<P>
   That luck (or that superior insight) continued. A young American
painter, Dorothea Tanning, said of Levy in the 1940s that ``his
temperament gave him the air of an extraterrestrial emissary,
fascinated and amazed by everything he saw and heard _ and read:
the offbeat, the occult, the enigmatic, the happened-on treasure of
the day.'' And we can see from Tanning's haunting portrait
``Deirdre'' (1940), with the subject's stately features and shock
of hair (made of sharp-pointed evergreens), that he knew how to
find someone whose vision was entirely her own.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was also a passionate enthusiast for the movies. In this,
as in all else, he cut a wide swath. The present show includes a
two-hour loop of experimental silent films, mainly sponsored by
Levy himself. In some of these, Ernst and others take part. At a
far extreme from these are the two original sketches from the Walt
Disney Studios at the time when ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''
was in production. Levy also presented avant-garde movies in the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were Leger's ``Ballet Mecanique,'' Duchamp's ``Anemic
Cinema'' and ``Un Chien Andalou'' by Dali and Bunuel.
</P>
<P>
   None of these movies would have been made without input from
Surrealism. Some of the works by minor Surrealists in this show now
look both feeble and contrived. But when we bend over the
microcosmographies of Ernst in this show, we marvel that so much
that has aged not at all could be packed into so small an image.
</P>
<P>
   So it may well be, in the end, that Levy's adventures in
Surrealism were the ones that have lasted best. Certainly the
Museum of Modern Art's survey of ``Fantastic Art, Dada,
Surrealism'' in 1936 can be read as a careful replay of Levy's more
headlong forays. Levy closed the gallery in 1949, shortly after the
suicide of his close friend Arshile Gorky.
</P>
<P>
   For an original and heartfelt estimate of Levy, I recommend the
brief memoir by Norman Mailer that is part of the catalog (due out
soon from the MIT Press). ``Julien was not an easy man to love,''
he writes. ``But I think I have some real love for him, because he
had one gift he gave you. He was a terribly stingy, quirky, odd,
offbeat man in about every way but one. Which is that he had
wonders to offer.'' Levy did have those wonders, in abundance, and
many of them are in this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julien Levy: Portrait of an Art Gallery'' remains at the
Equitable Gallery, 787 Seventh Ave., at 51st Street, Manhattan,
through Oct. 31.

ART REVIEW: SILO MEETS SATELLITE DISH IN THE NEW NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ There has never been a shortage of landscape in
New England, nor, for that matter, of artists to romanticize it
freely. But as industry, technology and suburbia have turned
hamlets into towns and farmland into malls, the focus has
drastically shifted. New takes on the old rural theme of human
harmony with nature are showing up in the work of artists from the
region. We've come a long way from the 19th-century vision of the
Sublime, a view of America as a glorious, pristine land where
nature connected man with God.
</P>
<P>
   How local artists register the rejiggered use and look of the
land is the subject of a catchall but appealing show,
``Post-Pastoral: New Images of the New England Landscape,'' at the
Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College here. It sets out some 50
objects made by 15 artists, from paintings to photographs to, well,
manipulated vegetable matter.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the disturbing reality of clearcutting timber and the
surreality of satellite dishes next to silos make viable subject
matter; others dwell nostalgically on the products and phenomena of
nature, and a few bring a resigned and sometimes cynical wit to the
theme of landscape in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its shortcomings, the show is certainly an improvement
on the outmoded juried biennials that the Hood, following the
custom of museums elsewhere, has long mounted as showcases for
local talent. Under a new policy, a series of theme exhibitions, of
which this is the pilot, will replace the hodgepodge biennials,
still allowing artists of the region a forum for their work while
presenting it in a sharper context.
</P>
<P>
   With its diversity of viewpoints, ``Post-Pastoral,'' organized
by Amy Schlegel, a curatorial fellow at the museum, has no real ax
to grind. Its approach is moderate: Not all change is bad, but
change has happened, and here is what it feels like. Although it
basically presents the work of regional artists, a few outlanders
have crept in, like Alan Sonfist of New York, whose concern has
long been the natural landscape, and Dan Ford, a satirical
nostalgist from Brooklyn. But the concentration is on Vermont and
New Hampshire, picture-postcard rural states where megadevelopment
still has the power to shock.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the aerial photographs of Alex MacLean that
track changes in what he calls ``settlement patterns'' of the two
states. Flying his Cessna 182, MacLean has for 20 years been
viewing from on high the sometimes conflicting arrangements of man
and nature, more recently registering the fact that nature is
losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Upscale subdivisions in the Shelburne area of Vermont; big bald
patches, caused by clearcutting, in the White Mountain forests of
New Hampshire; an ugly sprawl of storage lockers on a once-pristine
Vermont farm are tellingly depicted in these arresting photographs,
enhanced by their startling perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Esten, also a photographer, documents more subtle changes,
deliberately using a low-tech camera whose fuzzy images are of
sites in the Connecticut River Valley and northeastern Vermont. In
``Brook and White Bucket'' (1994), a commercial paint bucket lies
near a quiet stream; in ``Peak'' (1996), a shabby mobile home
obtrudes on the view of a dignified mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Another photographer, John Willis, accepts the depredations of
beavers as partners in nature's processes, making close-ups of
their dams and lodges with the devotion to detail of an
architectural photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings in the show are less impressive than the photographs.
The most accomplished work in this medium is that of Altoon Sultan,
whose slick Superrealist mode does not have much competition here.
But although her style seems ideal for calendar art, her subject
matter, the ``working landscape'' of farms, is fairly gritty.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Silage, Coventry, Vt. (1996),'' for instance, piles of
fodder serve as a repository for old tires; ``Quonset Barns,
Coventry, Vt.,'' of the same year depicts efficient but ugly
aluminum buildings replacing the picturesque wooden barns that have
long been a cliche of farm life.
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, if not always rewardingly, artists who work in
less conventional ways are not in scant supply. One is Suzanne
Pretty, a tapestry maker, whose weavings convey the impact of heavy
industry on a sylvan section of eastern New Hampshire, an unusual
subject for a tapestry maker, to say the least. Her most effective
piece, ``Fragmentation'' (1995-96), shows a stylized forest of
conifers invaded by earth-moving equipment and flatbed trains
lugging logs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Leslie Fry and Daniel Ladd make much of
nature's bounty. Ms. Fry has produced a group of wonderfully wacky
architectural ministructures that appear to be made of real fruits
and vegetables: brussels sprouts, melons, celery, beans, peanuts
and such.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd has set up what he calls a ``working relationship with
nature,'' an intricate process whereby he grows small gourds in
shaped plaster casts so that the gourds themselves emerge as
sculptural images, from fragments of ancient statues to modern
street fixtures. Their surfaces suggest stone or metal, but their
origins as gourds are betrayed by their protruding stems.
</P>
<P>
   Another natural medium is coaxed into sculpture by Bill Botzow.
His diminutive ``Pine Needle Farmhouse'' (1994), a traditional New
England connected house and barn made of pine needles roughly
covering an armature of stone and plywood, is set up in an outside
court of the museum to play off the postmodern architecture of
Charles Moore and Chad Floyd, who designed the Hood building.
</P>
<P>
   Another outdoor piece, and the most far-out object in the show,
is Lars-Erik Fisk's ``Barn Ball'' (1998), representing the
ubiquitous New England barn. But this one occurs in the form of a
big sphere, its red boards and fieldstone base rounded into a
roly-poly ball, while still allowing a look inside its doors and
windows. The comic shape seems to reflect a kind of Disneyfication
of the rural landscape, and it is seen by Fisk, who also
contributes a ``Field Ball,'' a ``Street Ball'' and a ``Tree Ball''
to the show, as an example of the ``packaging'' of a countryside
once known for its idiosyncracies.
</P>
<P>
   A show that is by turns benign and alarming, ``Post-Pastoral''
is a come-on and a cautionary tale for those who hanker for the
joys of rural life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-Pastoral: New Images of the New England Landscape''
remains at the Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, Hanover,
N.H., New Hampshire through Sept. 20

THE HALLOWED GROUND OF SPORTS CAR RACING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH SIANO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every form of racing has its spiritual home: Indianapolis for
Indy cars, Charlotte for stock cars, Pomona for dragsters. And for
a half-century, sports-car racing has had Watkins Glen, N.Y., host
from 1961 to 1980 of the United States Grand Prix Formula One race.
``Part of the appeal of the race was the uniqueness of it,'' said
Bob Kelly, who was the track's press chief from 1970 to 1980. ``You
had this tiny town of 2,700 people in upstate New York hosting a
race that was the focus of international attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Vintage Grand Prix next weekend at the Watkins Glen
International road-racing circuit will come almost 50 years to the
day after the postwar revival of road racing in the United States,
on Oct. 2, 1948. Cameron Argetsinger, who still practices law in
the village, was the force behind the race that day, which was run
over a 6.6-mile course that used Franklin Street, the Glen's main
drag, and other public roads encircling Watkins Glen State Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been said, and it's not entirely wrong, that I did it
because I had an MG-TC and didn't have a place to race it,''
Argetsinger, 77, said by telephone recently. ``But the idea was
born before World War II, when I got all excited reading about the
Vanderbilt Cup races on Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   The first races were a success, but with spectators separated
from the cars by only a rope in some cases, a serious accident was
almost preordained. In 1952, a race car hit and killed a 7-year-old
boy. ``That could have ended it right there,'' Argetsinger said.
``But the citizens loved having the race and were determined to
keep it going.'' To do so, the race had to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, the race committee bought land for a permanent track _
what is now Watkins Glen International _ on a hilltop west of the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins Glen International is now owned by the International
Speedway Corp., led by Bill France Jr., Nascar's president.
International Speedway and the glass maker Corning rescued the
track from bankruptcy in 1983, and the ISC gained full ownership
last year. The annual Winston Cup race in August draws many
thousands more than the United States Grand Prix ever did.
</P>
<P>
   But the Glen and the grand prix will forever be stuck together,
like the cars that were sucked into the track's once-infamous mud
pit, the Bog.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the mystique was timing: the race was run the first
weekend in October as a final boost for the tourism season. The
Finger Lakes foliage and the autumn chill made the experience all
the more vivid.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1960s, before Formula One became a
multimillion-dollar industry, everything about the grand prix
seemed more personal. The cars were practically within arm's reach,
too. Kelly, who went to high school in Watkins Glen, recalled the
early '60s, when Formula One teams kept their cars in the village
each night because the permanent circuit still did not have
garages. ``The local Chevy dealer's garage was the home of the
Ferrari team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers did more than open their garages to visitors. When
I covered my first grand prix as a journalist in 1978, I rented a
room with a local couple who lived about a half-block off Franklin
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The village's Norman Rockwell atmosphere did not, however,
survive the trip up the hill to the track, with its sometimes rowdy
mob of spectators. In 1971, the track was expanded to 3.4 miles
from 2.3 miles to satisfy Formula One's demands _ and the Bog was
born. ``When they were moving dirt to build what's now turn 11,
they found an underground spring,'' Kelly said. What started as an
informal challenge among motorcyclists to see who could get through
the mud pit without getting stuck soon turned into a competition
among junk cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then somebody got their car stuck in there pretty well,
and the fans decided in their inebriated wisdom to set it on
fire,'' he added. ``Pretty soon you had people going around the
infield `borrowing' other people's cars. I can remember seeing some
Corvettes on fire in there.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, the United States Grand Prix was sinking into
a financial bog. Bernie Ecclestone was establishing his grip on the
Formula One Constructors Association, the dominant team-owners
group, and he quickly took aim at the relatively primitive
conditions at the Glen. ``You couldn't really expect sponsors to
want to come,'' he said in a recent phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the team owners' increasing financial demands, another
mounting expense for the Glen was meeting the safety demands of the
drivers' association, which seemed to change from year to year,
Kelly said. The track also had no TV revenue and meager corporate
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then in the late '70s, we had a couple of races where bad
weather kept the crowd down,'' he said, ``and because the Watkins
Glen Grand Prix Corporation was a not-for-profit group, there was
never too much money in reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1980 grand prix was the last at Watkins Glen. ``I guess they
just forgot to pay us one year,'' is how Ecclestone recounted the
race's demise. In fact, the grand prix corporation was unable to
pay and declared bankruptcy in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Formula One has never returned, but the village _ which looks
much the same as it did in 1948 _ and the track have made a cottage
industry out of revisiting the era. Watkins Glen International
annually holds a reunion of old Formula One cars in summer, along
with next weekend's schedule of exhibition races for historic
competition cars.
</P>
<P>
   The village itself will be the site of the Watkins Glen Grand
Prix Festival on Sept. 11, including a re-creation of the first
races 50 years ago. And the library will dedicate its
6,000-square-foot addition, which will serve as a motor sports
research center when it opens next year.
</P>
<P>
   The sidewalks along Franklin and Fourth Streets are the Grand
Prix Drivers Walk of Fame, with markers honoring stars like Graham
Hill, a three-time grand prix winner, and Jackie Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   About 2.3 miles from the starting line of the original course,
on a granite boulder by the roadside, is a bronze plaque dedicated
to Miles and Sam Collier, brothers who drove in the early races.
It's at the spot where Sam Collier crashed and was killed in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Their survivors have since moved away from New York State. The
road bisects quiet farmland, where it could easily be forgotten _
just like a race that took place a half-century ago. But this is
Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody still puts flowers there,'' Argetsinger said.

`DEEP DOWN': DIGGING FOR MEANING IN SLAVERY'S WAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORk _ Maybe he just wanted to play the harmonica again.
Whatever his reasons, and try as he might, the charismatic Ruben
Santiago-Hudson cannot overcome the insurmountable obstacles
imposed on him by ``Deep Down,'' a preachy mishmash of a drama
about racism in rural Florida in the early days of the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago-Hudson deservedly earned a Tony for his richly detailed
comic portrayal of Canewell, the fidgety harmonica player in August
Wilson's ``Seven Guitars.'' Here he plays Daniel, a plain-spoken
ex-convict of unappreciated depth. In Doug Grissom's muddled work
at the Intar Theater, directed by John Lawler, Daniel takes a job
digging holes on land owned by Ned (Christopher Murney), a
mysterious, grizzled redneck who barks cantankerously whenever
Daniel has the temerity to wonder aloud what they are supposed to
be digging for, although Ned eventually confides that they're
prospecting for gold. Yep, gold.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, making a nuisance of herself around the
excavation site is Ned's teen-age daughter, Hannah (Catherine
Zambri), who spends lazy afternoons hurling racist insults at
Daniel, who is black, and then flirting with him. Her behavior
makes scant impression on Daniel, but nearly gives her father a
coronary. Ned may not mind black men working at his side, but he
draws the line at intimacy with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual tension, however, is really not the point here, and
neither is an exploration of the relationships among these three
souls. Grissom is a frustratingly restless dramatist; he shifts the
focus about once every 10 to 12 lines. His central thrust seems to
be the notion of coming to terms with one's heritage; it turns out
the old tin cups and chains that Ned and Daniel uncover once
belonged to slaves who lived on the land. Daniel, growing
increasingly swept up by the history of his people, has the idea of
exhibiting the artifacts in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   The pall cast by slavery 100 years down the line is a weighty
theme, but skated over so superficially in ``Deep Down'' that the
audience is provided no insight into what an encounter with the
South's horrible legacy signifies for any of Grissom's characters.
No larger meaning is derived from anything they do or say, and the
play ultimately trails off, like an abandoned ship drifting into
the mist. Ms. Zambri's Hannah is perversely given the play's
closing monologue, a speech that suddenly, and oddly, suggests the
whole evening has been about her.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, when all else fails, Lawler has his players make
music. As the lights go down on one curious scene after another,
Santiago-Hudson whips out his harmonica, accompanied by the blues
guitarist Bill Sims Jr. Sims is the best thing about ``Deep Down''
_ the second-best thing is Charles Kirby's realistic set _ and it
seems completely fitting that Sims' involvement here should have
absolutely nothing to do with anything else that occurs onstage.

   PEARL CLEAGE, author of ``What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary
Day''

<P>
   ``Alice Walker's new novel is my hot title this fall. I can't
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH WILSON, spokeswoman for Chapter 11 bookstores:
``Besides all the obvious ones, I think the Lindbergh biography by
Scott Berg is going to be very big. And `Rocket Boys' by Homer
Hickam is a great read.'' Other titles to look for: ``The Tennis
Partner'' by Abraham Verghese, ``The Professor and the Madman'' by
Simon Winchester (``an extraordinary book'') and Peter Jennings'
``The Century.'' ``And, of course, everybody's talking about Tom
Wolfe. ...''
</P>
<P>
   MELISSA FAY GREENE, author of ``The Temple Bombing'':
``Definitely the Philip Roth novel `I Married a Communist' and
Alexander Solzhenitsyn's `November 1916.'''
</P>
<P>
   LEE WALBURN, editor in chief of Atlanta magazine: ``I'm looking
forward to reading (the paperback reprint of) `Home Fires Burning'
by Robert Inman. And, like everybody else, I want to read Tom
Wolfe's `A Man in Full.'''
</P>
<P>
   FRANK REISS, owner of A Cappella Books .``Obviously, there's a
buzz about Tom Wolfe's new book. A couple that I'm really looking
forward to are Michael Chabon's `Werewolves in Their Youth' and
Ethan Canin's `For Kings and Planets.' He's another really good
writer we haven't heard from in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   E. LYNN HARRIS, author of ``If This World Were Mine'': ``I'm
looking forward to reading `Stigmata' by Phyllis Perry, of course.

and `Something's Wrong With My Scale' by Van Whitfield.''

<P>
   PAUL COSSMAN, president of Humpus Bumpus bookstore . ```The
First Horseman' by John Case is a biomedical thriller ... that has
what everybody wants these days.'' Other picks for fall: ``The
Children's Civil War'' by James Marten, the Georgia Conservancy's
``Highroad Guide to the Georgia Mountains'' and the Reader's Digest
``Book of Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   FREDERICK ALLEN, author of ``Atlanta Rising'': ``I'm curious

Full.'''

ENSEMBLE CAST MAKES `FRIENDS' A TALKY DOWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - All the iars, cheaters and adulterers who wallow
through ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' feel bad about their sexual
transgressions and infidelities. But that doesn't stop them from
sinning every chance they get.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they share their misery in this unhappy comedy of
venom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' displays a painful intimacy about
sexual misery with a group of people who are animated only by the
unease of their frustrated lives and what passes for relationships
among the overanalytical.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Neil LaBute mined this same frigid territory
with his first film, ``In the Company of Men,'' in which his
women-hating heroes mentally tortured a deaf secretary because they
could get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute comes back with sharper and wittier vitriol in ``Your
Friends and Neighbors,'' in which men and women torture each other
under the theory that you always hate the ones you can reach. This
particular ``menage a angst'' centers on three friends:
</P>
<P>
   - Jerry (Ben Stiller), a college drama professor who has never
found a relationship or a romantic moment he can't dissect to
death.
</P>
<P>
   - Barry (Aaron Eckhart), a sexual sniveler who tries to whine
his wife into being happier.
</P>
<P>
   - Cary (Jason Patric), a psychotic who rehearses his bed talk
and seduces women for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The women they inflict themselves upon include Jerry's longtime
girlfriend (Catherine Keener), who will do anything for a moment of
peace, and Barry's wife (Amy Brenneman), whose most romantic notion
is the cessation of lust.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the whirlpool of their libidos, these friendless
enemies deceive each other in spiraling patterns. Their only solace
is their only punishment: None of them can ever be happy.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute twists his characters through painful rounds of sexual
balletics, a dance at which he has become much more adept than he
was during ``In the Company of Men.''
</P>
<P>
   As scriptwriter, he reveals the bitterness that can underline
the most mundane conversations between men and women who are
through with each other without admitting it.
</P>
<P>
   As director, he films most of the encounters from uncomfortable
angles: too close, too intimate. His shots are designed to make us
uncomfortable, to feel the same dis-ease that his characters do
with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' would have worked better as a
shorter film or with the addition of other characters who had
something else going on in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute's people are all cut from the same cloth, and the
repetitious pattern wears out the movie's ability to depress us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' comes from the same depressive
sexual perspective as ``Carnal Knowledge ''but without attaining
that film's emotional peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Keener complains about all her lovers: ``You just talk too
much.'' It's the problem with the movie, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' is rated R for profanity, sex and
nudity. For all its incessant talk about sex, the physical acts are
deglamorized, anti-erotic. That's LaBute's point: Sex is not the
province of Eros. It's the battleground of Ares. 3 stars. &QL;

WAS SUPPORT FROM BLACK CELEBS THE MISSING MAGIC INGREDIENT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it about being criticized _ and then canned _ that
forces somebody to abandon his middle-of-the-road demeanor and say
what he really thinks?
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson, late of ``The Magic Hour,'' or, as my Southern
California colleagues mercilessly dubbed it, ``the tragic hour,''
has renewed vigor. Watch his lame-duck talker and you'll notice a
kind of yeah-we-bad attitude, giving ``Magic'' a certain zip it
lacked precancellation. Still stinks, but the odor no longer
literally cleans out the senses.
</P>
<P>
   Magic is now discussing the disaster, and, surprisingly, he
chose a black-owned outlet to do it. Radio, no less. During his
playing days, Magic wasn't what you'd call an outspoken brother
with a cultural conscience. But change is good, especially when
it's in your favor.
</P>
<P>
   He recently told Los Angeles-based Radioscope, the radio
features syndicate, that black celebrities dissed him and ignored
him, zooming past him as if he were a brother trying to catch a cab
after nightfall. Figured his amateurish hour was too low-wattage to
pump their high-priced wares.
</P>
<P>
   Such snubs hurt his show, he says; he even theorizes that
similar treatment helped bring other late-night brothers to their
knees. He talks of Keenen Ivory Wayans and Sinbad's ``Vibe'' as
having had similar problems with the A-list black folks, whom he
refuses to name (hey, his boldness goes only so far). But let's
face it, how many A-list black film and TV stars are there?
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to support each other, and we don't do that,''
Magic told Radioscope. ``Black stars think that if they're not on
Leno or Letterman, then they're not making it. That's the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, says the Magic Man, was how some of those black celebs
were unknowingly led astray by white publicists and managers with
no stake in black industry progress. These publicists often run
interference for stars, at the expense of ``worthy black causes.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never thought of a talk show as a social or political
cause, but I get his drift. From the new organizations urging
moviegoers to attend black films on opening weekends (to impress
theater owners enough to keep them showing these and other black
films) to a Los Angeles group campaigning to save black-cast shows
like ``The Parent'Hood,'' there's a sense that black art is dying.
</P>
<P>
   The contention is that if African-Americans don't support black
art, who will? This is a dicey proposition; not every show with a
black cast needs to be saved, and not every movie starring black
folks is a viewing joy. In fact, many are painful disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Magic's own late-night party tanked partly because of Magic, and
he admits as much, saying, ``Maybe I wasn't the right person.''
Same could be said of Wayans. And Chris Spencer. It became clear
early that Magic was merely a Celebrity chatting up Another
Celebrity, moaning together about the joys and tribulations of
Being Famous. Case in point was last week's show with Will Smith. I
thought I'd stumbled upon three guys (sidekick Tommy Davidson was
in on it) hanging out after a game of hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Magic does make a good point, though I question whether a
professional basketball player who employed a white agent and was
known to be difficult to pin down because of his ``handlers,'' is
the most credible individual to make it.
</P>
<P>
   But welcome back anyway, my brother. He says he'll continue to
urge blacks to support whomever makes the next attempt at a black
variety show because, ``We still need an avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, even though my show is canceled ... all minorities
suffer. Because regardless if the show was good or not, you don't
have an outlet anymore. Now we will complain because we don't have
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   While also remembering we're better off accepting nothing than
just anything.

`ANIMORPHS` BOOK SERIES TAKES SHAPE ON NICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Kids all over America will morph into couch potatoes
tonight, (note: Friday, Aug. 4) as the tube adaptation of the
fabulously popular ``Animorphs'' book series makes its debut on the
Nickelodeon cable network.
</P>
<P>
   The books (15 million in print since 1996) tell the continuing
story of a group of young friends who get the gift of
shape-shifting from a dying alien prince. By becoming any living
creature they touch, the kids, led by brave and true Jake, do
battle against the evil Yeerks, who are trying to take over the
human race.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action TV series based on a megapopular book series would
seem to have a built-in audience ready and waiting for whatever
hits the screen. But expectations will be sky-high among
``Animorphs'' fans, who typically devour the sequential little
books cover to cover.
</P>
<P>
   This new series' toughest competition won't be whatever
counterprogramming the Disney Channel comes up with but, rather,
the millions of mind-movie adaptations already in production inside
young readers' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Forte, executive producer of ``Animorphs,'' knows the
perils of a text-to-TV transition. A couple of years ago, Forte and
Scholastic Productions oversaw just such a transition for the
even-more-popular-if-that's-possible ``Goosebumps'' books. That
anthology series quickly became the most popular thing on kid TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading the books is a very private experience for kids,''
said Forte, in a recent telephone interview. ``All of this is in
their mind's eye. When you go to television, it becomes a shared
experience. You have to keep true to the things they hold onto,
which are usually the characters and the overall story line.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte said that protecting the makeup of key characters is
all-important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we would never think of making Jake a loser,'' she
said. ``He would definitely not change.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said ongoing story elements must remain intact, within
``a new reality, one that works for an audio-visual medium.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed of storytelling, for example, will be the chief
difference kids may notice between the books and the new show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pacing is different in the show,'' she said. ``It has to
be, to keep the audience watching. There are pages of descriptive
material and exposition in the books. Exposition doesn't work very
well in television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also can't do justice to some of the descriptions of what
it feels like to be the animals. What we've done is captured, in a
visual style, that kind of energy and feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, for example, the kids morph into lizards. To
capture that moment, the show attempted to visually ``create a
sense of nervousness and jeopardy,'' Forte said. ``We sort of gave
it a `lizardvision' look, for lack of a better term, that gives it
a special energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes sort of our our answer to those very wonderful
descriptions in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte has obviously spent some time analyzing the vast appeal of
the book series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like a metaphor for adolescence and for
childhood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have a great sense of empowerment. They're able to
accomplish amazing things, not just through their ability to morph.
They are true heroes. They are loyal, they are smart, they work
cooperatively. It sounds corny, but those are things kids aspire
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, they're feeling some alienation as they get
older. People have expectations for them they're not sure how to
meet. The books create a reality that many kids feel already: `I
don't know how to handle this, the changes going on in my life, but
I will prevail. I'll figure out how to do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The animals are sort of a metaphor for all of that. They are
not controllable, which is just the way kids feel when they get
into adolescence. They don't know how to control themselves, their
body is changing, their feelings are changing, their expectations
are changing.''

COLORFUL NARRATIVE BRINGS QUEST FOR BLACK DIAMONDS, BLACK GOLD TO
LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Black diamonds! Black gold!
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the energy business will recognize those as
romantic pseudonyms for lucrative findings of coal and oil.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases are also the title of a compelling work now out by
Fort Worth native Don Woodard about the legendary Texas Pacific
Coal and Oil Co. In full, Woodard's book is titled ``Black
Diamonds! Black Gold: The Saga of Texas Pacific Coal and Oil
Company'' (Texas Tech University Press, 322 pages, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   The full title is an apt description of this dense book. It is a
saga. But in addition to writing a fascinating and rich history of
a multibillion-dollar energy company, Woodard has also skillfully
captured the spirit of a hundred-year era.
</P>
<P>
   From his description of coal miners drinking at the horseshoe
bar at the Snake Saloon in Thurber to the ``Seventh Street Gang,''
a group of powerful businessmen wielding political clout at the
Fort Worth Club, Woodard has written such a detailed history that
readers will feel they are on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is because Woodard was an insider of sorts; he was
a landman for T&AMP;P from 1952 to 1964. But it's his skillful
storytelling that makes the history dance off the page.
</P>
<P>
   And when T&AMP;P first hits its black diamonds and black gold,
readers have a front-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day in 1880, while riding through northern Erath's hills,
Will Johnson stopped at a farmhouse for a cool drink of water,''
Woodard writes. ``He told the farmer that he was looking for timber
for his fence post-and-crosstie operation. The sodbuster replied by
telling of the hard time he was having digging a well.
</P>
<P>
   ```Black rock makes it hard to dig,' he allowed, scuffing at a
small pile that had been chiseled from the shallow hole. ...
Johnson became excited _ he knew instantly that the black rock was
coal. As he gazed intently at the substance, visions of black
diamonds danced in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, W.W. Johnson, a recent Texas transplant supplying posts
and crossties to the Texas and Pacific Railway as it finished the
first transcontinental railroad line, now had a new product for the
railroad: coal. The big black engines on the rail line hungered for
it. And a company was born.
</P>
<P>
   T&AMP;P's first gusher of oil at the McCleskey farm in West Texas,
almost 30 years later, also had a profound impact on the company,
the nearby town of Ranger and the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``News of the McCleskey's storybook ending raced across Texas _
indeed across America _ like a prairie fire,'' Woodard writes.
``There was no radio in 1917 _ the first commercial radio broadcast
did not air until 1920 _ so word was spread by telegram, newspaper,
and word of mouth. ... The fame of Ranger swept over the land and
the black gold rush was on.''
</P>
<P>
   After that a host of businessmen well known to Fort Worth
natives were involved with the company. Among them Amon Carter, Sid
Richardson and H.B. ``Babe'' Fuqua, a former CEO of the company and
a legendary figure.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard pulls from a book on the Fort Worth Club by Irvin Farman
to describe Fuqua's considerable influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some three decades _ the '50s, '60s, and '70s, especially
after the death of Amon Carter in 1955 _ Babe Fuqua's name was
synonymous with civic leadership, hardheaded business acumen and
political clout in Fort Worth,'' Farman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard adds: ``It could be said that no decision of the Fort
Worth establishment was ever made without Fuqua's acquiescence and
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuqua was also instrumental in T&AMP;P's development. But after
decades of growth, the Texas independent was eventually sold in
1963 for $277 million to Indiana-based Joseph E. Seagram &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Seagram sold T&AMP;P to Sun Oil Co. for $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Oil spun off the company in 1988 and a year later, the name
changed to Oryx Energy Co., which comes from the Greek word meaning
``to dig,'' Woodard writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``While not a bad name for an oil company, the few graying
veterans who still attend the TP ex-employee Christmas parties in
the 1990s would sniff, `Not as good as Texas Pacific,''' he writes.
``But Texas Pacific was gone with the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for us, Woodard was still around to write its
history before that evaporated into the air as well.

   ``The Emperor's Nightingale: Restoring the Integrity of the
Corporation in the Age of Shareholder Activism''
</P>
<P>
   By Robert A.G. Monks
</P>
<P>
   Addison Wesley, $26
</P>
<P>
   Corporations, according to Adam Smith, are artificial life
forms, neither human nor machine, but parts of both. Yet the
corporation is also on the ``verge of a profound restoration: a
return to its original, highly adaptive and accountable form,''
writes investment adviser Robert Monks. Part of that is a
resurgence toward corporate governance, the way corporations
balance power. Monks describes this new climate and the role
shareholders play.

   ``Getting Started in Security Analysis''
</P>
<P>
   By Peter J. Klein
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $18.95
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there is a science to investing, argues
PaineWebber Vice President for Investments Peter Klein. It's called
security analysis, but Klein warns up front that it could take
years, even decades, to master it. His book takes readers through
an overview of the fundamentals of security analysis, with chapters
on accounting, economics, investment mathematics and quantitative
analysis (and those are the easy chapters). Concepts such as equity
analysis and credit analysis are also included.

   ``Write for Results''
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Lauchman
</P>
<P>
   Amacom, $39.95
</P>
<P>
   This is the first book in a series developed by the American
Management Association's publishing arm that combines a book with a
CD-ROM. The association calls this series the Get Ahead Toolkit.
Because of its interactive nature, it provides a much more lively
look at material that can often be troublesome to pick up and read.
This book covers the basics of effective writing; the CD provides
hands-on training using the principles in the book.

   SUNDAY MARKETS PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   The AJC is planning a package for this Sunday examining whether
the stock market volatility has altered consumer behavior, as well
as the plans of businesses that are directly affected by the whims
of consumers. Early reporting indicates that consumer confidence is
eroding, but other forces are probably more important than concerns
about the market. There's no doubt, however, that the market news
will reinforce some negative trends that were already at work. A
budget with all of the stories and visual elements that will run in
this package will move on the Cox wire. A CoxNet repackaged page
will be created and posted on the Cox server on Friday afternoon.
Please call Ed Bean at 404-526-5032 or ebean(at)ajc.com, or call
CoxNet at 404-526-5456.

   KUWAIT-IRAQ _ KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ When Saddam Hussein closed
the door to weapons inspections at just eight of his palaces last
year, U.S. aircraft carriers and troops swooped into the Persian
Gulf ready for a showdown that was barely averted. Last month,
Hussein put a stop to all inspections anywhere, but the U.S.
reaction has been so muted that people are questioning U.S. resolve
against Iraq. Kuwaitis are watching closer than anyone. Government
officials remain calm, saying that the United States has just
learned, after the widely unpopular military build up last year,
that it needs to take a lower profile against Iraq. They are still
grateful for the U.S. troops buffering their border with Saddam.
They have not forgotten that the United States led the coalition
that freed them from Iraqi occupation. They named a luxury
apartment building after their liberator, former President George
Bush. But seven years after the war, many Kuwaitis wonder why they
still have to live with Saddam on their border. (Kaplow, Cox News

   IMPEACH-HYDE _ WASHINGTON _ Henry Hyde still vividly remembers
the most frightening day in his life. In 1945, he was a 20-year-old
Navy ensign skippering an amphibious boat in the South China Sea.
The boat was tied up to a grounded freighter when a typhoon struck
and ``the sky and the ocean turned solid green. The waves, man,
they were 25 feet high. I was slapping against the freighter like
this _ slap, slap, slap,'' he says, his hand hitting the desk. You
thought you were going to die any minute. My knees turned to
water.'' ``Are we going to make it?'' his worried crew asked.
``Sure, sure, we'll be fine,'' Hyde reassuringly replied. Now, half
a century later, he appears equally calm in turbulent political
waters. As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the
Chicago-area Republican is poised to take center stage in the most
politically charged event since Watergate _ weighing evidence in a
possible impeachment proceeding against President Clinton.
(Morehouse, Cox News Service 1800).
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LEGAL _ WASHINGTON _ The authors of the U.S.
Constitution wrote that impeachment _ a formal accusation that a
public official is unfit to serve in office _ should result from
``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' No one
quibbles over treason and bribery. But what did the framers mean by
high crimes and misdemeanors? (Morehouse, Cox News Service 650).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS _ WASHINGTON _ History shows that impeachment
is more of a political than a legal process. (Shepard, Cox News
Service 650).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-PROCESS _ If historical precedents are followed,
potential impeachment proceedings would go like this. (Cox News
Service 430).

<P>
   CLINTON-DEMOCRATS _ WASHINGTON _ Democrats hope that President
Clinton's reputation won't hurt his efforts to raise $18 million in
big contributions at ``unity events'' in August through October.
They're depending on him to help offset similar efforts by the
Republican party. The chief House GOP fund-raiser, Rep. John Linder
of Georgia, says the GOP has already raised more than $17 millio
toward its goal of $37 million in big gifts during the same period.
Both parties are getting a lot of those funds from favor-seekers
giving the kind of ``soft-money'' contributions that would be
outlawed under a campaign finance bill that Sens. McCain and
Feingold promise to bring to the Senate floor for a vote between
Monday Sept. 7 and Friday Sept. 11. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   DOWNSIZING-CONDO When Jill Vantosh, an Atlanta interior
designer, downsized froma house to a condo, she seized an
opportunity to create a streamlined interior that emphasizes a few
of her favorite things _ including an unconventional material.
Vantosh stripped the second-floor unit of a 1950s red-brick
building to its concrete bones, from floor to ceiling , then
extended the material to the kitchen countertops. The result is a
clean, industrial look made warm and inviting by juxtaposing the
unpainted beams and chrome furnishings with oak floors and rich
cabinetry. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS

   SUNDAY MARKETS PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   The AJC is planning a package for this Sunday examining whether
the stock market volatility has altered consumer behavior, as well
as the plans of businesses that are directly affected by the whims
of consumers. Early reporting indicates that consumer confidence is
eroding, but other forces are probably more important than concerns
about the market. There's no doubt, however, that the market news
will reinforce some negative trends that were already at work. A
budget with all of the stories and visual elements that will run in
this package will move on the Cox wire. A CoxNet repackaged page
will be created and posted on the Cox server on Friday afternoon.
Please call Ed Bean at 404-526-5032 or ebean(at)ajc.com, or call
CoxNet at 404-526-5456.

   PRISONER-BERENSON _ MIAMI _ ``President Clinton visited with
Monica Lewinsky on 37 occasions, but he can't see us once,'' said
Mark Berenson, his voice trembling with anger. For the last two and
a half years, the New Yorker and his wife, Rhoda Berenson, have
worked to free their daughter, Lori Berenson, from a windowless
prison some 500 miles outside Lima, Peru, where she's serving a
life sentence for treason. The 28-year-old MIT graduate was
convicted in 1996 of plotting to take over Peru's Congress by
hooded judges during a secret trial. The Berensons have tried
repeatedly to see Clinton, who has asked Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori to review their daughter's case. I will visit in New York
with the couple, who will be just back from a visit with their
daughter at the prison, located 12,700 feet above sea level. I will
also visit with other members of Lori Berenson's family, who live
in Palm Beach, Florida. Story will focus on the family's plight to
win their daughter's freedom, and where Lori Berenson's case stands
now. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   POOR-SUBURBS _ WASHINGTON _ The economy is booming, but not for
everybody. Two decades of declining wages have squeezed the middle
class and flattened the poor. Nowhere is this trend more apparent
than in suburbia, where the Cleavers have given way to the Joads,
with little or no social safety net left. (Shepard and Jaspin, Cox

   BOWLES _ WASHINGTON _ White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles,
who for nearly two years has been a camera-shy insider, may be
stepping into the limelight as a Democratic candidate for North
Carolina governor in 2000. Many believe that Bowles's business
background, moderate ideology and personal fortune make him ideal
to replace popular Gov. James Hunt, who is retiring after his
fourth term. Bowles hasn't made it official, but he's definately
leaving the White House this year and has been attracting a lot of
attention. The step would be almost logical, some North Carolinians
say, since politics is in his blood. His late father, Hargrove
``Skipper'' Bowles, is a legendary figure in North Carolina
politics. (Moscoso, Cox News Service).

Elizabeth Stoner has become a household name in Mississippi. She
filed an initiative in June that would put the issue of riverboat
casinos to a statewide vote, giving Mississippians a chance to kick
the casinos out. If they vote to ban gambling, the 30 riverboats
docked in eight counties along the Mississippi River and the Gulf
Coast would have two years to shut down. (Rochell, Atlanta

   BINGO _ ROCK HILL, S.C. - The Indian tribe that didn't really

raking in about $2 million a month at the largest bingo operation
on the Eastern Seaboard. Located in a former Sears Roebuck store on
the edge of this college town, Catawba Bingo offers games every day
except Sunday, luring thousands of folks from all over the
Southeast. On Big Games days, twice each month, the payout is
$200,000 with one game worth $50,000. Folks arrive as early as 10
a.m. for the start of the 1 p.m. games. ``We're doing quite well,''
said Wanda George Warren, the Catawba Indian Nation's executive
director. (Riddle., AJC freelancer; not for use by NYT clients).

   LABOR _ The labor movement in the Miami Valley and United States
has been on the decline for about two decades. Nearly every major
independent union has seen a drastic decline in membership while
battling with massive private employers like the General Motors
Corp. In fact, some labor experts believe the labor movement is
nothing but a myth. And results from a recent Dayton Daily
News/Springfield News-Sun poll show residents also believe unions
are losing power. Nearly half of the poll's 503 respondents believe
labor unions will become weaker in the Miami Valley over the next
10 years. And nearly 80 percent of the people polled believe
companies will continue to export more jobs during the same period.
The poll shows that people in the Dayton-area are becoming less
sympathetic towards labor unions. We talk with poll respondents,
labor leaders, workers, labor experts and others about the problems
facing unions and what organized labor is doing to reverse its
decline in membership and support. (Wagner, Dayton Daily News).

   GM _ Who got hurt most by the recent United Auto Workers strike
against the General Motors Corp in Flint, Mich.? The automaker and
company endured about the same amount of pain, according to Miami
Valley residents responding to the Dayton Daily News/Springfield
News-Sun labor poll. Surprisingly, more people from union
households believe one of the costliest strikes in U.S. history
hurt the UAW more than the company. The poll results reflect the
opinions of most labor and Wall Street analysts who said neither
side won the 54-day strike labor dispute which idled nearly 200,000
workers and shut down GM's North American production. (Wagner,

at London's World Chicken Festival. Chew on that name a moment: not
the London Chicken Festival or the Kentucky Chicken Festival _ the
World Chicken Festival. Where does a town in a state that produces
a smidgen of the poultry produced in Georgia or Arkansas get off
staging an event with such a preposterously boastful name? The
justification lies in a former resident who made good, a tough old
bird named Harland Sanders. (Auchmutey, Atlanta

after they documented the influence of money in state politics, the

research foreshadowed the national debate over campaign finance
reform. Mackay, 79, is a retired Georgia state legislator and U.S.

   TRAVEL-VIETNAM - Before I visited Vietnam, I took a look at the
Web site of the Vietnamese embassy in Washington. The Vietnamese
must have thought some re-education was called for when the nations
resumed diplomatic ties in 1995, because the first sentence that
popped up on my screen was this: ``Vietnam is a country, not a
war.'' Vietnam is indeed more that the sum of its battles. It is an
ancient country with a distinctive culture and a natural beauty
that runs from mountains to vast river deltas to a serpentine coast
that has more beachfront than California. (Auchmutey, Atlanta

   With the kickoff of the NFL season on Sunday, CoxNet will begin
posting The Journal-Constitution's two weekly NFL pages _ a preview
page and an Inside the NFL page _ every Saturday beginning this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The preview page will feature a standings box and a capsule
preview of the games on Sunday and the Monday night game. It will
be posted by 2 p.m. EDT each Saturday during the regular season and
is for use that Sunday. The format for this year's page will
include the equivalent of one column in ads. The AJC has asked for
the ad stack to be a strip across the bottom of the page each week,
but there is no guarantee that the ad stack will be in that
position or will be the same from week-to-week. If the capsules and
standings box are ready on Friday night, CoxNet will post the page
then without a story. This early posting will allow papers that are
using it to pull it into their systems as early as possible. In
this case, other Cox papers would have the option of waiting for
the story to move on the Sports wire or of filling the text hole
with another story, such as one about a team in their circulation
area.
</P>
<P>
   The Inside the NFL page will look much the same as the AJC's
Inside Baseball and Inside the NBA pages with conference briefs on
the outside rails and league feature stories in the middle four
columns. This page will be posted on the Cox server by 3 p.m. EDT
each Saturday during the regular season and is also for use that
Sunday.

Atlanta at 404 526-5456.

it works out to $12,460 to put a bottom-feeder Nissan Frontier in

CONGRESS SEEKS TO TOUGHEN BANKRUPTCY LAWS AS PERSONAL DEBT MOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As personal bankruptcy filings reach record highs,
Republican leaders in Congress are pressing hard for a law that
would make it tougher for people to file for protection from
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   One in 70 U.S. households filed for bankruptcy last year,
according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit group
that represents more than 6,300 bankruptcy professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of legislation that would make it harder to qualify
for bankruptcy protection say the system is badly abused by some
people who are escaping debt they are able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous need for (tougher bankruptcy laws)
because there are those who really do need protection, and those
who are utilizing the laws improperly and shouldn't be able to get
away with it,'' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   An advertisement that has appeared in Capitol Hill newspapers
over the last few weeks shows the feet of a man and a woman
relaxing on a crystal blue beach with a yacht in the background,
ostensibly after filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcy shouldn't be a free ride for the wealthy,'' says
the advertisement, which was paid for by banking and retail
organizations and housing material providers.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the House and Senate bankruptcy bills say many
people who file for protection are in dire financial straits and
are victimized by risky lending and credit policies.
</P>
<P>
   The typical bankruptcy case doesn't involve someone living high
on the hog, said Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor
who specializes in bankruptcy law. She said the average family
seeking protection from creditors makes less than $23,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a poorer, more deeply in debt group of families going
bankrupt every year,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   In attempt to squeeze those beach bums out of the system, bills
pending in the House and Senate aim at shifting some debtors from
Chapter 7 bankruptcies _ the least cumbersome of two choices for
individuals _ into Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 7, a consumer is able to discharge much unsecured
debt, such as credit card or medical bills, within a few months. To
do so, a debtor must liquidate assets and pay what he or she can to
creditors. Under Chapter 13, a debtor commits to repay at least a
portion of the debt with future earnings over three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements for repaying secured debt, such as loans for a car
or a house, are typically made separately.
</P>
<P>
   The 186-page House bill, sponsored by Rep. George W. Gekas,
R-Pa., was approved by the House 306 to 118 in June. The 123-page
Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, and
Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill, was approved by the Senate Judiciary
panel 16 to 2 in June.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills would prohibit a debtor from filing for Chapter 7 if
the household earned more than the median income _ $51,000 for a
family of four _ and was able to repay at least 20 percent of
unsecured debt.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McGarry, spokesman for the Visa U.S.A. credit card company,
said the current system can allow someone earning $100,000 a year
to file under Chapter 7. He said personal bankruptcy filings cost
the credit card industry $9 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current bankruptcy system is unfair because it allows
people who have an ability to repay a portion of what they owe to
simply walk away,'' McGarry said. ``It's the only social welfare
system not based on need.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Culhane, a professor of consumer bankruptcy law at
Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., who is studying how the
legislation would affect debtors, said many people depend on credit
cards because they have lost a job, been divorced or have a serious
illness and huge medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have no clue how fast interest builds up,''
Culhane said. ```They don't have a real good feel for what interest
rates and late charges can add up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The bills also encourage out-of-court credit counseling.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the Senate bill would empower creditors to
request that a judge decide if a debtor qualifies for Chapter 7,
the House bill would use a computerized formula to determine if a
debtor qualifies. The Clinton administration has denounced the
House bill as ``rigid and arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the two bills would have to be ironed out by
negotiators from both chambers before the legislation could go to
the president for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the
Senate bill, said last week he hoped for a vote on bankruptcy
legislation as early as next week. But opponents are threatening to
block it by attaching several controversial amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP believes that the bankruptcy system should be a
collection system for the credit card industry, funded by the
taxpayers,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who has pledged
to try to sink the legislation by attaching a proposal to raise the
minimum wage, which is opposed by many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley predicted the Senate would ``have to wrestle'' with a
long list of amendments, but added, ``I do expect a bankruptcy bill
will be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin, a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, now says he won't
support it unless it requires credit card companies to spell out
for consumers how interest rates _ which average 14 percent to 18
percent _ can add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid the abuses of bankruptcy and the abuses of
credit card solicitation,'' Durbin said. ``A lot of people are
misled. They don't know the real penalties or interest rates. We're
looking for something like the nutrition labels on food that is
easily understood.''
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.35 million consumer bankruptcies were filed in 1997,
and 361,908 were filed in the second quarter of 1998, the most ever
reported in a three-month period, according to the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warren characterizes the legislation in Congress as ``a billion
dollar gift to the consumer credit industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill was written by credit industry lobbyists to further
increase the profitability of the credit card business, which is
already twice as profitable as any other lending business,'' she
said. ``It falls hardest on vulnerable Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s consumer debt shot up, mirrored by a spike in
bankruptcy filings in the 1990s, according to data from the Federal
Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Warren said
the spike in personal bankruptcy filings was directly linked to
deregulation of consumer interest rates, which enabled banks to
drastically jack up credit card rates in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The wide availability of credit cards and ``risky lending
practices'' by banks have fueled the surge in bankruptcies, said
Samuel Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy
Institute in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdano said there is a danger in expecting that a new law alone
is going to change consumers' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope people use their freedom responsibly,'' he said.
``When they don't, bankruptcy is there as the kind of economic
cleanup of the household balance sheet.''

EARL CAPSIZES BOATS OFF FLORIDA, LASHES SOUTHEAST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Fla. _ Two fishing vessels straggling to port were
caught and capsized during Hurricane Earl's erratic push into the
Florida Panhandle early Thursday, killing one crew member.
</P>
<P>
   With 80 mph winds and heavy rains, Earl left flooded streets and
power outages as it crossed the state. Tornados spawned as it moved
into the Carolinas, where one person was killed and three others
injured near St. Helena Island south of Charleston, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   James Martin, 33, captain of the Me-Too, and two of his crew
clung to the hull of their capsized boat for four hours off Florida
before being rescued by the Coast Guard. Another crew member from
the companion boat Can-Too was rescued from a life raft about 5
a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Can-Too crew member Kalvin Fountain washed ashore
Thursday morning. The boat's captain, Paul Pence, 68, remains
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought 17 to 20-foot waves all day and all night,'' said
Martin, squinting through blood-shot eyes. ``The final one took us
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The crews of the two boats had been fishing since last Friday
and were returning to port with a full load. They expected the
storm to follow a north by northwest path, but were caught when it
veered due north, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm got a jump on us,'' Martin said. ``We couldn't
outrun it.''
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the category two hurricane made landfall between 1
a.m. and 2 a.m., EDT, Thursday, after dumping more than 12 inches
of rain from its leading edge. Panama City and surrounding counties
reported street flooding, spotty road damage and scattered power
outages, but merchants and hoteliers were relieved that the storm
did no major property damage just days before the Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory evacuations were ordered for residents of some of the
barrier islands off the coast, but most residents chose to ride out
what proved to be a mostly inconvenient storm. By contrast, in 1995
Hurricane Erin killed 11 people and Hurricane Opal killed 27
residents along the Florida Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   Earl was downgraded to a tropical storm by mid-morning, as it
continued to churn across Georgia and the Carolinas, dropping heavy
rains.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists were back in coastal waters under sunny skies by noon
Wednesday, but an exhausted Martin was limping on a bandaged leg as
he hoisted himself over the side of a boat returning to the St.
Andrews Marina from another attempt at locating the still-missing
Pence.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two fishing vessels had been coming to shore about
9:30 p.m. Wednesday when the Can-Too capsized just ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were following them in,'' Martin said, ``and it was more or
less a freak sea that hit us. We were running for the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw the life raft deploy on the other boat before his own
boat flipped. Crew member Marcok Blake was later pulled from that
raft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the water rushed in, it stripped my clothing off,''
Martin said. ``That's how much force it had.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his two crew members, Charles Anderson and Justin Powell,
were trapped under their capsized boat but swam free. They clung to
the hull and waited for rescue. Martin said he feared they would
find Pence, co-owner of both boats, underneath the Can-Too once the
boat is righted.
</P>
<P>
   He described Pence as ``one of the best,'' an experienced
fisherman with decades on the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard was called out for another rescue Wednesday
afternoon, when two men in a sailboat were capsized in the heavy
swells and stranded on Shell Island near here.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard had to turn back a 41-foot boat dispatched to
retrieve them due to the high seas. The Coast Guard was attempting
a second rescue when the two men managed to swim nearly a mile to
shore.

   FALWELL-NEW CHURCH-TEX (Lynchburg, Va.) _ The Rev. Jerry
Falwell, who emerged on the national scene in 1980 as founder of

   POLYGAMOUS-AZR (Colorado City, Ariz.) _ It was 4:25 p.m. at
Justin's house and the welcome call ``Come to dinner!'' went out

home the kids came pouring into the cafeteria-sized dining room.
Justin, 45, sat and smiled amid the clang of silverware and plates
as many of his 10 wives and 28 children consumed the contents of
three casserole dishes of enchiladas. Justin is not his real name;
he asked that he and his wives remain anonymous in exchange for
granting a rare glimpse of polygamous life in this fiercely

CONGRESS SEEKS TO TOUGHEN BANKRUPTCY LAWS AS PERSONAL DEBT MOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)   (EDs: Also filed in Washington, ``w,'' category)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As personal bankruptcy filings reach record highs,
Republican leaders in Congress are pressing hard for a law that
would make it tougher for people to file for protection from
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   One in 70 U.S. households filed for bankruptcy last year,
according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit group
that represents more than 6,300 bankruptcy professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of legislation that would make it harder to qualify
for bankruptcy protection say the system is badly abused by some
people who are escaping debt they are able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous need for (tougher bankruptcy laws)
because there are those who really do need protection, and those
who are utilizing the laws improperly and shouldn't be able to get
away with it,'' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   An advertisement that has appeared in Capitol Hill newspapers
over the last few weeks shows the feet of a man and a woman
relaxing on a crystal blue beach with a yacht in the background,
ostensibly after filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcy shouldn't be a free ride for the wealthy,'' says
the advertisement, which was paid for by banking and retail
organizations and housing material providers.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the House and Senate bankruptcy bills say many
people who file for protection are in dire financial straits and
are victimized by risky lending and credit policies.
</P>
<P>
   The typical bankruptcy case doesn't involve someone living high
on the hog, said Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor
who specializes in bankruptcy law. She said the average family
seeking protection from creditors makes less than $23,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a poorer, more deeply in debt group of families going
bankrupt every year,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   In attempt to squeeze those beach bums out of the system, bills
pending in the House and Senate aim at shifting some debtors from
Chapter 7 bankruptcies _ the least cumbersome of two choices for
individuals _ into Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 7, a consumer is able to discharge much unsecured
debt, such as credit card or medical bills, within a few months. To
do so, a debtor must liquidate assets and pay what he or she can to
creditors. Under Chapter 13, a debtor commits to repay at least a
portion of the debt with future earnings over three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements for repaying secured debt, such as loans for a car
or a house, are typically made separately.
</P>
<P>
   The 186-page House bill, sponsored by Rep. George W. Gekas,
R-Pa., was approved by the House 306 to 118 in June. The 123-page
Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, and
Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill, was approved by the Senate Judiciary
panel 16 to 2 in June.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills would prohibit a debtor from filing for Chapter 7 if
the household earned more than the median income _ $51,000 for a
family of four _ and was able to repay at least 20 percent of
unsecured debt.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McGarry, spokesman for the Visa U.S.A. credit card company,
said the current system can allow someone earning $100,000 a year
to file under Chapter 7. He said personal bankruptcy filings cost
the credit card industry $9 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current bankruptcy system is unfair because it allows
people who have an ability to repay a portion of what they owe to
simply walk away,'' McGarry said. ``It's the only social welfare
system not based on need.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Culhane, a professor of consumer bankruptcy law at
Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., who is studying how the
legislation would affect debtors, said many people depend on credit
cards because they have lost a job, been divorced or have a serious
illness and huge medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have no clue how fast interest builds up,''
Culhane said. ```They don't have a real good feel for what interest
rates and late charges can add up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The bills also encourage out-of-court credit counseling.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the Senate bill would empower creditors to
request that a judge decide if a debtor qualifies for Chapter 7,
the House bill would use a computerized formula to determine if a
debtor qualifies. The Clinton administration has denounced the
House bill as ``rigid and arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the two bills would have to be ironed out by
negotiators from both chambers before the legislation could go to
the president for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the
Senate bill, said last week he hoped for a vote on bankruptcy
legislation as early as next week. But opponents are threatening to
block it by attaching several controversial amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP believes that the bankruptcy system should be a
collection system for the credit card industry, funded by the
taxpayers,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who has pledged
to try to sink the legislation by attaching a proposal to raise the
minimum wage, which is opposed by many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley predicted the Senate would ``have to wrestle'' with a
long list of amendments, but added, ``I do expect a bankruptcy bill
will be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin, a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, now says he won't
support it unless it requires credit card companies to spell out
for consumers how interest rates _ which average 14 percent to 18
percent _ can add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid the abuses of bankruptcy and the abuses of
credit card solicitation,'' Durbin said. ``A lot of people are
misled. They don't know the real penalties or interest rates. We're
looking for something like the nutrition labels on food that is
easily understood.''
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.35 million consumer bankruptcies were filed in 1997,
and 361,908 were filed in the second quarter of 1998, the most ever
reported in a three-month period, according to the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts.

</P>
<P>
   Warren characterizes the legislation in Congress as ``a billion
dollar gift to the consumer credit industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill was written by credit industry lobbyists to further
increase the profitability of the credit card business, which is
already twice as profitable as any other lending business,'' she
said. ``It falls hardest on vulnerable Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s consumer debt shot up, mirrored by a spike in
bankruptcy filings in the 1990s, according to data from the Federal
Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Warren said
the spike in personal bankruptcy filings was directly linked to
deregulation of consumer interest rates, which enabled banks to
drastically jack up credit card rates in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The wide availability of credit cards and ``risky lending
practices'' by banks have fueled the surge in bankruptcies, said
Samuel Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy
Institute in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdano said there is a danger in expecting that a new law alone
is going to change consumers' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope people use their freedom responsibly,'' he said.
``When they don't, bankruptcy is there as the kind of economic
cleanup of the household balance sheet.''

`BREAD AND BUTTER': O'NEILL'S FIRST PLAY OF INTEREST ONLY AS
YARDSTICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The good news down on Macdougal Street is that the
Provincetown Playhouse has been thoroughly refurbished and is once
again operating as a theater. It seems all the more fitting that
the first productions in the spiffy and comfortable new space
should be given to the works of Eugene O'Neill, whose early plays
were staged there 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, the Playwrights Theater, which will be a
main tenant of the New York University playhouse, has been
presenting an O'Neill festival that has included a cabaret revue of
songs from his plays; a forum featuring Jose Quintero, the director
who has been one of O'Neill's chief interpreters, and the staging
of a series of his early one-act plays. The festival is now ending
with a production of O'Neill's first full-length play, ``Bread and
Butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kennedy Murphy, the artistic director of the Playwrights
Theater, planned the festival as the kickoff of a project to stage
all 49 of O'Neill's known plays. In a bold if risky step, he chose
a virtually unknown O'Neill work as his first offering.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for staging ``Bread and Butter'' as the festival's
main opening attraction must have seemed compelling. Apart from
being the playwright's first full-length work, it is a play that
had never before been staged.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill wrote it in 1914 while undergoing treatment in a
sanitarium for tuberculosis, and sent it off to a producer. When it
was rejected, O'Neill disowned it and tore up his only copy. But
before destroying it, he submitted it for copyright, and that copy
was discovered only a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, O'Neill knew best. ``Bread and Butter'' is interesting
only as a yardstick by which to measure his growth in later works.
In fact, he used the best parts of ``Bread and Butter'' in a
similar play called ``Before Breakfast'' that was staged by the
Provincetown Players while they were still on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread and Butter'' concerns John Brown, a young man from
Bridgetown, Conn., who wants to be an artist but faces opposition
from most of his family and his fiancee. Only one sister, Bessie,
supports him. After he spends a year in New York studying art, the
family and the fiancee give him an ultimatum to come back to
Bridgetown or else. It all ends badly.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the writing is stilted and quaint, filled with dialogue
that no one ever spoke, even in 1914. It tries hard to be clever
but ends mostly in calling attention to its cleverness. As a
result, the characters are little more than cardboard figures who
speak mostly in platitudes about Art and Mammon.
</P>
<P>
   Although at two hours the play is short by O'Neill standards, it
is often repetitious and filled with beginning writers' mistakes
like having close friends or relatives tell each other things they
obviously know as a way of filling in background information for
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Only toward the end, when the play's focus shifts from the
debate over John's dreams of being an artist to marital discord and
divorce, can one see the sparks of dramatic fireworks that would
light up O'Neill's later work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To be fair, Murphy explains all this to the audience before the
performance as a sort of apologia for O'Neill's early lack of
craft. A note in the press material further points out that since
the playwright never intended ``Bread and Butter'' to be produced,
it is being staged without sets or props and with mostly student
actors wearing modern street dress. Unfortunately, this translates
to the audience's watching an undergraduate rehearsal of an
unfinished play.
</P>
<P>
   Some performances in the cast of 14 show promise, but others are
wincingly inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Kristoffer Polaha, an engaging young actor, is credible as the
young artist, and carries most of the show. Stacie Lents, as his
sister Bessie, and Brent Vimtrup, as his friend Babe, provide good
supporting turns.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who directed, tries to inject some energy into the
production, but bouts of shouting and aimless pacing around the
stage are interspersed with listless scenes punctuated by awkward
pauses by actors (perhaps trying to remember their lines) who don't
know where to put their hands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a worthy project Murphy has undertaken and one wishes him
well for the future. Like O'Neill's writing, it can only get
better.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unusually high humidity and sporadic rains, some with occasional
thunder, marked the weather pattern over Southern California on
Thursday as tropical moisture steadily streamed northward from Baja
California and the Gulf of California. Friday, scattered showers
and thunderstorms will develop over much of the Southwest states as
an upper-level low off the coast of Southern California continues
to summon tropical moisture into the region. With moisture from the
remnants of Hurricane Isis also drawn into the tropical fray,
flooding rains are possible in parts of Southern California,
Arizona and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Caught by high-altitude winds blowing from the southwest, the
remnants of Hurricane Earl will retreat off the Middle Atlantic
coast. Nonetheless, showers and thunderstorms, some heavy, are
possible early Friday in northeast North Carolina and southeast
Virginia before the system heads out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered strong thunderstorms will douse parts of southern
Florida with moderate to heavy rains as strengthening, moist winds
from the east team with a disturbance moving west from the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, puffy cumulus clouds will mix with sunshine over the
Northeast from the Appalachians westward. Isolated showers will
develop over the Longfellow Mountains of Maine. East of the
mountains, isolated showers will move off the Northeast coast early
Friday morning, followed by a mix of sunshine and cumulus clouds.
Over the coast, some early morning cirrus clouds from the remnants
of Hurricane Earl will gradually dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: California Thunder
</P>
<P>
   Just before dawn Thursday, Los Angeles residents were awakened
by peals of thunder echoing across the sky as moist, tropical air
from Hurricane Isis streamed north into the state. Thunderstorms
are a rare event across the Los Angeles basin during the month of
September. On average, thunder is observed at the Los Angeles
airport in only three Septembers out of every 10.
</P>
<P>
   Because thunderstorms prosper in hot, humid conditions, the
chill of the adjacent Pacific Ocean and dryness of nearby deserts
make coastal southern California a poor breeding ground for
thunderstorms.

ART REVIEW: A WRY AMBIGUITY IN A WORLD OF VIBRANT COLOR AND TABLOID
DRAMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Multiculturalism is a complicated phenomenon, both
sweet and bitter. During the last decade, artists and even whole
cultures once excluded from mainstream consideration have gained
admission, however tentative, to the contemporary art market
controlled by the United States and Europe. But the terms of entry
are often capricious and constricting.
</P>
<P>
   One minute the institutional demand is for ``international''
styles based on Western models, the next for work deemed culturally
specific enough to be ``authentic.'' The risk in the first case is
the creation of a kind of global homogeneity; in the second, a new
version of exoticism.
</P>
<P>
   As in any period, the most interesting artists manage to
override conventional options and make rules of their own. Such is
the case with the Colombian painter Beatriz Gonzalez, 59, whose
work is on view at El Museo del Barrio in a 30-year survey,
organized by Carolina Ponce de Leon, that also marks the artist's
New York solo debut.
</P>
<P>
   The very title of the show, ``What an Honor to Be With You at
This Historic Moment,'' catches the tone of Ms. Gonzalez's
figurative painting: wry, mock-formal, hiding reserves of emotion
behind a hard-to-read public face. Ambiguity is everywhere: in
images that mix tabloid dramas with canonical art icons; in a
homely-pretty painting style, and in her own half-defiant,
half-resigned description of her work as ``an underdeveloped
painting for underdeveloped countries.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that her work, with its wealth of topical
references, is intimately bound to a time and place. She grew up in
Colombia in the 1940s and '50s and was shaped by a politically
calamitous era now known simply as ``the Violence.'' In the
country's capital, Bogota, she studied painting and art history,
though the city itself had no collection of European art.
</P>
<P>
   What it did have was a vibrant, multiracial culture and an
avidly sensationalistic popular press. And these elements provided
a source for some of Ms. Gonzalez's earliest works, including the
painting titled ``The Sisga Suicides I'' (1965), which opens the
show.
</P>
<P>
   The smallish picture looks straightforward enough: a half-length
depiction of a young man and woman holding hands and absently
smiling. With its simplified forms and eye-catching colors, it
could be a folk painting: a shop sign, say, sentimentally promoting
the rewards of married life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the image, clipped from a local newspaper, is based on
a photographic portrait that a young couple had had made just
before they committed suicide by drowning. In a farewell letter
they explained that they were deeply in love but, being religiously
devout, preferred death to sullying the woman's purity.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is one of a number from the late 1960s in which Ms.
Gonzalez explored the pervasive violence of Colombian society. In
the same years, she produced an extraordinary series of ink
drawings on the same theme. Some derive from tabloid photos of
crimes of passion and political murders, others from advertisements
for bodybuilding and headache cures. Significantly, in Ms.
Gonzalez's hands, the two types of images are rendered all but
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '60s and into the '70s she continued to work with
mass-media images, a radical move in a Latin American culture that
equated ``high art'' with European academic tradition. Then she
began to turn the tables by loosely adapting classic European
masterworks to local vernacular formats.
</P>
<P>
   Dating from this time are a group of inventive and irreverent
paintings that Ms. Gonzalez either executed on, or attached to,
pieces of mass-produced furniture or household utensils picked up
in Bogota's open-air markets. Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last Supper''
appears in garish colors and paint-by-number forms on a faux-wood
dining table. A Degas bather is painted on the interior of a tin
wash basin.
</P>
<P>
   Form and function merged spectacularly in several mural-scale
works not included in the show. In one, Ms. Gonzalez reconstituted
a panoramic waterlily painting by Monet on 62 feet of plastic
shower curtain. For another, she painted Renoir's paean to
middle-class leisure, ``Le Moulin de la Galette,'' on a long scroll
of paper, which she offered for sale by the centimeter, like cloth
from a bolt.
</P>
<P>
   These examples of ``underdeveloped'' painting were many things:
homages to artists whom Ms. Gonzalez genuinely admires, but also a
witty blend of public service work and historical illustration.
They allowed Ms. Gonzalez, who exhibits regularly in Colombia and
has taught there for years, to import European masterworks into her
country, even if second hand. And they demonstrated the sea change
that any art undergoes when it is translated from one culture to
another: forms, meanings and valuations change.
</P>
<P>
   Although such ideas make perfect sense in the '90s, when Ms.
Gonzalez exhibited these works at the Venice Biennale in 1978, they
went virtually unnoticed. In the '80s, she changed direction in her
art, circling around to where she had started out, as history
painter of her own country. Once again she drew on current events,
but she now phrased them in more complex formal terms _ fragmented,
expressionistic, surreal _ as is evident in two closely related
paintings she produced in response to a civic catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1985, armed guerrillas occupied the Palace of
Justice in Bogota, taking dozens of magistrates hostage. The
guerrilla group, one of many in Colombia, had been active for years
and had gained considerable public support. Whether the incident
would have ended peaceably is impossible to say. The military,
reportedly acting without orders from the Colombian president,
bombed the building, killing guerrillas and civilians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gonzalez's paintings, both titled ``Mr. President, What an
Honor to be With You at This Historic Moment,'' depict the event
through a hallucinatory lens. In one picture, done in bright
colors, the grinning president and his cabinet, flanked by
uniformed soldiers, sit at a table that has a bouquet of blood-red
flowers as a centerpiece. In the second, done in a somber newsprint
grisaille, the seated figures remain, but the flowers have been
replaced by a charred human torso.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As always, Ms. Gonzalez is less intent on assigning blame for
deeds done _ almost impossible in this case _ than in suggesting
that violence itself is an existential condition. And its power
reverberates through all of her subsequent work, including a series
of paintings from the early 1990s _ ``Island of the Good-Luck
Rabbit'' (1993) is an example _ in which male corpses dressed in
suits and ties, float Ophelia-like in dark water. Whether their
deaths were violent or accidental is uncertain, but they have all
found a watery grave.
</P>
<P>
   In the artist's most recent paintings of single female figures,
politics, art history and the personal merge. The figures are
adapted from two sources: Gauguin's exoticized images of Polynesian
women and news photos, taken last year, of the distraught mothers
of kidnapped Colombian soldiers. In two of the paintings, weeping
brown-skinned woman wear skirts decorated with scenes of a tropical
paradise lost. In a third, the artist depicts herself, nude, her
skin a deathlike blue, her hands covering her face as if she were
peering through her fingers at things she could barely stand to
see.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gonzalez has called her painting ``a regional art that can't
be recognized universally except as a curiosity.'' And it does pose
problems. Its determinedly rough, anti-academic painting style _
awkward forms, workaday surfaces _ will not be to all tastes. And
its culturally grounded references can make its play of humor,
despair and affection hard to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her work is dynamic enough to suggest many things and offers
intriguing, if oblique, points of comparison with certain of her
New York contemporaries. Her work has, for instance, parallels with
that of Andy Warhol. Both artists deal with similar popular
material, from tabloid disasters to Last Suppers. Both embody their
images in low-art forms (Warhol in industrial silk screen, Ms.
Gonzalez on inexpensive furniture). Both disguise an art of
passionately alert social observation, behind a facade of studied
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol, of course, was a key player in the international
mainstream market. Ms. Gonzalez is not. She has chosen to forge an
artistic universe from her home turf, and it is one of remarkable
richness and depth. It is no surprise to learn that when a catalog
of her collected work was being prepared in Colombia in 1984, she
insisted the book be titled ``Beatriz Gonzalez: Provincial
Artist.'' Like many of her colleagues across the world in the
multicultural '90s, she has turned a ``peripheral'' status into a
badge of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatriz Gonzalez: What an Honor to Be With You at This
Historic Moment, Works 1965-1997'' remains at El Museo del Barrio,
1230 Fifth Ave., at 104th Street, through Oct. 25.

 &HT;    AFC Central capsules
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Story
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Tom Coughlin is 26-26 in three seasons with the
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 11-5, second in AFC Central (wild card, lost in
first round of playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: RB Natrone Means (FA), C Michael Cheever (injury),
QB Rob Johnson (trade), DE Clyde Simmons (cut), FB Ty Hallock (FA),
C Dave Widell (FA), DT Esera Tuaolo (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: LB Bryce Paup (FA), RB Fred Taylor (D-1a), FS
Donovin Darius (D-1b), DE Fernando Smith (FA), C Quentin Neujahr
(FA), CB Cordell Taylor (D-2).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: In just their fourth season, Jaguars have a
legitimate shot to make it to Super Bowl XXXIII. They are one of
NFL's deepest and most well-rounded teams. Secondary is a concern,
but the Jaguars have plenty of young veterans who might be ready to
step up. QB Mark Brunell is the offensive key, but Coughlin would
prefer to run the football. Offensive line is one of the strongest
in league, and OT Tony Boselli might be NFL's best blocker at his
position. Look for Taylor to make an instant impact splitting time
with veteran RB James Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH STEELERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Bill Cowher is 69-38 in six seasons with the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 11-5, first in AFC Central (lost in AFC
championship game).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: WR Yancey Thigpen (FA), CB Chad Scott (injury), OT
John Jackson (FA), LB Greg Lloyd (cut), FB Tim Lester (injury),
offensive coordinator Chan Gailey (Dallas), SS Myron Bell (FA), OG
Tom Myslinski (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: Offensive coordinator Ray Sherman (Minnesota), CB
DeWayne Washington (FA), OG Alan Faneca (D-1), DT Jeremy Staat
(D-2), WR Hines Ward (D-3).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Sooner or later, free agency departures will result
in some slippage in the division. This could be the year. The
season-ending knee injury to Scott has forced SS Carnell Lake to
move to corner again, disrupting the whole secondary. Much on
offense will depend on continued development of QB Kordell Stewart,
who will have more freedom to audible. There is no proven ``go-to''
wideout, so Sherman wants the ball dumped more to the tight ends
and running backs. Pittsburgh is a veteran team that knows how to
win.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE OILERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Jeff Fisher is 24-30 in four seasons with the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 8-8, third in AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: OG Kevin Donnalley (FA), RB Ronnie Harmon (cut),
KR Mel Gray (retired), TE Rod Lewis (FA), P Reggie Roby (cut).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: WR Yancey Thigpen (FA), WR Kevin Dyson (D-1), TE
Jackie Harris (FA), CB Samari Rolle (D-2), P Craig Hentrich (FA),
CB Dainon Sidney (D-3).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Too bad Nashville hasn't embraced what should be an
entertaining team. GM Floyd Reese upgraded the receiving corps for
QB Steve McNair, signing free agents Thigpen and Harris and
drafting Dyson in the first round. The trio should make life easier
for McNair, in his second season as the starter, and take pressure
off RB Eddie George. The Oilers blitz as much as any defense in the
league and count on their corners in man-to-man coverage. Fisher
and coordinator Greg Williams are creative and cause lots of
headaches for opposition. This is a fringe playoff team that
probably won't make the postseason because of killer division.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI BENGALS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Bruce Coslet is 14-11 in two seasons with the Bengals
and 40-50 in six NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 7-9, fourth in AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: DT Dan Wilkinson (trade), QB Boomer Esiason
(retired), LB Gerald Dixon (FA), DE John Copeland (injury), LB Rico
McDonald (FA), FS Bo Orlando (FA), LB Jerry Olsavsky (cut), LB
Andre Collins (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: QB Neil O'Donnell (FA), LB Takeo Spikes (D-1a), LB
Brian Simmons (D-1b), DE Michael Bankston (FA), DE Clyde Simmons
(FA), CB Thomas Randolph (FA), QB Paul Justin (trade), CB Artrell
Hawkins (D-2).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Even with the change to O'Donnell, the Bengals should
score points. Wideouts Carl Pickens and Darnay Scott can be lethal,
and RB Corey Dillon is an emerging star. A potential problem is
that the demoted Jeff Blake could be a distraction. Complex
zone-blitz scheme should sink in better in defensive coordinator
Dick LeBeau's second season. Linebackers drive the defense, though,
and Cincy has lots of kids there.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE RAVENS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Ted Marchibroda is 10-21-1 in two seasons with the
Ravens and 83-92-1 in 11 NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 6-9-1, fifth in AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: CB Antonio Langham (FA), QB Vinny Testaverde
(cut), RB Earnest Byner (retired), WR Derrick Alexander (FA), RB
Bam Morris (cut), C Quentin Neujahr (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: QB Jim Harbaugh (trade), CB Duane Starks (D-1), RB
Errict Rhett (trade), CB Rod Woodson (FA), WR Pat Johnson (D-2), FB
Roosevelt Potts (FA), OT James Atkins (FA), FS Corey Harris (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Defense has young quality in linebackers and
safeties, but front four is showing some age. Nobody knows how much
Woodson will help the secondary. Pass rush should be effective; LB
Peter Boulware and DE Michael McCrary are quick, upfield-type
players. WR Jermaine Lewis is emerging but might not post
Alexander's numbers. C Wally Williams ended a long holdout, but the
line could be a problem. Rhett hasn't beaten out second-year RB Jay
Graham.

`ELEGANCE, GLAMOUR AND STYLE': NICE DRESS, BETTER PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Exhibition notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Avedon's 1955 photograph of the model Dovima posing
regally between two lively elephants may be overly familiar, but
with its startling contrasts, it is an extraordinary image. It has
less to do with beauty and the beast, and much more to do with
Blakean ``Tiger, tiger, burning bright'' symmetry and the gall of a
fashion photographer to have the mighty animals be a mere backdrop
for a slender woman wearing an expensive evening dress.
</P>
<P>
   But pair this photograph with the actual dress _ as does
``Elegance, Glamour and Style: Fashion and Its Photography,'' at
the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn. _ and what do you get? A close
look at how easily haughty couture can be upstaged by masterly
fashion photographers like Avedon, Baron Adolf de Meyer, George
Hoyningen-Huene, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Horst P. Horst and Lillian
Bassman.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the exhibition's intention to have the prominently
displayed costumes fall short of their photographic counterparts,
but this is what happens time and again. This dichotomy is
especially striking when you consider how some of the photographs
literally take a back seat to the costumes: positioned so far back
on the walls only binoculars could afford a good look.
</P>
<P>
   The Yves Saint Laurent for Christian Dior gown in Avedon's
model-with-elephants picture looks perfect on Dovima, but on the
exhibition mannequin, it has awkward shoulders and a clumsy obilike
trailing sash. Similarly, Augustabernard's evening dress in
Hoyningen-Huene's 1933 portrait is an elegantly fluid
black-and-white affair, nothing like the real thing, which
resembles something fashioned out of maroon velvet curtains and
peach satin.
</P>
<P>
   In Horst's 1948 image of a model in a Nettie Rosenstein black
silk evening dress, the costume is boldly high style, the flyaway
angles at the shoulders and back neatly echoed in a flurry of
butterflies on a background wall, the model's shadow delicately
elongated on the wall in front of her. But the exuberance of the
image is hardly matched by the bronze iridescent taffeta evening
dress sitting sedately on the nearby mannequin. And the smokily
enticing silhouette in Ms. Bassman's 1955 rendering of a Charles
James tunic suit bears little resemblance to the boring wool number
on the exhibition mannequin.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial photography is meant to make the object photographed
more desirable than it often is. But one expects that haute couture
will not suffer by comparison. That it does in this exhibition
attests, most satisfyingly, to the magic of photography.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the show, organized by Nancy Hall-Duncan, Bruce
Museum curator of art, and Caroline Rennolds Milbank, a fashion
historian, gives an excellent, though abbreviated, overview of
fashion photography and, by extension, an idealized view of women
who favor designer clothes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the exhibition's informative wall labels, the
Seeberger Freres _three Parisian brothers, Jules, Louis and Henri,
working in the first decade or so of this century _ were the first
to show society women wearing designer clothing as they went about
their socializing business. Before the Seebergers, models were
generally shown posing indoors, often before a painted backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   A Seeberger Freres image on exhibit predates by a few years
Edward Steichen's Pictorialist picture of women in luminous white
dresses and large hats on steeplechase day in Paris. In the
Seeberger Freres photograph, the dresses of three women at the
races in Paris are exquisitely detailed even as the face of the
woman with her head turned toward the camera is cast in shadow, her
hat a white glowing blur.
</P>
<P>
   During the theatrical 1920s, fashion photography, too, became
theatrical, with models striking stylized poses. The photographer
Sheila Metzner affects a painterly old-fashioned look in her 1984
Fresson photograph of a model in a pleated Fortuny tea gown. But
the fashion photographers of the '20s and '30s produced spare
black-and-white images.
</P>
<P>
   A 1928 de Meyer picture, of Georgia Graves in a Lucien Delong
evening dress, is particularly sublime, with a woman in a slinky
gown and a fur-collared wrap standing beside simple
Japanese-influenced interior furnishings. Sharing the same
elegance-is-all esthetic, Horst toned down a '30s Madeleine Vionnet
sheath _ with its row of rhinestone-set bows down the length of the
gown _ by casting the model in shadow and having her stand to one
side of the picture frame, a pillar of ice taking center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as though he wanted to accentuate a wedding cake of a
Paquin white organdy evening dress festooned with rows of black
lace, Man Ray showed in a 1940 photograph an innocent-looking,
smiling (as opposed to coldly sophisticated) woman in this billowy
confection. Completing the picture is an arty backdrop of
Matisse-like figure drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Equally subversive is a Dahl-Wolfe image of an absurd swimsuit _
a ``balloon suit.'' Countering one absurdity with another, an
elegant model in this Claire McCardell concoction holds an umbrella
and struts her stuff before the brutalist facade of a Frank Lloyd
Wright house.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment in the late '40s, photographic models were loftily
beautiful, with Irving Penn and Cecil Beaton providing two of the
most memorable images. Penn's ``Twelve Most Photographed Models''
salutes remote gorgeousness in haute couture. In Beaton's
photographic illustration of Charles James evening gowns, a bevy of
supremely at ease women in a sumptuous setting of carved wood
paneling, oversized mirrors and a crystal chandelier chat or look
at themselves in the mirror or look at others looking at themselves
in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Any history of fashion photography has to recognize the work of
Paul Schutzer and his 1964 photographs in Life magazine of the
infamous topless bathing suit by Rudi Gernreich. (Schutzer, a
photojournalist, was killed at 36 when an antitank shell hit the
armored vehicle in which he was riding while covering the June 1967
war in the Middle East.) For the Gernreich swimsuit assignment he
took an underwater photograph of a female model in the topless
black swimsuit surrounded by males in black trunks _ the models'
heads obscured by the surface lines of the water. Like Garry
Winogrand's picture of a woman moving gracefully underwater with a
swimming pig, also taken in 1964, Schutzer's image is provocatively
lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   From the late '60s on, fashion photography seems to reflect
funkier, more decadent times and fashions. There is Helmut Newton's
ambiguous picture of a woman with slicked back short hair and
outfitted in a mannish Yves Saint Laurent pinstripe suit, a naked
woman close at hand. There are Steven Meisel's la dolce vita-like
pictures of women in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana garments. And how can a
history of fashion photography exhibit be complete without
Jean-Baptiste Mondino's 1990 portrait of Madonna looking intense
and brassily aggressive in Jean-Paul Gaultier's postmodern gold
corset?

 ROUNDABOUT THEATER NAMES ASSOCIATE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Ellis, the Broadway director, has agreed to take the new
position of associate artistic director of the Roundabout Theater
Company, the theater announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis will assist Todd Haimes, who said he planned to continue
as artistic director of the Roundabout through the coming theater
season and the company's move to its new home in the Selwyn Theater
on West 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes was named artistic director of Livent Inc. on Wednesday,
assuming some duties of Garth Drabinsky, the company's co-founder
and producer of ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, a Livent vice president, were
suspended on Aug. 10 after the company's new management team,
headed by Michael Ovitz and Roy Furman, said they had found
accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who will not work exclusively for the Roundabout, is a
resident director at the theater and has staged several of its
productions.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time Tony Award nominee, Ellis most recently directed
``1776'' at the noncommercial Roundabout; it moved to the Gershwin
Theater for a commercial run and received three 1998 Tony Award
nominations. One was for Ellis as best director of a musical.

CLINTON SEES HOPE FOR PEACE IN ULSTER DESPITE LATEST BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ President Clinton on Thursday solemnly
walked past the scarred, shattered shops along Market Street where
a terrorist car bomb killed 28 people and wounded 220 others last
month.
</P>
<P>
   But as he neared the spot where Market Street changed names to
become High Street, the president and First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton were engulfed by the boisterous shouts and chants of
well-wishers who turned out on a sunny summer day to welcome the
latest pilgrims to pay homage to victims of the Aug. 15 tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see I think is the resilience of the people here,''
said National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger as he
accompanied the Clintons on their hour-long walk through the heart
of this market town of 27,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are beginning obviously to be able to be joyful as well
as sad at the same time,'' Berger observed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton barnstormed Northern Ireland by helicopter on his second
trip to the troubled province since 1995 when he became the first
American president to visit Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, he urged wary members of the newly created 108-seat
Northern Ireland Assembly to resolve their differences when they
convene on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Omagh, Clinton consoled more than 500 people mourning
death or injury within their families as a result of the worst
terrorist attack in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Armagh, Clinton counseled Northern Ireland's
Protestants and Roman Catholics to keep a watchful eye for
follow-on attacks by extremist paramilitary factions.
</P>
<P>
   Extremists' hopes of quelling the quest for peace ``backfired,''
Clinton declared. ``Out of the unimaginably horrible agony of
Omagh, the people said, `It is high time somebody told these people
that we are through with hate, through with war, through with
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered promises as well of America's helping hand as
feuding parties strive to build a prosperous future on the ruins of
communal warfare that has claimed more than 3,400 lives since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ~``We all thank you for standing up in the face of such a
soul-searing loss ... and your determined refusal to let a cowardly
crime rob you of the future you have chosen,'' Clinton told the
families of victims here in this mixed Roman Catholic and
Protestant community located in lush dairy country some 60 miles
west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States would add to the $100 million it
has contributed since 1993 to the International Fund for Ireland;
train members of the new assembly; promote cross-border programs;
seek to bolster foreign trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, Clinton's top adviser on Northern Ireland, said he
initially urged Clinton to pass up Omagh because he feared a visit
would focus attention on the past instead of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I originally was reluctant about coming here,'' Berger said.
``But this is part of the equation and it was very important that
we came here and I'm glad that we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with a 14-year-old girl, Claire Gallagher, who was
blinded in the bombing, and her mother, a radiologist who had been
on duty at a Omagh hospital when her daughter was rushed there for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no word to explain a mindless act of terror that grabs
the life of an innocent,'' Clinton told the families. ``But I think
the only way to truly redeem such a terrible loss is to make the
memories of the innocents monuments to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who along with his wife
Cherie accompanied the Clintons at stops across Northern Ireland,
said the Omagh bombing had united the divided religious communities
``in grief, outrage and greater determination'' to cement the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Clinton encountered a range of emotions. ``Some
were angry; some people were frustrated; some were very determined
to tell him that he had to continue to work on the peace process,''
McCurry said. ``His impression was that many of these families are
at different stages in the grieving process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons presented a plaque to be placed along Market Street
in remembrance of the victims. ``May their memory serve to foster
peace and reconciliation,'' the plaque said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and Blairs also laid a wreath in front of
Watterson's, a clothing store at No. 37 High Street. Two
Watterson's staffers were killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS - STORY MAY END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton's principle achievement was
winning a private commitment from Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble and Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams to hold their
first face-to-face summit next week. Trimble has refused to meet
Adams until Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican
Army, agreed to turn over weapons and explosives as required by the
April 10 ``Good Friday'' peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Adams agreed on Monday to begin ``decommissioning'' the IRA
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   In the window of Omagh's Progressive Building Society, a bank, a
red-inked flyer emblazoned with the word ``murder'' and with two
pictures of a red four-door sedan appealed for help from the public
to track down the bombers. Police suspect a 500-pound car bomb,
possibly carried by that auto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you in Omagh on Saturday 15th August 1998?'' the flyer
implored. ``Did you see this vehicle?''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Real I.R.A.'' _ a breakaway faction of the outlawed
Republican Army _ claimed responsibility for the blast that
occurred 29 years to the day after the initial deployment of
British combat troops to Northern Ireland.

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS SAY CLINTON STILL RAKES IN BIG BUCKS
 &HT;    For release Saturday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic officials say President Clinton's legal
and personal embarrassments haven't harmed his ability to raise
money for his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is still the biggest asset this party has,''
said Steve Grossman, general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. He said the party counts on grossing $18 million for the
November elections at 11 ``Unity '98'' events headlining Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The money is intended to help offset a similar $37 million drive
by the Republican party for money to run TV and radio ads that
could swing close U.S. House races in November.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised more than $2 million at the first two ``Unity
'98'' events, dinners in Washington and Chicago in early August.
Dates have been set, and fund raising is under way for events Sept.
14 in New York, Sept. 17 in Boston and Sept. 26 in Los Angeles. The
remaining six events are expected to be held in October in St.
Louis, Miami and four other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now past our pretty ambitious goal of $3 million for
the New York event, and some of my colleagues in New York think
we'll exceed $3.5 million,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices range from a $1,000 ``hard-money'' donation for
distant seats at a Broadway production of ``The Lion King'' to
$100,000 in ``soft money'' for an opportunity to mix and mingle
with the hosts: the Clintons, the Gores, Senate Democratic Leader
Tom Daschle of South Dakota and House Democratic Leader Dick
Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a choice'' whether or not to appear at such
events, Gephardt, who has described Clinton's behavior as
``reprehensible,'' told the St. Louis Post Dispatch. ``We need to
have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Net receipts from the Unity '98 events are being divided equally
among three national committees _ the DNC, the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three committees are also doing well in our small-dollar,
direct-mail donor receipts,'' said Michael Tucker, communications
director for the senatorial committee. ``Traditional Democratic
donors are sticking with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect them to say that,'' said Mike Russell,
communications director of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee. ``If they're telling the truth, they're going to need
every dime.''
</P>
<P>
   While top Democrats head to New York in mid-September, top
Republicans will be in Washington hosting a private fund-raising
briefing for chief executive officers of Fortune 200 companies in
the Business Roundtable.
</P>
<P>
   The $18 million Democratic drive and the $37 million GOP drive
are crucial for the parties, according to political scientist
Stephen Ansolabehere of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half the money a political party raises (in a two-year
election cycle) comes in the last three months before the
election,'' he said. He found the Democratic claim plausible,
because party loyalists give more ``when they feel their dollars
are going to matter, and this year it's an extremely close contest
in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet brave Democratic talk of how to take over the House by
picking up a dozen seats is starting to fade inside the Beltway.
More Republicans are talking like Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who
has claimed all along that the GOP majority could add another 10 to
40 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a normal mid-term election, the president's party loses
about 25 seats,'' Ansolabehere said. ``If the Democrats are able to
stem the damages from this investigation enough to hold the loss to
10 seats, that's pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Stockmeyer, a veteran GOP strategist who now offers
political guidance to corporations, said, ``I wouldn't see it as an
incongruity if party stalwarts feel more motivated to chip in
during a time of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In broad-based programs like telemarketing and direct mail,
the Democrats are dealing with hard-liners who aren't going to
abandon their president until the noose is over the neck,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But both parties plan to raise the bulk of their money in the
kind of big, unregulated gifts known as ``soft money'' that would
be outlawed under legislation the Senate is expected to vote on
shortly after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   While some of those giant gifts come from loyalists like
Grossman, who has given more than $160,000 to his party in the last
year and a half, many come from favor-seekers more interested in
buying access to policy-makers than in helping a party out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House is so narrowly divided right now, that a lot of
pragmatic givers feel obliged to fuel the fire on both sides,''
Stockmeyer said. ``And even the most pragmatic givers, whose money
goes only where the power is, can't afford to abandon any
president, no matter how crippled he is.''

US WARY OVER FATE OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Deletes reference to nuclear-tipped cruise missiles in
third-from-last paragraph.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV   AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russia in financial meltdown and its political
leaders paralyzed, US and Russian specialists are increasingly
concerned about the threat posed by the country's vast nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has about 7,000 nuclear warheads and several thousand
more nuclear bombs and other devices, though no one seems to agree
on an exact count. The important questions are how many of them are
well-guarded and how many are simply decaying, half-forgotten, in
fenced-in cities.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapidly deteriorating economy where little funding is
available for maintaining secure facilities and the people who work
in them, US officials worry that nuclear weapons and materials
could end up in the hands of terrorists or pariah states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern remains (that) with the economy in trouble,
it is a constant challenge to make sure no one with access to these
materials crosses the line and tries to smuggle or sell it,'' one
senior US official said Wednesday, when Presidents Clinton and
Yeltsin signed two minor nuclear-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deals, on converting 50 tons of Russian weapons-grade
plutonium into material unusable for weapons, addresses concerns
raised by US officials and Russian and American analysts about the
safety of weapons that have been dismantled under arms reduction
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure signed Wednesday would set up a system for the
United States and Russia to share information on launches of
ballistic missiles and space rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Senior US officials say they have significant confidence that
Russia's active nuclear missiles are properly safeguarded. It is
the dozens of nuclear facilities spread throughout the former
Soviet republics that have given the US military its greatest
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the disparate facilities, many of them
storehouses for plutonium and uranium left over from the Cold War,
and the failing Russian economy provide a potentially terrifying
mix. Officials fear that military personnel, many of whom are low
paid or unpaid these days, will smuggle or sell plutonium and
uranium to terrorists, rogue states, or US enemies such as Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in recent years, the United States has mounted operations
to remove significant amounts of weapons grade plutonium from
former Soviet republics where they were at risk of being smuggled,
last year in Kazakhstan and this year in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, US officials and other analysts remain fearful that
former Soviet nuclear scientists, left unemployed and destitute by
the end of the Cold War, may begin selling their knowledge to
developing nuclear states such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those would be the first people I would pay,'' said Stan
Norris, an analyst on nuclear weapons for the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Washington. ``If you don't pay your nuclear
weapon designers and they can't feed their families, then they
might be tempted.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, nuclear physicists in Sarov, the closed research city
that designed much of Russia's atomic arsenal, went on a brief
strike to protest late paychecks. Ivan Gradobitov, head of the
nuclear industry workers union, said even top specialists faced pay
delays of up to five months. Nuclear industry workers plan to hold
another protest next week.
</P>
<P>
   To try to stem the risk, the US Department of Energy has created
at least two programs, though they conceded that the risk still
exists. Energy officials have set up contracts with some 45 nuclear
sites in the former Soviet Union to help upgrade the facilities,
officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials said the pact signed Wednesday that calls for
each country to dissassemble 50 metric tons of weapons grade
plutonium will also ease the anxieties of the US military.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials have established a program that
allows the US government to, in essence, hire former Soviet nuclear
scientists to assure that they remain gainfully employed and not
susceptible to the overtures of a terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the United States slapped sanctions on seven Russian
defense industry companies it suspects of aiding Iran in that
country's quest to build nuclear missiles. The Russian government
says it is investigating the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say Russia has done much to consolidate the vast
nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union, which comprised over 50,000
nuclear devices, and was as late as 1991 spread throughout over 500
sites in the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe. Russia
reportedly has made efforts to remove weapons from unstable parts
of the country, such as the north Caucasus regions near the
separatist republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian nuclear arsenal is greatly reduced and over time
it is atrophying,'' said Robert L. Pfaltzgraff, professor of
international security studies at Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Russia's arsenal could before long be reduced
by decay to fewer than the 3,000 warheads mandated by the 1993
Start-II agreement, which the Russian parliament has yet to ratify.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia remains a country committed to a strong nuclear
deterrent as part of its defense doctrine, especially in the wake
of its conventional military's disastrous failure to defeat poorly
armed militants in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Russia continues to develop new weapons, even as it
dismantles old weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Felgenhauer, defense analyst for the Russian daily
Segodnya, said Russia has already produced 40 new SS-27 missiles,
which have a capability to avoid detection by anti-ballistic
missiles systems.
</P>
<P>
   And as Russia's weapons grow older, many are being
decommissioned, often in ways that pose a threat, if not of falling
into the hands of nuclear terrorists or pariah states, then to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Felgenhauer said that thousands of tactical nuclear weapons have
been ``taken apart and thrown in plutonium pits and factories,
where it's dismantled and lying around.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamara Robinson, a senior research associate at the Monterey
Institute of International Studies in California, said Russia's 73
nuclear-powered submarines, including some 26 that carry ballistic
missiles and 12 with cruise missiles, also pose a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after meeting Clinton at a discussion with other
governors and opposition leaders, Alexander Lebed, the
tough-talking possible presidential candidate, said he had told the
US president to beware a repeat of the Bolshevik revolution in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him today the situation in Russia is catastrophic. The
situation is worse than in 1917,'' Lebed said. ``Now we have huge
stockpiles of poorly guarded nuclear weapons.''

WILLIAMS COLLEGE MUSEUM: A HARD-EDGED ZEAL IN IMAGES OF THE
AVANT-GARDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (Eds.: Exhibition notes are at end of review.)

 By KEN JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ Early modernist graphics are nothing if
not upbeat. Embodying enthusiasm for the social and material
possibilities of the new century in bold, insouciant,
scientifically efficient new forms, they generated moods of almost
utopian euphoria. Why then should the story told by ``Graphic
Design in the Mechanical Age,'' a fascinating show at the Williams
College Museum of Art here, be so depressing?
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was drawn from a vast collection of graphic
material assembled by Merrill Berman, a businessman who lives in
Scarsdale, N.Y. It comprises more than 200 works, including posters
in all the print media as well as original paintings, drawings and
collages by some of the big names in early modernism, like
Alexander Rodchenko, Kurt Schwitters, El Lissitzky, Hannah Hoch and
many lesser-knowns. Along with its indispensable catalog, with
essays by the co-curators, Deborah Rothschild, Darra Goldstein and
Ellen Lupton, the exhibition shows how avant-garde experimentation
in the teens and '20s decisively influenced the development of
mainstream advertising and propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This, in fact, is what one contemplates with some misgivings:
how innovations meant to liberate consciousness were turned into
tools for controlling consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition begins by setting out several fronts of
avant-garde activity distributed across Europe. In Paris before
World War I, the Italian Futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti
produced some of the first aggressively anti-conventional graphic
works, typographically scrambled poems in which, he proclaimed,
``my reformed typesetting allows me to treat words like torpedoes
and hurl them forth at all speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dada artists like Tristan Tzara, Francis Picabia and Man
Ray delighted in flouting all forms of conventional logic in order
to disrupt the established intellectual and moral order that gave
rise to World War I. Their posters for exhibitions or theatrical
events defied norms of typographic regularity, mixing diverse
styles, running lines of text every which way and including
surrealistically absurd phrases and images among pieces of real
information.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin during the 1920s, Hoch, John Heartfield and Raoul
Hausmann developed photomontage into a ferociously acerbic mode of
social commentary for newspapers and magazines, while Russian
Constructivists like Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Lissitzky
worked to mobilize participation in an ongoing social and political
revolution. Combining flat, hard-edged, abstract geometry, punchy
lettering and emblematic images, Constructivist graphic designs
burst with hortatory zeal, whether promoting Communist ideology or
vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, graphic artists were inspired by the radical
abstraction of De Stijl, the movement founded by Mondrian and Theo
van Doesburg. In De Stijl design there is less interest in the
direct incitement of social change than in the achievement of
partly scientific and partly spiritual purity, which, implicitly,
might help to engender a more orderly and rational world.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their differences, these movements share a belief that
art can reorient society to new values through new forms of public
address. These artists knew of their colleagues' work, influenced
one another and often collaborated, crossing over party lines
between, for example, De Stijl and Dada, as in a densely layered
poster from 1923 by van Doesburg and Schwitters in black, white and
red. In this early work, there's an almost explosive feeling of
cross-fertilizing creative ferment.
</P>
<P>
   What followed, however, is less inspiring. The revolutionary
impulses of avant-garde design died out, leaving a set of formal
rules and mechanical techniques that could be adapted to the needs
of any program or client. A movement called the New Typography,
dedicated to precisely this conception, arose at the end of the
1920s. It emerged from a circle of artists that included Schwitters
as well as expert but lesser-known designers like Paul Schuitema
and Piet Zwart, who went into business creating ads for paying
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The New Typography concentrated on the refinement of forms and
reproductive techniques, including photographic processes. Graphic
design became a science of visual communication; it could be
studied at progressive schools like the Bauhaus and could be
practiced as a regular job.
</P>
<P>
   Here one begins to feel let down. Early design integrated
spiritual and moral purposes with commercial or political purposes.
You feel a militant urgency even in the candy wrappers bearing
stark images of factory buildings bordered by red stripes designed
by Rodchenko (who, in any event, was incapable of creating anything
visually unconvincing). Later design, though it continues to be
formally interesting and often exciting, is morally and spiritually
hollow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   You don't worry about this too much when contemplating elegant
designs like that of Vilmos Huszar for ``Miss Blanche Virginia
Cigarettes,'' which features a modern smoking woman abstracted on a
yellow field, or Schuitema's lithograph advertising Dutch ham, a
beautiful composition of primary-colored geometric shapes and
modernist lettering. Pieces like Otis Shepard's 1930s poster for
Wrigley's gum, which calls to mind the Pop-Conceptualist paintings
of Ed Ruscha, or Lester Beall's starkly abstracted 1937 posters for
the Rural Electrification Administration in the United States could
be mistaken for art were they not devoid of any compelling value.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to posters glorifying figures like Mussolini
or Stalin, you may feel serious reservations about the relationship
between form and content. A giant 1933 poster by Vasilii
Nikolayevich Elkin showing Stalin and his henchmen towering over
regimented fields of soldiers, while dirigibles and airplanes ply
the luminous sky and the text announces, ``Long Live the Red
Army,'' is an artistic monstrosity.
</P>
<P>
   As a history of how artists developed forms of communication
suited to the complexities and contradictions of modern society,
this show is immensely informative and suggestive. It can be argued
that this material projects a more vivid sense of modernity, of its
fragmentation, speed and intensity, than does fine art of the same
period. And though some of it looks quaint, the language it speaks
is still very much alive in magazines and billboards or on
television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of a dream shadows that history. An art of cheap
mass communication that could be not only visually arresting but
transformative in the best sense has never been credibly realized.
Artists like Barbara Kruger and Felix Gonzalez-Torres have tried in
recent years, but their audience of art world sophisticates
remained minuscule. Mainstream graphic design sold its soul to the
devils of consumerism and bureaucracy.

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC CRISIS CONFIRMED THE BAD NEWS FOR
INVESTORS

 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than a year after the Asian economies of
Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand were sucked into a
tailspin, Wall Street mostly yawned, shrugged and continued to
spiral upward.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did the collapse of Russia's $360-billion economy --
roughly the economic output of the Netherlands -- finally trigger
the Dow's devastating late summer slide?
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound, but the long and short of it is that the Dow
was overdue for a fall and Russia's woes, serious as they are,
merely confirmed for increasingly skeptical investors that the
world's emerging markets -- abetted by systemic and chronic ills in
Japan -- are undergoing a painful shakeout not likely to resolve
itself soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 20 months, after all, since Federal Reserve Board
chairman Alan Greenspan issued his now famous warning that the
stock market was experiencing ''irrational exuberance.'' That's
central banker talk for: Wall Street's shifted from an investment
pool to a casino, and anyone who throws money at it now is acting
more on faith than on reasoned analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's slide from its mid-July highs has been a reminder
to some that investors are paid for putting their money at risk.
What goes up can indeed come down.
</P>
<P>
   The slide had already begun, cautiously to be sure, weeks before
the Russian ruble collapsed on Aug. 17. In the days that followed,
though, investors became increasingly agitated, not only by the
promise of unpaid Russian debts and economic strife in Moscow, but
also by the threat of social and political chaos in a country that
saw its entire system evaporate less than eight years ago and, for
the past 11 days, has been limping along with a sharply divided
parliament and without a government.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of anarchy in a former superpower that still
maintains the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal tends to set
people's teeth on edge -- considerably more so than the prospect of
default on Russian loans.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Russia's economy become the next domino to fall in the
global financial crisis, however, is disconcerting news to
investors who have predicated much of their risk on the premise of
ever-growing world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors tend to buy stocks on the prospect of good news.
Scanning the emerging markets -- from Asia to Latin America, to
Africa and to the former Soviet States -- many have concluded that
there's more bad news at the moment than good.
</P>
<P>
   The next shoe to drop, moreover, could well be in China, where
export-driven growth is threatened by its neighbors' currency
devaluations. The 800-pound gorilla of the region, China could send
all of Asia tumbling further into the economic basement by
devaluing its own currency, the renminbi, though Beijing has
repeatedly vowed not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling emerging markets out of their torpor is a job for the
engines of the industrialized world. And while the economies of the
United States and Europe are healthy, the sick man, Japan, is very
sick indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Its economy, the second-largest in the world, has been flat for
seven of the past eight years and is now in recession.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed to pull it out are dramatic reforms Japanese
politicians have been ducking for decades that would tip the
balance of power away from producers and toward consumers, thereby
encouraging domestic-led growth.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in Washington, a man named Keizo Obuchi, then Japan's
foreign minister, chuckled when reporters asked him whether Japan
was concerned that the falling yen would spike the annual trade gap
-- more than $50 billion in Japan's favor -- that has caused so
much friction between Tokyo and Washington over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan would simply export its way out of its woes, Obuchi said,
noting wryly that the United States was plenty rich enough to
absorb the added imports that strategy would imply.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the yen has slumped further, and Obuchi is now the
country's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   His recommendations of the last year will doubtless come under
scrutiny Friday night and Saturday, when his finance minister,
Kiichi Miyazawa, meets in San Francisco with Greenspan and U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   If the three most powerful finance officials in the world can't
come to terms with a way out of the global economic crisis, there
could be more dark days ahead for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   As Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa told the Associated
Press on Friday, ''We're all holding our breath.''

FISH OIL SHOWN TO COMBAT MENTAL CONDITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fish oils that are already believed to reduce the risk of heart
disease may also help combat a number of serious psychiatric
diseases as well, including depression, manic-depression, and
schizophrenia, researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At an international conference sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health, scientists said that though the data are
preliminary, a growing body of evidence suggests that higher
consumption of essential fatty acids in the oils, notably one
called omega-3, appears linked to a lower risk of depression and
better treatment outcomes in manic-depression and schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Essential fatty acids must be consumed in the diet or as
supplements because the body cannot make them. A major dietary
source of omega-3 is fatty fish such as mackerel, Atlantic salmon,
bluefish, halibut, herring, and Sockeye salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers shied away from making specific recommendations
for consuming fish or omega-3 supplements. But previous research
already suggests that eating fish two to three times a week is
healthful, says Larry Lindner, executive editor of the Tufts
University Health &AMP; Nutrition Letter.
</P>
<P>
   People seeking to increase their consumption of omega-3 fatty
acids can also eat green leafy vegetables, nuts, flaxseed and
canola oils, which contain fatty acids that the body can make into
two chemicals, called EPA and DHA, that are thought to produce the
health benefits. The researchers said they had no definite answers
on whether DHA, which is found in human breast milk, should be
added to infant formula in America, as it is in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Consuming high quantities of omega-3 supplements, however, can
suppress immune function, conceivably leaving people more
vulnerable to infection. On the other hand, Lindner said, omega-3
supplements seem to help people with arthritis, an auto-immune
disorder. A 3,000-milligram daily dose has been shown to reduce the
symptoms caused by immune system damage to joint tissue. Omega-3
can also reduce the ability of the blood to clot, which means it
could be hazardous in a person with a bleeding disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The new research includes data suggesting that countries where
large quantities of fish are eaten have lower rates of depression
than countries where fish is not a major part of the diet, said Dr.
Joseph R. Hibbeln, chief of the outpatient clinic at the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Major depression, ``the greatest single cause of years of life
lost to disability worldwide,'' is 60 times more prevalent in some
countries than others, Hibbeln said. Fish consumption appears to be
an ``important protective factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindner called the link between fish oils and reduced incidence
of depression ``provocative,'' but said it's ``too early to make a
recommendation that people suffering from a mood disorder should
eat more fish or start taking omega-3 supplements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hibbeln's team found that higher blood levels of two omega-3
fatty acids (EPA and DHA) in both normal people and alcoholics
correlated with higher levels of an important brain chemical,
serotonin. This suggests, he said, that consuming omega-3 fatty
acids may influence production of serotonin. Many scientists
believe that low levels of serotonin are linked to depressive,
suicidal, or violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In one study of 18 suicidal patients, higher blood levels of EPA
were linked to lower scores on tests that predict suicide, Hibbeln
noted. The emerging data, taken as a whole, suggest that EPA and
DHA may reduce depressive and suicidal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew L. Stoll, director of psychopharmacology at Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston, reported what he called ``very
exciting'' results from a study of about 50 patients with
manic-depression, or bipolar disorder, which affects an estimated 2
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the patients were given 10 grams a day of omega-3
(equal to many servings of fish) in a special formulation and the
other half received a placebo made of olive oil. All patients
continued to receive their usual medications as well.
</P>
<P>
   The study was planned to last nine months, said Stoll, but after
four months the rate of relapse in the omega-3 group was
dramatically lower, prompting researchers to stop the study early.
Although it's not totally clear how omega-3 works, Stoll said, it
appears to act like lithium and valproate, two manic-depression
medications that block transmission of neurochemical signals inside
brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there were ``virtually no side effects,'' Stoll
added, the disease is dangerous and patients need to be monitored
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Omega-3 fatty acids also appear to help reduce symptoms of
schizophrenia in people taking standard medications, said Dr.
Malcolm Peet, head of psychiatry at the University of Sheffield in
the United Kingdom. Schizophrenia, which affects 1 percent of the
population, produces delusions, hallucinations, apathy, and
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Peet has found that levels of fatty acids are lower in people
with schizophrenia. In three small studies, he said, giving omega-3
supplements to schizophrenic patients appears to lessen the
severity of symptoms.

 &HT;     BILL'S WORLD 
 &HT;     By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Northern Ireland, says Mr. Clinton, is moving ``from the deep
freeze of despair to the warm sunlight of peace.'' Past the high
wall of cliche.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``It's time for us to now go back to the work of the country,''
says the president, ``and give people their government back.'' Who
wants it back?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``There is no possible justification for terrorism,'' Mr.
Clinton says. So what's his plan? Cancel Halloween?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``The ultimate national security of any country,'' says Mr.
Clinton, ``rests in the strength of its own citizens.'' Right. We
need to be able to say, ``Our citizens can beat up your citizens.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Printing money to pay the bills and bail out the banks does
not help,'' the president says. Especially if you print money with
your own picture on it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``We are living in a smaller and smaller world,'' says Mr.
Clinton. Why, he can hardly take off his pants without folks
everywhere knowing.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It looks like another bumper corn crop this year. Our parents'
folks used to grow corn and were so good at it we called them
Grainpa and Grainma.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The federal government estimates Americans spent $7 billion last
year on marijuana. Was a polling firm hired to toke(CQ) the survey?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Because we're Cubs fans, we favor Sammy Sosa over Mark McGwire

said of his talks with Mr. Clinton. Was the same true of the

 &HT;    
 &HT;    The president says Russians are committed to building a

time making up that kind of a past.
 &HT;

Russia any more,'' Mr. Clinton says. Most of the folks afraid of
Russia are Russian.
 &HT;

Russia.
 &HT;    She figured there, at least, he'd say he's crazy.

 &HT;     THE NEW HEARTTHROB: THE GIRLY MAN 
 &HT;     By DIANE WHITE    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Science may have shed light on the mystery of the current crop
of male movie hearthrobs, who almost to a boy-man look like
somebody's little sister. Recent studies of facial attractiveness
have found that people of boths sexes prefer delicate-featured,
rounder-faced, more feminine-looking men over traditionally
masculine-looking types.
</P>
<P>
   From all reports no one seems exactly sure what this means, or
if it means anything, but perhaps helps explain Leonardo DiCaprio,
Matt Damon, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, et al., each and every one of
them just too adorable for words.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a blessing that William Holden, Clark Gable, John
Wayne, and other craggy screen hunks of yore didn't live to see
their places in the popular imagination usurped by a bunch of
baby-faced post-adolescents. I'm trying to imagine Leo sweeping up
Vivien Leigh and ascending that staircase in ``Gone With the
Wind.'' I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the studies are published in the current issue of
Nature. Strange as it may seem to some, illuminating Leo's appeal
was not the main aim of the cross-cultural research, conducted in
Scotland and Japan. Scientists were investigating what makes a face
attractive to both sexes. They weren't surprised when both male and
female subjects expressed a preference for ``ultra-feminized''
female faces, with high, round cheeks, wide eyes, a small nose, and
full lips. But they were caught off guard by the preference for
male faces with similar feminine features.
</P>
<P>
   They had predicted that both female and male subjects would be
drawn to mature male faces with larger features, heavy brows, and
big jaws. They assumed that such men, bristling as they are with
testosterone, would be impressive to other males and irresistible
to females. But they weren't. One of the Scottish researchers told
a New York Times reporter, ``When it was found early on that there
was a preference for feminized male faces, nobody believed it, so
we did it again, and again. The preference for a feminized face
keeps coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that most recently the research team ``replicated this
work among hunter-gatherer tribes in the Amazon.'' Science marches
on, into the heart of the rain forest, in search of answers. Except
there are no answers. The results of these studies are wide open to
intepretation. According to the Times story, one theory put forward
by the researchers is that women may prefer more feminine-looking
men ``because they give the appearance of being sensitive, honest,
and potentially reliable fathers.'' Because they look like women,
presumably.
</P>
<P>
   For women _ particularly for young women, who buy a lot of movie
tickets _ Leo and his ilk are probably less threatening than macho
types. It's safe to swoon over these sweet-looking guys. They're so
sensitive, so vulnerable, so ... feminine?
</P>
<P>
   But what explains the male preference for feminine-looking
males? Maybe hyper-masculine men are intimidating to ordinary men.
In terms of movie idols, for example, what man can measure up to
the super-macho image of John Wayne? Leonardo DiCaprio is merely
cute, therefore no real threat. That's the fantasy, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory: It may be that all the girls and young women who
are crazy over Leo only want to mother him. The current issue of
Psychology Today has a short piece about Lesley Zebrowitz,
professor of psychology at Brandeis and author of a book, ``Reading
Faces.'' Her research indicates that baby-faced adults bring out
the nurturing instincts in both men and women. I can almost see a
remake of ``Sunset Boulevard,'' with Leo as Joe Gillis and Barbra
(``I am big. It's the pictures that got small.'') Streisand as
Norma Desmond. In this version, she adopts him.

   &UR; BLURRING FACT AND FICTION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;  These are
sad days for fictionalized journalism.
</P>
<P>
   First Janet Cooke, then Patricia Smith, then Stephen Glass and
now Mike Barnicle have lost their jobs for making up stuff and
passing it off as truth.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to me a terrible hypocrisy as newspapers print
fiction all the time (Blondie, the weather report, presidential
denials, etc.) and nobody gets upset, let alone loses his or her
job.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, newspapers need to be running more fiction, not
less, as reality is much too hard to digest over one's morning
coffee. My favorite newspaper is Weekly World News, which prints
nothing but fiction disguised as fact. The Weekly World News is the
media source that I turn to when I want to find out which
congresspeople are under the control of aliens (Newt Gingrich,
Trent Lott and Barney Frank, to name a few), the location of the
latest Elvis sighting (a Blockbuster Video in Columbia, Md.), the
latest, updated date of the End Of The World (Nov. 13, 2003) and
the Bigfoot Diet (apples, romaine lettuce and human brains).
</P>
<P>
   Weekly World News, needless to say, is wildly popular. It has
more readers in a week than The New Republic has in a year. The
paper's writers are not fired for making stuff up. In fact, they
are richly rewarded. (Presumably, if the writers tried to pass off
fact disguised as fiction, they would be fired. After all, that is
the province of the ``mainstream'' press.)
</P>
<P>
   The Weekly World News is also fun to read, whereas mainstream
papers print articles that run the gamut between upsetting and
depressing. (See Monica Lewinsky, Northern Ireland, the NBA, et
al.)
</P>
<P>
   Mob journalism, such as what you see at schoolyard shootings and
presidential sex testimonies, is an ugly sight and plays a large
part in lowering the public esteem of journalists to a station
usually reserved for serial killers and used car salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers, however, want no part of the pack mentality.
They can ``research'' their stories just as capably while lounging
next to the pool or watching television. Fiction writers don't
shove microphones into a murder victim's mother's face and ask her
how she ``feels.'' They don't stand there like ninnies in the
middle of the South Lawn with their toupees flapping in the breeze,
shouting dumb questions at the president while he boards his
helicopter for Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers may not hew to all the ``rules'' of traditional
journalism, but they have a dignity and class that is often missing
from their fact-addicted counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas traditional news reporters tend to be disheveled and
distracted, fiction writers are the picture of calm and
sophistication. While traditional news reporters are chasing after
plane crashes and stained dresses, fiction writers are gazing out
the window in quiet contemplation or perhaps curling up for a
mid-afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers do not need to worry about misquoting people or
misspelling names, because all the quotes and names are made up.
</P>
<P>
   There is little threat of a libel suit either as fictional
people almost never sue.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking down the news is an expensive, time-consuming business
requiring lots of long-distance telephone calls, plane tickets and
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers need only a pad and a pencil, and maybe a
comfortable couch on which to recline during those occasional
lapses in inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Since most people hate journalists and don't believe what they
read in the newspaper anyway, it is doubtful that the public's
faith in journalism will be damaged by replacing fact with fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it will keep a lot of columnists like myself off the
welfare rolls and make breakfast for all of us a lot easier to
digest.

IRVING SEGAL, AT 79; MIT PROFESSOR, PHYSICS THEORIST  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irving Segal, a mathematician whose work had applications in
quantum mechanics and astrophysics, died Sunday, Aug. 30, after
collapsing while walking near his home in Lexington, Mass. He was
79.
</P>
<P>
   An expert on functional and harmonic analysis, Mr. Segal was a
professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   His early work applied algebraic methods to fundamental physics
and the foundations of quantum field theory. In 1947, he introduced
a system of postulates for general quantum mechanics that reworked
a number of key concepts. More recently, he applied his
chronometric theory to astrophysics, leading to a new theory of the
red-shift in light from receding stars and a new model of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT he contributed to the review and upgrading of the
curriculum and was adviser to many graduate students, including
Princeton University professor Edward Nelson, who dedicated his
1983 book, ``Studies in Applied Mathematics,'' to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His encouragement was strong when I was writing a thesis,''
Nelson wrote, ``and equally important was his total lack of
encouragement when I found a result unrelated to anything beyond
itself. His sense of the global nature of mathematical research is
one of the most valuable things that he imparts to his students. ''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Segal was born in New York City. He graduated from Princeton
in 1937 and earned a doctorate in mathematics at Yale University in
1940.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army during World War II, he taught at the
University of Chicago before joining the faculty at MIT in 1960. He
retired in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Martha (Fox); a daughter, Miriam, of
Lexington; and three children from an earlier marriage to Osa
MacLane of Chicago, William of Bethesda, Md., Andrew of Espinola,
N.M., and Karen of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held at MIT later this month.

latest, updated date of the End Of The World (Nov. 13, 2003) and

<P>
   Weekly World News, needless to say, is wildly popular. It has
more readers in a week than The New Republic has in a year. The
paper's writers are not fired for making stuff up. In fact, they
are richly rewarded. (Presumably, if the writers tried to pass off
fact disguised as fiction, they would be fired. After all, that is
the province of the ``mainstream'' press.)
</P>
<P>
   The Weekly World News is also fun to read, whereas mainstream
papers print articles that run the gamut between upsetting and
depressing. (See Monica Lewinsky, Northern Ireland, the NBA, et
al.)
</P>
<P>
   Mob journalism, such as what you see at schoolyard shootings and
presidential sex testimonies, is an ugly sight and plays a large
part in lowering the public esteem of journalists to a station
usually reserved for serial killers and used car salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers, however, want no part of the pack mentality.
They can ``research'' their stories just as capably while lounging
next to the pool or watching television. Fiction writers don't
shove microphones into a murder victim's mother's face and ask her
how she ``feels.'' They don't stand there like ninnies in the
middle of the South Lawn with their toupees flapping in the breeze,
shouting dumb questions at the president while he boards his
helicopter for Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers may not hew to all the ``rules'' of traditional
journalism, but they have a dignity and class that is often missing
from their fact-addicted counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas traditional news reporters tend to be disheveled and
distracted, fiction writers are the picture of calm and
sophistication. While traditional news reporters are chasing after
plane crashes and stained dresses, fiction writers are gazing out
the window in quiet contemplation or perhaps curling up for a
mid-afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers do not need to worry about misquoting people or
misspelling names, because all the quotes and names are made up.
</P>
<P>
   There is little threat of a libel suit either as fictional
people almost never sue.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking down the news is an expensive, time-consuming business
requiring lots of long-distance telephone calls, plane tickets and
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction writers need only a pad and a pencil, and maybe a
comfortable couch on which to recline during those occasional
lapses in inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Since most people hate journalists and don't believe what they
read in the newspaper anyway, it is doubtful that the public's
faith in journalism will be damaged by replacing fact with fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it will keep a lot of columnists like myself off the
welfare rolls and make breakfast for all of us a lot easier to
digest.

GEPHARDT TAKES CONCILIATORY TONE ABOUT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  MERRIMACK, N.H. _ House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, on a
swing through New Hampshire Thursday to bolster support for
Democratic congressional candidates, took a far more conciliatory
tone toward President Clinton than he did last week when he called
the president's conduct with Monica Lewinsky ``reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his original statement was a good statement,''
Gephardt said of Clinton's televised admission that he had had an
improper relationship with the then 22-year-old intern. ``I thought
his statement Thursday was a good statement,'' he said of the
president's mention of seeking forgiveness in response to a
question posed to him after his summit meeting in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been very clear in my view ... He stated them in the
proper manner and he took responsibility for his actions,''
Gephardt said. ``I thought that was courageous. So I think again,
let's get to the issues people want to hear about. People are tired
of hearing about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal was not affecting his party's mission, raising money
and support for Democratic candidates, Gephardt said. Nor did he
believe that it would affect voter turnout in November.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a small crowd of Democratic loyalists at the Red
Caboose, a landmark in the middle of town, Gephardt stressed
education, health care and Social Security _ the issues he said
would help his party regain control of the House of
Representatives. Asked what advice he has been giving Democratic
candidates tempted to distance themselves from Clinton and the sex
scandal, Gephardt counseled patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not jump to conclusions. Let's wait and get the
information when it's available. In the meantime it is extremely
important that we talk about the issues that people care about,''
he said. ``When they sit around the kitchen table, people are
talking about Social Security, education and health care. We need
to deal with those issues in September if we can and then if we
can't, we need to deal with them after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Congress may address, Gephardt said, is reform
of the law governing the actions of indepenent counsels who
investigate official wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having somebody out there for an endless period of
time with an endless budget is the only part of government I know
of that has no check or balance,'' Gephardt said. ``Maybe we ought
to reconsider the way the law works. I am not for getting rid of it
entirely. I think you have got to have some mechanism out there,
but I think we have to limit it more carefully than we have in the
past.''

 &HT;     BILL'S WORLD 
 &HT;     By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Northern Ireland, says Mr. Clinton, is moving ``from the deep
freeze of despair to the warm sunlight of peace.'' Past the high
wall of cliche.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``It's time for us to now go back to the work of the country,''
says the president, ``and give people their government back.'' Who
wants it back?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``There is no possible justification for terrorism,'' Mr.
Clinton says. So what's his plan? Cancel Halloween?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``The ultimate national security of any country,'' says Mr.
Clinton, ``rests in the strength of its own citizens.'' Right. We
need to be able to say, ``Our citizens can beat up your citizens.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Printing money to pay the bills and bail out the banks does
not help,'' the president says. Especially if you print money with
your own picture on it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``We are living in a smaller and smaller world,'' says Mr.
Clinton. Why, he can hardly take off his pants without folks
everywhere knowing.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It looks like another bumper corn crop this year. Our parents'
folks used to grow corn and were so good at it we called them
Grainpa and Grainma.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The federal government estimates Americans spent $7 billion last
year on marijuana. Was a polling firm hired to toke(CQ) the survey?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Because we're Cubs fans, we favor Sammy Sosa over Mark McGwire
in the homer race. But we'd feel more enthusiastic if we were
rooting for Ernie Banks.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The video version of ``Titanic'' now is out. Same story, smaller
ship?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Boris Yeltsin declared his summit with Bill Clinton a success.''
 &HT;    Translation: One president stayed sober, the other celibate.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Russia will get back on its feet,'' Mr. Clinton says. And then
would really go places _ if it could afford shoes.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    We have had intensive, productive negotiations,'' Boris Yeltsin
said of his talks with Mr. Clinton. Was the same true of the
Clintons on vacation?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The president says Russians are committed to building a
brighter, better, stronger future.'' Their historians used to spend
time making up that kind of a past.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I don't think there are many people in America who are afraid of
Russia any more,'' Mr. Clinton says. Most of the folks afraid of
Russia are Russian.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Aunt Ilse from Oelwein was disappointed by Mr. Clinton's trip to
Russia.
 &HT;    She figured there, at least, he'd say he's crazy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Mr. Clinton says he's been quite heartened by the reaction of
the
 &HT;    American people'' to his Lewinsky admission. Enough to have
another affair?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Former first dog Rex, who lived in the Reagan White House, died
recently.
 &HT;    It raises an old question: Did the trickle down'' idea grow out
of efforts to housebreak him?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A new U.N. report suggests world population will continue
growing by 80 million a year well into the next decade. This
suggests a long-term investment in the funeral industry.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It's official: Mark McGwire has broken Hack Wilson's National

 &HT;     THE NEW HEARTTHROB: THE GIRLY MAN 
 &HT;     By DIANE WHITE    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Science may have shed light on the mystery of the current crop
of male movie hearthrobs, who almost to a boy-man look like
somebody's little sister. Recent studies of facial attractiveness
have found that people of boths sexes prefer delicate-featured,
rounder-faced, more feminine-looking men over traditionally
masculine-looking types.
</P>
<P>
   From all reports no one seems exactly sure what this means, or
if it means anything, but perhaps helps explain Leonardo DiCaprio,
Matt Damon, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, et al., each and every one of
them just too adorable for words.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a blessing that William Holden, Clark Gable, John
Wayne, and other craggy screen hunks of yore didn't live to see
their places in the popular imagination usurped by a bunch of
baby-faced post-adolescents. I'm trying to imagine Leo sweeping up
Vivien Leigh and ascending that staircase in ``Gone With the
Wind.'' I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the studies are published in the current issue of
Nature. Strange as it may seem to some, illuminating Leo's appeal
was not the main aim of the cross-cultural research, conducted in
Scotland and Japan. Scientists were investigating what makes a face
attractive to both sexes. They weren't surprised when both male and
female subjects expressed a preference for ``ultra-feminized''
female faces, with high, round cheeks, wide eyes, a small nose, and
full lips. But they were caught off guard by the preference for
male faces with similar feminine features.
</P>
<P>
   They had predicted that both female and male subjects would be
drawn to mature male faces with larger features, heavy brows, and
big jaws. They assumed that such men, bristling as they are with
testosterone, would be impressive to other males and irresistible
to females. But they weren't. One of the Scottish researchers told
a New York Times reporter, ``When it was found early on that there
was a preference for feminized male faces, nobody believed it, so
we did it again, and again. The preference for a feminized face
keeps coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that most recently the research team ``replicated this
work among hunter-gatherer tribes in the Amazon.'' Science marches
on, into the heart of the rain forest, in search of answers. Except
there are no answers. The results of these studies are wide open to
intepretation. According to the Times story, one theory put forward
by the researchers is that women may prefer more feminine-looking
men ``because they give the appearance of being sensitive, honest,
and potentially reliable fathers.'' Because they look like women,
presumably.
</P>
<P>
   For women _ particularly for young women, who buy a lot of movie
tickets _ Leo and his ilk are probably less threatening than macho
types. It's safe to swoon over these sweet-looking guys. They're so
sensitive, so vulnerable, so ... feminine?
</P>
<P>
   But what explains the male preference for feminine-looking
males? Maybe hyper-masculine men are intimidating to ordinary men.
In terms of movie idols, for example, what man can measure up to
the super-macho image of John Wayne? Leonardo DiCaprio is merely
cute, therefore no real threat. That's the fantasy, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory: It may be that all the girls and young women who
are crazy over Leo only want to mother him. The current issue of
Psychology Today has a short piece about Lesley Zebrowitz,
professor of psychology at Brandeis and author of a book, ``Reading
Faces.'' Her research indicates that baby-faced adults bring out
the nurturing instincts in both men and women. I can almost see a
remake of ``Sunset Boulevard,'' with Leo as Joe Gillis and Barbra
(``I am big. It's the pictures that got small.'') Streisand as
Norma Desmond. In this version, she adopts him.
</P>

   &UR; BLURRING FACT AND FICTION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;  These are
sad days for fictionalized journalism.
</P>
<P>
   First Janet Cooke, then Patricia Smith, then Stephen Glass and
now Mike Barnicle have lost their jobs for making up stuff and
passing it off as truth.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to me a terrible hypocrisy as newspapers print
fiction all the time (Blondie, the weather report, presidential
denials, etc.) and nobody gets upset, let alone loses his or her
job.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, newspapers need to be running more fiction, not
less, as reality is much too hard to digest over one's morning
coffee. My favorite newspaper is Weekly World News, which prints
nothing but fiction disguised as fact. The Weekly World News is the
media source that I turn to when I want to find out which
congresspeople are under the control of aliens (Newt Gingrich,
Trent Lott and Barney Frank, to name a few), the location of the
latest Elvis sighting (a Blockbuster Video in Columbia, Md.), the
latest, updated date of the End Of The World (Nov. 13, 2003) and
the Bigfoot Diet (apples, romaine lettuce and human brains).
</P>

GOOD WILL OF CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES IS GOOD BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Back in my school days (well before VCRs, CDs and PCs),
we used to say that the chemicals in the human body were worth 98
cents. I have no idea where the number came from, but it was common
lore.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Morowitz, a biochemist now at George Mason University but
previously at Yale University, took issue with that paltry
appraisal. Using his 1979 biomedical supply catalog, he looked up
the prices of all the body's chemicals and calculated their costs
per pound. They totaled $36,000 a pound. At 168 pounds, Morowitz
figured he was a $6 million-plus man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $6 million man has become a $6 billion man now,'' Morowitz
said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``We now can add in the
cost of determining the DNA sequence and making DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does this have to do with the workplace?
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of the price tag on our bodies when I read a news
item that the Financial Accounting Standards Board has formed a
committee to study the value of intangible assets.
</P>
<P>
   Intangible assets are as important a part of corporate wealth as
are physical assets. Intangibles include the good will of
customers, the reputation of the company and _ in growing
proportion _ intellectual capital.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Brookings Institution study found that hard assets
(land, buildings and equipment) account for only one-third to
one-half of most companies' stock market value. The greater value
is in soft assets such as employee knowledge, customer
satisfaction, manufacturing processes and patents.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``knowledge economy,'' the value of our bodily chemicals
pales in comparison with the value of what we know. That means the
value of employees' thoughts and feelings are more important to the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   A biochemist may be able to figure out the physical value of our
brains, but certainly not their metaphysical worth. All brains are
not created equal, for starters. And how does one price the ability
to compose a sonata compared with a sonnet, or the ability to read
computer code compared with Morse code?
</P>
<P>
   But put aside the question of how to evaluate brainpower. The
more relevant workplace question is whether companies understand
the awesome profit influence held by employees.
</P>
<P>
   Do employers understand they're more likely to maximize profits
by improving skills and fostering positive attitudes among their
work force than by installing a new 800 number or upgrading the
computer system?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. It's easier to measure things than
intangibles. It's easy to see that John is a good worker when he
meets his production quota; it's harder to say what John's
experience, skill and good attitude are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers are beginning to quantify employee attitudes.
Sears, Roebuck and Co., for example, surveyed employees in 800
stores, asking them questions about job satisfaction. The retailer
then looked at each store's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. When employee attitudes improved, store
profit margins went up _ and it doesn't take a biochemist to
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Contented employees are more likely to continue working at the
store. Their experience is more likely to translate into better
customer service. Customers are more likely to enjoy shopping
there. Revenue is apt to rise.
</P>
<P>
   And that's my 98 cents' worth.
</P>

PAY-RAISE REPORT SHOWS ANOTHER YEAR OF 4 PERCENT SALARY INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: A pre-Labor Day headline to think about: ``No
compensation inflation in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how William M. Mercer Inc. introduces its preliminary
salary-increase report for 1999. The subhead emphasizes the point:
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite pressures created by a tightening labor market,
employee compensation costs are not escalating.''
</P>
<P>
   The complete Mercer survey of expected 1999 pay raises won't be
available until later this fall, but all signs point to another
year of standard increases slightly above 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not entirely bad news, though. This year's inflation rate
is expected to be under 2 percent, which means real wages, or what
you keep after inflation, will rise in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Mercer, a human resource management consulting firm,
surveys midsize to large employers nationally. It derives salary
data covering nearly 11 million workers, or about 10 percent of the
private-sector work force.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercer survey dovetails with predictions made earlier this
year by The Conference Board, a business research organization. The
Conference Board estimated that 1999 salary increases would average
4 percent for the fifth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   It's the usual story.
</P>
<P>
   Average raises have hovered slightly above 4 percent since 1994.
Since 1993, the annual inflation rate has danced around 3 percent,
although this year's rate is expected to be about 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board says employees, on average, will have a
real earnings gain of 2.3 percent this year. That's the largest
gain since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers help to squelch employee dissatisfaction with their
raises.
</P>
<P>
   The strong national economy and rising corporate profits might
have led to more sharing of the wealth. And an exceedingly tight
labor market in many job categories should have driven salaries
higher, according to the theory of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, survey results indicate only top executives are getting
raises that are notably larger than the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In a Labor Day missive, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said
unions had staged a comeback in bargaining power this year. He also
said, ``While many union workers have had big wins, too many
working families continue to lose benefits, job security and pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has been a strong critic of the widening gap between
average-worker wages and top executive salaries. The gap has
morale, if not financial, effects on many workers, critics argue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the static wage picture has a lot to do with changing
compensation philosophies in American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country's employers appear resolved to hold the line on
fixed compensation costs,'' said Jeffrey J. Fuller, a principal in
the performance and reward consulting practice in Mercer's Kansas
City office.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said global price competitiveness might be the primary
force. U.S. employers can't or won't increase their prices to
accommodate an increase in base compensation costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend is influencing the stagnant raise pattern:
Employers are moving toward rewarding outstanding performers,
instead of increasing base pay across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of the annual raise as an entitlement are waning,''
Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compensation dollars are being selectively used to fill
positions requiring critical skills,'' said Charles Peck, The
Conference Board's compensation specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, 48 percent of the companies surveyed by Mercer
reported that the number of employees eligible for pay incentives
had increased. According to this year's review, an additional 22
percent of companies surveyed plan to increase their compensation
reward programs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, employers are turning to contract workers or temporary
help to fill needs rather than hiring full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   They also are outsourcing entire departments. In some companies,
there will no longer be an in-house employee benefits department;
that function will be handled by a specialist company that does
similar work for multiple employers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Mercer's early pay-raise predictions are:
</P>
<P>
   - 4.4 percent for top executives
</P>
<P>
   - 4.2 percent for managers
</P>
<P>
   - 4.2 percent for skilled technical and professional workers
</P>
<P>
   - 4.2 percent for non-exempt workers who are eligible for
overtime payments under provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
</P>
<P>
   - 3.9 percent for non-union hourly workers.

HOSPITAL ANNOUNCES $1.1 MILLION GIFT TO FUND RESEARCH CHAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Children's Mercy Hospital took another step
toward building a major medical research program with the
announcement this week of a $1.1 million gift to establish an
endowed chair in immunology.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first of more than $10 million in gifts for research
that the hospital expects to receive over the next few months,
Children's Mercy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The donation Wednesday from former Marion Merrell Dow Chairman
Fred Lyons will create the third endowed research chair at
Children's Mercy. The two others, for a medical research director
and a clinical pharmacologist, were funded by Marion Merrell Dow
(now Hoechst Marion Roussel) and the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The new money ``assures we have the best and brightest,'' said
David Oliver, chairman of the hospital's central governing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our achievements have been significant, research is
still a well-kept secret at the hospital,'' he said. ``We are a
first-class research center.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is giving the money in honor of his wife, Dee, who has
been a volunteer at the hospital for many years. Lyons said he
hoped his gift would encourage other individuals and businesses to
contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a start,'' Lyons said at a luncheon to announce
the gift. ``This gift alone won't be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy began planning about eight years ago to build a
substantial research program. Since then, the hospital has opened
laboratories for research into such areas as genetics, cell biology
and immunology.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the hospital's clinical pharmacology program was
designated by the National Institutes of Health as one of seven
sites nationwide to evaluate new medications for children.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy pharmacology researchers participated in the
development of the first new drug in 25 years to treat tuberculosis
of the lungs. The drug was recently approved for use by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't deliver the best cutting-edge medicine without a
vigorous research program,'' said Ralph Kauffman, the hospital's
medical research director and holder of one of the hospital's
endowed chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said immunology, the study of the body's immune system,
was chosen for funding because it is a crucial field affecting the
way doctors treat infectious diseases, organ transplants, cancer
and auto-immune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The Dee Lyons Endowed Chair in Pediatric Research Immunology
will ``fill an important gap'' in the hospital's research program,
he said. ``I see this bringing an expertise we don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientist chosen to fill the immunology chair will conduct
his or her own research and be available as a resource to other
researchers at the hospital, Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects under way that may benefit from an
immunologist's expertise:
</P>
<P>
   - Research on the molecular and clinical aspects of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   - An investigation into the influence one pituitary hormone has
on the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   - Attempts to modify the immune system to prevent rejection of
transplanted pancreatic islet cells to treat diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   - Research into the molecular basis of unpredictable, rare but
life-threatening drug reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy is seeking a matching grant from the University
of Missouri to endow the immunology chair. The university already
has provided matching funds for the two other endowed chairs.
</P>
<P>
   If the grant is approved, the immunology researcher will hold
joint appointments on the staff of Children's Mercy and the faculty
of the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

AVAILABILITY OF HIDDEN CAMERAS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS, TERRY COLLINS and RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hidden cameras watch you on the job, while
you shop, while you gamble...and maybe while you tan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the walls have ears, but they also have eyes,''
said Stephen Barnhart, owner of Barnhart Security and Alarm
Services in Grandview, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   As technology advances, surveillance cameras that produce
sharper images are becoming less expensive and much smaller _ and
easier to conceal. And business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sales of spy and security equipment grew from $10
billion in 1985 to $40 billion in 1995, according to CCS
International, which makes and sells the devices in the United
States and Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   People spy on their spouse, their babysitters, and even their
children. Businesses catch customers and employees committing
crimes on tape.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Amanda Tull and Buddy Hall were sentenced in the
January kidnapping of a baby from the University of Kansas Medical
Center in Kansas City, Kan. FBI agents said a key to their quick
capture was the release of hospital and discount store videotapes
that allowed the couple to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   But some say hidden cameras invade people's privacy, catching
their most vulnerable moments on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, police in Lenexa, Kan., arrested a tanning salon
owner after finding videotapes of naked salon customers.
</P>
<P>
   If there's something on your desk or wall, chances are you can
buy those items with a camera inside.
</P>
<P>
   Companies advertising on the Internet offer cameras hidden in
picture frames and wall clocks, in pencil sharpeners and lamps, in
sprinkler heads and smoke detectors. They sell pinhole cameras that
can stare through a stray nail hole in a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Suspect your spouse is cheating? Try the clock radio camera.
Don't trust your babysitter? Try the teddy bear camera.
</P>
<P>
   Prices typically start at a couple of hundred dollars. Color
cameras and wireless models cost more.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, residents are starting to buy more
video cameras to protect their homes from vandals, said Garry
McCormack, owner of Alarm Equipment &AMP; Supply of KC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameras are easier to install than burglar alarms,'' he said.
``It just takes some coaxial cable _ there's not much to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most places that rely on surveillance systems, such as casinos,
hotels and shopping centers, won't talk about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very high-tech security. I'm not even allowed back
there,'' said a casino employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about it,'' said a Kansas City International Airport
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give it all away, then you're letting the bad guys in
on your secrets,'' said the owner of a Kansas City security
company.
</P>
<P>
   William Denton, though, was willing to talk. As the security
manager at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, he oversees about 30
cameras throughout the amusement park. Eighteen cameras are visibly
posted near the entrances and exits.
</P>
<P>
   The rest are hidden cameras, some about the size of a
wristwatch, placed in the park's retail shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help cut down on theft,'' Denton said. ``Everything from
using false credit cards to shoplifting. You can't argue with
videotape. What you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   And from a control room with several monitors, Denton can also
watch his employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell all of them they may be watched by surveillance _ they
just don't know where it's at,'' said Denton, who changes the
location of the hidden cameras by himself each week. ``That's the
element of it, not knowing if you're on camera or not.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert said he doubts that hidden cameras prevent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no studies that show that cameras have
deterred robberies at convenience stores,'' said Bill Staples, an
associate professor of sociology at the University of Kansas and
the author of ``The Culture of Surveillance.'' ``They also
indiscriminately tape other things. It might catch someone doing
something embarrassing that could wind up on the news.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasing sophistication of video cameras has been a boon
to one segment of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Voyeurs use cameras hidden in backpacks, shopping bags and
briefcases to catch peeks up women's skirts. Sometimes the images
end up on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voyeurism is going up,'' said David Banisar of Privacy
International, a monitoring group in Washington. ``It's the power
of small, cheap cameras and easy distribution methods through the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain may have the highest concentration of police
cameras trained on streets and other public areas, privacy experts
say. Banisar said a study of British police tapes revealed that 10
percent to 15 percent of the time the cameras were used to zoom in
on women, apparently for voyeuristic purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The police tapes, which are available to the public, provided
fodder for a businessman who culled salacious episodes for his own
hot-selling tape, ``Caught in the Act.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, TV stations have installed cameras on rooftops to
offer viewers footage of sunsets and traffic jams. But some people
have worried that the cameras could be redirected by remote control
to peer into high-rise apartments.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Pollack, who controls nine New York traffic cameras,
told The New York Times, ``Rule of thumb: If you can see the Empire
State Building, we can see you.''
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Orlando, Fla., TV stations removed five highway
traffic cameras they had mounted after a county commissioner saw
one pointed away from the road to an apartment complex. MORE

`THE TRAMWAY END': A SELF-EXILE MOURNS THE IRISH DIASPORA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why, audiences may ask, would anyone want to get
inside the head of a loud international soccer fan hanging around a
German train station? As it turns out, that character, Eoin, an
Irishman a long way from home, does have something worthwhile to
say. But it takes him a long time and a lot of shouting to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Yeates plays Eoin in ``The Tramway End,'' a one-man show
written by the Irish novelist Dermot Bolger, and he starts off at a
disadvantage. Yeates is lighted most of the time in what may be
meant as a re-creation of railway-terminal glare; unfortunately, in
the tiny Chelsea Playhouse, much of the audience is enveloped by
the glare, too. And Yeates is directed, it seems, to spend his
first few minutes onstage absently reading a newspaper and putting
things away in his backpack. This feels like an acting-class
exercise rather than a performance, albeit reasonably well done.
</P>
<P>
   Eoin lives in Germany, and he's feeling a little down because
Ireland has just lost to the Netherlands in the European soccer
championships. At first Eoin just seems to be reflecting on the
noisy fun of soccer games. He recalls, for instance, a crowd's
singing ``If you hate the Queen of England, clap your hands'' (to
the tune of ``If You're Happy and You Know It''). But his thoughts
turn to home, to Limerick Junction, to train stations where the
place names are spelled out in white stones in the flower beds, to
a family who ``had been in Waterford since before the Normans,'' to
a permanence and a belonging to which he has no chance of
returning.
</P>
<P>
   Eoin is here to mourn the Irish diaspora. He left Ireland
decades ago, when ``the construction game collapsed,'' and now he
sees his own children, like other children in the United States and
around the globe, growing up with Irish faces and foreign accents.
And as he speaks he realizes why he's willing to follow a sports
team from his homeland almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing for all those generations written out of
history,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He describes a stadium ringing with the applause of an Irish
crowd: ``I saw 30,000 pairs of hands, moving as one, united by
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   At last Thursday night's performance, the audience for ``The
Tramway End'' seemed to want to join in that reaction. Certain
Irish place names got laughs just by being mentioned, in the same
way a television talk-show audience applauds and hoots when a
famous guest mentions his or her hometown. This message should
inspire far more complex emotion than tht. In this production,
sadly, it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tramway End'' continues at the Chelsea Playhouse
Wednesdays through Sundays through Sept. 20.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ an apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, the cameras that broadcasters have mounted
around the area aren't powerful enough to pry on people in their
homes, a news producer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a position to abuse anything because our cameras
can't do anything except wide shots,'' said Alvie Cater, executive
producer at KSHB-TV 41. ``...I'm not aware of any lens in the city
that will let you zoom in and invade on somebody. That would have
to be a powerful lens.''
</P>
<P>
   As technology races ahead, it's leaving the law behind, said
Banisar, and people are getting away with little punishment for
severe privacy invasion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when a Buffalo, Mo., tanning bed operator was accused
of secretly videotaping his customers, he was charged with child
abuse and endangering the welfare of a child for taping underage
women. Prosecutors at the time could not file serious charges for
taping the adult women, said Jackson County (Mo.) Prosecutor Claire
McCaskill.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Missouri has made it a felony to secretly view,
photograph or film more than one person if the subjects had a
reasonable expectation of privacy. Spying on just one person can
still be prosecuted as an invasion of privacy case, McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   The felony charge can be punished with up to five years in
prison and a $5,000 fine. Repeat offenders face up to seven years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas prosecutors said they use eavesdropping laws in cases
like the Lenexa tanning salon.
</P>
<P>
   Lenexa resident Michael W. Emmons, 32, owner of the Sun Swim USA
salon, has been charged with 13 counts of eavesdropping, a
misdemeanor. If convicted, he could be punished with up to a year
in the county jail and a $2,500 fine for each of the 13 charges.
</P>
<P>
   Many cities have laws against peeping toms, but someone who
``breaks the seal'' on a room _ by drilling a hole or installing a
hidden camera, for instance _ can be charged with eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, an interim legislative committee is scheduled
to hold hearings in Topeka, Kan., on privacy issues, including the
use of hidden cameras in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Several legal experts said that businesses probably cannot hide
cameras in dressing rooms or restrooms unless people are warned
that they may be recorded.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't always the case, however.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, nine security officers sued Johnson County Community
College in Overland Park, Kan., after learning that a hidden camera
had been installed in the officers' locker room. College
administrators said they had received information about possible
thefts and had heard rumors that guns were being brought on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The officers lost their case in federal court. The judge's
reasoning: Because people could freely enter the locker area at any
time, the officers didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCaskill said the law may not even allow an
expectation of privacy for men using public restrooms, because most
are designed with urinals in the open.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison's office files at
least one eavesdropping case a year, but only a few of them have
involved videotaping. In one Johnson County case, a man was charged
for secretly putting a video camera in his roommate's room so he
could record her undressing and sleeping, police said. Police said
another man was charged for hiding a camera to videotape his
family's babysitter using the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Said Morrison: ``People do a lot of weird stuff with cameras.''

THE IMF IS THE `9-1-1' CALL FOR NATIONS IN ECONOMIC TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)   (EDs: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Russian economy melting down and global
markets and economies in crisis, political leaders trying to calm
the tumult are looking to the International Monetary Fund for help.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF _ the ``911'' call for nations in financial disarray _
has been a controversial player in the international efforts to
transform Russia from a lumbering centrally planned economy to an
agile western-style market economy. But despite $25.5 billion in
IMF loan commitments and billions more made by the World Bank and
the government of Japan, Russia's economy remains deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow isn't the only borrower at the IMF loan window these
days. Since the Asian economic crisis began last summer, the
organization has made $36.1 billion in loan commitments to South
Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Though it plays a crucial role in nursing global economic
health, D.C., the IMF is shrouded in secrecy that the organization
assiduously maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some questions and answers about the IMF:
</P>
<P>
   Q) What is the International Monetary Fund?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF opened for business in 1945 after 29 countries signed
a treaty to promote monetary cooperation among nations as a way of
encouraging world trade. The idea was that trade would increase if
it were easier to convert one nation's currency into another.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF was a direct response to the Great Depression of the
1930s when the world economy plummeted in part because nations
placed severe restrictions on the exchange of domestic and foreign
currencies. This made trade practically impossible. In fact,
trading became so cumbersome that some governments resorted to the
barter system, exchanging one cargo for another.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What does the IMF do?
</P>
<P>
   A) One of the IMF's main missions is helping member nations
suffering from payment imbalances, as Russia is now. This problem
crops up when a nation doesn't take in sufficient foreign currency
from exports, tourism and financial services to pay for what it
imports.
</P>
<P>
   When this happens, the country has to borrow money from banks to
make up the difference. If a country borrows too much and fails to
correct the causes of the imbalance, currency speculators such as
banks and international corporations may lose confidence in the
government's ability to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Speculators may sell the nation's currency in an
effort to exchange it for more stable currencies, causing its value
to plunge. In Russia, the ruble declined in value from 16 cents in
June to 9 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the IMF loaned Russia $4.8 billion to restore investor
confidence by bolstering foreign currency reserves and closing a
budget deficit. However, President Boris Yeltsin's administration
apparently used most of the sum to prop up the ruble. This effort
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gone and wasted that money to buy up rubles of banks
that wanted to get rid of them, and the money has ended up out of
the country,'' said Charles Gaddy, a Russian economics expert at
the independent Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   IMF spokesman Vasuki Shastry says: ``Dollar for dollar, there's
no way we can account for what happens to the money when we give it
out to a member country. The money is fungible.''
</P>
<P>
   Q) Where does the IMF get its money?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF has 182 member nations, each of which contributes
funds that are loaned to nations in need. The amount of a nation's
contribution depends on the strength of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the United States, with the world's richest economy, has
contributed the most to the IMF, about $36 billion, or 18.14
percent of the total in the IMF bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall Islands in the Pacific make the smallest
contribution, $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also asks member nations to make new contributions when
its reserves are low. For example, last December the IMF requested
new contributions because of its loans to slumping Asian nations
and Russia. The U.S. share came to $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the United States, other top donors to the IMF are
Germany, Japan, France and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Q) Do IMF members have equal status?
</P>
<P>
   A) No. Member nations have voting power in direct relationship
to the size of their financial contributions. Because it is the
biggest donor, the United States has the most votes and the biggest
clout within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Q) Who runs the IMF?
</P>
<P>
   A) The head of the IMF is Michel Camdessus, a French economist
and banker, who has held the post of managing director since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-member executive board appoints the managing director and
advises on which loans to make. The IMF, based four blocks from the
White House in Washington, has a staff of 2,600 from 110 countries
with offices in Paris, Geneva, Tokyo and the United Nations in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What are typical terms of an IMF loan?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF imposes strict rules on borrowers: They must agree to
repay the money within a specified time and they must agree to
reform those economic policies that created the problem in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   The loans typically are disbursed in installments tied to
progress in making the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms can cause political instability. In Indonesia,
rioting broke out shortly after that nation adopted strict IMF
austerity measures last year. The unrest eventually toppled the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Russia, the Yeltsin administration agreed to cut
government spending, an action that exacerbated the financial woes
of the average Russian because many government workers and
pensioners are not being paid.
</P>
<P>
   To ease financial hardships on the average Russian, the
legislature has suggested softening the austerity measures. Western
governments, meanwhile, are pushing for greater belt-tightening
with a formula of high interest rates, reduced government spending
and more taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What sparked Russia's recent economic crisis?
</P>
<P>
   A) A political dispute over economic reforms between
reform-minded Yeltsin and reform-cautious legislators, coupled with
Russia's partial default on domestic debt, exploded last month in a
sweeping loss of investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the collapse of Russian financial markets, a
steep devaluation of the ruble and a spike in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Q) How is the IMF responding to Russia's problems?
</P>
<P>
   A) In 1995 and 1996, the IMF approved about $14.3 billion in
loans to Russia. The money was supposed to bolster Russia's foreign
reserves, help it ride out a balance of payments problems and
attract foreign investment by building investor confidence,
according to Shastry.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian economy is faltering and the IMF has become
Russia's lifeline. It is ``virtually the only source of major
external funding in sight,'' said Keith Bush, a Russian economics
expert at the non-partisan Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The organization approved $11.2 billion in new loans in July,
$4.8 billion of which the Russian government already exhausted in a
failed effort to support the plummeting ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Russians want to use the next installment of IMF funds, $4.3
billion, to pay workers and pensioners and to pay down the
country's debt. The IMF hasn't yet agreed to release the sum,
pending a review of the country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also has provided Russia with expertise for establishing
institutions and services essential for market-based economies such
as central banks, currency convertibility and tax collection
systems.

A HORSEBACK VIEW OF NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  ((js) 
 By BETH UMLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spice and Poison waited patiently for the light as
cars whizzed through the chaotic traffic circle below Prospect
Park, in Brooklyn. Spice was a smallish mare, but on her back I was
nearly eye-level with the distant ``Don't Walk'' sign. The light
changed and Walker Blankinship, my instructor and owner of
Kensington Stables, moved Poison into the street. Spice lagged
behind and the light changed again before we were across.
Blankinship called over his shoulder, ``Horses have right of way in
New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime city driver, I was not reassured. I wanted Spice
to hustle, but with my first riding lesson just under way, I didn't
know how to tell her. I settled for meaningful eye contact with the
closest driver, and we clip-clopped safely to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1800s, dozens of stables surrounded Prospect Park;
Kensington Stables is the only one that remains. When I first
entered the dimly lighted, crumbling brick barn, I eyed the wooden
bars atop the stalls that were gnawed to half their original
diameter and felt that I'd wandered into a Dickens novel.
</P>
<P>
   But a boom box wired crookedly to the side of a stall was
playing a Haydn concerto, and the horses all looked glossy and
well-fed. Alone with 15 snorting, scuffling, 1,000-pound nonhumans,
I tried to act casual by patting the nose of a chestnut colt with a
white blaze on his face. He turned his head sharply to look at me
and I jumped a foot, just as Blankinship walked in.
</P>
<P>
   Bearded and bespectacled, this 29-year-old Brooklyn native is
not your typical cowboy. After strenuously avoiding sports
throughout childhood, he took up riding in college to learn more
about horses for the medieval role-playing game, ``Dungeons and
Dragons.'' His knowledge is encyclopedic, encompassing both the
practical and the esoteric. He and his family began running the
stable in 1993 when the building was in danger of being sold and
converted to a warehouse, which would have ended horseback riding
in Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   To select the right horse for me, Blankinship asked about my
riding experience. I had very little, even considering that horses
had always loomed large in my imagination. Growing up in the Bronx,
I devoured every horse book in the library and filled notebooks
with horse drawings. At 14 I went on my first trail ride. Plodding
along a narrow path in a pack of riders, I tried to let my horse
know I recognized its nobility and was worthy of its trust. It
responded by stopping every few yards to graze, yanking the reins
out of my hands. The guide kept yelling, ``Jerk his head up,'' an
act of which I was neither spiritually nor physically capable.
Recently, I resumed my quest for a soulful connection with a horse
and decided to improve my chances by taking private lessons.
</P>
<P>
   I was nervous as I stood waiting in the street in front of the
stables. When Spice sauntered down the ramp, I was struck by how
big even a small horse looks when you haven't ridden one in 20
years. I had asked to ride Western-style, so Spice was decked out
in a big old easy chair of a saddle, curved up in the back with a
horn in front I could grab if I had to. English-style riding, which
uses a smaller, flatter saddle, seemed beyond my reach.
</P>
<P>
   In the movies, mounting a horse signals the beginning of a
chase, a battle, a new life. I was determined to show some panache,
or at least not get stuck halfway up. I stood on Spice's left side,
grabbed the horn with my left hand, stuck my left foot in the
stirrup and swung boldly up, making a mental note to wear looser
jeans next time. Success! I stroked the horse's satiny neck,
breathed in her clean, earthy scent, and my nervousness vanished.
Blankinship turned his graceful, high-strung mare down Caton
Street, and Spice obediently followed. In the rarified air eight
feet above the ground, wearing a black velvet riding helmet, I felt
regal.
</P>
<P>
   The stable is only a stone's throw over the traffic circle from
the south entrance of the park. Once inside, we took the dirt
bridle path to the riding ring. Blankinship used the 10-minute ride
to deliver a lecture on horse psychology. Horses evolved to live in
herds, he said authoritatively, and when you ask a horse to move
about the world on its own you create a state of anxiety that can
easily flare into panic. ``Your job as rider is to reassure your
horse that nothing is about to eat it.'' Approaching the ring,
Blankinship had me stand in the stirrups, bent forward at the hips,
to warm up my calf muscles and practice keeping my legs against the
horse's side. As I struggled to keep from pitching forward onto
Spice's neck, he asked, ``Did you see the article in this month's
Equis on Type A horses?'' I admitted I'd missed it. ``It described
Poison to a tee.''
</P>
<P>
   The ring was a lopsided circle of stout posts supporting a
flimsy snow fence. I walked Spice around it (or did she walk me?)
for the rest of the hour, practicing basic communication
techniques. Squeeze the legs to move the horse forward. To turn
left, tighten the left rein and squeeze with your left leg. To
stop, pull back on both reins. But communication occurs on a far
more subtle level as well. Blankinship said a horse ``listens'' to
its rider's whole body. When I had trouble turning Spice, he told
me to look where I wanted to go. I was dubious. Bunched up in a
herd, he said, horses communicate through their skin and muscles.
``When you move even just your eyes, you start a chain of physical
adjustments that the horse picks up through its back.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Spice moved immediately in the direction I looked. I
now understood why some people say horses are dumber than dirt and
others say they're smarter than Robert Redford. Horses may not have
rational intelligence _ a horse will run into a burning barn
because it's felt safe there in the past _ but their ability to
read body language and mood is far more evolved than humans'.
</P>
<P>
   As we approached the traffic circle on the way back to the barn,
Blankinship casually mentioned that if my horse spooked and ran, I
should first breathe ``to communicate calm,'' then lean back and
try to steer it in a circle or into brush to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this happen often?'' I asked, flashing back to the
liability waiver I'd signed just after buckling my helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national average is one incident per 350 riding hours,''
he said. He improves the odds by being selective about the horses
he keeps, by putting customers on the right horses, and by keeping
a low ratio of customers to guides.
</P>
<P>
   For the next couple of days I savored a slight stiffness in my
thighs and the slight scent of Spice on my sweater. I analyzed my
2-year-old's posture on the mechanical horse outside the grocery
store (excellent). While the one-hour lesson could make only the
slightest improvement in my technique, it had provided a compelling
introduction to the intellectual and psychological challenges of
riding. I was both fascinated and a little intimidated by how much
more there was to learn.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   I arrived early for my next lesson and found the stable humming
with horse-lovers. A middle-aged man hanging out by the small
corral across the street introduced himself as one of the
Cobblestone Cowboys, a spirited band of four who board their horses
at Kensington and regularly conduct mounted pub crawls in Brooklyn
neighborhoods. Two pre-teen girls, both volunteers, were
worshipfully grooming a couple of Shetland ponies tethered to a
light pole. Inside the barn, another young volunteer called for
help; one of the horses would not go into his stall. Edwin Acety, a
guide in his late 20s who has worked in the stable since he was 14,
grabbed the horse's head and leaned his wiry, tattooed shoulder
into the animal, trying to muscle him backward. I was stunned at
his fearlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Blankinship introduced me to the rest of the horses, ranging in
size from Midget, one of the Shetlands, to Hanover, the gigantic
ex-carriage horse, reserved for the stable's largest customers. On
a summer Saturday, the 12 ``hack horses'' make an average of three
trips to the park for guided trail rides, usually in groups of two
or three. The typical customer? Anybody and everybody. ``A lot of
couples, sometimes a whole family,'' Blankinship said. ``And
there's a group of three middle-aged women who have been showing up
regularly for years.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, I was ready to try English-style riding, which
Blankinship says is better for a beginner because the smaller
saddle allows more contact and makes communicating with the horse
easier. (I had experienced a tooth-rattling trot riding Western,
and he swore that trotting English-style was far more comfortable.)
</P>
<P>
   This time I rode a big sorrel mare named Katie, a former race
horse. Halfway through the lesson, my clumsy seat and mixed-up
signals began to try her patience, and every now and then she
protested by stopping or grazing. ``Discipline her,'' Blankinship
said sternly, and handed me a riding crop. A light tap on the
haunch was enough to keep her moving. But the crop didn't fit into
my riding fantasy, and I felt guilty knowing that if I were a
better rider it wouldn't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the lesson _ and of my riding career to date _
came when Blankinship announced that it was time to post. One of
the basic elements of horsemanship, posting involves rising up in
the stirrups when the horse rises on the trot, staying up while she
drops, and gently meeting the saddle as she rises again. Done
properly _ leaning forward, hands low, with your lower leg back
behind your knee and touching the horse _ you get a remarkably
bounceless trot. I clicked into the rhythm only a small fraction of
the time. But it's like what people say about golf: hit the ball
cleanly once and you're hooked.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, I requested a ride around Prospect Park. We set
off in a light rain that left the park pristine and empty. The air
was as sweet as it ever gets in New York. The bridle path wound
through parts of the 526-acre park I'd never seen before, at one
point following a rocky stream through dense woods. Blankinship
pointed out dozens of features in the landscape that in his opinion
at least proved the genius of Frederick Law Olmstead and Calvert
Vaux, the park's designers. ``Central Park was only a dry run for
Prospect Park,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As I listened to stories about Revolutionary War battles and
park restoration campaigns, I stopped thinking about my technique;
toward the end of the ride I realized Katie and I were
communicating without conscious effort on my part. When I wanted to
go left, she went left. I could tell when she was thinking about
stopping for a mouthful of grass, and I could tactfully move her
ahead without using the crop. I had a sense of a partnership
beginning. The reality of riding was different from the dream: less
romantic, but far more interesting.

THE MORALITY GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's the everyone-does-it defense and it's not
pretty.
</P>
<P>
   It won't get President Clinton off the hook. His romp with a
young intern and the subsequent attempted coverup is indefensible,
no matter how sinful those who criticize him may also be.
</P>
<P>
   The private lives of the president's pursuers would not be
relevant to his own behavior if the probes of his conduct had
remained within serious legal bounds and relatively free of
partisan coloration.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, however, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
investigation of Clinton's activities has been heavily politicized.
Thus it is fair game to question not only the president's character
and motives but those of other politicians who propose to sit in
judgment upon him.
</P>
<P>
   This two-way street has become increasingly traveled as the fall
campaign approaches. Republicans are shamelessly injecting the
issue of presidential credibility into congressional debates on
unrelated issues, as well as into their campaigns against local
Democratic candidates whose names are not Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Demoralized Democrats can either give up and go under or insist
that the Republicans have no lock on purity. A practical way to do
the latter is to point out those on the GOP side who are eager to
ignore their own sins while they pile on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP message is that the president now lacks the ``moral
authority'' to lead. Okay. But from whence springs the GOP ``moral
authority'' to replace him?
</P>
<P>
   Recently GOP congressional candidates have begun campaigning on
a claim to a higher moral standard than their Democratic opponents
in an effort to smear the president's entire party through guilt by
association. Commercials sponsored by the Republican National
Committee and the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee
project an image of GOP probity, noting slyly that ``honesty does
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, it becomes legitimate, even imperative, for
Democrats to inquire whether the Republicans themselves are the
paragons of virtue they would have us believe or are merely being
hypocritical for political gain. We are reminded of previous bad
behavior on the GOP side, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
cavalier treatment of his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   Integrity is a matter of individual character rather than party
label. Throughout history, bad apples have come from every
ideological pole _ and still do.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee investigating the president's campaign
fund-raising practices, highlighted the issue this week by whining
that he was being picked on. He complained bitterly that the White
House was spreading nasty rumors about virtuous old him.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who called Clinton a ``scumbag'' and vowed to ``get''
him, can obviously dish it out _ but can't take it. This is the man
who had no qualms about privacy rights when he personally made
public tapes of Clinton friend Webster Hubbell talking to his wife
from prison about intimate family matters.
</P>
<P>
   Because a Vanity Fair writer is digging into his past, Burton
called a news conference to confess that he and his wife had been
separated three times during their marriage. Burton charged that
the pending article, sight unseen, was part of a White House
``scorched earth'' policy to discredit good Republicans who dare to
expose Clinton's wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
   This theory of a broad liberal scheme to intimidate Republicans
is the counterpart of First Lady Hillary Clinton's notion that
criticism of her husband is part of a ``vast right-wing
conspiracy.'' Despite a smidgen of truth in both charges, the
existence of some secret, organized plot on either side is
unrealistic, politics being a sloppy business.
</P>
<P>
   And suggesting that the irreverent Vanity Fair is an arm of the
Democratic National Committee doing the president's bidding is
downright silly. The magazine, for instance, recently ran a gushy
one-sided, two-part article slobbering over the noble perfection of
Ronald and Nancy Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's professed outrage that his sex life is being examined
is supposed to make the White House look mean for doing to Burton
exactly what Burton is helping to do to Clinton _ exposing
offensive private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extent to which the White House is pointing
reporters in the direction of GOP critics with unsavory backgrounds
is not clear, it doesn't really matter so long as the information
provided is factual and properly checked out. A president must be
held to a high moral standard, but his accusers cannot be given a
pass to have none of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The public has a right to know just who these people are who may
be asked to take the extreme step of impeaching a president.

FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER REPLACED AFTER HEART ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement was
temporarily replaced Thursday after suffering a heart attack
Wednesday in a routine operation to remove gallstones.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Val-de-Grace military hospital in Paris said his
heart had stopped beating, probably in an allergic reaction to
anesthetics administered for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were able to restart his heart, but Chevenement, 59, has
not regained consciousness. Dr. Yves Cudennec, the hospital's chief
doctor, said Thursday night that the minister was slowly improving
in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin asked Jean-Jack Queyranne, a junior
minister for overseas territories, to replace Chevenement while he
recuperated.
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement, long a member of Jospin's Socialist Party, resigned
from it in 1993 to found a leftist group called the Citizens'
Movement. His strong views and outspoken nationalism often brought
him into conflict with governments he served.
</P>
<P>
   As interior minister, he presided over changes in French
immigration and nationality laws that gave anyone born on French
soil the right to acquire citizenship at the age of 18. He also
reviewed the status of tens of thousands of clandestine immigrants
he asked to register and apply for residence papers. About 140,000
did apply, but Chevenement's ministry decided this year that only
half of them qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously all extremely upset about this accident,''
Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said after Jospin told Cabinet
ministers that Chevenement would not be back as planned next week.

CONFERENCE OF CONGO BELLIGERENTS IS PLANNED

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ No cease-fire in the war in the Congo was
worked out Thursday, but a summit meeting of the warring factions
is to be held soon to discuss one, parties to the conflict said.
</P>
<P>
   News of the planned summit meeting came as a conference of the
113-nation Non-Aligned Movement wound up here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In evening news reports, South African President Nelson Mandela
was reported to have abruptly changed his position on the conflict
and to have joined other African leaders in endorsing military
support for its embattled president, Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   But his spokesman said later that a remark by Mandela during a
morning press conference had been taken out of context and
``exaggerated by the media.'' Mandela is sticking to his position
that the situation in Congo cannot be solved by force, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   It was also reported that the summit meeting of the warring
factions would be held as early as this weekend in Victoria Falls,
Zimbabwe _ but both the president of Zimbabwe and a spokesman for
Mandela said no date or place had been set yet. It was not clear
whether South Africa would be invited, since it has no troops in
the Congo. ``We might go as an observer,'' Mandela's spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to aid Kabila, and
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe said Thursday that they had
prevented the fall of the capital, Kinshasa. ``Our troops found
armored troops _ troops with armored cars, heavy artillery _ within
40 miles of Kinshasa,'' he said in a speech. ``Had we not
intervened, the government of Laurent Kabila, which we had just
legitimized, would have fallen.''

IS YOUR CHILD SICK, OR JUST SICK OF SCHOOL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aching or faking?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the flu or a history test? How do you decide if your child
is sick enough to stay home from school?
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it's obvious. Repeated diarrhea or vomiting
within the last 24 hours, a rash that is blistering or oozing and
sore, or a severe cold with fever of 100 degrees or more _
especially in a younger child who cannot remember to cover his
mouth when he coughs _ should always keep a child home.
</P>
<P>
   A good first step is to ask yourself: ``If my child were
healthy, would I want her to sit next to a child with these
symptoms?'' says Dr. Robert Hoekelman, professor of pediatrics at
the University of Rochester and a contributing editor to the Merck
Manual of Medical Information _ Home Edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When children exhibit overt signs of illness such as
listlessness, vomiting or fever, parents can easily make the
decision to keep them home,'' Hoekelman says. ``However, making
this determination can be trickier when children are on the verge
of illness or have been home sick for several days, and the
symptoms are more ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Children should be without fever, vomiting or diarrhea for at
least 24 hours before returning to school. In the case of an
infection that is being treated with antibiotics, a child usually
can return to school after being treated for 24 hours, Hoekelman
says.
</P>
<P>
   The new home edition of the popular manual defines medical terms
and illnesses in consumer-friendly language. It's available in most
bookstores for $29.95. Specialists in many areas contribute their
expertise. Back-to-school outreach
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Health Care is reaching out to the parents of more
than 11,000 Texas youngsters with an immunization reminder.
Administrators, secretaries and nurses are calling the homes of 12-
and 13-year-olds enrolled in their care plan as part of an
educational campaign against hepatitis B and chickenpox, the newest
vaccine-preventable diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna employees are calling in the evening, on their own time
and sending out follow-up educational materials to increase the
number of area teens who are fully immunized.
</P>
<P>
   As immunization guidelines changed in the early 1990s and new
vaccines were developed, some children were lost in the time warp
and have not received the full set of recommended shots. Breathe
free
</P>
<P>
   It could be a lifesaver for the Tarrant County Hospital
District, but that $20,665,000 anticipated as the first payment
from the state's $17.3 billion tobacco settlement is anything but a
free bonus. Tony Alcini, the district's chief executive officer,
estimates smoking costs taxpayers here $24 million to $30 million a
year in hospital expenses.
</P>
<P>
   True, we have a lot of allergies and smog contributing to lung
problems, but Alcini and company figure the heart disease, chronic
obstructive respiratory disease, lung cancer, emphysema, asthma and
other illnesses linked to tobacco make smoking a costly evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure at least $24 (million) to $30 million of our budget
each year is related to smoking, and that's money we all pay in
taxes,'' Alcini says.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the settlement _ if it overcomes all the legal
roadblocks _ will be used by the public hospital to help finance
the hospital district's respiratory clinic and other services for
people sick from diseases related to smoking.

SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL RECLAIMS SEPTEMBER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire goes for No. 60 Friday night in St. Louis. Goes for
No. 61. Goes for No. 62. They are coming in bunches for the big
boy. He's got his stroke down. Sammy Sosa is right behind him with
56. Their talent and their growing zest for this marvelous chase
are knocking all the other sports into the ``Transactions'' slot.
</P>
<P>
   We are reminded of the collective hold that baseball, and Babe
Ruth, and Roger Maris, have on us. The games drag on incessantly;
the non-leaders dither; but we always know what Nos. 60 and 61 and
62 signify _ power and reflexes, the ball soaring through the
stratosphere, the slugger gaping at his wondrous act, the gabber in
the booth chanting, ``Going, going, gone.''
</P>
<P>
   We know. It is in our collective genes. The home run is still
America's great signature sporting feat.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-Jordanian, pre-Monday-Night-Football days, baseball
was always the National Pastime in the United States. However, in
recent years, the Labor Day weekend has become the gateway to the
fall sports, with lavish time and money reserved for the eccentric
and exotic individuals whacking the fuzzy yellow balls at the
United States Open.
</P>
<P>
   Down South, where fans wear their school colors on their license
plates, people are undoubtedly talking college football, but around
the United States and Canada and surely the Dominican Republic,
Sammy Sosa's country, people are talking baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The professional football season starts this weekend, and that
is a big thing for Giants and Jets fans in New York, and Packers
fans in Green Bay, and Cowboys fans in Texas _ but the Cards and
the Cubs are America's teams right now. This reverses a trend that
was widely but perhaps prematurely described as The Death of
Baseball, personified by clumpy suburban kids imitating Michael
Jordan's moves in their local playground. Michael and the Bulls
became an international fetish, via the television cables that
David Stern had prophesied. Bulls caps in China. The Red Oxen.
</P>
<P>
   More people know Michael and Ronaldo of Brazil and even racing
drivers than the big basher from the Gateway and the slugger from
Wrigleyville. But following this summer of the home run, the red
Cardinals cap and the blue Cubs cap will spread through the world,
the way Yankees caps did in November of 1996 when I spotted them in
the narrow streets of Florence, Dante's city.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, baseball had become a temporary and local
preoccupation, squashed collectively by the wonderful owners and
the terrible players in the dance-to-death labor troubles of
1993-94 that killed a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were delightful in the Northwest in 1995, and the
politically incorrect nicknames from Atlanta and Cleveland were
having their moments, but baseball was sunk in a morass created by
the brutally short-sighted Bud Selig and Donald Fehr.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, baseball lucks out. Amidst grim evidence of a gambling
scandal by members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox, Babe Ruth hit 54
home runs in 1920 _ 25 more than had ever been hit before. In 1921,
he hit 59 more. It was said that Babe Ruth saved baseball by
hitting baseballs over fences.
</P>
<P>
   It would be exaggerating to say that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
(and Junior Griffey and Greg Vaughn) have saved baseball with their
home runs, but the television networks are scrambling to upgrade
their coverage, and the Internet is buzzing with the latest news,
literally pitch by pitch.
</P>
<P>
   What a far cry from the Ruthian days when people stood outside
the Western Union office and followed the World Series via the
ticker. For that matter, Roger Maris' splendid year was closer to
Babe Ruth's time than the age of the proprietary Gates from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer of McGwire and Sosa, an old sportscaster named
Bill Weaver in the Maris home town of Fargo, N.D., recalled, ``Back
then, you didn't have highlights on TV or updates on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver told Dave Dondoneau of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram how
he used to invite Rudy Maris, the father of Roger, to the station
to follow the crucial games via the old-fashioned tickertape.
``We'd just sit there and wait for the updates,'' Weaver said.
``Tick ... tick ... tick ... HR ... tick ... tick ... tick ... NYY
... tick ... tick ... M ... tick ... A ... tick ... it drove us
crazy waiting to see if the next letter would be an N or an R.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are web sites and talk radio and cable stations and
networks and national newspapers, making it easy to talk baseball,
when something wonderful is happening. Friday night, in the shadow
of the Gateway Arch, the big man will flex muscles as big as the
river that flows past. Baseball lives.

THE IMF IS THE `9-1-1' CALL FOR NATIONS IN ECONOMIC TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)   (EDs: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Russian economy melting down and global
markets and economies in crisis, political leaders trying to calm
the tumult are looking to the International Monetary Fund for help.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF _ the ``911'' call for nations in financial disarray _
has been a controversial player in the international efforts to
transform Russia from a lumbering centrally planned economy to an
agile western-style market economy. But despite $25.5 billion in
IMF loan commitments and billions more made by the World Bank and
the government of Japan, Russia's economy remains deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow isn't the only borrower at the IMF loan window these
days. Since the Asian economic crisis began last summer, the
organization has made $36.1 billion in loan commitments to South
Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Though it plays a crucial role in nursing global economic
health, D.C., the IMF is shrouded in secrecy that the organization
assiduously maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some questions and answers about the IMF:
</P>
<P>
   Q) What is the International Monetary Fund?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF opened for business in 1945 after 29 countries signed
a treaty to promote monetary cooperation among nations as a way of
encouraging world trade. The idea was that trade would increase if
it were easier to convert one nation's currency into another.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF was a direct response to the Great Depression of the
1930s when the world economy plummeted in part because nations
placed severe restrictions on the exchange of domestic and foreign
currencies. This made trade practically impossible. In fact,
trading became so cumbersome that some governments resorted to the
barter system, exchanging one cargo for another.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What does the IMF do?
</P>
<P>
   A) One of the IMF's main missions is helping member nations
suffering from payment imbalances, as Russia is now. This problem
crops up when a nation doesn't take in sufficient foreign currency
from exports, tourism and financial services to pay for what it
imports.
</P>
<P>
   When this happens, the country has to borrow money from banks to
make up the difference. If a country borrows too much and fails to
correct the causes of the imbalance, currency speculators such as
banks and international corporations may lose confidence in the
government's ability to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Speculators may sell the nation's currency in an
effort to exchange it for more stable currencies, causing its value
to plunge. In Russia, the ruble declined in value from 16 cents in
June to 9 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the IMF loaned Russia $4.8 billion to restore investor
confidence by bolstering foreign currency reserves and closing a
budget deficit. However, President Boris Yeltsin's administration
apparently used most of the sum to prop up the ruble. This effort
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gone and wasted that money to buy up rubles of banks
that wanted to get rid of them, and the money has ended up out of
the country,'' said Charles Gaddy, a Russian economics expert at
the independent Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   IMF spokesman Vasuki Shastry says: ``Dollar for dollar, there's
no way we can account for what happens to the money when we give it
out to a member country. The money is fungible.''
</P>
<P>
   Q) Where does the IMF get its money?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF has 182 member nations, each of which contributes
funds that are loaned to nations in need. The amount of a nation's
contribution depends on the strength of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the United States, with the world's richest economy, has
contributed the most to the IMF, about $36 billion, or 18.14
percent of the total in the IMF bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall Islands in the Pacific make the smallest
contribution, $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also asks member nations to make new contributions when
its reserves are low. For example, last December the IMF requested
new contributions because of its loans to slumping Asian nations
and Russia. The U.S. share came to $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the United States, other top donors to the IMF are
Germany, Japan, France and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Q) Do IMF members have equal status?
</P>
<P>
   A) No. Member nations have voting power in direct relationship
to the size of their financial contributions. Because it is the
biggest donor, the United States has the most votes and the biggest
clout within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Q) Who runs the IMF?
</P>
<P>
   A) The head of the IMF is Michel Camdessus, a French economist
and banker, who has held the post of managing director since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-member executive board appoints the managing director and
advises on which loans to make. The IMF, based four blocks from the
White House in Washington, has a staff of 2,600 from 110 countries
with offices in Paris, Geneva, Tokyo and the United Nations in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What are typical terms of an IMF loan?
</P>
<P>
   A) The IMF imposes strict rules on borrowers: They must agree to
repay the money within a specified time and they must agree to
reform those economic policies that created the problem in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   The loans typically are disbursed in installments tied to
progress in making the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms can cause political instability. In Indonesia,
rioting broke out shortly after that nation adopted strict IMF
austerity measures last year. The unrest eventually toppled the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Russia, the Yeltsin administration agreed to cut
government spending, an action that exacerbated the financial woes
of the average Russian because many government workers and
pensioners are not being paid.
</P>
<P>
   To ease financial hardships on the average Russian, the
legislature has suggested softening the austerity measures. Western
governments, meanwhile, are pushing for greater belt-tightening
with a formula of high interest rates, reduced government spending
and more taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Q) What sparked Russia's recent economic crisis?
</P>
<P>
   A) A political dispute over economic reforms between
reform-minded Yeltsin and reform-cautious legislators, coupled with
Russia's partial default on domestic debt, exploded last month in a
sweeping loss of investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the collapse of Russian financial markets, a
steep devaluation of the ruble and a spike in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Q) How is the IMF responding to Russia's problems?
</P>
<P>
   A) In 1995 and 1996, the IMF approved about $14.3 billion in
loans to Russia. The money was supposed to bolster Russia's foreign
reserves, help it ride out a balance of payments problems and
attract foreign investment by building investor confidence,
according to Shastry.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian economy is faltering and the IMF has become
Russia's lifeline. It is ``virtually the only source of major
external funding in sight,'' said Keith Bush, a Russian economics
expert at the non-partisan Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The organization approved $11.2 billion in new loans in July,
$4.8 billion of which the Russian government already exhausted in a
failed effort to support the plummeting ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Russians want to use the next installment of IMF funds, $4.3
billion, to pay workers and pensioners and to pay down the
country's debt. The IMF hasn't yet agreed to release the sum,
pending a review of the country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also has provided Russia with expertise for establishing
institutions and services essential for market-based economies such
as central banks, currency convertibility and tax collection
systems.

 &HT;    EVEN WOUNDED, CLINTON STILL PROVIDES BOOST FOR STALLED IRISH
PEACE PROCESS
 &HT;    With IRELAND-CLINTON-0904; IRELAND-PRIMER-0904.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Wounded as his presidency may be,
Bill Clinton's return here has generated fresh momentum for a peace
process that at times has seemed hopelessly stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of the summer had taken its toll on the complex
process started four months ago to bring an end to ``the troubles''
that have gnawed at the heart of this island for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism, which was proclaimed a thing of the past in the
spring, claimed its bloodiest day just last month when 28 people
were killed in a car bomb attack in Omagh. A few weeks earlier,
three young brothers died in their beds when their house in
Ballymoney was firebombed in a sectarian attack.
</P>
<P>
   And as political leaders have struggled to evolve from mortal
enemies to respectful opponents, the process seemed to founder on a
generation of distrust.
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit may have brought the catalyst needed to
produce an important breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, there were clear signs that two key leaders of
opposing sectarian factions may meet -- perhaps even shake hands --
a prospect that three years ago would have been dismissed as
bizarrely optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The once fierce adversaries, unionist David Trimble and
republican, Gerry Adams, are expected to meet meet next week, said
White House spokesman Michael McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and first
minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, has refused to meet
with Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political party long
associated with the Irish Republican Army, or IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Such a meeting would be viewed as clear evidence here that the
peace process has gone beyond the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse was approaching the critical point. Trimble has been
suggesting that he may refuse to take his seat in the assembly,
which is expected to hold its first session in a few weeks, with
Adams until the Sinn Fein leader adequately renounced the use of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Clinton's arrival, Adams issued his strongest
statement to date renouncing the use of force. ``Sinn Fein believes
the violence we have seen must be for us all a thing of the past,
over, done with and gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sinn Fein agreed to participate in an international
commission on disarming paramilitary forces of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble expressed skepticism, saying he still must see concrete
signs that the IRA is prepared to disarm. ``Words alone cannot heal
the mistrust,'' he said. ``People want not just to hear of peace,
they want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nevertheless welcomed the statement. ``Those words were
music to ears all across the world, and they pave the way for the
progress still to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the deep differences that remain, the statements
swirling around Clinton's visit seemed to share an acceptance that
the conflict in Northern Ireland has moved from a violent struggle
to a political one.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the surrender of weapons remains elusive, there is
no credible leader on the island who advocates the use of force.
This is a substantial change since Clinton's last visit.
</P>
<P>
   Much else has changed since the 1995 visit to bring Northern
Ireland to this point. The governments of the Republic of Ireland
and the United Kingdom have joined in unprecedented levels of
cooperation to address the problems of Northern Ireland. In the
wake of the Omagh bombings, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Irish leader Bertie Ahern have worked in tandem to obtain tougher
anti-terrorism measures from their legislatures. Such cooperation
would have been unthinkable even a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the process survived the summer with its
terrorism attacks and conflicts over marches by Protestant groups
through Catholic neighborhoods to commemorate the 300-year-old
victory of Protestant hero King William of Orange.
</P>
<P>
   At times Thursday, it seemed that Clinton was treating the peace
process as a foregone conclusion, even holding it as an example for
other conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   However, he reminded business and political leaders in Belfast
that the peace is fragile and cautioned that it would be tested in
the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terror in Omagh was not the last bomb of the Troubles; it
was the opening shot of a vicious attack on the peace,'' he said.
``The question is not whether there will be more bombs and more
attempts to undo with violence the verdict of the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``There well may be,'' he said. ``The question is how will you
react to it all -- to the violence? How will you deal with your
differences? Can the bad habits and brute forces of yesterday break
your will for tomorrow's peace?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's comments often had the ring of someone taking
his leave, and, indeed, Clinton is not expected to return as
president to Ireland -- the site of what is perhaps one of his
greatest foreign policy triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   The president's troubles over his admitted relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, while rarely mentioned
directly, nevertheless is always with him. Hillary Rodham Clinton
has been greeted warmly, usually with standing ovations. She gives
no hint of any problems in her marriage, and the president has
mentioned her frequently in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the criticism directed toward Clinton on the streets
here has more to do with U.S. attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan
following the embassy bombings in East Africa. Demonstrators
outside Waterfront Hall held up signs comparing the U.S. cruise
missile attacks to the Omagh bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clinton remains popular here. He is highly
regarded not because he is an Irish-American -- the 14th American
president to hold that distinction -- but because he is considered
unusually adept at maneuvering through the complex political and
cultural forces that play upon the peace process here.
</P>
<P>
   Blair expressed this perception in his introduction: ``Above
all, your grasp, not just of the complexity of the issues, but of
the subtlety of the competing claims for justice, has meant that
your commitment to help was actually matched by your capacity to
help.''

RETAILERS CITE GOOD SALES FOR AUGUST; ANALYSTS FRET ABOUT REST OF
YEAR

<P>
   U.S. retailers reported relatively strong sales for August on
Thursday, but analysts warned that continued unease in the stock
market and in the global economy could slow down retail sales for
the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously premature to make a call,'' said Jeffrey
Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers. ``But certainly the
volatility in the market and in the economic outlook is likely to
cause some slowing in consumer spending. Some companies have been
talking about gradually scaling back orders for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers enjoyed strong sales increases over the summer, and
August was no exception. Same-store sales, or sales in stores open
at least a year, rose 3.5 percent in August compared with the month
a year earlier, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite
index.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way were discount stores, which have enjoyed two
years of exceptional sales. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a 7.6
percent gain, while Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., said
sales rose 4.9 percent. Sales at Dollar General rose 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Off-price apparel retailers, which have also been strong
performers for several quarters, saw sales slow a bit last month,
perhaps because they had lofty numbers with which to compare. Ross
Stores, for example, said sales rose only 2 percent, while Value
City saw sales fall 1.8 percent. TJX Co. reported a sales gain of 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among all retailers, department stores continued to be the real
laggards. Sales at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. fell 0.7 percent, and sales
at Federated Department Stores Inc. fell 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   May Department Stores Co. said sales dropped 0.7 percent in
August, and Dillard Department Stores reported a 1 percent
decrease. Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General Inc., said
sales fell 1.7 percent. Only Saks Fifth Avenue reported a
respectable sales increase _ 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Department stores have been weak all year,'' said Richard
Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``They are losing
share to specialty apparel retailers, who are executing better this
year than last year. And then you've got the discount department
stores moving their offerings more upscale, like Target, which is
siphoning off business as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among specialty apparel merchants, Ann Taylor Stores
said sales rose 15.5 percent, and The Gap Inc.'s sales rose 9
percent. The Limited Inc.'s sales blossomed 7 percent, thanks in
large part to improvements at its Express and Limited women's
chains.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers may also have given some of August's sales to
September because of the late Labor Day. ``There was some pretty
strong evidence that business in the Northwest and Southeast, where
back-to-school is earlier, was better for the month than in the
Northeast,'' Baum said. ``So we don't yet have the full picture of
back to school. We think September will be a strong month, and
we'll have to look at the two together.''

CARIBBEAN TIGER: NATURAL GAS FUELS TRINIDAD'S ECONOMIC BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphics are being sent to NYT graphic clients.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago _ The flights coming in from
the United States are so packed with oil and chemical company
executives hungry for a piece of the action here that reservations
are hard to come by. Almost weekly, it seems, the government is
announcing some natural gas find or new factory project at the
booming Point Lisas Industrial Estate.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the rest of the Caribbean worries about making
ends meet, this twin-island nation _ almost evenly divided between
citizens who trace their ancestry to Africa and India _ is
experiencing a burst of investment and growth. Thanks to the
belated realization that its substantial natural gas reserves may
prove to be even more valuable than its oil, Trinidad is rapidly
emerging as the region's foremost economic success story.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the boom less than five years ago, the 50
U.S. companies now operating here have invested more than $4
billion, a remarkable figure in a country with only 1.3 million
people. Seeking to take advantage of cheap and abundant energy
supplies, petroleum, chemical and steel companies from Britain,
Canada, Germany, India, Norway and Spain are also flocking here.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, ``this country is becoming industrialized'' and
turning into a Caribbean tiger, said Krishna Persad, a leading
Trinidadian oil and gas industry consultant. ``If only 50 percent
of what is being talked about actually comes to pass, you're going
to be seeing a Singapore in the Western Hemisphere,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But as Trinidad government officials acknowledge, they must also
resist the temptation to spend too much too soon and risk
overheating the economy. Administering a bonanza, while more
pleasant than coping with scarcity, offers hazards of its own. For
confirmation of that, Trinidad need only look at its own recent
past, or neighboring Venezuela, where billions of dollars in oil
profits are said to have been squandered or pilfered.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, ``This country is booming, going
gangbusters, and the boom is nowhere near peaking,'' a diplomat
here exulted. ``With all the recent finds and the plants coming on
line, you're going to see a substantial level of activity for the
next several years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1997, Trinidad's economy grew by 4 percent, compared with a
1.5 percent contraction in 1993; over the same period, inflation
has dropped to 3.8 percent from 13 percent. Income per capita has
risen to $4,290 from $3,920. The figures are in 1990 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the boom are Trinidad's proven natural gas reserves of
more than 21 trillion cubic feet, up from 8.9 trillion just five
years ago. David Wight, president of Amoco Energy Co. of Trinidad
and Tobago, the local subsidiary of the U.S. oil and gas giant,
said that figure was likely to double yet again, while Persad
predicted reserves could eventually reach 75 trillion cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the numbers turn out to be, they are big, comparable
to anywhere in the world,'' Wight said. ``Trinidad has already
become a very big and active player, both in terms of natural gas
resources and the downstream side, offering development
opportunities here in-country and also significant export
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural gas discoveries have coincided with a downturn in
oil production as Trinidad's proven crude reserves dwindle. Output
has dropped from a peak of 225,000 barrels a day in the late 1970s,
when oil accounted for 80 percent of the country's export income,
to 130,000 barrels; at current rates of production, existing
reserves will be exhausted in little more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But with oil prices in decline and now ``at their lowest level
in a dozen years,'' explained Finbar Gangar, minister of energy and
energy industries, ``we have consciously diversified our economy
away from oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic strategy of Prime Minister Basdeo Panday's government,
which took power late in 1995, has been ``to widen and deepen our
industrialization thrust,'' Gangar said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, this Delaware-sized nation at the extreme
southeastern tip of the Caribbean, just seven miles off the coast
of Venezuela, is already the second-largest exporter of ammonia and
methanol in the world. By the end of 1999, when the last of five
plants built here during the last five years comes on stream, it is
expected to become the largest exporter of both those key
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stand back and look at the broad picture, you can
identify four major industrial thrusts,'' Persad said. ``Gas is
being used as raw material for petrochemicals, as fuel for steel
plants, as fuel for aluminum projects, and is being liquefied and
exported.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the methanol and ammonia complexes, plants that
will produce urea, ethylene, fertilizers and other industrial
chemicals are completed or under construction, many of them at the
Point Lisas Industrial Estate on the coast south of here. The
Indian steel company Ispat already has one plant here and has
committed to another, government officials said. Negotiations are
under way with Brazilian interests to refine iron ore mined in the
Amazon and with other foreign investors interested in building an
aluminum smelter here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil, Guyana, Jamaica and Suriname have no shortage of
supply of the raw materials required'' for such plants, Gangar
said. ``It's a welcome bit of synergy when countries in the
immediate geographic region have vast supplies of raw materials and
Trinidad and Tobago can supply the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's showcase project is the $1 billion Atlantic LNG
Co. of Trinidad and Tobago complex in southern Trinidad, which
officials here say is the largest single industrial investment ever
made in the Caribbean. Amoco has taken a one-third interest in the
project, joined as partners by British Gas, a unit of Centrica;
Repsol of Spain; Cabot LNG Ltd., and the state-run National Gas Co.
of Trinidad and Tobago Ltd., and is already talking of expansion
early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Production of 3 million tons a year of liquefied natural gas is
scheduled to begin in the second quarter of next year, with the
bulk of production initially scheduled to go to Spain. But some
output is also intended for New England, where, as Amoco's Wight
noted, ``the wintertime demand for energy far exceeds the pipeline
capacity.'' Trinidad would be the closest supplier of LNG.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since Trinidad and Tobago achieved independence from Britain in
1962, Amoco has traditionally been the dominant player here. But
the Panday government, in what one diplomat described as an effort
to increase its leverage, has adopted ``a conscious policy of
avoiding overdependence on any one company.'' That has led the
government to award several recent offshore drilling contracts to
Amoco's main rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco's share of total production here has dropped to 60 percent
from 80 percent, according to government estimates, and is likely
to continue to fall. But Wight said his company was more than
satisfied with its situation, in part because ``we've had a high
degree of exploratory success.''
</P>
<P>
   That track record, he explained, has ``elicited a huge amount of
competition. Everyone is here now,'' including ARCO; Conoco, a unit
of Du Pont; Exxon; Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties of international politics have also lent a
hand. For European energy companies like Repsol of Spain, countries
like Algeria and Nigeria may be closer, but domestic turmoil and
widespread corruption in those energy-rich countries have made
Trinidad a more attractive place to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is not the cheapest gas on the market,'' acknowledged
Frank Look Kin, president of National Gas Co. of Trinidad and
Tobago. ``But we believe we have the advantage of a legal system
based on British law and a high degree of honesty and
transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   Wight agreed. ``We're still working from contracts and
concessions that date from independence,'' he said, which have not
been tinkered with or renegotiated despite several changes of
government. ``That is rare and really important to a businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also huge reserves of natural gas, seven times larger
than Trinidad's, in nearby Venezuela. But the leading candidate in
the presidential election there later this year, Hugo Chavez, has
threatened to review contracts with foreign oil companies, leading
to suggestions by many executives that Trinidad would be the best
place to process not just local gas reserves, but also those of
Venezuela, which are concentrated in the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to develop a fair amount of Trinidad's reserves first,
but we believe there is an opportunity there,'' Look Kin said when
asked about the issue, adding that he and other government
officials have talked with their counterparts in Caracas about the
matter. ``There is recognition on both sides that because of pure
geography, Trinidad would seem to be the appropriate place to
process some Venezuelan gas.''
</P>
<P>
   The high regard in which Trinidad is held by foreign investors
contrasts sharply with the image it had two decades ago, when the
local oil boom was at its peak and profligate spending was the
order of the day. This time around, chastened government officials
say they are determined to maintain fiscal discipline and funnel
the country's riches into much-needed infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's rare to get a second chance, and we are trying
very hard not to make the same mistakes as in the past,'' Vishnu
Ramlogan, president of the government's economic promotion agency,
the Tourism and Industrial Development Co. of Trinidad and Tobago,
said. ``We're not going to let inflation and conspicuous
consumption run away and overheat the economy. This time there is a
consensus our new-found wealth must be prudently managed.''

WARMLY GREETED IN ULSTER, CLINTON URGES LASTING PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see NIRELAND-SCENE)  
 (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland _ On a rare sunny day marked by the
fragile promise of peace and the wrenching remnants of hatred,
President Clinton on Thursday urged all parties in Northern Ireland
to seize this moment of optimism to secure lasting reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of hope, but warned of the certainty of more pain to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you look ahead, to be sure,'' the president told a crowd of
several thousand on a broad greensward in the center of this city
southwest of Belfast, ``in this peace process, there will be false
steps and disappointments. The question is not if the peace will be
challenged. You know it will. The question is, How will you respond
when it is challenged?''
</P>
<P>
   But he urged the people of Northern Ireland to press on in their
quest for peace. ``Three years ago, I pledged that if you chose
peace, America would walk with you,'' Clinton said, referring to
his visit here in late 1995. ``You made the choice, and America
will honor its pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The president journeyed across Ulster on Thursday, meeting with
members of the new Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast and with
the families of the victims of the Aug. 15 bombing in Omagh, the
worst attack in Northern Ireland's 29-year civil war. He dedicated
a new university campus that straddles Protestant and Catholic
districts of Belfast, and delivered an evening address at a
``Gathering for Peace'' in Armagh, the ancient spiritual capital of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he was met with warmth and acceptance, a welcome
relief after a tense summit meeting in Moscow and months of
personal and political troubles at home. Clinton appeared
noticeably cheered by his reception here, a respite from the debate
still raging in the United States over his honor and his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied everywhere Thursday by British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, a friend and kindred spirit who offered Clinton moral
support during a visit to Washington in January a few days after
the Monica Lewinsky matter became public.
</P>
<P>
   This was Clinton's second visit to Northern Ireland, and while
his reception was not as ecstatic as it was in November 1995, it
clearly lifted his flagging spirits.
</P>
<P>
   In Omagh, crowds a dozen deep lined the streets as Clinton
somberly walked down Market Street past the buildings smashed in a
terrorist bombing three weeks ago that killed 28 and injured 200.
When Clinton entered a hall to speak in Belfast, an audience of 500
gave him an extended ovation. And thousands stood patiently on the
playing fields in Armagh waiting for his 8 p.m. arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent an hour Thursday afternoon with victims of
the bombing and their families at a municipal recreation center in
Omagh, a town of 25,000 located 70 miles west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke briefly, encouraging the people gathered on
a basketball court not to let ``a cowardly crime'' deter them from
the path of peace. He said the terrorism had strengthened the
momentum toward reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here on Aug. 15 was so incredibly unreasonable,
so shocking to the conscience of every decent person in this land,
that it has perversely had exactly the reverse impact that the
people who perpetrated this act intended,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By killing Catholics and Protestants, young and old, men,
women and children, even those about to be born, people from
Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and abroad _ by doing all that
in the aftermath of what the people have voted for in Northern
Ireland, it galvanized, strengthened and humanized the impulse to
peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting the families, Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Blair and his wife, Cherie, walked past the bomb's devastation and
greeted hundreds who lined to streets to see them. The two couples
laid a wreath near the spot where the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has invested much time and the prestige of his office in
brokering a peace accord reached April 10, and his visit Thursday
served as a catalyst for the declaration earlier this week by Sinn
Fein leader Gerry Adams, that violence on all sides must be ``a
thing of the past, over, done with and gone.'' This week Adams also
appointed Sinn Fein's respected chief negotiator, Martin
McGuinness, as the party's representative to a new disarmament
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Adams and leaders of all the major parties to
be represented at the new Northern Ireland assembly, which is to
meet formally for the first time later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton believed he had secured the agreement of
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and the
designated first minister in the new Assembly, to meet next week
with Adams for the first time. Trimble has steadfastly refused for
years to speak with any representatives of Sinn Fein, which the
Protestant Unionists consider the public face of a banned terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Trimble-Adams meeting is not yet assured, despite Clinton's
prodding, officials acknowledged Thursday evening. ``I think that
there is a good expectation that a meeting will take place next
week,'' said James Steinberg, the president's deputy national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Another official said it was likely the meeting would also be
attended by Seamus Mallon, the No. 2 official of the Assembly and
the leader of the Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, introducing Clinton at a gathering Thursday morning at
Waterfront Hall in Belfast, praised the president for his role in
securing the April accord and said, ``We are determined to do
everything we can to make this agreement work.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not look directly at Adams, seated 25 feet away in the
front row of the auditorium. ``Words alone cannot heal distrust,''
Trimble said pointedly, ``but deeds will.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, noticeably buoyed by the audience's prolonged ovation
and speaking on an issue close to his heart, said Northern Ireland
had chosen to break with its anguished past by accepting the April
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you must prove that the passion for reason and moderation
can trump the power of extremes,'' he said. ``There will be hard
roads ahead. The terror in Omagh was not the last bomb of the
troubles; it was the opening shot of a vicious attack on the peace.
The question is not whether there will be more bombs and more
attempts to undo with violence the verdict of the ballot box. There
well may be.''
</P>
<P>
   The test of the new accord and Northern Ireland's new governing
structures will be how they respond to future attacks.

<P>
   Clinton said successful implementation of the accord required
the specific steps that were spelled: disarmament by Protestant and
Catholic paramilitary groups; formation of a multi-party executive
council to administer the province's laws; an end to police
brutality and street justice by armed bands; early release of
political prisoners whose organizations forswear violence;
protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people of Northern Ireland I say, it is your will for
peace, after all, that has brought your country to this moment of
hope,'' Clinton said at Waterfront Hall. ``Do not let it slip away.
It will not come again in our lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the people who turned out to see Clinton were
grateful for his efforts to foster peace and delighted that he
returned to Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   One skeptic was Gerald Douglas, 68, of Newcastle, Northern
Ireland, who came to Armagh to hear Clinton speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose his intentions are good,'' he said of Clinton's
involvement. But Douglas said Clinton's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky undercut his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northern Ireland is a fairly religious country and we don't
take too kindly to it,'' he said. ``When you become president or
king, you have to set an example, and I don't think he set too good
an example.''
</P>
<P>
   But most others in the crowd were willing to overlook Clinton's
personal weaknesses and simply welcome him back to the land he
claims as his ancestral home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a wee thing for Ireland,'' said Josephine Gay of
Armagh. ``If everybody's washing were hung out, there would be
skeletons in all their closets.''

TREASURIES BUOYED BY ONGOING STOCK TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bonds continued to benefit from the turbulence in
stocks Thursday, managing a modest gain.
</P>
<P>
   Investor demand for U.S. government securities, especially for
the shorter maturities, has recently been tied to the rise and fall
of the nation's and overseas stock markets. With stocks down
Thursday, still in reaction to the unresolved economic crisis in
Russia and turbulence in the global financial markets, bonds were
up.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond rose 15/32, to 103. The bond's yield, which
moves in the opposite direction, was down to 5.30 percent, from
5.33 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market was poised for the release of the August jobless
report Friday. Analysts forecast a gain of 370,000 new jobs last
month. One estimate was even higher, calling for a gain of as much
as 500,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department released its weekly report on first-time
applications for jobless benefits Thursday for the week ended Aug.
29. The data rose only slightly, indicating that the labor market
was still tight. Claims were up 1,000, to 302,000. The four-week
average of claims _ which economists consider more reliable _ fell
to 302,250, its lowest level in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed
income at J.W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said,
``The long and the short of it today is that bonds are trading
inversely to the Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the August employment data being released on Friday, I
have no apprehension about the number,'' he added. ``I think that
all of the positive factors have been factored in at these market
price levels. In other words, we are fully valued here, taking into
account the emerging markets, the stock market, low inflation,
along with a number of other things that bode well for the bond
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping in mind what happened to stocks, Pugliese is being
cautious about bonds: ``I get a little apprehensive when I hear
analysts say bonds are going to go up in price. It makes me a
little nervous. That's why I think any surprise in the employment
numbers tomorrow could just as easily be a negative for Treasuries.
The only reason the bond market traded higher today is because of
the turmoil in the equity markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds were further bolstered in the afternoon by late buying
linked to Moody's Investors Service downgrading of Brazil's foreign
currency debt rating to B-2 from B-1.

JAPAN MULLS EXPERIMENTAL BANK NATIONALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan is considering a trial step toward nationalizing
troubled big banks.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, one that might seem more at home in the old communist
bloc than in the world's second-largest capitalist economy, would
be an odd and embarrassing step for Japan's government to adopt.
Yet taking over one or more giant banks could avoid the risk of a
large-scale bankruptcy that would rattle the nation's financial
system. And while there are doubters, some analysts say that
nationalization may be the best way out of an increasingly
difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   The test is likely to be played out with the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan, which has been teetering as political parties here
squabble over how to save it. Now there are signs that the parties
may put their swords aside and work toward a solution, perhaps
involving nationalization.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa boards a plane Friday
to head for talks with officials in the United States, he is
leaving the financial system in less turmoil than it was a week ago
and with greater hope. Though the benchmark Nikkei index of 225
stocks fell 115.38 points, or 0.8 percent Thursday, to 14,261.24,
bank stocks in general rose more than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan can restore financial stability, experts say, it can
move toward repairing the broad economy _ something that U.S.
officials have been prodding the Japanese, less and less politely,
to do for years.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence has been shaken by the near-collapse of the Long-Term
Credit Bank, whose $180 billion in assets makes it one of the
country's largest. The government wants to inject taxpayers' money,
so that the bank can be more readily absorbed in a rescue merger.
But the opposition parties disagree and demand rigid criteria in
exchange for the release of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of what to do with the nation's biggest and weakest
banks has become crucial, and it has helped drag down stock prices
in recent weeks. But the idea of the government's stepping in to
nationalize banks has become increasingly accepted, and expected,
by investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many small banks and many major banks can no longer fund
themselves in the market because people are too scared,'' said
Alicia Ogawa, a banking analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo.
``The government has to take over that function. But the public
will not stand for the government lending a ton of money unless the
government manages it. Otherwise, they run the risk of current
management taking the money and flushing it down the toilet
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has already taken stakes in the largest banks,
but the holdings are relatively tiny ones. Now, after dancing
around the concept of nationalization, the governing Liberal
Democratic Party and the opposition parties are expected to address
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationalization is one of the major pillars of our proposed
bill,'' said Eisei Ito, who heads the policy research board of the
Democratic Party, the largest opposition group. ``We do not think
that many banks will be nationalized, but we are organizing the
bill to accommodate the situation, just in case several banks
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the opposition parties submitted their proposed bills
for reviving the financial system to Parliament and will defend
them in debate Friday. The opposition has criticized the
government's proposed legislation, arguing that it caters to small
and regional financial institutions and lacks any provisions for
dealing with the largest and weakest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have always listened to Americans for advice
on tackling the bad debt problems in its financial system, and they
fashioned their current plan from methods used in the United States
to resolve the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   But now, some Japanese are beginning to say that perhaps the
proper model is not the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp. and the small
bridge banks, which Washington used to help shutter insolvent
savings and loans. Rather, they say that a better model may lie in
the method used to deal with the collapse of the Continental
Illinois Bank &AMP; Trust Co. in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Although no specific deals between the opposing sides in this
argument have yet been struck, politicians are widely backing a
proposal allowing the Long-Term Credit Bank to be the model for
nationalizing a big bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank would write off about $5.5 billion in unrecoverable
loans, depleting its capital by more than 80 percent. The
government would then step in and buy newly issued shares to bring
that amount of capital back up to its former level and then
restructure the bank, selling what assets it could and trying to
collect on the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the government would bring in new managers, who
would either liquidate the bank or revive it and then sell it to
another bank. Such a process could be a great deal cheaper than
cleaning up the financial debris from a big bank's collapse.

CLINTON CHEERED IN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland _ President Clinton took a whirlwind
tour of hope Thursday across the healing scars of this rolling
countryside, basking before adoring crowds, comforting families
ravaged by sectarian war and urging lifelong enemies to let their
violent past give way to a peaceful future.
</P>
<P>
   He was given a hero's welcome, hailed as an architect of this
young and fragile peace, applauded loudly at every stop by crowds
that spilled out of auditoriums and surged against ropelines to
shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Clinton warned of the inevitability of future
violence and urged the battle-weary Irish, Protestants and
Catholics alike, to overcome it. And he sternly advised the
paramilitary factions to lay down ``weapons of war that are
obsolete in a Northern Ireland at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two proud traditions can exist side by side, bringing people
closer to God and closer to each other,'' Clinton said to a
boisterous outdoor crowd at a park in this quaint city. Later, he
added: ``Three years ago, I pledged that if you chose peace,
America would walk with you. You made the choice and America will
honor its pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier Clinton landed in the village of Omagh, a town
still reeling from an Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 28 innocent
bystanders _ including a woman pregnant with twins _ and injured
220, in the single worst attack in the 30-year-old guerrilla war
between Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met a somber collection of survivors and family members
who had gathered in the same information center where many of them
had been told that their loved ones had died. The president spoke
briefly, then wandered from table to table, first talking with a
14-year-old girl blinded in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton pointed out throughout the day, rather than
weakening the peace plan, the bombing seemed to strengthen the
island's resolve. Those killed included the young and old, men and
women, and perhaps most importantly, Protestants and Catholics,
drawing the two sides together in a common grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It galvanized, strengthened and humanized the impulse to
peace,'' Clinton told the groups, adding separately, ``To all of
you, we thank you for standing up in the face of such a
soul-searching loss and restating your determination to walk the
road of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   By every measure, the daylong tour was a victory lap for
Clinton, an opportunity to showcase what is arguably the most
significant foreign policy triumph in his 5 1/2 years as president.
It was Clinton who played a crucial role in allowing the factions
to reach their Good Friday accord in the spring, through constant
prodding, sage appointments and a last-minute blitz of telephone
lobbying on the eve of the pact.
</P>
<P>
   He has told confidants that his trip to Belfast in 1995, when
100,000 supporters turned out to greet him in a gently falling
snow, was the best day of his presidency. Thursday's visit may rank
as the most timely. Badgered at home by questions of credibility
and fresh off a Russian summit that yielded only specious results,
Clinton seemed enlivened by the loud and repeated ovations he
received at every stop.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Belfast, in a morning speech before the newly elected
Northern Ireland Assembly, Clinton beamed at his applauding
audience, letting his eyes drift toward the balcony in seeming joy.
As the crowd finally settled back into their chairs, Clinton was
the last official on stage to reluctantly take his seat.
</P>
<P>
   The day even began with an unusual dose of good news. Clinton
arrived from an early morning flight from Moscow, quickly descended
the steps of Air Force One and was handed a newspaper, The
Independent, with the front page headline: ``Trimble agrees to meet
Adams for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   It represented a remarkable turn _ David Trimble, the Protestant
leader of the newly elected Northern Ireland Assembly, and Gerry
Adams, the hard line head of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the
militant Irish Republican Army, coming together despite years of
open disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the headline we wanted to see when we got here,'' said
Samuel (Sandy) Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, after
he made a beeline for reporters on the tarmac of the Belfast
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Upon Clinton's arrival, he immediately met with leaders of
virtually every relevant faction at the Stormont Parliament
Building to personally endorse the Good Friday peace plan. He
walked into the room and simply asked, ``What can I do to help?''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who accompanied and lauded
Clinton throughout the day, told him he could concentrate on
stifling private US financial support for militant extremist
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the breakaway splinter factions of the IRA do have
some source of support and we agreed that we can identify and
locate and isolate and eradicate those sources of support in the
United States,'' said Michael McCurry, Clinton's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   At his morning speech, Clinton seemed unusually subdued, telling
the gathering of well-dressed officials, Adams and Trimble among
them, ``Your destiny is peace.''
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, Clinton appeared more at ease. Aides said he was
``deeply moved'' in his closed-door meeting with the families in
Omagh, a market city of 18,000 people. When he arrived, in the last
light of a pristine early autumn day, he was outright animated,
working the crowd into repeated cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this peace process, there will be false steps and
disappointments,'' said Clinton. ``The question is not if the peace
will be challenged. You know it will be. The question is how will
you respond to it when it is challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   He again raised the bombing in Omagh and added, ``Out of the
unimaginably horrible agony of Omagh, the people said, it is high
time somebody told these people that we are through with hate,
through with war, through with destruction. It will not work
anymore.''

   MICROSOFT-JUSTICE (Washington) MSFT04 A federal judge yesterday
ordered lawyers for Microsoft Corp. to produce documents detailing
the Redmond-based company's relationship with Apple Computer Inc.
and Intel Corp., saying that allegations Microsoft bullied those
companies may be relevant to the antitrust case slated for trial
later this month. Microsoft lawyers say the tactic is unfair
because it comes so soon before the Sept. 23 scheduled start of the
trial. Microsoft warned yesterday that if it is to defend against
charges surrounding all those companies, it will need months more
to prepare for trial. By Michael Paulson. (story will move in the

<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Pastime is back. Four years after a strike canceled
the World Series and put major league baseball on the path to
oblivion, the game has been revived by a succession of stunning
performances, specifically Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa's
season-long assault on one of the game's most cherished records.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting four monstrous home runs in two nights in Miami,
Cardinals slugger McGwire goes into tonight's game in St. Louis
with 59 homers. Only Babe Ruth (60 in '27) and Roger Maris (61 in
'61) ever hit more. McGwire has 23 games left in which to hit three
home runs and guarantee immortality.
</P>
<P>
   And so America's summer of stock market woes, ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' and a devil in a blue dress also goes down in the books as
the Summer of the Home Run. Like a favorite son returning from a
stint overseas in the Peace Corps, baseball has come home to remind
us of what was great about the game in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the home run chase has made a stunning
contribution to bringing the focus back on the field,'' says
baseball commissioner Bud Selig, the man who announced cancellation
of the World Series in 1994. ``It's fascinating. It's why this is
still the greatest game in the world. No other sport reaches people
and captivates the nation the way baseball can.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide attendance is up 3.2 percent and major league
baseball could draw in excess of 70 million fans and wipe out the
attendance record set in 1993 _ one year before the strike. Last
Sunday night's ESPN game, featuring McGwire and the Cardinals, was
the network's second-highest-rated baseball telecast ever, topped
only by Cal Ripken's consecutive-game record-breaker of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the feats of McGwire and Sosa, baseball in 1998
has a New York Yankee team threatening to break the record for wins
(116 by the 1906 Cubs) in a season. There's also been a perfect
game by Yankee lefthander David Wells, a run on Hack Wilson's
68-year-old RBI record (190), and an influx of new superstars,
including Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, fans are ecstatic about the unexpected rise of
the Red Sox and the possibility of a seven-game playoff series with
the Yankees in October. The trendy Patriots open their season
Monday night against the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, but
fans suddenly are talkin' baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on home runs. Everyone loves the long ball. The summer
of '98 has created a national obsession with the home run chase.
Baseball hasn't had any real pennant races and the games have
become secondary to the inning-by-inning updates of McGwire and
Sosa's respective performances. ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' usually
leads the hour with news of the home run chase, and most newspapers
in the land have devised their own graphic to keep fans up to date
on the march toward Maris. ESPN added Friday night's Cardinals-Reds
game to its lineup, and Fox TV picked up Saturday's game in St.
Louis and had it converted from a night game to a matinee.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time baseball has been bailed out by
tape-measure shots. In 1919, eight members of the Chicago White Sox
were involved in a conspiracy to throw the World Series against
Cincinnati. The ``Black Sox'' scandal threatened to ruin major
league baseball, but the game was saved in part when the
larger-than-life Ruth hit 54 homers in 1920 and 59 in '21 to put
the focus back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   When Maris _ considered a party-crasher in the pantheon of
baseball greats _ hit 61 homers, baseball, and New York in
particular, was still reeling from the relocation of the Dodgers
and Giants to the West Coast. Expansion had watered down the
product, and purists were horrified when the traditional 154-game
season was expanded by eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have McGwire, the red-haired mastodon, hitting a home run
once every eight trips to the plate. This is his third consecutive
season with 50 or more homers (breaking Ruth's record), and he's
been joined by Sosa, a relatively unknown slugger from the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been months of expectation and anticipation
about the quest for 62, few baseball experts believed any player
would be this close with so much time remaining in the season.
McGwire is a whopping six homers ahead of where Maris was after the
same number of games in 1961. Maris did not hit No. 61 until the
final day of the season (against Red Sox righthander Tracy
Stallard). Maris staggered late in the '61 season and lost clumps
of hair from worry. McGwire has practically thrown off all the
pressure. It's no longer a question of ``Can he do it?'' It's
``When can he do it?'' And how many for the Cubs' Sosa, who is at
56 with 22 games left?
</P>
<P>
   The only controversy touching McGwire involves his use of
androstenedione, a naturally occurring steriod sold over the
counter and allowed by major league baseball. McGwire says he takes
``andro'' as a dietary supplement to help him train harder and
recover faster. It is banned by the NFL, the NCAA, and the
International Olympic Committee. Critics have complained that the
Cardinal slugger is sending the wrong message to aspiring young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy seems to come with the territory. When Maris hit his
61st in New York's 162d game, it was considered tainted because the
new schedule was eight games longer than Ruth's campaign in 1927.
Maris's record was listed with an asterisk until 1991, when former
commissioner Fay Vincent erased the black mark and crowned Maris
the undisputed home run champ. McGwire has a chance to wipe out all
the records long before he gets to 154 games.
</P>
<P>
   More than any sport, baseball is about numbers: 714 was Ruth's
seemingly unassailable career home run total, which was surpassed
by Henry Aaron (who finished with 755) in 1974. It was also assumed
that Lou Gehrig's streak of playing in 2,130 consecutive games
could never be matched, but that was before Ripken (2,617 and
counting) came along. Ted Williams (.406 in 1941) is baseball's
last .400 hitter, and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak remains
intact. But Maris's 61 in '61 is going to fall, and everyone, even
the ballplayers, seems happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of the best-selling
``Wait 'Til Next Year,'' says, ``The nicest part is when you see
the other players' awe toward these guys. Usually, they are such
individuals, only worrying about themselves, but in so many of
these stories, you see Sosa giving McGwire credit and the great
Garciaparra talking about it. They must feel it's good for the
whole game. You somehow feel it's a band of brothers, which makes
you feel a sense of them all being together as professionals and
belonging to something that is larger than themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Major league pitchers are part of the story. Stallard became a
trivia answer when he yielded Maris's 61st homer, and the man who
surrenders No. 62 to McGwire faces a lifetime of infamy. Most
pitchers say they'll challenge McGwire and Sosa. They don't want to
give up the record-breaking homer, but they don't want to issue a
walk and appear cowardly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the seamy issue of 1990s memorabilia madness. In
1961, when Maris hit No. 61, the ball was caught by Sal Durante, a
teenager from Coney Island, who gave it to Maris, posed for a few
pictures, and was rewarded with a $5,000 check from a Sacramento
restaurateur. It's been estimated that the home run ball that
breaks Maris's record could fetch seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe in the larger forces _ and the church of
baseball has many disciples of superstition _ take note that Maris
broke Ruth's record 13 years after the Babe died in 1948. Roger
Maris died in 1985. Thirteen years ago.

BOURQUE, BRUINS TO TALK CONTRACT EXTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This will be the 20th season for Bruins captain Ray
Bourque, but chances are excellent it won't be his last. Bourque,
who turns 38 in December, is scheduled to sit down with management
next week to discuss a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   This season Bourque will be the lone first-round pick from the
celebrated 1979 entry draft remaining as an active player in the
NHL. Wayne Gretzky came in through the WHA as a priority pick by
Edmonton that year. In addition to Bourque and Gretzky, only Dale
Hunter (selected No. 41 overall), Guy Carbonneau (No. 44), and Mark
Messier (No. 48) remain from the '79 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Bourque repeatedly said he would wait until his
contract ran out at the end of this season before deciding whether
to continue his career. However, after a break this summer which
gave him time to think, he has changed his mind. Right now he
thinks he'll play one extra year, retiring after the 1999-2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to go on too long,'' said Bourque, speaking
after a workout at Pingree School in Hamilton. ``Let's keep it
realistic. I think two (more) years and we'll see where we go from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he doesn't yet know if he'll meet only with
president-general manager Harry Sinden or with assistant GM Mike
O'Connell as well. He isn't sure if he'll be accompanied by his
representative, Steve Freyer, or will go on his own for the initial
meeting. But no matter who is in attendance, he figures he'll know
very early if the sides can come to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go in there and listen to what they have to say
and they'll listen to what I have to say and then we'll see where
we go from there,'' said Bourque. ``I'm going in there to see what
happens but I really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is discussing specific figures. However, anyone with any
business sense knows that in order for Bourque to forgo
unrestricted free agency next July 1, he will have to have his deal
sweetened for this year. Bourque is scheduled to make $3.5 million
in the last year of his current pact. With Al MacInnis the current
pacesetter for defensemen at $4.5 million, it's likely Bourque will
want to increase his earnings to that same figure for this year,
with a bump to the $5 million range next season. However the
situation gets resolved, Bourque said the decision wasn't driven by
money. It was driven by a reevaluation after some time away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself playing more than next year,'' he said. ``I think
that's a definite. When you're going through it, sometimes you
don't really know. But you step away from it for a little bit, you
look at the year and how things went, how I felt, how I played. I
enjoyed myself and things went well. I think I had another solid
year and I don't see why that can't continue. If I stay healthy, I
don't think that will be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said the summer afforded him some perspective that was
hard to come by during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get done with the season, sometimes there are certain
points of the year where it's longer and tougher and you don't
know,'' he said. ``When you have one year left, you don't know what
you are going to do. But I'm pretty clear on what I want to do now.
I want to play more than this upcoming season.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, he would like to get the extension done quickly and
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be done that way,'' he said. ``I don't see
why not, but we'll see.''

CURVEY NAMED PRESIDENT OF FIDELITY PARENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In his quiet rise to power at Fidelity Investments,
James C. Curvey has helped steer the nation's largest mutual fund
firm through the turbulent waters of competition and crisis. Now
Curvey, Fidelity's influential, behind-the-scenes chief operating
officer, has an even more commanding role.
</P>
<P>
   Curvey, 63, Thursday was named president of Fidelity's parent
company, FMR Corp. The title gives Fidelity's number two man a
stronger hand in daily operations and strategic business planning,
and a greater role in preparing the Boston-based firm for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment signals that Fidelity's chairman and chief
executive, Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson III, is gradually assuming a
narrower role in running the firm his father founded just after
World War II. It also underscores what industry observers say is
Curvey's function to prepare the ground for Johnson's 36-year-old
daughter, Abigail, to eventually take over her father's company
should she wish to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Curvey's new title formalizes some arrangements that were
already in place. But it also consolidates the growing, front-stage
position of a man observers say is Johnson's closest confidante and
most trusted adviser.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Curvey now has a greater number of senior
executives reporting to him. Previously only the heads of corporate
administration, finance, and affairs reported to him on operational
issues, while other top executives reported to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the heads of all of Fidelity's core business units _
including J. Gary Burkhead, who heads sales and distribution,
Robert L. Reynolds, who oversees institutional retirement, Mark A.
Peterson, who heads systems and services, Roger T. Servison, who
oversees international operations, Kevin J. Kelly, head of
institutional investment products, and Timothy T. Hilton, who heads
the Fidelity Capital venture capital unit _ report to Curvey on a
day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Pozen, who heads Fidelity's retail mutual fund unit,
now reports to Curvey on all ``nonfund related'' issues, Fidelity
spokeswoman Anne W. Crowley said. Previously, Pozen reported to
Johnson on all matters.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 67, who shows no signs of retiring any time soon, now
handles only policy matters, including fund management issues.
</P>
<P>
   Curvey retains his current titles of chairman of Fidelity's
powerful 10-person operating committee (the firm's key
decision-making group) and vice chairman of FMR Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Described by industry observers as elegant but hard-driving,
Curvey joined Fidelity in 1982 as human resources director.
Appointed operations chief in May 1997 at a time when Fidelity was
battling a string of defections by fund managers, disappointing
returns, and a lack of coordination among its fractious units,
Curvey played a major role in smoothing things out. Prior to that,
he headed Fidelity Capital, a colorful collection of assets,
ranging from telecommunications firms and art galleries, that
reflects Johnson's varied interests.
</P>
<P>
   Eric M. Kobren, editor of the independent Fidelity Insight
newsletter, said under Curvey's tenure, Fidelity had stabilized by
improving fund returns, slowing attrition, integrating distribution
channels, and cutting costs. Private, family-owned Fidelity had
$692.9 billion in assets under management and 12.3 percent of the
nation's fund market as of the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were growing, but we never really had time to take care of
growing,'' Curvey said in an interview. ``I guess Ned's satisfied
with the job I'm doing.'' The firm last had a president in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Curvey's new title comes as Wall Street gyrates wildly, Fidelity
launches a new advertising campaign, and Abigail P. Johnson
prepares to return to the firm, where she is a senior vice
president assisting Pozen, from maternity leave.

   Overnight, with the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 just five miles
away, it became synonymous with such places as Lockerbie, Scotland,
and East Moriches, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And the 60 or so souls here woke up Thursday in a different
hamlet, one whose carefree tourists have been driven out by fire
engines, television vans and somber emergency crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a pleasant place,'' Fitzgerald said. ``It's amazing
how a blanket of sadness can suddenly cover a place.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadness with a hint of horror. From the rounded rocks where
tourists gaze to sea, the vista Thursday included Her Majesty's
Canadian Ship Preserver, a naval supply vessel collecting debris
and passengers' remains, its freezers turning rapidly into a mass
morgue.
</P>
<P>
   To and from the Preserver shuttled Coast Guard cutters and
humble local lobster boats still scouring the swells for flotsam
and jetsam from the plane. By daybreak, officials had said that
there had been no survivors of the crash, but rescue workers said
they still held out hope of finding someone alive.
</P>
<P>
   But in the main, the jobs of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
the Canadian Transportation Safety Board and hundreds of other
rescue workers on Thursday consisted largely of fishing out tiny
bits of luggage, seat-rests, stray shoes, body parts and occasional
whole bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Dartmouth, at a Canadian military base, rescue workers
began to assemble a makeshift morgue in an airplane hangar in
preparation for the platoon of corpses soon to come.
</P>
<P>
   In Peggy's Cove itself, the sadness was mixed with a sense of
the surreal _the abnormal absence of the crowds of ocean-gazers on
the rocks; the edicts of the emergency workers, such as the ban on
children playing in the schoolyard because it was needed as a
helicopter landing spot. Tourists have been barred from the
village, which is normally one of Canada's most popular
destinations, and the prevailing tone of Peggy's Cove seemed turned
from light to dark in a kind of anti-holiday.
</P>
<P>
   On a house's back stoop high above the protected cove for which
the village is named, onlookers watched somberly Thursday as boats
that normally disgorge lobsters or sunburned whale-watchers instead
puttered in with shoes or a child's backpack in forensic-looking
plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like Peggy's Cove has stopped,'' said Darrell
Fralick, 26, the attendant at the town's main parking lot. He had
been awakened at 2:30 a.m. to open the public washrooms in the lot
for use by the media and emergency crews flocking in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad,'' said Tara Gabriel, Fralick's fiancee and an
attendant at the art gallery across the street from the parking
lot. ``This doesn't happen in Peggy's Cove's backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about things like this,'' Fralick said, ``but when it
hits in your backyard, you can feel how other people feel.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They all have families,'' said John Thomas, who patrols the
rocks of Peggy's Cove to keep tourists from endangering themselves
as they clamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have people at home waiting,'' Frailick added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine,'' Ms. Gabriel said, ``going to the airport to meet
someone and the flight doesn't come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas continued: ``You only see a sign saying `See agent.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Such sympathy, expressed universally hereabouts, is nonetheless
only sympathy, not grief; Peggy's Cove did not lose any of its own
people _ a loss that would be deeply felt in a village dominated by
a handful of families, most of them here since the community was
founded in 1811.
</P>
<P>
   There were no tears to be seen here Thursday, as victims'
identities became known in only a trickle and the victims
themselves remained largely names without faces. Almost all the
recovered bodies were being taken to a Navy ship, not to shore
here.
</P>
<P>
   But there was concern closer to home as well. At least one
fisherman from Peggy's Cove, John Campbell, participated with
dozens of colleagues from nearby in the ghastly work of gathering
up bodies and debris from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like that in my life, and I hope I
never do again,'' Campbell, a red-headed man of 34, said quietly
and matter-of-factly Thursday back on the wharf at Peggy's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   It was Campbell and dozens of other veteran lobstermen,
fishermen and small boaters from the coves and villages south of
Halifax who, in the first horrible hours of the rescue effort,
rushed to form the vanguard of the search for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents expressed concern for the physical _ and
psychological _ safety of those fishermen during their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard E. Walsh, who ministers at the only church in
this town of 60 people, St. John's Anglican Church, said that even
hardened fishermen were having trouble dealing with the scope of
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fishing village,'' he said. ``The people here know
about tragedies. They know what the sea can do.'' But he added:
``Some of the men are very, very upset. It's quite traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also expressed dismay that there was never a chance to
rescue anyone, here in a region where the rough Atlantic often
plunges ships into distress, and where daring rescues at sea are a
proud tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Crooks, a lobsterman, said he had considered taking his
boat _ which lacks the lights to run at night _ out to help with
rescues Thursday morning, but by daybreak, word had come that there
were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people,'' said Gordon Earle, a Member of
Parliament whose region includes Peggy's Cove, ``The hardest thing
was that there was no one they could save.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle was walking Peggy's Cove's winding streets, he said,
because he wanted to show his support: ``It's quite traumatic for a
community to have this tragic disaster take place right there in
the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, said Eliza Manuel, chairwoman of the Peggy's Cove
Commission that oversees local land use, ``It's scary to think how
close the crash was to all of us here _ minutes or seconds in the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Manuel's father, John Beale, proprietor of Beales'
Bailiwick, a crafts store specializing in Canadian work, provided
some sage perspective to the strange day.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, an announcer on the all-news radio station
CJCH told listeners that the little village ``certainly takes on a
different meaning from the time you were there with your family
enjoying the beauty of Peggy's Cove.'' And Beale said that some
reporters had been asking him whether its association with tragedy
could damage Peggy's Cove, much as the village of Lockerbie,
Scotland, is now synonymous for many people with the 1988 crash of
Pan Am Flight 109.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask, `Will the Cove ever be the same?''' he said. ``They
say, `Will people stay away forever?''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, Beale said, given the public's penchant for sad,
gory stories like the sinking of the Titanic, Peggy's Cove will
most likely not be shunned for its association with tragedy.
Rather, he said, ``It will probably be the reverse. It's a sad
dialogue on society but it's true.''

TERROR (Washington) - FBI Director Louis Freeh made it clear in a
hearing of Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl's terrorism subcommittee that
America can expect more and larger attacks on random U.S. targets
and people from terrorists connected with Osama bin Laden. And
America will respond. What all that adds up to is a war the likes
of which the nation has not seen before. By ADRIANNE FLYNN and PAT
FLANNERY. Story will move in the ``A`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AMWEST-EARNINGS (Phoenix) - America West Holdings Corp. Chairman
William Franke says America West Airlines will fall short of
third-quarter earnings estimates because of poor July and August
performance. The Am West president and CEO points a finger at
mechanics for negatively affecting the airlines' operating and
financial results. Also, on-time performance slipped to 64.9
percent, last among the nine largest carriers. By PETER CORBETT.
Story will move in the ``F`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BASEBALL-NOSHOWS (Phoenix) - It's a game everyone loses at Bank One
Ballpark, day after day. The bouncing baseball caps give fans three
guesses at the day's attendance. And none of the options is
correct.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks officials confirmed this week what fans had
suspected: The number of people who actually attend each game is
substantially less than the announced attendance. The team reports
the number of tickets sold or given away, rather than the number of
people in the ballpark. During August, the difference was about
6,000 fans per game. The team's executives say they have a good
reason for refusing to divulge the correct number of people who
attend Diamondbacks games: It's a secret shared by teams throughout
major league sports. By MARY JO PITZL. Story will move in the ``A``
and ``S`` categories.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
OBESITY (Undated) - Health specialists are calling it a ``fat
epidemic,'' and no wonder with the latest numbers showing that more
than half of Americans are overweight and one out of three adults
is obese. The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into
obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings
linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including
heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of
cancer. Yet although much has been learned about obesity, it's
still a medical enigma that prompts more questions than there are
answers. By THOMAS ROPP. Story moved in the ``L`` category. &QL;

EDITORIAL: EDIT-CLINTON ATTACKS
</P>
<P>
   (Undated) - The Clinton administration's attack on the peronal
lives of its critics is reprehensible. Story moved in the ``K``
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
VALDEZ-COLUMN (Undated) - The people who put up $2.3 million to
have their dog cloned provided comics with a deep vein of yuk-yuk
material.
</P>
<P>
   But this is more than a high-tech version of what Roy Rogers did

   It's the trivialization of both science and life. By LINDA
VALDEZ. Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POOL PRO-ART (Undated) - There is a fine line between devotion and
obsession. For Jeanette Lee, upon that line is balanced a cue
stick. Every day, every hour it hovers precariously between healthy
enthusiasm and destructive fixation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is one of the best pool players in the nation, in the world
for that matter. She prowls that small patch of green felt like a
tiger smelling fresh meat. Lee has been dubbed the Black Widow not
only because of her preferred color in fashion, but also because of
the killer instinct that takes over once she looks down the shaft
of a cue. With PHOTO. By

   SCOTT CRAVEN. Story moved in the ``E`` and ``S`` categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Undated) - I saw him as I looked through my front
window, watching the stream of kids filter through the streets to
the nearby school on the first day of the new year. While other
kids walked in groups, swinging backpacks and laughing, he shuffled
his feet, looking at the ground as he walked. I knew how he felt.
I've never been a good starter, either. By LAURIE NOTARO. Story
moved in the ``L`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOPE DAVIS-MOVIE (Undated) - Hope Davis is a gold-star member of
the indie posse. Like actors Campbell Scott, Julianne Moore, Parker
Posey and Stanley Tucci, she keeps turning up in the kind of
low-budget, high-quality movies that tend to burst out of nowhere
to acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest is ``Next Stop Wonderland,'' which got snapped up for
distribution by the formidable Miramax Films at this year's
Sundance Film Festival. By
</P>
<P>
   MELISSA MORRISON. Story moved in the ``E`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GABRIEL-MUSIC (Undated) - Frank Sinatra remains the Chairman of the

</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen is the Boss.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Latin music world, one man overshadows them both.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gabriel is known as nothing less than ``El Idolo de las

   GRACIELA SEVILLA. Story moved in the ``E`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FRIENDS-MOVIE (Undated) - ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' displays a
painful intimacy about sexual misery, with a group of people who
are animated only by the unease of their frustrated lives and what
pases for relationships among the over-analytical. 3 stars. By BOB
FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL;

SAIL-MEXICO (Undated) - Not a day went by that Monte Berget, beaten
down by radiation treatment and lying exhausted in the gray
recliner, didn't think of the catamaran docked in San Diego. The
Odysseus. His family had bought the white sailboat for a year-long
trip together. Then, just before Christmas, less than a year before
they were supposed to leave, came the diagnosis of cancer. Berget
recovered from the aggressive form of cancer and the family of four
made the trip around the Baja Peninsula and drew closer, despite
dangerous storms and teenagers with attitudes. With PHOTOS. By
KELLY ETTENBOROUGH. Story will move in the ``L'' category.  &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - Has it really been 10 years since the Mazda
Miata single-handedly reignited America's enthusiasm for
lightweight roadsters, years after the British had packed up their
little sports cars and gone home? Miata remains a singular
expression of sports-car virtue. Others have tried but missed the
mark.
</P>
<P>
   A recent flurry of German roadsters from BMW, Porsche and
Mercedes-Benz may eclipse the Miata in performance, but they cost
twice as much. And they probably wouldn't exist if Miata had not
paved the way. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L`` category. &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED - There is a fine line between devotion and obsession.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeanette Lee, upon that line is balanced a cue stick. Every
day, every hour it hovers precariously between healthy enthusiasm
and destructive fixation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is one of the best pool players in the nation, in the world
for that matter. She prowls that small patch of green felt like a
tiger smelling fresh meat _ and will do just so at the Penn Ray
WPBA Phoenix Classic, running today through Sunday at Bucky's
Casino in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been dubbed the Black Widow not only because of her
preferred color in fashion, but also because of the killer instinct
that takes over once she looks down the shaft of a cue.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell the first person she nearly destroyed at a
pool table was herself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Lee, born and raised in New York City, was a typical
18-year-old who had no idea what she wanted to be when she grew up.
After landing a job at a software company, she thought about
attending college and becoming a teacher. Or maybe not. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   That was before colleagues insisted she join them at a new pool
hall in town. It was big and oh so trendy.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how a night out can alter the rest of your life. Not one
detail of that visit has escaped Lee's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I walked into this incredibly crowded pool room, an
old man caught my eye,'' Lee says from her offices in Cincinnati.
``As I watched him, the people and the music faded away. Pretty
soon all I could hear was the sound of his breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so mesmerized by everything he did, the way he lined up
his shots, how one shot led perfectly to another. Everything was so
simple and yet so perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee never picked up a cue stick that evening. It would be the
last pool-free night of her life.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the pool hall the next day and spent a few hours
learning the felt-covered ropes. It was long enough to know she'd
found her passion. It wasn't long before it was an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Nights at the pool table stretched into early mornings. At one
point she played 37 hours straight before collapsing. Friends had
to carry her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something there, a chemistry,'' Lee says. ``My life
became pool. Nothing else mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   One day led to another. Lee can't remember times she didn't have
a cue in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   It started to take a toll. Lee suffers from scoliosis, and at
times her back pain became insufferable. She became sick for days
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was play pool,'' Lee says. ``I didn't eat, I didn't
sleep. Finally I said, `OK, I've got to stay within reality here.'
I had to take care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first few years, she gave no thought to money or a
career. Until she entered a regional tournament and won. And won
another. And another.
</P>
<P>
   Doors she never knew existed opened to her. In 1993 she
qualified for the Women's Professional Billiards Association tour.
She'd become incredibly good incredibly fast.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years Lee has won several WPBA tournaments
and has become one of the tour's most popular players. Ranked third
on the tour, she is as busy making personal appearances as she is
competing. She maintains her own Web site (www.jeanettelee.com) and
heads the Jeanette Lee Foundation, a charitable organization.
</P>
<P>
   As busy as she is traveling and meeting fans, she still has a
hobby _ playing pool. In her spare time she likes to play pool. To
relax, she plays pool.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love the game,'' Lee says. ``I'd rather play than go to
a movie or go dancing or whatever. It's just that now I no longer
play to exhaustion.'' &QL;

CLINTON LACKIES TRYING TO TERRORIZE OPPONENTS  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARS IN FRIDAY'S ARIZONA REPUBLIC)
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - In personal terms, Indiana Rep. Dan Burton's
confession of past troubles in his 38-year marriage, including a
hint of infidelity, was a sad but prudent pre-emptive strike
against a coming magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   But in political terms, it was an outrage _ one more instance of
the campaign of rumors and even terror waged by the Clinton White
House against anyone it views as a threat to the president's
future. Richard Nixon merely made a list of his enemies; Bill
Clinton's lackies (including a notorious private eye) put the fear
of God into them. Criticizing this president can be hazardous to
one's reputation and even health.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Rep. Paul McHale. Within days after calling on Clinton to
resign, the Pennsylvania Democrat was accused by unidentified White
House sources of faking his military record. The accusation was a
lie, but the audacity of aides to a draft dodger challenging the
military authenticity of anyone is little short of breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Scott Ritter. The senior and highly praised U.S. weapons
inspector in Iraq, resigned when the administration quietly blocked
critical inspections, and was immediately labeled as a
``disgruntled'' ex-employee who had passed secret documents to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Or ask Kathleen Willey. Two days before she was to testify about
her presidential groping, she was greeted by a stranger who asked
threatening questions about details of her life, and cited her
children by name.
</P>
<P>
   Or ask Sally Perdue, a former Miss Arkansas who had a fling with
Clinton in 1983 and has said she was warned against talking in 1992
by a campaign aide who noted that she was known to go jogging ``and
we can't guarantee what will happen to your pretty little legs.''
</P>
<P>
   All these incidents, and many others in an ugly litany of
vengeance dating to Little Rock, share a common thread _ instead of
confronting the criticism head on, they seek to smear and
intimidate the critic.
</P>
<P>
   No one suggests Clinton personally ordered all these acts, but
there is no question that the climate in which such conduct
flourishes is created at the top. And Clinton, who hails from a
small, one-party state run by an old-boy network, is used to
getting his way without the fuss and bother of reasoned debate.
</P>
<P>
   With grand jury testimony complete, White House attention has
shifted from witnesses to Congress, where a scorched-earth policy
is now aimed at discouraging members like Burton from thinking
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be working.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, they've just made people madder than hell,'' a House
aide said. At last, an encouraging word.

 &HT;    AirTran flight attendants threaten spot disruptions
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years of acrimony between AirTran Airlines and the
Association of Flight Attendants come to a head this weekend, when
the union vows to disrupt operations if a contract is not reached.
</P>
<P>
   But AirTran executives say the union's threats will prove hollow
because of a lack of rank-and-file support and company
countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to operate every flight,'' said Thomas Kalil, senior
vice president for operations and customer service at AirTran,
Atlanta's second-largest airline. The low-fare carrier has 120
daily departures from Hartsfield International Airport, where it
handles about 6 percent of the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   A strike countdown ends at midnight tonight, after which the AFA
can stage spot walkouts under a plan dubbed CHAOS, for Creating
Havoc Around Our System.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passengers won't know where or when we'll strike,'' said Bill
Green, president of the AFA local for AirTran. ``All they will know
is that they are stranded.''
</P>
<P>
   The union conducted a ceremonial ``lottery'' Thursday at
Hartsfield to decide which flights might be struck. Another group
of attendants who don't support the union planned a counter-rally
today.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran and union negotiators are in last-ditch contract talks
that could still avert the showdown. Neither side would
characterize their progress Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The mere threat of schedule disruptions is likely to cost
AirTran some business _ a chief element of the union's strategy to
pressure management into a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike larger airlines, AirTran does not have agreements under
which stranded passengers could trade in their reservations for
seats on rival carriers, although they could seek refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Kalil insisted that won't be a problem. He said AirTran's 700
flight attendants include only a couple hundred who support the
union. The AFA contends it has strong support but could not provide
a membership figure.
</P>
<P>
   Kalil said AirTran already has taken several steps to assure
that any walkouts won't force cancellations. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Permanent replacements have been hired and trained, and will be
deployed in various cities where they could step in as needed.
Strikers who are replaced would be put on a preferential hiring
list when they agreed to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Some airport agents are qualified to act as substitute
attendants if needed.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran has removed six seats from each of its DC-9 jets,
cutting the total to 100. That means flights can be staffed by two
attendants rather than the normal three, although Kalil said he
expects that will be rare. The Federal Aviation Administration
conducted safety tests for the two-attendant plan. AirTran passed
this week _ but only after failing the first three times.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the airline and the union dates to 1995,
when attendants at the then-ValuJet Airlines voted for AFA
representation. ValuJet merged with Orlando-based AirTran last year
and adopted its name.
</P>
<P>
   On-and-off talks never produced an initial contract, and ill
will grew when AFA leaders publicly criticized ValuJet management
during the three-month shutdown that followed the 1996 crash of
Flight 592 in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the National Mediation Board declared an impasse,
triggering a strike countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 1996 shutdown and high turnover, many of the
attendants who originally voted for AFA representation are no
longer with the carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Dissident attendants are trying to oust the AFA as their legal
bargaining agent, a laborious process that would require a vote
conducted by federal labor monitors. Karen Malone, one of the
organizers, said the group has 300 petition signatures and is
staging today's pro-company rally at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show our support for the airline and reassure
customers we'll be flying,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Union official David Borer discounted the anti-AFA campaign,
noting that efforts to unseat the union have been made since 1996
without result. In any case, he said, the CHAOS campaign is
designed so that only a few attendants have to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with a few flight attendants striking random flights, the
customer has to make a decision and risk rolling the dice and being
stranded at the airport,'' he said. ``The whole idea is to gain
leverage without putting a lot of jobs at risk.'' He said the
tactic has been used successfully at other AFA carriers, including
United and Alaska airlines.
</P>
<P>
   A chief sticking point in the contract talks is a union demand
that all flight attendants pay dues, whether or not they want to
belong to the union.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA argues that is a common feature of union contracts _
including those AirTran has with its pilots and mechanics _ and is
the only fair way to fund bargaining activities that cover all
members of a work group.
</P>
<P>
   Kalil said management promised attendants who don't support the
union it wouldn't accept a contract that forces them to pay union
fees. He said there was no such concern among pilots and mechanics,
``so those were different situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalil said AirTran gave flight attendants two pay raises last
year and is offering an immediate 10 percent raise in the new
contract, which would boost the base monthly salary for a
three-year attendant to about $1,600. That would be followed by 4
percent annual raises through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Kalil said the airline's offer also boosts per diem pay and
provides a new uniform allowance and moving allowances.
</P>
<P>
   But Borer said the offer is ``still short and leaves them at or
near the bottom of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalil said the airline will unilaterally implement the new
contract offer even if no agreement is reached _ another move to
discourage support for union walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we reach an agreement or not,'' he said, ``the flight
attendants who work are going to reap the benefits.''

 &HT;    Investors pull back
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stocks fell for the second straight session on Thursday as
investors pulled back ahead of the long Labor Day weekend, and
against the backdrop of continued foreign financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Investors aimed to lock in profits so they wouldn't be exposed
to further losses should anything disastrous happen between now and
Tuesday, in which time they would be unable to make a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market, however, continued to benefit from fearful
investors looking for a safe haven from the world's turbulence.
Rising bond prices had the effect of lowering long-term Treasury
yields even more.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market is still concerned that economic and
financial crises in Russia and Asia are already spreading to Latin
America. Moody's Investors Service downgraded ratings on the debt
of Venezuela and Brazil, and put a downgrade alert on Mexico and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Market technicians believe the Dow Jones industrial average will
continue to decline until it tests the low of 7,539.07 it reached
on Monday, after falling 513 points. It closed Thursday at
7,682.22.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, most analysts believe the market may need some
major event, such as a cut in interest rates or an improvement in
foreign conditions, to turn stocks around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a bullish headline of major impact, it appears that
the bounce from Monday's sell-off has already reached its point of
diminishing returns,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst Paul Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Upbeat foreign news may be the least likely, however. There was
further chaos in Japan, as giant steelmaker Toa Steel announced it
would abandon efforts to survive and begin liquidating its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street hopes to get better news about Japan from today's
meeting between Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say vigorous economic reform is needed in Japan if it
is to help solve economic problems in the rest of Asia, where Japan
has stronger trade ties than does the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All major stock averages posted losses in volatile trading
Thursday: the blue chip Dow by 1.3 percent, the technology-loaded
Nasdaq composite by 1.3 percent and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller stocks by 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today's usually important report on August non-farm job growth
and the unemployment rate may get less attention because of the
effects of the General Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report that initial unemployment benefit claims rose
1,000 to 302,000 in the week ending Aug. 29 was interpreted,
however, as further evidence of strong job markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Association of Purchasing Management's
non-manufacturing index declined to 52 percent from 57.5 percent in
July, reflecting slower growth in service industries.

 &HT;    Research Alliance thanks governor for his support
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. Zell Miller described the Georgia Research Alliance as one
of his lifetime's great achievements Thursday, but expressed
concern about the future of two of his other great accomplishments
_ the HOPE scholarship and pre-kindergarten programs.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was attending his eighth annual board meeting of the GRA,
a consortium of top business leaders and presidents of the state's
six research universities. Former and current board members alike
turned out to thank Miller at his last visit with the group as
governor. They credited Miller for supporting $200 million in state
funding over the past eight years, which helped increase Georgia's
technology employment from 86,000 in 1990 to 135,000 last year,
numbers that make Georgia a national leader.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of continuing Georgia's progress in research and
technology, the GRA board voted unanimously to ask the next
governor to include in his budget $45 million _ its largest request
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic about the Georgia Research Alliance,'' Miller
told the group. ``Frankly, I'm not as optimistic about the HOPE
scholarship and the pre-K programs. I think politicians in the next
few years will begin to try to fiddle with those two programs.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Miller added that he worries politicians will
want to take Georgia Lottery funds away from education for other
causes, such as fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   Miller warned that the lottery is not an inexhaustible source of
money. The next governor will have to be careful not to dilute its
impact on education by agreeing to spend it elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to have the vigilance and the commitment,''
Miller said, advising his successor. ``Folks knew that if they
messed with the lottery, I would slap them upside the head.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to recognize the governor, the GRA board announced
it will give an annual $5,000 stipend in Miller's name to a junior
faculty member working in technology at a Georgia university. GRA
President William A. Todd said they wanted to respect the
governor's wishes in not providing plaques or gold cowboy boots,
but in having an award that was in keeping with his initiatives as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   The GRA board hopes to convince the next governor of the
importance of supporting its initiatives, which include funding for
eminent scholars _ a program that brings nationally renown
researchers to Georgia universities _ as well as research labs and
equipment. By investing in the GRA, Todd said the state benefits
with more high-tech jobs by helping Georgia entrepreneurial
companies grow and by attracting new businesses to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The $45 million request includes $3 million for four new eminent
scholars, $10 million in new facilities, $31.1 million in equipment
and $750,000 for developmental funds across the state.
</P>
<P>
   United Way chairman takes job in New York
</P>
<P>
   Neal Purcell, chairman of Metro Atlanta United Way's 1998
campaign, has been named vice chairman of assurance for KPMG-Peat
Marwick in New York _ proving once again Atlanta is a launching pad
for executives of professional firms. Purcell has been KPMG's
managing partner in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell said he will not move to New York full time until he has
completed his civic obligations in Atlanta. ``I plan to stick right
here until we complete the campaign and achieve the $70 million
goal,'' Purcell said Thursday. ``That was one of the conditions
that I made.''
</P>
<P>
   William J. Garrett, United Way's campaign vice president, said
Purcell already had done most of the legwork for the campaign by
naming a top-rate cabinet and completing 52 out of his 55 CEO
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garrett said United Way hasn't yet figured out how the
campaign will make its $70 million goal, the most ambitious in its
history. But he has been encouraged by early returns. The campaign
will be launched Sept. 16, and the planned victory celebration is
Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his job change, Purcell also had to weather brain
surgery this summer. Calling it a simple operation, Purcell said he
has recovered and was given a clean bill of health by his
neurosurgeon this week.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Purcell has been transferred while in
the midst of important Atlanta civic roles.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Purcell was in line to be chairman of the
Atlanta Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, as well as chairman of the
Business Council of Georgia (now the Georgia Chamber of Commerce).
He had to give up those roles when he was transferred to Seattle by
KPMG-Peat Marwick. But when he returned to Atlanta, he became
chairman of the Georgia chamber.
</P>
<P>
   George Sands, who has been active with ACVB, will succeed
Purcell as managing partner of KPMG-Peat Marwick's Southeast
office.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hassebroek, Atlanta managing partner with Andersen
Consulting, will head the Atlanta United Way campaign in 1999 and
will be available to help Purcell with fund-raising this year.

DR. JONATHAN MAX MANN, PIONEER IN CAMPAIGN AGAINST AIDS, 51 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Max Mann, a pioneer in the international campaign
against AIDS and a founder of a movement to link health issues with
those of human rights, died Wednesday night alongside his wife, Dr.
Mary Lou Clements-Mann, a vaccine scientist at Johns Hopkins School
of Hygiene and Public Health University, in the crash of Swissair
Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia. He was 51 and lived in
Columbia Md.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and Dr. Clements were on their way to Geneva to attend a
series of global strategy sessions on AIDS, sponsored by the World
Health Organization and the United Nations. On Thursday, Gro Harlem
Brundtland, the former prime minister of Norway who is now the WHO
director general, led a memorial service attended by about 80
colleagues on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting tears, she said Mann ``was the kind of person who
changed the course of events by his dedication, conviction and
commitment. He had a burning engagement for human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann, who spent a good portion of his career at the Harvard
School of Public Health, came to international prominence in 1986
when he founded and became the first director of the WHO's Global
Program on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said he was unusual among public health officers
because he was both fierce and sensitive at the same time, and took
on great challenges with an apparent disregard for their
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan was the architect of the global mobilization against
AIDS,'' said Dr. Daniel Tarantola, a senior policy adviser for the
director general of WHO. ``He said many times that the way you
define a problem will determine what you do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
appeared uncontrollable and seemed to create a kind of political
paralysis among health officials around the world. ``Jonathan
determined to project an image of the epidemic that was one of a
disease that could be managed, could be controlled in some ways,''
Tarantola said. ``He defined the problem not only as a terrible
viral disease, but as a social problem to be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   He started the AIDS program with a single assistant and built it
over four years into the WHO's largest program in history,
employing 280 people and expending $109 annually in its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although mild-mannered, he could be a passionate speaker. In
1989, at an AIDS Action Committee dinner in Boston, he said: ``In
the last few years we have gained confidence that as individuals
and all together we are not condemned passively to allow the
disease AIDS or the fears and forces which it can unleash to
dominate us. Against AIDS we will prevail together, for we will
refuse to be split, or to cast into the shadows those persons,
groups and nations that are affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. June Osborne, who had worked with Mann throughout his career
and is president of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, which is
dedicated to improving medical education, said of him: ``He brought
the world together in a practical, unprecedented way. When he was
head of the Global Program, he had developed bilateral working
relations between the WHO and 155 countries around the world. He
got the developing countries to buy, for at least a time, the idea
that we really had a common cause _ to work on this deadly
epidemic.''

 &HT;    In Florida, Earl spares some, wallops others
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fl. _ Ben Simon watched the water rise early
Thursday toward his neat townhouse in the poorly named Gulf
Highlands Beach Resort, wondering if he should gather up his family
and run for high ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty minutes after it was at the edge of the door, it was a
foot deep in the house,'' said Simon, a husky man who has lived in
the 700-unit development for six years. ``I was really praying to
God that the rain would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon and dozens of his neighbors survived, but their homes in
the low-lying neighborhood just off the main tourist drag in this
resort town were perhaps Bay County's hardest-hit after Hurricane
Earl came calling with torrential rains and 80 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a mess,'' said Bob Wright, who retired here from
Americus, Ga. ``I'm guessing we've got 300 homes flooded in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Panama City Beach's tourist businesses, however, were
spared damage by the storm, although a few still had flooded
parking lots late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really was almost no damage at all,'' said Jayna Leach,
a spokeswoman for the area's convention and tourism bureau. ``We
were really lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials planned to start a crash radio advertising
campaign in key cities _ including Atlanta _ to tell visitors they
should not cancel their plans to visit during the Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the town showed the officials weren't exaggerating.
All along Thomas Drive and Front Beach Road, hotels, restaurants,
go-cart tracks, gift shops and carpet golf operations were open and
virtually untouched by Earl's fury.
</P>
<P>
   No trees down, no signs overturned, no windows blown out, not
even much sand in parking lots. Roofing shingles were still on the
roofs, instead of piled against walls and lining the streets.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from Hurricane Opal in 1995, which devastated
hundreds of beachfront buildings, leaving billions in damage.
</P>
<P>
   But Earl wasn't so gentle further east in Gulf, Franklin,
Wakulla and Taylor counties.
</P>
<P>
   While the storm side-swiped Panama City Beach, its winds staying
mostly side-shore, Earl's powerful eastern quadrant lashed the
low-lying counties south of Tallahassee for hours Wednesday night
with on-shore winds.
</P>
<P>
   The 80- to 100 mph gusts pushed up massive walls of water that
tore at beaches all along the region.
</P>
<P>
   The storm produced a surge estimated at 11 feet, Gov. Lawton
Chiles said, higher in many places than Opal's.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 people lost power, including all the residents of
St. George Island, another popular Atlanta vacation destination.
Waves overtopped the causeway on the bridge leading to the barrier
island, shutting off access until midday Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no detailed damage reports Thursday, but at least six
homes on St. George were hit by a tornado spun off from Earl's
tempest.
</P>
<P>
   The storm also capsized eight unlucky mariners, including six
fishermen on two boats based in Orange Beach, Ala., the Me-Too and
the Can-Too. The boats flipped in 16-foot seas about three miles
off Panama City during the height of the storm, with conditions so
bad the Coast Guard couldn't scramble rescue teams for 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six fishermen eventually were found, but two still
were missing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other men whose sailboat capsized managed to reach Shell
Island near Panama City, eventually swimming to the mainland near
Tyndall Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of other casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Earl's biggest impact in Panama City Beach was an estimated 23
inches of rain. Streets in several areas flooded, with the waters
swallowing parked cars and drowning out the engines of several
unwary motorists who tried fording the floods.
</P>
<P>
   A few parking lots at small motels were flooded, but the waters
had receded several feet by late Thursday, helped by fire trucks
that pumped the muddy liquid into the nearby Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At the Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort, a tunnel that carries guests
under Front Beach Road to a parking lot flooded, but crews were at
work and expected to finish well before the weekend crowds arrive.
The popular high-rise hotel suffered little other damage.
</P>
<P>
   At least two Georgia visitors didn't wait for Labor Day to see
the beach _ they drove down Wednesday night into the teeth of the
storm, just to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome watching the surf,'' said Donna Long, who drove
down from Cochran with her husband, William. ``I'd do it again in a

 UNDATED: deadly epidemic.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eventually, Mann's zeal on the issue brought him into conflict
with the WHO director general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, and in March
1990 Mann resigned in protest over the organization's failure to
move faster.
</P>
<P>
   Mann went on to raise the point that improved health care
methods, instruments and technology would not alone solve world
health issues. Instead, he said, many diseases and other health
problems are rooted in social issues like education and the status
of women and in the continuing violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, with funds and assistance from Albina du Boisrouvray,
whose son died while on a medical mission in Africa, founded and
became first director of the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for
Health and Human Rights at the Harvard University School of Public
Health. There, he founded the journal Health and Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   He also organized the first world conference on health and human
rights, held at Harvard in 1996. ``Jonathan was a critical player
in this new field,'' Tarantola said, ``bringing together two worlds
that had never spoken to each other _ the world of doctors and
scientists and medical officials, with the world of human rights
activists and lawyers. They had two completely different jargons,
and there was at first only cacophony. But now they speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Mann loved the role of founder. When
Allegheny University in Philadelphia asked him to become the dean
of a new school of public health, he seized it, beginning the
position in January.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Curran, dean of the Rollins School of Public Health at
Emory University in Atlanta, hired Mann on a Centers For Disease
Control project early in Mann's career. The job brought him to what
was then the African nation of Zaire and a hot spot of AIDS
research. to found a program in an atmosphere of suspicion and
hostility. Although the Project SIDA at first seemed to have little
chance of success it came to be regarded as the most innovative and
important center of AIDS research in Africa, until President Mobutu
Sese Seko dissolved it in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It was always safe for scientists and institutions to think of
AIDS as a virus, a transmissable infection, Curran said. But Mann
structured it ``as a human rights issue, and a global rights issue.
He really was a spiritual leader as well as a scientific leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In one line often remembered by colleagues, Mann said at the
World AIDS Summit meeting he had organized in London in 1988: ``We
live in a world threatened by unlimited destructive force, yet we
share a vision of creative potential... AIDS shows us once again
that silence, exclusion and isolation _of individuals, groups, or
nations _ creates a danger for us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann was born in Boston and grew up in Newton, Mass. His father,
the late James Mann, was a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, and
his mother, who still lives in Newton, Mass, was a librarian.
Jonathan Mann and earned a BA degree in history from Harvard
University, magna cum laude. He earned an MD from Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, then returned to the
Harvard School of Public Health for a master's degree in public
health. From 1975 to 1977, he worked for to the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta as an epidemic intelligence service officer.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New Mexico in 1977 to become state epidemiologist
and chief medical officer of the state Health Services Division,
where he remained until 1984.
</P>
<P>
   After his terms at Project SIDA and the Global Program on AIDS,
he returned to the Harvard School of Public Health, where he first
directed the International AIDS Center and then the Bagnoud Center
for Health and Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the editor of the influential two-volume work ``AIDS
in the World,'' which contains of scientific, practical and human
rights articles on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harvey Fineberg, provost of Harvard University and a
colleague of Mann, said that one of Mann's most characteristic
remarks combined both passion and invitation. ``He used to say to
us, `People say there is no use trying to change the world. But if
we don't try, will it change?' ''
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Marie-Paule Bondat, ended in divorce in
1996. Mann is survived by Ms. Bondat of Boston; their three
children, Naomi, Lydia, and Aaron; his mother, Ida, of Newton,
Mass.; two brothers, Gerald, an obstetrician in Northern
California, and Joshua, a rabbi in Israel; and a sister, Carol, a
rancher in Wyoming.

 &HT;    Earl tears through with floods, tornado
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hurricane Earl lashed the lower half of Georgia with as much as
nine inches of rain Thursday, spawned a tornado that injured five
people near Savannah, and made a bad year worse for many Georgia
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   One flood-prone Albany neighborhood with 60 to 70 residents was
ordered evacuated because water covered the streets and was surging
into a few homes.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were closed Thursday in many southwest Georgia counties,
and there were scattered power outages across the southern part of
the state. But anxious vacation hosts along the Florida panhandle,
normally jammed over the Labor Day weekend, said beaches were
clean, skies were beautiful and plenty of room was available.
</P>
<P>
   At last report Earl had been downgraded to a tropical storm,
with winds around 45 mph, and forecasters said it would continue to
weaken as it moved through Georgia and into South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In Screven County, five people were injured when a tornado hit a
house about 2 1/2 miles northwest of Sylvania at 11:30 a.m., Paul
Bryan, emergency management director for the county, told the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He said one child suffered a broken arm, but he didn't know the
extent of other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The twister also damaged 27 buildings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little area down from me with trailers. They're not
there anymore,'' said Judith Taylor, a 16-year resident of
Sylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homes were lifted up and dropped back down. But they didn't
come back down in the same place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastman, Dodge County Extension agent Duren Bell said at
midafternoon ``the rain has stopped but the wind has really picked
up.'' Rain gauges in the county, he said, registered from
nineinches in the north to above five in the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of open cotton that's being defoliated,'' he
said. ``This wind will blow it out of the bolls. Our nonirrigated
crops needed some rain. They didn't need nine inches. This is going
to take a poor year and make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Young of Carrollton, owner of Panama City Beach Rentals in
that Florida panhandle city, rushed to the coast Wednesday night,
fearing the worst.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday he said the sky over the panhandle beaches was
``absolutely beautiful, the prettiest I've seen all summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl caused minor damage to wooden stairs and dampened carpets
on some bottom-floor units, but there was no serious damage, Young
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``we've had a lot of cancellations'' among
Georgia and Alabama residents seeking a last few days on the
beaches over the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday, when we didn't know what was going to happen, there
wasn't much we could tell those people who called in, and a lot of
them canceled,'' he said. ``A few people have called back today and
rebooked, and we're trying to reach some of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he expects plenty of vacancies. His firm has 400
units for rent, he said, and ``we're hoping we'll hit 75 to 80
percent occupancy. I'd guess as a whole the beach occupancy rate
will be around 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, more than seven inches of rain, driven by 50 mph
winds, lashed Seminole County. Power lines and trees were felled in
Laurens County. Seven inches of rain washed out dirt roads in
Miller County and three vehicles were damaged when wind blew a
concrete wall down in Peach County.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of the flooded Albany neighborhood refused to
leave, complaining that the city had not improved flood control in
the neighborhood despite past floods, the wire service reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay right here until the city does what it's
supposed to do, cleaning out the drainage ditch and fixing the
pumps,'' said Don Brimer, 61, a retired postal worker. ``Every time
it rains, we get flooded.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Merton, Albany's public works director, said the storm
brought more water than the drainage system was designed to handle.
But all pumps were working fine Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few hours of this storm passing, the majority of our
flooding problems will go away,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river levels are down, so southwest Georgia may escape
severe flooding,'' said Georgia Emergency Management Agency
spokesman Buzz Weiss. ``We're preparing for the worst, because
we've had this experience before ... Alberto, our old friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Alberto stalled over southwest Georgia in 1994,
dumping 24 inches of rain in 24 hours and causing widespread
flooding around the Flint River. It was the state's worst natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In March, about 11,000 Albany area residents fled their homes
when the Flint rose over its banks again.
</P>
<P>
   John Feldt, hydrologist in charge of the Southeast River
Forecast Center in Peachtree City, said Earl is not expected to
cause serious flooding in Georgia unless it stalls the way Alberto
did.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN-ORIENTED TOUR OF TEXAS TOUCHES ON A SPICY MUSICAL
GUMBO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Doo-doo-dee-doo-dee-ooh-doo-dee-ooh-doo ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Strains of the score from the hit movie ``The Sting'' plink from
a player piano in your mind as you view the Scott Joplin mural
adorning a wall at Third and Main streets in downtown Texarkana.
</P>
<P>
   Joplin, the composer called the Father of Ragtime Music, is
arguably Texarkana's most famous native son. His rival for that
distinction is Dallas billionaire Ross Perot _ and, in fact, the
Perot Theater is not far from the Joplin mural.
</P>
<P>
   The Texarkana Historical Museum at 219 State Line Ave. features
a permanent Scott Joplin exhibit. It includes the square grand
piano on which Joplin is reputed to have learned to play, along
with sheet music, recordings and other Joplin memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which is open 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday through
Saturday, recently held a Scott Joplin portrait contest, and the
entries are still on display there. For more information about the
Joplin exhibit and other material relating to African-Americans of
the region, call (903) 793-4831.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that an African-American-oriented tour of Texas
should commence with Texarkana, which dubs itself the ``Gateway to
the Southwest.'' It must be pointed out, however, that such a tour
should occur in conjunction with a trip for some other purpose.
Most Texas cities have not yet devoted as much attention as
Texarkana has to the African-American elements of their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, you happen to be in Marshall, it would be
worthwhile to drop by the campus of historic Wiley College. Wiley
is the alma mater of civil rights leader James Farmer, whose father
was a prominent faculty member there. When Wiley opened in 1873, it
was the first black college chartered by the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   To hop deep into the heart of African-American Texas, you should
definitely journey to the Beaumont-Port Arthur area along the
Southeast coast. African-Americans have profoundly flavored the
music, art and diet of the region. Beaumont's home county of
Jefferson is 32 percent African-American, the highest such racial
concentration in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The main campus of Lamar University in Beaumont is on Martin
Luther King Parkway in the southeastern part of the city. The Babe
Zaharias Museum, which houses Beaumont's visitor information
center, is also located on that street.
</P>
<P>
   In Beaumont, the most festive event for African-Americans is
Juneteeth (June 19), the day in 1865 when Gen. Gordon Granger
delivered the belated news of the Emancipation Proclamation to
Texas slaves in Galveston. City-sponsored events blend gospel,
rhythm and blues, and zydeco music. Cajun and creole food,
including the rice and pork sausage mixture called ``boudin,'' is
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Houston boasts the mother of all Juneteenth celebrations. It's a
two-part event. The first part consists of the Juneteenth USA
Gospel Festival and the Juneteenth Blues Festival at Miller Outdoor
Theater on the weekend preceding Juneteenth. The second part, which
occurs on the nearest weekend to the actual emancipation
announcement date, is a National Emancipation Association-sponsored
Juneteenth Freedom Festival at the same location.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans will find two Houston museums particularly
interesting _ The Menil Collection, at 1515 Sul Ross in the Museum
District, and the Contemporary Arts Museum, at 5216 Montrose Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   Currently through Oct. 11, the Menil is featuring ``In and Out:
Native, Folk and Self-Taught Artists,'' an exhibit gleaned from its
permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Contemporary displays through Sept. 20 ``Face of the Gods:
Art and Altars of Africa and the African Americas,'' a spectacular
traveling exhibition from the Museum of African Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Moving northward, any Afro-Texas tour must pause in the state
capitol to visit the George Washington Carver Museum. It occupies a
1927-vintage, 1,800-square-foot frame building that once served as
the Austin Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1979, the museum, at 1165 Angelina St., was the
first neighborhood black history museum opened in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One of the real gems of the Afro-Texas tour is farther north in
Dallas. The Museum of African-American Life and Culture, at 1620
First Ave. in Fair Park, was established in 1974. It offers African
art and sculpture in addition to exhibits pertaining to
African-American history.
</P>
<P>
   The building makes a symbolic architectural statement. It is
designed to resemble an African cross.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles west in Fort Worth, the jazz aficionado can usually
find something to savor at the Caravan of Dreams, a combination
nightclub, museum, botanical garden and little theater at 3112
Houston St. near Sundance Square. Huge murals in the nightclub
portray the evolution of jazz from the arrival of its early stages
via slaves to its eventual acceptance as an important musical
genre.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Jubilee Theater, at 506 Main St. in Sundance
Square, is another Afro-Texas jewel. The black ensemble offers
polished productions of mainly musical comedy. Many of its programs
are original works.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth, of course, is noted for its cattle culture heritage.
African-American cowboys figured prominently in its history. They
are represented symbolically by a large bronze statue in the
Stockyards tourist area depicting fabled black cowboy Bill Pickett
bulldogging a longhorn steer.
</P>
<P>
   Heading West out of Fort Worth, the seeker of Texas'
African-American historical and cultural treasures should make a
brief stop in Weatherford to visit the City Greenwood Cemetery. In
that historic burial place, you will find the graves of famous
cattleman Oliver Loving and his African-American sidekick, Bose
Ikard. The black cowboy rode with Loving and Charles Goodnight on
many perilous trail drives. The characters Gus and Captain Call in
Larry McMurtry's novel ``Lonesome Dove'' are based upon Loving and
Goodnight. Ikard was the real-life model for fictional Josh Deets.
</P>
<P>
   San Angelo owes its existence to Fort Concho, one of several
military posts in West Texas staffed in large measure by Buffalo
Soldiers, troops of the African-American 9th and 10th Cavalry and
the 24th and 25th Infantry.
</P>
<P>
   The men of those units engaged in heavy fighting against the
Apache, Comanche and other hostile tribes during the pacification
campaigns of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   San Angelinos have been restoring the fort for nearly 40 years.
Located between Burgess Street and Avenues C and D, Fort Concho has
become one the area's most popular tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   A special exhibit in the fort's Visitor Center honors the
Buffalo Solders, who constructed most of its original buildings.
Local Buffalo Soldier re-enactors also put on demonstrations at the
fort.
</P>
<P>
   Among other existing West Texas forts where Buffalo Soldiers
were posted are Fort Davis National Historic Site in the Big Bend
area, Fort Stockton in the city of the same name that grew up
around it, Fort Richardson State Historic Site near Jacksboro and
Fort Clark in Brackettville.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Clark was the primary post of the heroic detachment of
Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. The scouts were African-Americans
whose ancestors originally intermarried with the Seminole Indians
in Florida. They escaped to Texas and Mexico when the Seminoles
were forced to migrate to the Indian territories in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Seminole Negro scouts won the Medal of Honor
fighting for the U.S. Cavalry in campaigns against the Comanche and
Apache. Several of these Medal of Honor winners are buried in the
tribal cemetery in Brackettville.
</P>
<P>
   No Afro-Texas tour could conclude without a stop in San Antonio.
One of the venues that must be visited in the Alamo city is the
Institute of Texan Cultures in HemisFair Park. It includes a
variety of exhibits pertaining to 26 Texas ethnic and cultural
groups, including African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And in case you drop by Sea World while in San Antonio, it would
be well to take note of a life-size figure on the Famous Texans
Walk _ a statue of (''doo doo dee doo dee doo ... '') Scott Joplin.

SWISSAIR DISASTER PLAN KEEPS STRESS TO A MINUMUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under a plan filed three months ago with US
transportation authorities, Swissair officials promised to set up a
toll-free hotline for concerned relatives in the event of a major
air disaster, swiftly compile a detailed passenger list and even
erect a monument to the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Chillingly, the airline was forced to put that plan into action
Thursday following the crash of Flight 111 in Nova Scotia. Disaster
officials said the plan, which was required by a new federal law,
enabled Swissair and its partner airline, Delta, to avoid the
pitfalls experienced by TWA during its awkward handling of the
Flight 800 crash off Long Island in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no comparison,'' said Jerry Hauer, who heads New York
mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's office of emergency management. ``The
Swissair and Delta folks have done a really wonderful job in
mobilizing their forces. They were clearly prepared to deal with
this. They had plans in place, they knew what they needed to do and
they went out and did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Giuliani led critics who said TWA caused
additional anguish by failing to provide key information to the
families of Flight 800. The airline, for example, was unable to
produce an accurate passenger list until late the following day,
causing scores of panicked and confused relatives to descend on an
ad-hoc command post at the Ramada Plaza hotel outside John F.
Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the scene was calm Thursday at the same Ramada,
where Giuliani and Red Cross crisis specialists spent the night
counseling a handful of families. Many relatives decided to stay
away from the airport because they already were getting information
from hundreds of operators provided by Swissair and Delta over a
toll-free number (1-800-801-0088). Swissair issued four press
releases Thursday and set up an emergency website on internet. It
also offered $20,000 to the family of each passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The hotline was outlined as part of a seven-page Airline Family
Assistance Plan that Swissair filed June 11 with the Transportation
Department and the National Transportation Safety Board. The
airline was required to file the plan under the Aviation Disaster
Family Assistance Act of 1996, which Congress passed following the
criticism surrounding TWA 800.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims of TWA 800 helped write the
legislation. It was extended to foreign carriers such as Swissair
last year. The DOT said nearly 98 percent of all carriers operating
in the US have complied with the law, which also helps coordinate
communication between the airlines and various government agencies
following a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Starting October 1, in an effort to speed up communication even
further, the DOT will require airlines to collect not only the full
names of every American passenger but also a contact name and phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be anything like TWA 800 again,'' said a
senior Department of Transportation official.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tuesday's crash occurred outside the United States,
Swissair was not legally required to implement its Family
Assistance Plan. However, its actions indicated that it had
immediately put the plan into action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which was released by Transporation Department
officials, Swissair promised to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Establish a toll-free number dedicated to accident-related
calls within one hour after its Operation Control Center has
received information indicating that an aircraft operated by the
airline has been involved in a major incident and that there are
serious injuries and/or fatalties.
</P>
<P>
   -- Upon request of the National Transportation Safety Board,
provide a list of the names of the passengers who boarded the
aircraft to the NTSB Director of Family Support Services designated
for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   -- Activate a Family Assistance Center to notify the next of kin
of passengers involved in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   -- Provide next of kin with reasonable care, accommodation and
transporation.
</P>
<P>
   -- If the families express a desire for a monument at the
accident site...consult with the family of each passenger about its
construction, including any inscription.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight Thursday, nearly 100 Delta agents were stationed
inside Terminal 3 at JFK. The agents directed about five families
who showed up during the night to the Ramada, where they received
immediate counseling. The toll-free number for relatives was
activated shortly after. Meanwhile, NTSB and Swissair officials
communicated constantly over a separate 24-hour emergency telephone
line that had already been put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Swissair provided an accurate passenger list to
the State Department and local officials by 3 a.m. The State
Department immediately was able to contact US consulates in
Switzerland and Canada. The airline immediately dispatched
President and CEO Jeffrey Katz to Halifax with an emergency
response team that arrived early Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the men and women of Swissair, I wish to extend
our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those on
board,'' Walter Vollenweider, the company's vice president, said at
JFK. ``Our thoughts and prayers are with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (the airlines) are trying to make this process as least
painful as possible,'' said Shelly Auster, a spokesman for the
American Red Cross. ``You don't want to leave anyone in the dark.
The family members are the most important people here, and you want
to do everything you can to make a tragic situation less
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauer, the mayor's director of emergency services, Giuliani
``talked with many of the families. We are not hearing the same
issues that we did two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get out in front of these things and respond
to the needs of the families,'' he said. ``Being in a state of
suspended animation, not knowing if a loved one is on a flight, it
adds to the pain and the longer that goes on the more painful it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives who did come to the airport Thursday were escorted in
and out of the Ramada by police to avoid the swell of media that
had gather around the hotel.

   ESCAPING-LA (Los Angeles) _ A record number of Southern
Californians will hit the road this Labor Day weekend to celebrate
summer's last big hurrah. ``There's definitely more driving than
flying,'' said Randy Miller, a travel agent supervisor at AAA.

   LA-DWP-BILLS (Los Angeles) _ Today it's the heat and humidity.
Next month it will be sticker shock. That's when residents will

running of air conditioners and fans along with increased water
usage to keep pools filled and lawns and gardens irrigated. ``It's
hard to say for sure, but we expect customers will be paying about
15 percent more than last year at this time,'' said Steve Hansen of

CANSECO ADMIRES MCGWIRE'S HITTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Once, Jose Canseco shared equal billing with Mark
McGwire. No more. No matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire to me is the most dominating power hitter
baseball has seen, and will ever see, in your lifetime and maybe
your children's lifetime,'' Canseco said Thursday before the
Toronto Blue Jays played the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco said he predicted two months ago that McGwire would
finish with 68 home runs, shattering Roger Maris's home run record
of 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Sammy (Sosa), this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime
thing,'' said Canseco, noting that as aggressive hitters who chase
pitches out of the strike zone, he and Sosa are much alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has a shot at the record every year. You guys don't
understand. Mark McGwire is huge. The man has 22-inch forearms. Any
other man, that's a bodybuilder's arm. His forearms are twice as
big as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco came into Thursday night's game with 37 home runs. His
personal best is 44, in 1991. Back and hamstring injuries have
restricted him, but Canseco said the biggest difference between
himself and McGwire, once his fellow Bash Brother in Oakland, is
McGwire's selectivity at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a tremendous eye,'' Canseco said. ``He has a
high-average-type eye and puts a swing on the ball. He has what you
call smooth power, smooth torque. Beyond everything, his eye and
technique are perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco said that when he was with the Red Sox in 1995 and the
A's came to town, he noted that McGwire was on a hot streak and
warned Boston pitchers to work around him. I said, `He's going to
eat you guys alive,''' Canseco said. ``They said, `Oh, I think I
can get him out.' I think he hit four home runs in three days.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit three in one game against Red Sox pitcher Zane
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco said that when McGwire breaks the record, he plans to
call him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get ahold of him,'' he said. ``To me, he's my idol. When
he breaks it, he's going to break down and cry.''

SWISSAIR DISASTER PLAN KEEPS STRESS TO A MINUMUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under a plan filed three months ago with US
transportation authorities, Swissair officials promised to set up a
toll-free hotline for concerned relatives in the event of a major
air disaster, swiftly compile a detailed passenger list and even
erect a monument to the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Chillingly, the airline was forced to put that plan into action
Thursday following the crash of Flight 111 in Nova Scotia. Disaster
officials said the plan, which was required by a new federal law,
enabled Swissair and its partner airline, Delta, to avoid the
pitfalls experienced by TWA during its awkward handling of the
Flight 800 crash off Long Island in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no comparison,'' said Jerry Hauer, who heads New York
mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's office of emergency management. ``The
Swissair and Delta folks have done a really wonderful job in
mobilizing their forces. They were clearly prepared to deal with
this. They had plans in place, they knew what they needed to do and
they went out and did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Giuliani led critics who said TWA caused
additional anguish by failing to provide key information to the
families of Flight 800. The airline, for example, was unable to
produce an accurate passenger list until late the following day,
causing scores of panicked and confused relatives to descend on an
ad-hoc command post at the Ramada Plaza hotel outside John F.
Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the scene was calm Thursday at the same Ramada,
where Giuliani and Red Cross crisis specialists spent the night
counseling a handful of families. Many relatives decided to stay
away from the airport because they already were getting information
from hundreds of operators provided by Swissair and Delta over a
toll-free number (1-800-801-0088). Swissair issued four press
releases Thursday and set up an emergency website on internet. It
also offered $20,000 to the family of each passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The hotline was outlined as part of a seven-page Airline Family
Assistance Plan that Swissair filed June 11 with the Transportation
Department and the National Transportation Safety Board. The
airline was required to file the plan under the Aviation Disaster
Family Assistance Act of 1996, which Congress passed following the
criticism surrounding TWA 800.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims of TWA 800 helped write the
legislation. It was extended to foreign carriers such as Swissair
last year. The DOT said nearly 98 percent of all carriers operating
in the US have complied with the law, which also helps coordinate
communication between the airlines and various government agencies
following a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Starting October 1, in an effort to speed up communication even
further, the DOT will require airlines to collect not only the full
names of every American passenger but also a contact name and phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be anything like TWA 800 again,'' said a
senior Department of Transportation official.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tuesday's crash occurred outside the United States,
Swissair was not legally required to implement its Family
Assistance Plan. However, its actions indicated that it had
immediately put the plan into action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which was released by Transporation Department
officials, Swissair promised to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Establish a toll-free number dedicated to accident-related
calls within one hour after its Operation Control Center has
received information indicating that an aircraft operated by the
airline has been involved in a major incident and that there are
serious injuries and/or fatalties.
</P>
<P>
   -- Upon request of the National Transportation Safety Board,
provide a list of the names of the passengers who boarded the
aircraft to the NTSB Director of Family Support Services designated
for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   -- Activate a Family Assistance Center to notify the next of kin
of passengers involved in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   -- Provide next of kin with reasonable care, accommodation and
transporation.
</P>
<P>
   -- If the families express a desire for a monument at the
accident site...consult with the family of each passenger about its
construction, including any inscription.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight Thursday, nearly 100 Delta agents were stationed
inside Terminal 3 at JFK. The agents directed about five families
who showed up during the night to the Ramada, where they received
immediate counseling. The toll-free number for relatives was
activated shortly after. Meanwhile, NTSB and Swissair officials
communicated constantly over a separate 24-hour emergency telephone
line that had already been put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Swissair provided an accurate passenger list to
the State Department and local officials by 3 a.m. The State
Department immediately was able to contact US consulates in
Switzerland and Canada. The airline immediately dispatched
President and CEO Jeffrey Katz to Halifax with an emergency
response team that arrived early Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the men and women of Swissair, I wish to extend
our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those on
board,'' Walter Vollenweider, the company's vice president, said at
JFK. ``Our thoughts and prayers are with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (the airlines) are trying to make this process as least
painful as possible,'' said Shelly Auster, a spokesman for the
American Red Cross. ``You don't want to leave anyone in the dark.
The family members are the most important people here, and you want
to do everything you can to make a tragic situation less
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauer, the mayor's director of emergency services, Giuliani
``talked with many of the families. We are not hearing the same
issues that we did two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get out in front of these things and respond
to the needs of the families,'' he said. ``Being in a state of
suspended animation, not knowing if a loved one is on a flight, it
adds to the pain and the longer that goes on the more painful it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives who did come to the airport Thursday were escorted in
and out of the Ramada by police to avoid the swell of media that
had gather around the hotel.

STOCKS HEAD LOWER AS NERVOUSNESS CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices headed broadly lower Thursday as
investors continued to show nervousness about the effects of a
possible global economic slowdown on the profits of American
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of financial and transportation companies, which would be
among the companies hurt worst by a decline in global business
activity, fell most sharply in a volatile day of trading. Also
posting losses were companies like Coca-Cola, Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Gillette, which get large percentages of their income from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 100.15 points, or 1.3
percent, to 7,682.22. It was the sixth loss in seven days in the
Dow industrials, and other market indexes followed the Dow lower.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 8.21 points, or slightly less
than 1 percent, to 982.26, while the Nasdaq composite index
declined 20.99, or 1.3 percent, to 1571.86.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in American stocks followed further losses in
European markets, where the fallout from the financial instability
in Russia, including further declines in the value of the ruble,
dragged down share prices. Germany's most-watched stock market
index fell more than 3 percent, while the Financial Times Stock
Exchange index in London fell 2.2 percent, closing below the level
where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in the economies of Asia and, more recently,
Russia, have led many American analysts to cut their estimates of
corporate earnings here. Chuck Hill, director of research for First
Call, which tracks earnings estimates, said Thursday that analysts'
estimates of growth in 1998 operating earnings for the companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 index had declined to 5.3 percent in recent days, from
a previous level of 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, estimates of third-quarter profit growth
has plunged to 2.1 percent from 10 percent. In addition, Hill said,
many analysts are still predicting that fourth-quarter profits will
rise more than 10 percent. He expects those forecasts to be revised
downward, causing overall profit estimates to fall as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the last half hour of trading again proved to be
the most volatile part of the day. But where stock prices had been
falling sharply in the final minutes of trading in several previous
sessions, the Dow moved higher Thursday as the blue chips cut their
losses in half in the last 30 minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   While some of those sharp swings come from the implementation of
sophisticated trading strategies, traders attributed the late-day
gain Thursday to positive comments about the strength of the
American economy by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Rubin is
scheduled to meet Friday with the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan
Greenspan, and the Japanese finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, traders will be watching the August employment
data, which they hope will give some hint whether the domestic
economy has begun to feel any effects from the year-old Asian
malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the worries in the price of cyclical stocks, the
transportation stocks and shares of plain old-fashioned industrial
companies,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``People are concerned about a possible
downturn in the U.S. that would have been Asian-induced. I think
people are going to be very concerned if they see a jump in
unemployment.'' Analysts generally expect the unemployment rate to
remain steady at 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As such, investors are likely to see continued volatility in the
stock market, ``as long as everybody is focused on daily economic
numbers,'' said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for John
Hancock Funds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shares of bank and financial-service companies continued to take
a pounding Thursday as investors reacted to disclosures of losses
by many of the big banks. Citicorp fell 9 15/16 to 98 13/16, Chase
Manhattan slumped $5.625 to $49.25, American Express lost $6.75 to
$77 and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell $5.375 to $53.625.
</P>
<P>
   Also losing ground Thursday were the economically sensitive
transportation stocks, which include airline and trucking
companies. Ryder Systems fell 3 15/16 to $20. Shares of airline
companies fell across the board, with Delta Air Lines slipping
$3.125 to $58.75.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between this year's stock market turmoil and past
periods of volatility, like those in 1987 or 1990, stock traders
say, is that they now have a far harder time gauging the mood of
the market from day to day and minute to minute.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Molnar, a managing director in the retail sales and
trading operations of Salomon Smith Barney, said that as his firm's
trading operations have become more computerized, the volume of
background noise in the trading room has become far less reliable
as an indicator of market swings.
</P>
<P>
   Where a decade ago traders spent much of their day shouting
orders across the floor, today they spend more time punching
buttons on computer terminals. ``If you want to measure the
psychology of the market, you have to watch an individual stock,''
Molnar said.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar, who in 1987 worked at Lehman Brothers, says that in
times like this, sentiment can be as crucial as some fundamental
measures of value. Referring to the famed proponents of the
objective method of investing based on a company's underlying
value, he said: ``If the market is going to snap back 100 points,
that's not Graham and Dodd. That's sentiment.''

   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno is considering whether
to open a third preliminary inquiry related to President Clinton's
1996 re-election campaign, and this time the target could be the
president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials confirmed Thursday that Reno last
month ordered a fresh examination of so-called issue advertisements
and whether Clinton and his re-election team used them to get
around campaign spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference, Reno acknowledged that she was
examining information related to campaign fund raising recently
received by the department. She declined to describe the
information, say where it came from or who she is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we have new information that I cannot comment
on,'' said Reno, who for 18 months has been pilloried by
Republicans for refusing to allow an independent counsel to
investigate how Democrats financed Clinton's 1996 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg confirmed that the
department is investigating issue advocacy ads _ which were used by
both political parties during the 1996 presidential campaign _ but
he would not say whether the agency's review focuses on Clinton,
his campaign or the Democratic Party, or whether it might include
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Reno is likely to decide next week if there is
sufficient credible information to formally begin a 90-day,
preliminary investigation of issue ads and the 1996 campaign, an
inquiry that could lead to the appointment of an independent
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, met with
Justice Department officials Wednesday to argue that no further
investigation was necessary. Kendall reportedly told Justice
officials that, if a formal inquiry was begun, it should focus on
the 1996 campaign organization, not the president. Kendall could
not be reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno recently initiated separate, 90-day preliminary
investigations into whether Vice President Al Gore misled
investigators and whether former White House deputy chief of staff
Harold Ickes lied under oath when they were questioned about their
fund-raising roles during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary investigations of Gore and Ickes were disclosed
over the past 10 days after Reno completed an initial review _
similar to the one she currently is conducting on the use of issue
ads _ and notified a three-judge panel that oversees the
appointment of independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent line of inquiry involves whether Clinton evaded
federal campaign spending limits by orchestrating the televised
issue-ad campaigns financed by the Democratic Party and organized
labor. The Clinton-Gore campaign agreed to limit its spending to
$37 million during the 1996 primary election in return for federal
financing during the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission reportedly turned over
information to the Justice Department from an audit being conducted
of Clinton-Gore campaign practices The Wall Street Journal quoted
anonymous sources saying FEC auditors suggest the president and key
campaign advisers were so closely involved in creating the issue-ad
campaign that the ad costs should be counted against the spending
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insisted that Clinton did nothing wrong. ``The
use of issue ads was entirely legal and appropriate,'' said White
House spokesman James Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were designed to alert voters to the Democrats' defense
of Medicare and other social programs in 1995, when they were
targeted by Republicans wanting to reduce federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were cleared by legal counsel. There was no violation of
campaign spending limits,'' Kennedy said. ``We are confident that
at the end of its review the Justice Department will arrive at a
fair conclusion based on the facts and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno dismissed assertions that the Gore and Ickes inquiries were
indications that she is yielding to pressure from Republicans. The
attorney general pointed out that she has asked the three-judge
panel to name seven independent counsels to investigate allegations
of wrong-doing involving various administration officials,
including the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I will continually look to new information
that comes along, new arguments that are raised, anything that will
support implementation of the law,'' Reno said. ``But I'm going to
do it free of political pressure, based on what I think is right
and call it like I see it.''

LONG BALL REVIVES THE NATIONAL PASTIME _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Pastime is back. Four years after a strike canceled
the World Series and put major league baseball on the path to
oblivion, the game has been revived by a succession of stunning
performances, specifically Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa's
season-long assault on one of the game's most cherished records.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting four monstrous home runs in two nights in Miami,
Cardinals slugger McGwire goes into tonight's game in St. Louis
with 59 homers. Only Babe Ruth (60 in '27) and Roger Maris (61 in
'61) ever hit more. McGwire has 23 games left in which to hit three
home runs and guarantee immortality.
</P>
<P>
   And so America's summer of stock market woes, ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' and a devil in a blue dress also goes down in the books as
the Summer of the Home Run. Like a favorite son returning from a
stint overseas in the Peace Corps, baseball has come home to remind
us of what was great about the game in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the home run chase has made a stunning
contribution to bringing the focus back on the field,'' says
baseball commissioner Bud Selig, the man who announced cancellation
of the World Series in 1994. ``It's fascinating. It's why this is
still the greatest game in the world. No other sport reaches people
and captivates the nation the way baseball can.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide attendance is up 3.2 percent and major league
baseball could draw in excess of 70 million fans and wipe out the
attendance record set in 1993 _ one year before the strike. Last
Sunday night's ESPN game, featuring McGwire and the Cardinals, was
the network's second-highest-rated baseball telecast ever, topped
only by Cal Ripken's consecutive-game record-breaker of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the feats of McGwire and Sosa, baseball in 1998
has a New York Yankee team threatening to break the record for wins
(116 by the 1906 Cubs) in a season. There's also been a perfect
game by Yankee lefthander David Wells, a run on Hack Wilson's
68-year-old RBI record (190), and an influx of new superstars,
including Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, fans are ecstatic about the unexpected rise of
the Red Sox and the possibility of a seven-game playoff series with
the Yankees in October. The trendy Patriots open their season
Monday night against the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, but
fans suddenly are talkin' baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on home runs. Everyone loves the long ball. The summer
of '98 has created a national obsession with the home run chase.
Baseball hasn't had any real pennant races and the games have
become secondary to the inning-by-inning updates of McGwire and
Sosa's respective performances. ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' usually
leads the hour with news of the home run chase, and most newspapers
in the land have devised their own graphic to keep fans up to date
on the march toward Maris. ESPN added Friday night's Cardinals-Reds
game to its lineup, and Fox TV picked up Saturday's game in St.
Louis and had it converted from a night game to a matinee.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time baseball has been bailed out by
tape-measure shots. In 1919, eight members of the Chicago White Sox
were involved in a conspiracy to throw the World Series against
Cincinnati. The ``Black Sox'' scandal threatened to ruin major
league baseball, but the game was saved in part when the
larger-than-life Ruth hit 54 homers in 1920 and 59 in '21 to put
the focus back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   When Maris _ considered a party-crasher in the pantheon of
baseball greats _ hit 61 homers, baseball, and New York in
particular, was still reeling from the relocation of the Dodgers
and Giants to the West Coast. Expansion had watered down the
product, and purists were horrified when the traditional 154-game
season was expanded by eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have McGwire, the red-haired mastodon, hitting a home run
once every eight trips to the plate. This is his third consecutive
season with 50 or more homers (breaking Ruth's record), and he's
been joined by Sosa, a relatively unknown slugger from the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been months of expectation and anticipation
about the quest for 62, few baseball experts believed any player
would be this close with so much time remaining in the season.
McGwire is a whopping six homers ahead of where Maris was after the
same number of games in 1961. Maris did not hit No. 61 until the
final day of the season (against Red Sox righthander Tracy
Stallard). Maris staggered late in the '61 season and lost clumps
of hair from worry. McGwire has practically thrown off all the
pressure. It's no longer a question of ``Can he do it?'' It's
``When can he do it?'' And how many for the Cubs' Sosa, who is at
56 with 22 games left?
</P>
<P>
   The only controversy touching McGwire involves his use of
androstenedione, a naturally occurring steriod sold over the
counter and allowed by major league baseball. McGwire says he takes
``andro'' as a dietary supplement to help him train harder and
recover faster. It is banned by the NFL, the NCAA, and the
International Olympic Committee. Critics have complained that the
Cardinal slugger is sending the wrong message to aspiring young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy seems to come with the territory. When Maris hit his
61st in New York's 162d game, it was considered tainted because the
new schedule was eight games longer than Ruth's campaign in 1927.
Maris's record was listed with an asterisk until 1991, when former
commissioner Fay Vincent erased the black mark and crowned Maris
the undisputed home run champ. McGwire has a chance to wipe out all
the records long before he gets to 154 games.
</P>
<P>
   More than any sport, baseball is about numbers: 714 was Ruth's
seemingly unassailable career home run total, which was surpassed
by Henry Aaron (who finished with 755) in 1974. It was also assumed
that Lou Gehrig's streak of playing in 2,130 consecutive games
could never be matched, but that was before Ripken (2,617 and
counting) came along. Ted Williams (.406 in 1941) is baseball's
last .400 hitter, and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak remains
intact. But Maris's 61 in '61 is going to fall, and everyone, even
the ballplayers, seems happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of the best-selling
``Wait 'Til Next Year,'' says, ``The nicest part is when you see
the other players' awe toward these guys. Usually, they are such
individuals, only worrying about themselves, but in so many of
these stories, you see Sosa giving McGwire credit and the great
Garciaparra talking about it. They must feel it's good for the
whole game. You somehow feel it's a band of brothers, which makes
you feel a sense of them all being together as professionals and
belonging to something that is larger than themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Major league pitchers are part of the story. Stallard became a
trivia answer when he yielded Maris's 61st homer, and the man who
surrenders No. 62 to McGwire faces a lifetime of infamy. Most
pitchers say they'll challenge McGwire and Sosa. They don't want to
give up the record-breaking homer, but they don't want to issue a
walk and appear cowardly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the seamy issue of 1990s memorabilia madness. In
1961, when Maris hit No. 61, the ball was caught by Sal Durante, a
teenager from Coney Island, who gave it to Maris, posed for a few
pictures, and was rewarded with a $5,000 check from a Sacramento
restaurateur. It's been estimated that the home run ball that
breaks Maris's record could fetch seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe in the larger forces _ and the church of
baseball has many disciples of superstition _ take note that Maris
broke Ruth's record 13 years after the Babe died in 1948. Roger
Maris died in 1985. Thirteen years ago.

SOCIAL DEMOCRATS TURN TO SCHROEDER IN YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO OUST
KOHL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ Gerhard Schroeder has changed with the times.
</P>
<P>
   He first made his name in German politics in the 1970s as leader
of the Jusos, the radical, stridently anti-American, anti-nuclear
youth group of the Social Democratic Party. In 1981, in his maiden
speech in parliament, he became the first person ever to speak
there without wearing a necktie. Late one beer-fueled night,
according to an often-told story, he stopped by to rattle the gates
of the Chancellery, and to shout, ``I want in there!''
</P>
<P>
   But the higher he rose and the older he got, the less
rambunctious he became. He grew to admire the United States, he
says. As prime minister of Germany's second largest and third most
populous state for the last eight years, he has been the consummate
pragmatist, cooperating with or disregarding the left-wing party
hierarchy according to his purposes. He not only started wearing
neckties, he took to smoking fine Havana cigars and sporting
clothes designed by Armani.
</P>
<P>
   He got so chummy with business executives that trade unionists
and other ideological stalwarts in his party started mocking him as
``der Genosse von Bossen'' _ the comrade of the bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Social Democrats, who have failed three times to oust
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, have turned to Gerhard Schroeder to do the
job in a national election on Sept. 27. Handsome, telegenic, a
ferocious worker, Schroeder, 54, is almost a generation younger
than Kohl, 68. Not by accident, he is running a media-savvy
campaign as ambiguous and devoid of specifics as those that brought
Tony Blair and Bill Clinton to power in Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder must grapple with the problem that has confronted
left-wing politicians throughout Europe as well as the Democrats in
the United States: big government has become too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the huge expenditures in eastern Germany after
reunification, partly because of the competition with countries
that have learned to live with less, Germany can no longer afford
the restrictive labor laws, ample pensions and generous health care
system with which Schroeder's party has been identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more West German island,'' said a Western diplomat
here. ``Germany has to live by the same rules as the rest of us,
which means cutting back. That's the real dilemma for Schroeder and
his party.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory would make Schroeder one of Europe's most powerful
men, standing at the helm of the continent's dominant economic and
political power. It would also constitute an unprecedented
accomplishment in modern German history; no sitting chancellor has
been defeated by a candidate of another party since the federal
republic was established in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The polls put him ahead, but only by a slender margin, with a
sizable undecided vote. Germany is accustomed to a more
carniverous, less image-oriented politics, with plenty of
ideological meat to chew on, and people are starting to grumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't quite get hold of him,'' said Josef Joffe, editorial
page editor of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich, one of the
country's major newspapers. top ``He was given the nod very
grudgingly by the party bosses, who stand well to his left, because
they were convinced he was the only one with a chance to win. So he
tries to placate the left wing of his party and to win over the
swing voters at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He obfuscates, prevaricates and says as little as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Naumann, the German-born New York publisher whom
Schroeder has recruited as a potential culture minister, takes a
different view. He sees Schroeder as a man who has the capacity to
answer a national craving, ``to fill this big psychological hole at
the center of German life, the need to define what we live for in
the midst of our amazing material well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he has a fresh face. Kohl has been chancellor for 16
years, as long as Franklin D. Roosevelt would have served as
president had he not died in office. Schroeder has apparently
concluded that the electorate is tired of Kohl but resistant to a
major deviation from his policies. So he talks, in pure Clintonese,
of ``a New Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, on the day before he announced his party's
election program, Schroeder sat down for an interview at the
party's striking steel-and-glass headquarters, Willy Brandt Haus,
in the heart of the new Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The welfare state has reached its limits,'' he said, sitting
at a table covered with the detritus typical of campaigns
everywhere _ half-eaten sandwiches and empty coffee cups. ``We
won't be able to increase payments.''
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear the echo of Bill Clinton's voice
proclaiming the era of big government over.
</P>
<P>
   But like generations of liberal politicians eager to sound a
note of fiscal responsibility, Schroeder insisted that by closing
``a labyrinth of tax loopholes,'' he could roll back the small
welfare cuts made by Kohl and still cut income taxes. ``It's not
that much of a riddle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An engaging man with a large head, boldly cut jaw and beefy
body, Schroeder spoke quietly but gestured vigorously with his
squarish hands, waving a pair of half-moon spectacles as he talked.
His eyes are his most notable feature _ ice blue under fair, bushy
brows and unwelcoming until he laughs, which he does often, in
private as well as on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to give up the old Hegelian idea that when theory and
reality clash, reality is wrong,'' he said, apropos of his move to
the middle. ``Reality is often right.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he feared that Kohl would try to discredit him by
talking about the radicalism of his youth, Schroeder responded, ``I
don't think so. As you see, the revolution I planned didn't take
place, so there's no point in bringing up what I said then.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, in a paraphrase of what he said at Georgetown
University earlier last month: ``Learning is the essence of
politics. You should never trust politicians who think they have
nothing left to learn any more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder predicted that his opponents might try to
discredit him by talking about his private life, although Germans,
he said, were less interested in scandal and gossip ``than you
Americans or even the British.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has been married four times. The first marriage lasted
three years, the second nine and the third 12, breaking up bitterly
two years ago. When he eloped with Doris Koepf, a journalist from
Bavaria, the spurned third wife, Hiltrud Hamel, called him ``a
coward, an opportunist and an egotist.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Christian Democratic leaders have refrained so far
from personal criticism, the party's youth group has produced a
brochure that tackles the marriage issue. ``Schroeder is a bad
choice,'' it says. ``Three women couldn't be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In another indirect assault, the owner of a big German
car-rental company called Sixt is running a magazine advertisement
that shows two pictures of Schroeder, one looking left and the
other looking right. ``Sixt,'' the caption declares, ``has cars for
people who don't know where they want to go.''

 &HT;    Partnership lets Delta fill seats on other planes
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the sea off Nova Scotia on
Wednesday night, so did Delta Air Lines Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Only one plane went down and it belonged to Swissair. But both
airlines sold seats on the flight and listed it as their own in
computer reservations systems.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is called code-sharing, and it's a common
feature of international air travel in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows two airlines to serve more places together than they
ever could separately,'' said aviation consultant Michael Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Delta booked 53 of the 215 passengers on the doomed Swissair
jet. A New York-based Delta flight attendant, Patricia Eberhart,
was among the 14 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I speak for all Delta employees in expressing the
deepest sorrow we all feel concerning this tragedy,'' Delta Chief
Executive Leo Mullin said in an employee memo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swissair, as the operator of the flight, has primary charge of
the company response to the crash,'' Mullin said. However, he added
Delta sent teams to Nova Scotia and New York to help the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's partnership with Swissair dates to 1988 and is one of
the most extensive in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines sell seats on several of each others' flights
every day. The New York-Geneva leg by Flight 111 was among the most
popular for Delta passengers booked on Swissair, Delta spokesman
Bill Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Code-share alliances must be approved by the governments of both
nations involved. Other big U.S. carriers also have foreign
code-share partners. Under federal guidelines, U.S. airlines are
supposed to tell passengers at the time of booking they will be
flying on another carrier's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Code-share deals often involve operational cooperation. Berry
said Delta provided baggage handling for the Swissair jet at New
York's Kennedy Airport but did not perform any maintenance because
Swissair has its own mechanics there.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and Swissair assign their own flight attendants to some of
the most popular code-share flights, which accounted for Eberhart's
presence on Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said the operating carrier bears primary liability in the
crash of a code-share flight, although Boyd said that may not
prevent lawsuits against Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd also said the crash of a more obscure code-share partner of
a U.S. airline might raise public and political concern about the
deals. He added he doubts that will happen in this case because
Swissair is respected and well-known.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair is only one of a dozen foreign carriers with which
Delta has code-share deals. Others are Sabena, Austrian Airlines,
TAP Air Portugal, Malev Hungarian Airlines, Aer Lingus, Aeromexico,
Air Jamaica, Finnair and Transbrasil.
</P>
<P>
   These deals enable Delta to offer service to places it doesn't
actually fly, from medium-size cities in Brazil on Transbrasil to
parts of Africa on Sabena.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said Delta holds its partners ``to the same safety
standards we have to meet'' and periodically reviews their records.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the biggest questions about Schroeder's destination is
who would help him get there. It appears highly unlikely that the
Social Democrats will gain a clear majority, even if they win, so
he would need a coalition partner. There are two possibilities _ an
alliance with the Greens or teaming up with the Christian Democrats
in the kind of grand coalition Germany had under Kurt Georg
Kiesinger from 1966 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   When his visitor suggested that a coalition with the often
erratic Greens would make more sense in the party context, because
they are more ideologically compatible, but a grand coalition would
make more sense in a governmental context because of greater
stability Schroeder agreed. Then he added, with a malicious little
grin: ``There's an old saying in this country: If you want to be
successful, think first of your country, then of your party.''
</P>
<P>
   Whose old saying? he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision will not be his alone. Parties matter more in
German politics than in the United States, and Schroeder does not
yet control his party. Oskar Lafontaine, the party leader, is
giving stout backing to Schroeder for now, though he looked
noticeably jumpy recently as Schroeder announced the party program.
Many people wonder what he will do once the ballots have been
counted, and the Christian Democrats are trying to play on that,
suggesting that it would be the party bosses rather than Schroeder
who would call the ideological tune in choosing a partner and
framing government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder tries to equate himself to Clinton and Blair. But the
parallel is inexact. Each of them took office having already won
the main ideological arguments within his own party, and Schroeder,
if he wins, would become chancellor with important questions still
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lafontaine, a harsh critic of ``billionaire
capitalists,'' wants to cut the top income tax rate from 53 percent
to 49, while Schroeder wants to bring it down to 45. Schroeder
sometimes emphasizes a ``modern'' Germany that shines in new
technology, as when he named Jost Stillman, a businessman, as an
economic adviser; other times he attacks the pension reform and
labor flexibility that modernizers consider mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear, despite tens of thousands of words and endless
columns of analysis in the newspapers, exactly what Schroeder would
do to attack unemployment, one of Germany's most serious and
intractable problems.
</P>
<P>
   The party platform says a Schroeder government would expect
labor unions to permit ``the more flexible organization of work.''
Business, it continues, needs to invest more, innovate more and
provide more apprenticeships. The government itself, it says, needs
to shrink the bureaucracy and increase public spending on research.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a ``crash program'' to fight joblessness among the
young by bringing 100,000 unemployed young people into training
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the nuts and bolts of the program are still missing.
Persuading labor and business to work together, devising practical
programs and finding the money to pay for them would be the job of
Walter Riester, the highly regarded 54-year-old deputy chairman of
the powerful metalworkers' union, who has been designated as the
labor-minister-to-be in a Schroeder government.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems plain: with Schroeder as chancellor, Germany
will remain a firm ally of the United States. Diplomats from both
countries seem sure of this, as do officials Schroeder met during
his recent trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he stretches a point to dramatize his conversion from
anti-American views. He tells people that ``my daughter was born in
New York,'' when in fact she is his stepdaughter by his fourth
marriage, and until 1997, he had not visited the United States in
more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Schroeder admires Clinton's political
style, especially his success in repositioning himself and his
party. Schroeder has embraced issues like crime that the Christian
Democrats long dominated. He has even hired Hank Sheinkopf, a
Clinton adviser in 1996, to help with instant rebuttal and research
on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In the conversation last month, Schroeder said that despite an
all-party agreement that Germany will not commit military forces
abroad except on a U.N. mandate, he could not conceive of Germany
holding back from intervening in the embattled Serbian province of
Kosovo if the United Nations was silent and other European nations
wanted to act. That would please the United States, which has long
felt that the Europeans have been too slow to police their own
turf.
</P>
<P>
   In a long career, Schroeder, who is known as Gerd, has managed
to find a way forward when others might well have felt stymied.
</P>
<P>
   He had no more promising a start in life than Bill Clinton. His
father, a conscript, was killed during the Wehrmacht's retreat from
Russia when Schroeder was only three days old, and his mother
raised him alone while working as a cleaning woman. He dropped out
of school at 14, went to night school and ended up studying law at
Goettingen University during the turbulence of 1968.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Schroeder handles hecklers, commonplace in German
politics, with great aplomb. Asked how he learned, he replied, ``By
heckling.''
</P>
<P>
   After a stint as an member of parliament in Bonn, he won his
party's nomination for prime minister in the state of Lower Saxony
in 1984. He lost that time, but won four years later. Last March,
he gained a third term in a landslide, a victory that clinched his
nomination for chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the good suits and expensive cigars, Schroeder lives
unpretentiously in a smallish apartment in Hanover, the state
capital. He has no vast entourage, disdaining all but the most
basic security protection.

 &HT;    Georgia friends, U.N. staff among dead
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Georgia women killed in the crash of Swissair Flight 111
held strong religious beliefs that friends and neighbors say would
have helped them in the minutes before the airliner fell into the
sea off Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Hastie, 59, and Caroline Smith were next-door neighbors
in east Cobb County until Smith moved to Augusta several years ago,
but distance couldn't separate the two women and they remained best
friends, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   The two were traveling to Switzerland to do some sightseeing and
visit Hastie's daughter Elizabeth, 21, who is taking part in a
Christian study program there, said neighbor Nancy Fowler. The
Hasties have another daughter, Cameron, 18, who is enrolled in
college in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Hastie's husband confirmed that the two women were aboard the
flight. However, airline officials have not identified any of the
crash victims, and it is unknown whether other Georgians were been
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a very sweet lady. She's my friend and the person
I share things with,'' William ``Sandy'' Hastie told The Associated
Press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Hastie is a former Navy captain, and the family lived in
various places around the globe during his career, said Fowler and
Jean Kerr, another neighbor. But the Wednesday flight was Smith's
first trip abroad, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The two women were members of a Bible study group at Johnson
Ferry Baptist Church, where Smith worshiped until she moved to
Augusta. Hastie attended Sunday services at the Church of the
Apostles on Northside Parkway and Smith joined the First
Presbyterian Church in Augusta, the neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Cherie and Caroline lifted all the people on board that
airplane straight to the Lord,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson Ferry Baptist Church has been touched by tragedy
twice before in recent years. It was the church attended by Lamar
Allen and his son, Ashton, who died in the July 1976 crash of TWA
Flight 800, and it was where Gloria Chung, who was killed in the
August 1997 crash of a Korean Air passenger jet on Guam, taught
preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard being impacted by those three crashes,'' said
church administrator Angela Leveridge. ``It's just tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors were also having trouble dealing with the tragedy. ``I
just said goodbye to her (Hastie) yesterday,'' said Fowler. ``We
already had plans for when she came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastie and Smith were both wonderful homemakers and loving
Christian women, said Kerr. They were so alike in disposition and
interests that ``it was uncanny to me that they should wind up as
next-door neighbors,'' Fowler added.
</P>
<P>
   Hastie was effervescent, gracious and ``loved a good joke _ as
long as it was clean _ she couldn't remember them, though,'' said
friend Sarah Belle Tollison. A Charleston native who was a
schoolteacher until she married, she once wore pearls and a silk
blouse while mowing the lawn, Kerr remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ``was a little more reserved,'' and was ``totally devoted
to her daughter,'' Renee Campbell of Peoria, Ill., said Fowler.
Both women were members of a neighborhood sewing club, at which
more eating than stitching was accomplished, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Swissair officials and counselors expect to spend at
least another day breaking the news to relatives that their loved
ones died on Flight 111. But U.N. and other sources disclosed that
the 229 victims included some prominent U.N. officials, who
frequently used the flight between the organization's New York
headquarters and its main European office:
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Mann, a top pioneer in the fight against AIDS and
current dean of Allegheny University of the Health Sciences School
of Public Health in Philadelphia. Mann, an American, was the first
director of the World Health Organization's global program on AIDS
and was en route to a meeting of AIDS experts.
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Lou Clements-Mann, Mann's American wife. A professor in the
Department of International Health at John Hopkins University in
Baltimore. She specialized in research on vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Gerety, director of African Great Lakes operations for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. An American, Gerety was a
veteran of refugee operations in Sudan, the Philippines,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and the Great Lakes area around
Rwanda, Congo and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Calvert-Mazy, UNHCR senior social welfare officer. A
Frenchwoman with seven years experience at the refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Bilger, controller of the World Intellectual Property
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig Beaumler, a WIPO official.
</P>
<P>
   Yves de Roussan, UNICEF regional adviser for Central and Eastern
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Acevedo, the director of public relations for the U.S.
Committee for UNICEF.

 &HT;    MD-11 had track record as safe, reliable jet
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, questions surrounding the MD-11 airliner have had
more to do with sales than safety.
</P>
<P>
   The three-engine wide body _ most identifiable by the upswept
wingtips that reduce drag _ was designed by McDonnell Douglas Corp.
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But it was quickly eclipsed by competing models from Boeing Co.
and Airbus Industrie, whose planes now dominate wide-body fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which bought McDonnell Douglas last year, is shutting
down the MD-11 production line when current orders are filled in
2000. Worldwide there are 177 MD-11s in use, a significant number
of them as freighters rather than airliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Swissair crash is the second MD-11 ``hull-loss'' _ industry
parlance for an accident in which the plane is destroyed. The first
was in 1997 when a Federal Express MD-11 crashed and burned during
a landing at Newark, N.J. The crew survived.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents include an inadvertent in-flight deployment of
wing controls called slats on a China Eastern Airlines MD-11 in
1993. Two people were killed and 60 injured when the jet pitched
severely.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. passenger carriers fly the plane: Atlanta-based Delta
Air Lines, which has 16, and American Airlines, which has 11.
</P>
<P>
   Delta had once planned to buy as many as 44, American as many as
50. Both pared back the orders amid a financial slump in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and American encountered shakedown problems with the
model, although spokesmen said they involved economics rather than
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was first introduced, it was so highly computerized we
had some software problems,'' Delta spokesman Bill Berry said.
``But once they got those fixed, it was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 also failed to meet initial range expectations and
could not carry a full passenger load on some routes.
</P>
<P>
   American sold eight MD-11s to FedEx and is scheduled to sell the
rest by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said Delta plans to keep its MD-11s. It uses them
primarily on international flights, including the longest nonstop
in its system, the 6,850-mile Atlanta-Tokyo run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's proven to be a good, reliable airplane,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is a modernized version of the three-engine DC-10,
whose reputation was marred by three crashes: one in Paris in 1974,
another in Chicago in 1979 and a third in Sioux City, Iowa, in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 has a different wing design, a longer fuselage and
upgraded cockpit systems. It also requires two pilots, while the
DC-10 employs three.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, in a statement Thursday, said MD-11s ``have proven
themselves in terms of safety, reliability and performance.''

 BONN: security protection.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lower Saxony, covering most of the northwestern corner of the
country, is perhaps best known outside Germany for the fact that
Hanover's ruling family acceded to the British throne in the person
of George I in 1714. The state includes Hamlen, where the Pied
Piper played, and Wolfsburg, headquarters of Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   A seat on the Volkswagen board goes with the prime minister's
job because the state government is the company's largest
shareholder. And that, by all accounts, has had a major impact on
Schroeder's life. In a number of ways, he modeled himself on the
company's wily chairman, Ferdinand Piech.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Hanover has held annual trade fairs, and
Schroeder became a regular at them, courting businessmen from all
over Germany, inviting them to dinner at a favorite Italian
restaurant or to a game of tennis.
</P>
<P>
   But he always kept his fences mended with younger, more
proletarian groups as well. Dr. Ludolf von Wertenberg, the head of
the Federation of German Industries, who served as a Christian
Democratic member of parliament when Schroeder was also in Bonn,
recalled that Schroeder always asked beforehand precisely who would
be in the audience when he was invited to make a speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students? He'd show up in a turtleneck,'' von Wertenberg said
in an interview in his Cologne office. ``Entrepreneurs? The whitest
shirt you ever saw. He's amazingly good on his feet, never uses
texts or notes if he can avoid it, and if he sensed that what he
was saying wasn't going over well, he'd change gears within
seconds. Nice guy, provacateur, it didn't matter, as long as he
wasn't ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   He bulled his way to the nomination for prime minister, taking
his case over the heads of the party leaders to the rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schroeder's will for power is certainly impressive,'' the
former party chairman, Hans-Jochen Vogel, wrote in his memoirs.
``But the question increasingly is, What does he want to do with
that power?''
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders gave him his shot at the chancellorship anyway,
and he opened his campaign two weeks ago with three rallies in a
single day, in Berlin, Munich and Bonn. Relaxed, at times almost
professorial in his interviews and news conferences, he let it rip
on the stump. His voice hoarse from shouting, his face almost as
red as his power necktie, Schroeder greeted the crowds with both
arms aloft in a V-for-Victory sign like Richard Nixon's.
</P>
<P>
   At Rheinaue Park in Bonn, along the riverfront, there were
bratwurst stands and beer vendors, hot-air balloons and rock
musicians. Some in the audience wore football jerseys marked
``Schroeder 10'' _ a reference to the candidate's habit of giving
people a flyer listing nine reasons to vote for the Social
Democrats and telling them, ``The 10th is Helmut Kohl.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a lot of talk, from Schroeder and other party
figures about building an economy that was both humane and
efficient, some complaints about the lot of the lowest-paid people
in German society and the inevitable vague allusion to a new
alliance linking labor, management and government.
</P>
<P>
   But there was not a single mention of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Schroeder got into some tried-and-true Social
Democratic grooves, lambasting the government, for example, for
allowing disabled workers to collect only 80 per cent of their
wages when sick. This, he said, ``is not social justice; they can't
go to the store and pay 80 per cent of the price of a loaf of bread
or get their landlord to give them a 20 percent discount.''
</P>
<P>
   That went over well enough with the crowd of 8,000 to 10,000,
even though they had been soaked by intermittent rains. But what
they had on their minds most of all, it seemed, was what Schroeder
is concentrating on: winning.
</P>
<P>
   Their loudest cheers came when he told them: ``We want to win _
we will win _ because we want to do _ we will do _ something for
the German people.''

 &HT;    For Kentucky's Baesler, campaign reform a big deal
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Rep. Scotty Baesler (D-Ky.), a big backer of
campaign finance reform, raised a ruckus on Capitol Hill when the
House passed legislation last month banning unlimited donations to
the national parties and clamping down on issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Down home in Kentucky, however, political realities have
tempered Baesler's enthusiasm considerably as he campaigns in one
of the Senate's hottest races, hoping to replace retiring Sen.
Wendell Ford (D-Ky.).
</P>
<P>
   Senior Democrats in the Bluegrass State say the campaign finance
issue will have little impact on how voters choose between Baesler
and Rep. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), a six-term Republican who voted
against the House campaign finance bill. Baesler himself says he
doesn't think campaign finance will be ``the issue here, but it
will be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, Baesler is now getting punished by the very
political spending the House reform bill sought to cut off. The
state Republican party is spending an estimated $250,000 a week for
two and a half weeks in unregulated donations to run ``issue
advertisements'' promoting Bunning's record on Social Security,
perhaps the single most important issue in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the state party funds is the National Republican
Senatorial Committee (NRSC), chaired by Kentucky's junior Sen.
Mitch McConnell and the Senate's most articulate and combative
opponent of campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, elected to a third term in 1996, says he is living
proof that no American politician has ever lost by being opposed to
campaign finance reform. This year's Kentucky contest appears to be
proving the corollary true as well: no candidate can win on the
campaign finance issue, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably not a burning issue with a lot of people,'' says
Gov. Paul Patton, the state's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why Baesler, the former mayor of Lexington, spends
most of his time talking to voters about safeguarding social
security, protecting patients against heath maintenance
organizations and enacting pay equity for women.
</P>
<P>
   He says he plans to highlight his support for campaign finance
reform in upcoming commercials but mainly to show voters he can get
things done.
</P>
<P>
   One of only four open Senate contests, this year's Kentucky
battle is shaping up to be one of the closest in the country. In
neighboring Indiana, former governor Evan Bayh, a Democrat, is the
clear favorite to replace Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), and Blanche
Lambert-Lincoln, a former congresswoman, is also favored to succeed
retiring Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) in the Razorback State.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George Voinovich, meanwhile, appears to have a
solid lead to replace retiring Ohio Democrat Sen. John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Democrats, who control all the statewide offices, are
rallying behind Baesler to keep Ford's seat in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' urgency is real. In the 1990s five of the state's
six congressional seats have switched Republican even though
registered Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell is marshaling the influence of the national party and
the NRSC to help Bunning. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee (DSCC), the Democratic counterpart to the NRSC, puts
Kentucky at the top of its list of must-win states.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates themselves, both former athletes, are also fierce
competitors. Baesler was captain of the University of Kentucky
basketball team, which inspires religious devotion among state
residents. Bunning pitched in the major leagues for the Detroit
Tigers and the Philadelphia Phillies and in 1996 was inducted into
the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   As veteran House members, both are also no strangers to the
partisan fighting that dominates the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning is campaigning on the achievements of Congressional
Republicans, claiming credit for balancing the federal budget,
cutting taxes and reforming welfare. He hammers Baesler for voting
against the 1997 balanced-budget bill and voting for the NAFTA
trade agreement with Canada and Mexico _ a vote that Baesler has
since said was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say sorry after it happened,'' Bunning told
Republicans in Campbellsville, Ky., last week. ``That's an excuse.
You'd better been smart enough to know what would happen before you
vote on the darn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, a Fruit of the Loom underwear plant closed in
Campbellsville, laying off the last of about 4,000 employees,
because the company found cheaper labor outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler, meanwhile, paints Bunning as too conservative for
average Kentuckians, calling attention to Bunning's opposition to
the Family and Medical Leave Act and HMO reform. Both issues are
likely to count with women swing voters, among whom polls show
Baesler has an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be really important from my perspective to
prevent Jim from moving to the middle,'' Baesler says. ``He's never
been in the middle. I'm going to make sure people understand Jim is
to the right of the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the public rhetoric, however, the most pressing issue for
both candidates is money.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is perhaps most dire for Baesler, who spent about
$535,000 to come out on top of a three-way Democratic primary May
26. Since the primary, the candidate has been on a feverish
fund-raising campaign, drawing on Patton and Ford to help.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler, a tobacco farmer, snubbed President Clinton two years
ago when the president traveled to Lexington because of Clinton's
attacks on tobacco. But despite the president's unsavory sex
scandal, Baesler welcomed Clinton three weeks ago for a Louisville
fund-raiser that generated about $400,000 for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning faced only token opposition in his primary and emerged
with $1.6 million in the bank. Still, Bunning has set an aggressive
fund-raising goal for the campaign, intending to raise another
$700,000 by Nov. 3, or about $10,000 a day between now and the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush was in Kentucky to raise money for Bunning
on Tuesday. Bunning has enlisted National Rifle Association
chairman Charleton Heston, Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) and former
Bob Dole running mate Jack Kemp for additional fund-raisers before
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that the big amount of national money will
distort the outcome,'' says Patton, expressing the No.1 fear among
Kentucky Democrats. ``It could be huge amounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates also are expecting a deluge of outside spending
for and against them. The National Right to Life Committee already
has attacked Baesler for supporting campaign finance legislation,
which would subject issue ads to the same regulations as political
action committees if they used the name or likeness of a candidate
60 days prior to an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect the AFL-CIO and the (National Education
Association) to be in on behalf of my opponent,'' Bunning says.
``And I fully expect that I will have to answer those out of my own
campaign pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bunning has been the biggest beneficiary of outside
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The state party ads running now, courtesy of the NRSC, highlight
Bunning's stewardship of the House sub-committee overseeing Social
Security. At a minimum, the ads are helping introduce Bunning to
voters outside his northern Kentucky congressional district, where
he isn't as well known.
</P>
<P>
   The ads don't explicitly tell voters to vote for Bunning in the
upcoming election and therefore escape the $400,000 limitation
imposed on national parties contributing to Senate candidates here.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler criticizes the ads for papering over what he terms
Bunning's ``horrendous'' record on senior issues. But he hasn't
challenged the NRSC's right to air the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what they say when we start doing ours,'' he says
gamely. ``I think I will get some help independent
expenditure-wise. ... I know so.''
</P>

NORTH KOREA MAY BE PLANNING ANOTHER MISSILE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea may be preparing to test another
missile, U.S. and Japanese officials said Thursday, even as North
Korean diplomats met in New York to discuss their missile and
nuclear programs with U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has detected a flurry of activity at the same
military base along North Korea's northeastern coast used to launch
a two-stage ballistic missile Monday, a U.S. government official
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the official added, it appeared that North Korea was
making preparations to test one or more of its older missiles, not
the advanced missile tested for the first time Monday by firing it
in an arc over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations suggest that North Korea's reclusive
government, led by Kim Jong Il, was brushing aside international
protests over Monday's test, which has inflamed tensions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and South Korea, responding to North Korea's preparations
at the site about 20 miles north of Kimchaek, placed their
militaries on higher states of alert Thursday. Their foreign
ministers, Masahiko Komura and Hong Soon-young, met in Tokyo to
discuss how to respond to North Korea's tests.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has already withdrawn an offer to begin talks on
establishing diplomatic relations with North Korea and suspended a
$1 billion payment to the Korean Energy Development Organization,
the international agency building nuclear reactors in the North in
exchange for its pledge in 1994 to halt construction of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, North Korea's deputy minister for foreign affairs,
Kim Gye Gwan, met with a U.S. delegation led by Charles Kartman,
the State Department's special envoy for Korea.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration has officially voiced concern
over North Korea's test, some officials have sought to play down
the significance of it, as well as the new activity detected at the
launch site this week. Some agencies within the U.S. government
also appeared divided over the significance of the preparations now
under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is activity around the launch site, it is not at
all certain there is going to be any kind of test,'' one official
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, a senior Japanese official said his government was
specifically warned by the United States that a second missile
launch was likely in the next few days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as the launch site buzzed with activity, the European Union
on Thursday called on North Korea to refrain from further tests. A
statement issued by Austria, in its capacity as the union's current
president, said the tests inflamed tensions. The statement also
deplored the fact North Korea would devote resources to missile
development while its people faced severe hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Pentagon announced that it would send six
powerful bombers _ three B-52s and three B-2s _ to Guam on a
previously unscheduled training exercise, but officials were
adamant that the decision to dispatch them to the Pacific Ocean
over this coming weekend had nothing to do with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's test of a two-stage, medium-range missile, called the
Taepodong-1, represented a significant advance in North Korea's
missile program, according to arms experts. The missile can carry
conventional or nuclear weapons and has a range of 900 to 1,200
miles, putting all of Japan within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage of the missile soared into the sky and then
dropped into the Sea of Japan. The second stage continued over
Japan's main island before plunging into the Pacific, 360 miles
northeast of the American military base in Misawa.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, North Korea had only tested a single-stage missile,
called the Nodong, which has a shorter range and is considered
unreliable. North Korea tested the Nodong only once, in 1993. It
also has two variants of the Scud missile, originally developed by
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea could be planning to follow up Monday's test with
new tests of these missiles, the U.S. government official said.
After testing the Nodong in 1993, North Korea fired three Scuds
into the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication that North Korea might be preparing more
tests, the officials said Thursday, North Korea had issued a
maritime alert to ships passing through the Sea of Japan,
indicating that there could be military activity in the area until
Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has 37,000 troops in South Korea and 44,000 in
Japan. The Taepodong would bring all of them within striking
distance of North Korea.

 &HT;    Partnership lets Delta fill seats on other planes
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the sea off Nova Scotia on
Wednesday night, so did Delta Air Lines Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Only one plane went down and it belonged to Swissair. But both
airlines sold seats on the flight and listed it as their own in
computer reservations systems.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is called code-sharing, and it's a common
feature of international air travel in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows two airlines to serve more places together than they
ever could separately,'' said aviation consultant Michael Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Delta booked 53 of the 215 passengers on the doomed Swissair
jet. A New York-based Delta flight attendant, Patricia Eberhart,
was among the 14 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I speak for all Delta employees in expressing the
deepest sorrow we all feel concerning this tragedy,'' Delta Chief
Executive Leo Mullin said in an employee memo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swissair, as the operator of the flight, has primary charge of
the company response to the crash,'' Mullin said. However, he added
Delta sent teams to Nova Scotia and New York to help the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's partnership with Swissair dates to 1988 and is one of
the most extensive in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines sell seats on several of each others' flights
every day. The New York-Geneva leg by Flight 111 was among the most
popular for Delta passengers booked on Swissair, Delta spokesman
Bill Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Code-share alliances must be approved by the governments of both
nations involved. Other big U.S. carriers also have foreign
code-share partners. Under federal guidelines, U.S. airlines are
supposed to tell passengers at the time of booking they will be
flying on another carrier's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Code-share deals often involve operational cooperation. Berry
said Delta provided baggage handling for the Swissair jet at New
York's Kennedy Airport but did not perform any maintenance because
Swissair has its own mechanics there.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and Swissair assign their own flight attendants to some of
the most popular code-share flights, which accounted for Eberhart's
presence on Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said the operating carrier bears primary liability in the
crash of a code-share flight, although Boyd said that may not
prevent lawsuits against Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd also said the crash of a more obscure code-share partner of
a U.S. airline might raise public and political concern about the
deals. He added he doubts that will happen in this case because
Swissair is respected and well-known.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair is only one of a dozen foreign carriers with which
Delta has code-share deals. Others are Sabena, Austrian Airlines,
TAP Air Portugal, Malev Hungarian Airlines, Aer Lingus, Aeromexico,
Air Jamaica, Finnair and Transbrasil.
</P>
<P>
   These deals enable Delta to offer service to places it doesn't
actually fly, from medium-size cities in Brazil on Transbrasil to
parts of Africa on Sabena.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said Delta holds its partners ``to the same safety
standards we have to meet'' and periodically reviews their records.

CRASH CUTS SHORT LIVES OF CRUSADERS AGAINST AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since he resigned in 1990 after a bitter dispute with
the World Health Organization's director over global AIDS policy,
Dr. Jonathan Mann hadn't set foot in the organization's
Geneva-based headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to return Thursday. With his nemesis gone and a
more simpatico WHO director in place, the ever-restless 51-year-old
Mann looked forward to a series of talks about how he might launch
a new phase of his career in international health.
</P>
<P>
   But the crash of Geneva-bound Swissair Flight 111 Wednesday
night turned what was supposed to have been a grand reunion into a
harrowing memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's wife, Johns Hopkins University vaccine expert Mary Lou
Clements-Mann, also perished in the crash. She had planned to
attend meetings on how to design an AIDS vaccine that would be
practical for use in developing nations where 90 percent of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur.
</P>
<P>
   Planned agendas were canceled as 500 of the Manns' stunned
colleagues gathered in WHO's biggest auditorium _ the same room
where Mann announced his resignation as director of the Global
Program on AIDS on March 16, 1990 _ to absorb the news and
contemplate its poignant timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional indeed,'' said Daniel Tarantola, a
Harvard AIDS Institute scientist who will shortly become a top
adviser to Dr. Harlem Gro Brundtland, the new WHO director.
``Jonathan was very popular at WHO.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in the auditorium Thursday, Tarantola remembered the
staff's reaction to Mann's resignation eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of people formed a sort of escort or fence outside
the room when Jonathan left and applauded him. It was an emotional
departure,'' Tarantola said. ``He was about to come back as a
guest, a friend, a colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Tributes to Mann, one of the most visible and passionate of the
world's first-generation warriors against the AIDS epidemic,
clogged media fax machines Thursday. Their theme was appreciation
for a man who insisted, with rare eloquence, that the virus would
never be stopped as long as governments, societies, and individuals
persisted in stigmatizing those it was most likely to infect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never get used to losing our friends in the fight against
AIDS,'' said Larry Kessler, executive director of the Massachusetts
AIDS Action Committee. ``I just feel this is a tremendous loss. Jon
was a true missionary, a very powerful voice about the
interconnection of health, justice, and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation will not see a better man,'' added Dr. June
Osborn, former chairman of the President's AIDS Commission and now
president of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. ``He made an
extraordinary mark on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's influence was more than rhetorical. In the late 1980s, he
successfully pushed the World Health Assembly to pass a strong
resolution urging its 187 member nations not to discriminate
against people with AIDS or HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``That resolution was a landmark,'' Tarantola said. ``I can
assure you governments would have passed laws restricting the
rights of people with HIV/AIDS, imposing mandatory testing, even
putting them in jail. There was a search-and-destroy frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mann enjoyed the spotlight, his career was marked by
unconventional zigs and zags dictated more by principle and passion
than by ambition or self-preservation. His friends believe he is
one of only two people to relinquish an endowed professorship at
Harvard _ a report that university officials Thursday said they
could not confirm.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston native whose father was a well-known psychiatrist and
whose mother is a retired librarian and artist, Mann graduated from
Harvard in 1969 and got a medical degree from Washington University
Medical School in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A stint with the US Centers for Disease Control convinced Mann
he wanted to work in public health, and by the early 1980s he was
in Zaire, antagonizing government authorities loathe to acknowledge
the emerging AIDS epidemic. By 1986, Mann was founding director of
the WHO's global program on AIDS, but disputes over funding and
philosophy put him on a collision course with WHO's then-director,
Hiroshi Nakajima.
</P>
<P>
   After he resigned with a blast at Nakajima, Mann took a post at
the Harvard School of Public Health, where in 1993 he founded the
Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights with a
$20 million gift, the largest Harvard had received in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Mann announced he would give up the professorship
to become founding dean of a new public health school at Allegheny
University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia. ``The idea of
creating a new school along the lines of his vision of public
health was incredibly appealing to him,'' said Sofia Gruskin,
director of the human rights program at the Bagnoud Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Allegheny University is suffering from severe
financial problems that recently led Mann to explore options in
Geneva. ``He was really excited about this trip and what it might
mean,'' Gruskin said. ``He had a lot of hope that finally the WHO
and he were sharing a similar vision. When we taught courses
together, he liked to tell students, `This course is for people who
believe the world can change.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mann is survived by his mother, Ida Mann, of Newton, Mass.; twin
daughters by his first marriage, Naomi, of Washington, D.C., and
Lydia, of Boston; and a son, Aaron, a Peace Corps volunteer now in
Burkina-Fasso.

<P>
   Dr. Mary Lou Clements-Mann, an epidemiologist and vaccine expert
who headed the center for immunization research at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in
Baltimore, died with her husband in Wednesday night's plane crash
of Swiss Air flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Like her husband, Dr. Jonathan M. Mann, she was 51 and lived in
Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were on their way to meetings of the World Health
Organization in Geneva. Dr. Clements-Mann was to have attended a
U.N. AIDS conference dealing with research into vaccines against
HIV. She was a leading researcher on AIDS vaccines and was
considered an expert on the assessment of vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clements-Mann was a 1968 graduate of Texas Tech University
and earned her medical degree at the University of Texas in 1972.
She also received a doctorate in tropical medicine from the
University of London in 1975 and a master's degree in public
health, specifically epidemiology, from Johns Hopkins in 1979, the
year she first joined the staff at the university's school of
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in her career she served as a special epidemiologist on
the World Health Organization's smallpox program in Uttar Pradesh,
India. That was followed by a stint as coordinator for the
organization's smallpox eradication program, also in India.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s she was associated with the University of
Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and was chief of the
clinical studies section in its Center for Vaccine Development in
1985 when Johns Hopkins named her an associate professor in the
Department of International Health, School of Hygiene and Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   She also was a member of the medical staff at Johns Hopkins
Hospital and Bayview Medical Center. She advanced to tenured
professor in the department of international health in 1990 with a
joint appointment in the department of molecular microbiology and
immunology.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her mother, Mary Still Clements of Longview,
Texas, and two sisters, Ann Rhew of Floresville, Texas, and Paula
Conley of Fort Worth.  &QL;

RUSSIAN CONSUMERS BEGIN TO FEEL IMPACT OF FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The wasting disease ravaging Russia's ruble and banks
has begun to infect everyday commerce in shops and groceries, with
unsettling implications _ not just for ordinary citizens, but for
the Russian government, which rises and falls on their trust.
</P>
<P>
   From personal visits, interviews and anecdotal reports on the
Internet and in newspapers, it is apparent that many food markets
and hard-goods stores are running out of popular items, from rice
to televisions. Moreover, retailers are finding it increasingly
hard to replenish their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for far worse shortages exists. Government and
private analysts said Thursday that grain harvests are running 30
percent behind last year, that meat and cooking oil supplies are
dwindling, and that potato crops _ the bedrock of the Russian diet
_ have been devastated by hard rains.
</P>
<P>
   That does not add up to a winter of starvation, the Russian
Institute of Agrarian and Market Studies told the Interfax news
service. But it does signal that food shortages may become a
national problem at a time when dissatisfaction with the government
already is at fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the shortages are less a problem than an
annoyance. Moscow still bustles; an enormous fleet of Mercedes
still clogs streets and new strings of flashing lights celebrate
the city's 851st anniversary. To an uninterested visitor, many
store shelves seem full.
</P>
<P>
   But the edgy feeling of uncertainty that permeates the city is
easy to confirm on closer inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly pregnant shelves hold no butter or rice and fewer
soft drinks and snack foods: panic buyers have snapped them up.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics stores are selling floor models of televisions
because their back rooms are depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get their salaries and they want to spend it on
something before it loses its value. So they put it into a product
they can use later,'' one distributor said.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of other goods, from soups to diapers, is dwindling
as popular brands are bought out. What is left are mostly Russian
brands of lower quality and price _ or, at least, less visibility.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, a meat importer, Aleksei Ivanov, said
Thursday that demand for Russia's scrawny, softball-sized chickens
is mushrooming.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet on Thursday evening, one plaintive Moscow
resident begged for help in finding kitty litter, saying she had
canvassed about 10 stores only to find that importers were not
restocking Moscow retailers. ``I don't know if Kesha the cat can
hold off much longer,'' she typed.
</P>
<P>
   Such shortfalls are largely due to the out-of-control spin of
the ruble. The value of Russia's basic unit of currency has
shriveled from nearly 16 cents to barely 5 1/2 cents just since
mid-August, including a fall of some 50 per cent this week alone.
</P>
<P>
   Having toppled Russia's prime minister and wrecked the banking
system, the ruble's plummet is now inflicting a triple whammy on
commerce. The prices of imported items, and even Russian items with
imported components, are skyrocketing. Foreign firms, which supply
an amazing share of Russia's food and dry goods, are refusing to
let Russian companies buy on credit because they fear the ruble's
value will have fallen so far by the time bills come due that
customers will be unable to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   And Russian consumers, who see prices rising and goods vanishing
as retailers fail to replenish their stocks, have begun hoarding
both imported and domestic products. Thus do shelves become even
thinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckwheat. Millet. Rice. Macaroni. Sugar. Salt. Flour,'' said
a clerk at the Grocery Store _ most Russian markets still carry
generic names like ``Grocery Store'' and ``Department Store'' _ as
she ticked off a list of sold-out items Thursday evening. As this
particularly disheveled downtown market, the price of canned peas
has risen from six to 8.1 rubles in two days, a kilo of nectarines
from 17 to 33 rubles and cauliflower from 17.1 to 20.7 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to be done?'' she asked. ``People have to eat.'' So
quickly do prices change that a variety of merchants _ wholesalers,
distributors, even some restaurants and cafes _ no longer bother to
price their goods in rubles, but in ``unit equivalents,'' a
gray-market tender that magically floats each day to correspond
with the number of rubles needed to buy a dollar _ if, in fact, any
dollars were available to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harman, financial manager of the Cherkizovsky Meat
Processing Factory here, said he pays ``u.e.'s'' of rubles for
sausage casings from a manufacturer in the Don River valley, some
275 miles south of Moscow. Because imported materials are used to
make the casings, he said, their price must float to account for
the changing cost of the raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   And imported materials make up a stunning percentage of Russian
foods and other goods. According to Andrei Kushnerenko, a deputy at
the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade quoted by
Interfax, Moscow's food processors buy 85 to 90 per cent of their
raw materials abroad.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that importers demand payment in foreign
currencies, often dollars, and foreign currencies are next to
impossible to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, consider the plight of Monolit, a St. Petersburg
importer of Spanish foods. It currently holds an investment of some
$150,000 in food _ olive oil, canned fish and so on _ delivered
before the full force of the current crisis hit. Were the company
to actually sell the products, the devalued rubles it would collect
might now cover half the purchase cost. But in any case, Monolit
could not pay: the Spanish do not want rubles, and the government
so far is not converting rubles into more stable currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has almost collapsed,'' Artyom Kolobanov, Monolit's
general director, said in an interview Thursday. ``I hope there are
smart people in the country who can stop this chaos. If this entire
structure collapses, it will take a long time to restore it. If the
problem is not solved in the next two or three weeks, the collapse
of the ruble will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, where the city government has some influence over
food distribution, many major distributors and wholesalers are
rationing deliveries, Harman said.
</P>
<P>
   His meat-processing company has shifted much of its distribution
from rural areas to Moscow, where the demand is greatest, and could
continue selling for some six weeks more under the current
conditions. But he said most Moscow companies do not enjoy such
large inventories, and so they _ and the Russian government _ have
little time to stabilize the ruble and resume normal business.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, an official of the city's leading dairy
supplier, Boris &AMP; Pavel, said the company could continue for no
more than a month before it would be forced to shut its doors. Some
80 per cent of the company's goods are imported, and it has lost
hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last 10 days alone, said
its general director, Nikolai Guchevsky. ``I have no words to
describe the situation,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``We
didn't expect this,''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The chaotic stock market has sparked fears that some companies'
merger plans will fall apart and has created additional risk for
traders who specialize in takover stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest unknown for such traders, known as
arbitragers, is AT&AMP;T's pending acquisition of Tele-Communications
Inc. On June 24, AT&AMP;T agreed to swap 0.7757 of its shares for each
share of Tele-Communications, valuing the transaction at $31.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, AT&AMP;T's stock has fallen nearly 20 percent while
Tele-Communications' stock has fallen 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   TCI shareholders now stand to get just $40.24 worth of AT&AMP;T
stock for each of their shares, down from $49.60 at the time of the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   TCI's stock closed Thursday at $33.75, and AT&AMP;T's at $51.875.
</P>
<P>
   In stock swaps, arbitragers buy stock in the company being
acquired, anticipating that the price will rise over time. Because
stocks of acquirers usually fall, the arbitragers typically short
that stock, meaning they sell borrowed shares hoping to replace
them later at a lower price.
</P>
<P>
   In the TCI deal, arbitragers see plenty of merger skepticism in
the stocks' recent behavior. In the week just after the
announcement, TCI's stock moved up toward the indicated value of
AT&AMP;T's offer. But since the end of June, the spread between TCI's
stock price and the indicated value of the deal has widened,
instead of continuing to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Some arbitragers say they are worried that TCI's mercurial
chairman, John Malone, will lose enthusiasm for the merger. Indeed,
Malone has a history of renegotiating pacts. It was his tinkering
with the terms of the company's 1994 planned merger with Bell
Atlantic that finally scuttled that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a shriveling AT&AMP;T stock price, Malone might ask for
revised terms or back out, the traders fret.
</P>
<P>
   A TCI spokeswoman said Thursday that the merger was proceeding
as planned and was expected to be concluded in the first half of
1999. Ray Katz, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, sent a note to clients
on Wednesday saying he expected the deal to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Some arbitragers actually are happy to see a decline in TCI's
stock. They can buy more and if the deal is done at the previously
announced price, they will lock in a bigger profit.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is a big ``if.'' Forecasting the outcome is
exceedingly risky in a roller-coaster market. Many arbitragers are
edgy after the recent renegotiation of Tellabs' deal for Ciena
Corp. In June, the stock swap valued Ciena at $65.88 a share, or
$7.1 billion. Ciena later warned that its third-quarter earnings
would disappoint and that AT&AMP;T would not give it as much business
as anticipated. Tellabs subsequently lowered its price to $4.74
billion, or $46.25 a share, for Ciena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the last minute, traders were getting comfort from
the companies that the deal was on track,'' said one arbitrager,
who requested anonymity. ``That has really spooked them.''
</P>
<P>
   More than the stock deals, the cash deals that have been
announced in recent months are weighing heavily on arbitragers'
minds. These are the deals that have been damaged the most by the
stock market swoon, said George Kellner, a partner at Kellner
DiLeo, a merger and convertible arbitrage firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spreads all over the place are wider than you can get a
truck through,'' Kellner said. ``There is a fear that the buyer
will see what is going on and attempt to renegotiate and buy the
target company at a cheaper price.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Hercules' planned purchase of Betz Dearborn. Hertz offered
$72 a share at the end of July, and Betz' stock immediately soared
to $67.6875. Since then, Betz' stock has fallen to $62.4375,
meaning paper losses for anyone who bought on the news and held
pending the deal's completion. Since the deal was for cash,
arbitragers had no reason to short the stock of Hercules. So even
though Hercules stock has fallen about $10 to $27.75, they are
unlikely to have anything to offset the Betz losses if the deal
comes undone or is renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Appointments
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said Thursday that it had appointed Robert Annunziata
president of the company's $22 billion business-services group,
which provides voice and data services to corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Annunziata, 50, was formerly chairman and chief executive of
Teleport Communications Group, which AT&AMP;T bought in July for $11
billion.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also appointed Frank Ianna president of a new
network-services unit. He will be responsible for AT&AMP;T's local,
long-distance and wireless networks, including the former
Teleport's operations. Ianna, 49, was formerly executive vice
president responsible for AT&AMP;T's long-distance network operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ianna and Annunziata's appointments are effective immediately,
AT&AMP;T said.

FREEFALLING RUBLE BRINGS ANGRY DEPOSITORS TO BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Crowds of angry depositors filled the halls of Moscow's
best-known banks Thursday as the ruble took another plunge a day
after Russia's Central Bank announced it was powerless to stop the
Russian currency's freefall.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank set the ruble at 13.46 to the dollar, more than
twice the rate of 6.3 before the Aug. 17 devaluation, and far
beyond the rate of 9.5 rubles to the dollar the bank had set as the
outer limit for trading in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in trading at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange
(MICEX), reopened Thursday after a week-long shutdown by the
Central Bank, the ruble slid to a bid/offer rate of 16.000/22.000
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the ruble will continue to fall as long as
political instability endures, highlighted by the battle over a new
government being waged by an aging President Boris Yeltsin and the
opposition-led lower house of parliament, the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin wants the Duma to approve Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin in a vote scheduled for Friday. But the
Communist-dominated Duma has vowed to block Chernomyrdin, who was
prime minister for five years until this March and whom opposition
leaders blame for many of Russia's economic troubles. The Duma
overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin in a vote Monday. President
Clinton, before departing Moscow early Thursday, told Chernomyrdin
he had to find a way to form a government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as no one has any idea who is running the government,
and what it plans to do, the ruble rate will fall,'' said Veniamin
Simonov, chief analyst at MICEX.
</P>
<P>
   While the ruble's freefall has caused no street riots like the
public disorder that overtook Indonesia last fall, Russians have
begun sinking their fast depreciating rubles into durable goods and
staple products. Panic buying and hoarding has been on the increase
amid reports that importers, wary of uncertainty surrounding the
ruble, have stopped food shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the anxiety moved to a new front after the Central
Bank on Wednesday ordered six leading commercial banks to turn over
their individual depositors' savings accounts to the state-owned
savings bank, Sberbank.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks, which had invested heavily in high-return,
short-term treasury bills, where caught by surprise on Aug. 17 when
the government announced it would not be able to pay Treasury-bill
holders and abandoned its four-year policy of defending the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The currency has plunged ever since, prompting depositors to
rush to withdraw their savings. But the banks, suddenly caught with
inadequate funds by the government's devaluation and default, have
turned away clients with empty hands.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, promising there would be no repeat of 1992, when
Russians' life savings were wiped out overnight when prices were
freed and the ruble plunged to near-worthlessness, has vowed to
protect depositors this time. Acting on that pledge, the Central
Bank Wednesday ordered six banks _ Most Bank, SBS-Agro, Menatep,
Inkombank, Promstroi Bank and Mosbiznes Bank _ to surrender
individual savings accounts to Sberbank.
</P>
<P>
   Depositors have until Sept. 26 to make the change, but worried
Muscovites filled the banks' offices Thursday morning to try to
find out what was happening to their money. For those who opened
dollar accounts, a transfer to Sberbank will mean heavy losses _
the money will be exchanged at the Sept. 1 rate of 10.88 rubles to
the dollar. Even transferring ruble accounts into Sberbank is not
something many Muscovites do easily _ it was Sberbank where most
people kept their money in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin Thursday tried to calm Russians, telling them it
was their choice whether or not to transfer their accounts, and
that they had plenty of time. He also scolded the Central Bank for
its poor job in explaining the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to the population: there is no need to hurry to fill
out a declaration to transfer your savings from commercial banks to
Sberbank,'' Chernomyrdin said in remarks carried by all three major
television news networks.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin also said he would present ``radical proposals'' to
solve the economic crisis during a meeting Friday with the upper
house of parliament, the Federation Council. One of Chernomyrdin's
aides, Boris Fyodorov, is pushing the idea of setting up a fixed
currency peg similar to the one successfully implemented in
Argentina in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin did not elaborate on his plans, and his words were
unlikely to reassure many of the Russians who have deposited an
estimated $21 billion in commercial banks. These people drew
confidence from the banks' professional appearance and such modern
features as automated teller machines and credit cards, as well as
the ability to hold accounts in dollars as a hedge against the
ruble's instability. But that trust has now crumbled, along with
any residual belief in the authorities' ability to right the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we trust Sberbank if we don't trust our own
country?,'' asked Tatyana Chernosheva, as she stood in line outside
the modern office of Most Bank in a western Moscow bedroom
community. NTV television showed another woman in a different line
saying much the same thing: ``How can you trust the state bank if
you don't trust the state?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all a well-calculated tactic to separate the people
from their money _ again,'' said another man in line, who refused
to give his name but with whom everyone in line agreed with grim
nods.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the bank, clerks refused to comment and wary security men
in suits kept watch over the crowd. Alexandr Polyakov, a vice
president of Most Bank, was one of several commercial bank leaders
who criticized the Central Bank's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Central Bank) was hoping to calm the panic, but it has
had the opposite effect and raised it to another degree,'' Polyakov
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a nearby SBS-Agro bank, another line formed. Russia's second
largest bank, SBS-Agro has already been taken under Central Bank
administration, and Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin has said
SBS-Agro is effectively bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Another once powerful bank, Menatep, has already laid off 1,000
employees, according to the English language daily, The Moscow
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's private banks grew quickly after the 1991 Soviet
collapse and the beginning of the transition from a centralized
economy. The new bankers were often well-connected insiders who
hustled to lay claim to Communist party money, pension funds, and
other assets that were lying in the ruins of the Soviet system in
the chaotic early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The banks grew rich and powerful speculating on Russia's debt
market, and, among the most powerful banks, by acquiring lucrative
holdings in Russian industry through their Kremlin connections.
Until now, the presidents of Most Bank, Incombank, SBS-Agro and
Menatep _ the banks forced to give up their deposits _ were among
the magnates known as the ``oligarchs'' for their legendary
influence on Russian politics. But for all their power, critics say
they have been poor bankers, and were already vulnerable long
before the latest crisis hit.

ROSSET HAD THE WRONG TICKET, THE RIGHT TIMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marc Rosset's name might have been in the obituary
page instead of the sports pages this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rosset, one of the more famous citizens of Switzerland, held a
ticket on Wednesday night's ill-fated Swissair Flight 111 out of
New York's Kennedy Airport that crashed in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   But here was the 6-foot-7-inch Rosset, the most Alpine of
professional tennis players _ Olympic gold medalist in 1992 _ at
Flushing Meadow Thursday, feeling as if he'd won the US Open even
though he was a first-round loser. Feeling very lucky because he
didn't show up for Flight 111 to Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   Also feeling ``very sad for the (229) people who lost their
lives. Now I feel close to them. You know, Switzerland is a small
country, 6 million and ... 60 of them went just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosset wasn't sure why he didn't join them.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday he acknowledged still being ``a little bit afraid. So
close to death. I changed my mind about leaving last night, and
it's a strange feeling to realize that changing my mind changed my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   His opening-round defeat by Dominik Hrbaty Monday might have
been a death sentence. ``My coach and I had decided to stay a
couple more days to practice, to go home Wednesday,'' Rosset said.
``But you know, I didn't feel like packing. Some friends wanted to
have dinner. I changed my mind Tuesday. Sometimes ... you just
decide to change your mind. You wake up, you feel different. Why? I
don't know. For no real reason, I changed my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I was going to go (Friday), but I can't fly for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosset's blue eyes, offsetting a scraggly blond beard, were
bleary Thursday. Understandably. ``I stayed up all night watching
CNN,'' he said, ``hoping the people would be all right, calling
friends to let them know I was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came home from dinner, a friend called to tell me to
turn on the TV. That's how I found out how lucky I was. The first
thing I did was call my parents in Geneva _ it was 2 a.m. there _
and let them know I wasn't on the plane. They knew about the crash
and were worried that I might be. I called my coach, Pierre
Simsolo, to let him know we were pretty lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to practice (Friday), but I'm not able to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are pretty close like this,'' he added, ``maybe you
realize, `Maybe I am going to try to enjoy more my life, like every
day.' For sure now, I hope it's going to help me to be relaxed for
the end of my career, not to take the thing maybe too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called pressure of a tennis match, the fear of defeat,
will probably seem trivial to Rosset.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras, the four-time champ pushed hard Thursday in four
sets by 22-year-old American rookie Paul Goldstein, said, ``It's
something you think about, a crash, as much as we fly. But you
can't stop flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his predecessors as US champs died young in airplanes.
Mexican Rafael Osuna, winner of the 1963 title, was 30 and had
performed brilliantly to lead a 1969 Davis Cup triumph over
Australia days before boarding an airliner that plunged into a
mountain near Monterey. Joe Hunt, victor in 1943, was a 25-year-old
US Navy pilot killed in a Florida training mission 17 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Mats Wilander can empathize with Rosset. Shortly after capturing
the 1988 US Open, he booked a seat on the doomed Pan American
flight from Europe to New York that ended in pieces in Lockerbie,
Scotland. At the last minute, he picked another airline, feeling
the routing was better for him.
</P>
<P>
   Californian Derrick Rostagno, who nearly beat champ Boris Becker
during the 1989 Open, also can empathize with Rosset. In 1986,
after playing a minor Mexican tournament, he boarded a plane to Los
Angeles, via Mexico City. At the stopover in Mexico City, he
decided to get off to play another small-change event there. The
plane went down en route to LA.
</P>
<P>
   Rosset's countrywoman and sometime mixed doubles partner,
reigning women's champion Martina Hingis, rushed up to hug him.
``Planes can be scary,'' she said. ``You have no chance, not like
in a car. But this is our life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosset said, ``The life has to go on. After home, I go to
central Asia, Uzbekistan, to play in Tashkent ... I wonder if I can
get a boat.''

CRASH CUTS SHORT LIVES OF CRUSADERS AGAINST AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since he resigned in 1990 after a bitter dispute with
the World Health Organization's director over global AIDS policy,
Dr. Jonathan Mann hadn't set foot in the organization's
Geneva-based headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to return Thursday. With his nemesis gone and a
more simpatico WHO director in place, the ever-restless 51-year-old
Mann looked forward to a series of talks about how he might launch
a new phase of his career in international health.
</P>
<P>
   But the crash of Geneva-bound Swissair Flight 111 Wednesday
night turned what was supposed to have been a grand reunion into a
harrowing memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's wife, Johns Hopkins University vaccine expert Mary Lou
Clements-Mann, also perished in the crash. She had planned to
attend meetings on how to design an AIDS vaccine that would be
practical for use in developing nations where 90 percent of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur.
</P>
<P>
   Planned agendas were canceled as 500 of the Manns' stunned
colleagues gathered in WHO's biggest auditorium _ the same room
where Mann announced his resignation as director of the Global
Program on AIDS on March 16, 1990 _ to absorb the news and
contemplate its poignant timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional indeed,'' said Daniel Tarantola, a
Harvard AIDS Institute scientist who will shortly become a top
adviser to Dr. Harlem Gro Brundtland, the new WHO director.
``Jonathan was very popular at WHO.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in the auditorium Thursday, Tarantola remembered the
staff's reaction to Mann's resignation eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of people formed a sort of escort or fence outside
the room when Jonathan left and applauded him. It was an emotional
departure,'' Tarantola said. ``He was about to come back as a
guest, a friend, a colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Tributes to Mann, one of the most visible and passionate of the
world's first-generation warriors against the AIDS epidemic,
clogged media fax machines Thursday. Their theme was appreciation
for a man who insisted, with rare eloquence, that the virus would
never be stopped as long as governments, societies, and individuals
persisted in stigmatizing those it was most likely to infect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never get used to losing our friends in the fight against
AIDS,'' said Larry Kessler, executive director of the Massachusetts
AIDS Action Committee. ``I just feel this is a tremendous loss. Jon
was a true missionary, a very powerful voice about the
interconnection of health, justice, and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation will not see a better man,'' added Dr. June
Osborn, former chairman of the President's AIDS Commission and now
president of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. ``He made an
extraordinary mark on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's influence was more than rhetorical. In the late 1980s, he
successfully pushed the World Health Assembly to pass a strong
resolution urging its 187 member nations not to discriminate
against people with AIDS or HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``That resolution was a landmark,'' Tarantola said. ``I can
assure you governments would have passed laws restricting the
rights of people with HIV/AIDS, imposing mandatory testing, even
putting them in jail. There was a search-and-destroy frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mann enjoyed the spotlight, his career was marked by
unconventional zigs and zags dictated more by principle and passion
than by ambition or self-preservation. His friends believe he is
one of only two people to relinquish an endowed professorship at
Harvard _ a report that university officials Thursday said they
could not confirm.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston native whose father was a well-known psychiatrist and
whose mother is a retired librarian and artist, Mann graduated from
Harvard in 1969 and got a medical degree from Washington University
Medical School in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A stint with the US Centers for Disease Control convinced Mann
he wanted to work in public health, and by the early 1980s he was
in Zaire, antagonizing government authorities loathe to acknowledge
the emerging AIDS epidemic. By 1986, Mann was founding director of
the WHO's global program on AIDS, but disputes over funding and
philosophy put him on a collision course with WHO's then-director,
Hiroshi Nakajima.
</P>
<P>
   After he resigned with a blast at Nakajima, Mann took a post at
the Harvard School of Public Health, where in 1993 he founded the
Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights with a
$20 million gift, the largest Harvard had received in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Mann announced he would give up the professorship
to become founding dean of a new public health school at Allegheny
University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia. ``The idea of
creating a new school along the lines of his vision of public
health was incredibly appealing to him,'' said Sofia Gruskin,
director of the human rights program at the Bagnoud Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Allegheny University is suffering from severe
financial problems that recently led Mann to explore options in
Geneva. ``He was really excited about this trip and what it might
mean,'' Gruskin said. ``He had a lot of hope that finally the WHO
and he were sharing a similar vision. When we taught courses
together, he liked to tell students, `This course is for people who
believe the world can change.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mann is survived by his mother, Ida Mann, of Newton, Mass.; twin
daughters by his first marriage, Naomi, of Washington, D.C., and
Lydia, of Boston; and a son, Aaron, a Peace Corps volunteer now in
Burkina-Fasso.

   NEW YORK _ When tennis player Marc Rosset lost his first-round
match at the U.S. Open this week, he booked a flight home to
Geneva. It was Swissair Flight 111, the one that crashed Wednesday
night off the coast of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Rosset changed his mind. He decided to stay in New
York an extra day to get more hardcourt practice.

   ``I said, `OK, let's stay one more night,''' Rosset said at a

don't know why, and a couple of days later you realize you changed
your life.''

friend of mine who lives in New York calls me, and he says, `You'd
better watch CNN because the flight you were supposd to take just
crashed.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned on my TV, and then I called my parents and my friends
to let them know I was not on that flight. You have to try to call
most of the people who care about you just to make them secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed 229 people.
</P>
<P>
   Rosset's parents had been trying to call him, hoping he had
changed his mind about his flight plans. But they had been unable
to get their calls through the overheated telephone lines of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say they were pretty glad to hear my voice,'' Rosset
said. ``I feel really sad for the people who were on that plane. I
watched CNN all night long, and they show the airport in Geneva
with all the families that are waiting, all the friends, and I feel
really sad for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rosset now has ambivalence about flying. ``I have to
say that to fly is pretty secure,'' he said. ``You have less chance
to die in a flying accident than in the car or on the street here
in New York. But last night makes me realize you still have a
chance that something wrong happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little bit afraid,'' he admitted. ``I have plans to fly
tonight, but I don't know if I can do it, honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosset, 28, is in his 11th year of traveling on the Association
of Tennis Professionals tour.

suddenly decided to get off the plane to enter a satellite

   NEW YORK _ When tennis player Marc Rosset lost his first-round
match at the U.S. Open this week, he booked a flight home to
Geneva. It was Swissair Flight 111, the one that crashed Wednesday
night off the coast of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Rosset changed his mind. He decided to stay in New
York an extra day to get more hardcourt practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rosset lost his match Monday against Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia.

THREE TROOPERS   AMONG FIVE WOUNDED IN SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLINGTON, Conn. _ Called to investigate a routine crime just
after starting their shift Thursday, rookie State Trooper Michael
Hoague and his field training supervisor, Mark Pelletier had no
idea what was in store for them.
</P>
<P>
   About 8 a.m. Thursday, they approached a remote Willington
mobile home to question the suspect, Edward Premo, about damage to
his neighbor's car. Moments later, they were in a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   Premo had emerged, armed with two handguns, and opened fire on
the stunned officers, officials said. They managed to return fire,
and were joined by a third trooper, James Reidy, who answered their
call for help.
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting ended, Premo, a 40-year-old postal driver, and
all three officers lay seriously wounded outside the mobile home on
River Road.
</P>
<P>
   All four men were taken to Johnson Memorial Hospital, where they
underwent emergency surgery and were expected to fully recover. All
were listed in stable condition, and Premo faced a litany of
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Premo, who rented the mobile home near Interstate 84, was
apparently prepared for battle. Police said investigators found his
home rigged with several hand-made explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb squad was called in after the state police tactical
unit entered the home and found one of the undetonated devices.
River Road was then sealed off and specialists began a day-long
effort just to get in the home and search it.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, State Police Col. John F.
Bardelli said he could not recall a shooting of this magnitude
involving his department. Counselors were brought in to help
stunned troopers in this rural community, in northeastern
Connecticut just south of the Massachusetts border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sobering experience,'' said Lt. Ralph Carpenter, the
department's new public information officer.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland canceled a trip to Washington, D.C. Thursday
and visited the troopers in the hospital. He said their spirits
were high but their experience points to the constant danger in
even apparently routine police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant reminder,'' he said. ``That's the difficult
part of the job _ always being on guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said they did not know Premo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to find out who he is,'' said a nearby
resident, Natalie Williams. ``He wasn't a big psycho who we all
knew about. It's always been a quiet town.''
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Bardelli gave this account of the
incident:
</P>
<P>
   At 7:50 a.m., Peltier and Hoague were dispatched to the River
Road trailer after Premo's neighbor called and accused him of
vandalizing her car.
</P>
<P>
   Pelletier, who has been a trooper for five years, was paired
with Hoague, who had just graduated from the police academy a few
weeks ago. Having just begun their morning shift, the officers
considered it a low-priority call; they have sole jurisdiction over
the town of Willington.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived at the trailer on River Road _ just a few
miles from a state police barracks in Tolland _ Premo was outside
the house, armed with two handguns.
</P>
<P>
   A furious shootout ensued: Though they were hit, both officers
fired back at Premo, then took cover, calling for help.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not say which trooper's shots struck Premo, but he
was still firing _ and had grabbed an assault rifle by the time
Reidy, a 14-year veteran, sped up. Reidy was hit before he left his
cruiser, but he, too, managed to return fire. He was the only
officer who wasn't wearing a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   At least two passers-by called for help and even flagged down a
passing ambulance. Premo was apparently wounded and subdued by the
time other officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers had no explanation for the attack, or for Premo's
home arsenal. When they realized the mobile home had explosives
inside, police ordered the bomb squad to conduct a slow, careful
entry into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the day, police said, officers found several
apparent explosive devices, Carpenter said. He declined to describe
them as bombs, saying they were still being examined.
</P>
<P>
   Premo was not well known to police in this community, and had no
known criminal record in Connecticut, Carpenter said. A check of
Tolland County Courts showed no criminal charges or civil claims
against him. Carpenter did not specify the charges Premo now faces.
</P>
<P>
   Though troopers scoured the area overhead with a helicopter and
had barricaded the road, they insisted they believe Premo was alone
and they did not expect to arrest anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Premo apparently lived alone in the mobile home on property
owned by Pisciotta Real Estate. Property manager Michelle Pisciotta
said she never had any complaints about Premo, who routinely
stopped in and politely paid his rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't even aware if he had a telephone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Premo has worked as a truck driver for the U.S.
Postal Service in Hartford, delivering mail from the plant to post
offices, according to spokeswoman Christine Dugas &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Another spokesman, Steve Korker, said Premo had been off work
without pay for about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Korker would not elaborate because of personnel policies. He
explained that employees can be put on ``non-work status'' for
various reasons that range from requesting days off without pay to
disciplinary action.

INS PLANS TO DEPORT LEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH DWI CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A statewide roundup of legal immigrants with three
or more drunken-driving convictions ended Thursday, leaving almost
500 of them facing deportation, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Operation Last Call, the week-long sweep was timed to
precede the Labor Day holiday. Last Labor Day, 20 people died in
alcohol-related accidents in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The first of its kind, the operation corralled 76 convicted
felons in the San Antonio District that sweeps from Del Rio to
Victoria and from Waco to Laredo, INS officials told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has the authority, through the INS, to
remove habitual felony drunk drivers from the streets of our
communities,'' said Benito Lopez, the INS acting assistant
investigations director for the district. ``We take that
responsibility seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said 101 people were apprehended in the Harlingen District
which encompasses the Rio Grande Valley, 104 were found in the El
Paso District, 200 were arrested in the Dallas District and 34 in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The targets were taken to county lockups around the state. How
many posted bond was not known, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, which was both criticized and applauded by
observers, marked the first time immigration officials targeted DWI
felony offenders on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   They only took aim at drunken drivers for the first time in
February after the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals added felony
DWI convictions to the list of offenses punishable by deportation.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, most offenders convicted more than twice for driving
while intoxicated are considered felons.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, INS officers have been regularly but quietly
checking court and jail records, looking for immigrants, Lopez
said. This week's sweep, however, focused on areas such as Beeville
and Victoria, where a lack of staff has prevented daily checks.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said he did not know how many immigrants had been deported
for DWI convictions. But immigration attorneys say the cases have
started to trickle in.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio lawyer Josephine Daly said she has been helping a
legal permanent resident fight deportation since he was convicted
in July for a third DWI offense.
</P>
<P>
   She described him as an engine mechanic, a married father of two
who has lived in the United States since age 10. She said her
client might have fought his earlier DWI cases, if he had known
they could come back to pry him from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who handle criminal cases agreed the new INS policy has
ramifications for the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The policy may prolong cases as more immigrants reject plea
bargains that quickly dispose of DWI charges, said Robert Valdez, a
San Antonio lawyer whose main practice is such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something new, and it's probably going to mean more
people are going to want their cases tried,'' Valdez said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney David Lunan, chief of the Bexar
County task force that prosecutes felony-level DWI cases, agreed
the policy could spur more trials.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the policy, like Rogelio Nunez, director of the
Harlingen-based immigration advocacy group Proyecto Libertad, said
the government is punishing breadwinners who already have paid the
fines and served the jail time demanded by criminal codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done what the law requires,'' Nunez said. ``Now
they're being picked up without any warning of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Others took issue with the Board of Immigration Appeals decision
that characterized drunken driving as a violent offense.
</P>
<P>
   If someone who drives drunk without hitting anything is violent,
what's that make a speeder? asked Joseph De Mott, a San Antonio
immigration lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping the federal courts is going to overturn the
decision of the board,'' he said.

RENO MULLS REOPENING CLINTON FUNDRAISING PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, in a step toward the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate President
Clinton, is reviewing whether his 1996 campaign dodged spending
limits through the use of ``issue advocacy ads,'' legal sources
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is expected to decide by the middle of next week whether
she will open a 90-day inquiry to determine if Clinton and his
aides violated campaign-spending laws by their involvement in
Democratic National Committee television ads that promoted his
programs.
</P>
<P>
   A new inquiry by Reno, who had earlier rejected calls form
Republicans and campaign-watchdog groups to investigate issue ads,
would represent a further broadening of inquiries into the Clinton
campaign's practices in the '96 election. Already, there are 90-day
investigations covering Vice Presdient Al Gore and former White
Hosue aide Harold Ickes, and a new inquiry would have the potential
to reach into the highest level of the White House and ensnarl the
president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, if Reno ultimately decides to seek an independent
counsel, the resulting probe could encompass similar use of issue
ads by the Republicans in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton's private attorney David Kendall spent 90
minutes at the Justice Department trying to convince investigators
that there was no reason to launch a preliminary investigation, a
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday about an inquiry into the president, Reno said,
``All I can say is that we have new information. I cannot comment
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg refused to
disclose the specifics of the new information. ``The department is
reviewing new information with regard to issue advocacy advertising
and the 1996 campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign finance system provides some public
financing for candidates who adhere to campaign-spending limits.
The political parties are permitted to run issue ads, which
advocate positions but do not explicitly endorse a candidate, and
not have them count against the limit.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 campaign, however, the president and his top
advisers _ as well as GOP candidate Bob Dole _ were directly
involved in creating party-financed ads that in effect backed their
candidacies. If the DNC ads were counted as campaign spending, the
Clinton campaign would have received an illegal $42 million
contribution from the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph E. Sandler, general counsel at the Democratic National
Committee, said a staff audit done by the Federal Election
Commission triggered Reno's initial 30-day review, which expires
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a staff legal opinion that the commission itself
hasn't had a chance to address,'' Sandler said in an interview.
``It's not the view of the FEC. It's just some auditor's legal
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in a joint statement, Sandler and Lyn Utrecht, general
counsel for Clinton-Gore '96, insisted that the ads were ``entirely
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The FEC ``has long presumed that political parties' issue ads
are coordinated with their federal candidates and are intended, in
part, to promote those candidates' elections.'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, under FEC rules, a political party ad that
mentions a federal candidate does not count as a contribution to
that candidate unless it contains an `electioneering' message,
urging a vote for the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads promoted the Clinton administration's positions on such
topics as Medicaid, Medicare, education, the environment and crime,
and often contrasted those views against the Republicans'.
</P>
<P>
   James Kennedy, a White House lawyer and spokesman, said, ``Both
parties fully were engaged in the issue ads. Clearly the Democrats,
but the Republicans were actively out there with their issue ads
and, indeed, continue to be. Sugegstions there might be some
problems with them would dramatically change the understanding of
both parties about the legal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 television interview, Dole said of one such ad: ``It
doesn't say `Bob Dole for president.' It has my _ it talks about
the Bob Dole story. It also talks about issues. It never mentions
the word that I'm _ it never says that I'm running for president,
though I hope that it's fairly obvious, since i'm the only one in
the picture!''
</P>
<P>
   In Kendall's meeting Wednesday at the Justice Department, he
argued that the department had already reviewed whether Clinton
acted properly on campaign finance matters and that there was no
specific new information to warrant a new investigation.

IN SPORTS, THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE WITH BASEBALL'S HOME RUN
MARK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pursuit of baseball's home run record took a day off
Thursday, giving the contenders, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, and
everyone else a chance to relax and take a few deep breaths before
they resume the most captivating and chronicled sports chase in
recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   No other sport has seen anything like it; in fact, no other
sport seems to have a record that can equal the home run record for
glamour and notoriety. It may not be the most difficult record to
achieve, even in its own sport, but it has taken an unyielding grip
on the summer sports scene that no other milestone could seemingly
match.
</P>
<P>
   Take the following test, for example, without consulting
reference books.
</P>
<P>
   (1) Who holds the National Football League record for most
touchdowns scored in a season, and how many did he score?
</P>
<P>
   (2) Who holds the National Basketball Association record for
most points scored in a season, and how many did he score?
</P>
<P>
   (3) Who holds the National Hockey League record for most goals
scored in a season, and how many did he score?
</P>
<P>
   (4) Who holds the major-league baseball record for most home
runs hits in a season, and how many did he hit?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the last question is certainly more widely known
now because of the ongoing exploits of McGwire and Sosa, who have
spent the better part of the summer chasing Roger Maris'
37-year-old mark of 61 home runs in a season. McGwire, who has
raised his total to 59 home runs with 12 in the St. Louis
Cardinals' last 17 games and his last 52 times at bat, and Sosa,
who has remained doggedly close with 56, rested Thursday in their
mad-dash pursuit of the home run record.
</P>
<P>
   They resume their seemingly inevitable quest Friday night,
McGwire at home against the Cincinnati Reds and Sosa in Pittsburgh,
where the Chicago Cubs open a weekend series with the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   No pursuit of a record in any other sport has created the
electrifying atmosphere in which McGwire and Sosa take their daily
whacks. Touchdowns, baskets, goals are scored throughout the sports
year, but nothing grabs attention like home runs, especially the
prospect of a record number of home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that challenges to Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting
streak or to the .400 batting average barrier could match the
intensity of the attention that is focused on the home run chase,
but those challenges have been virtually nonexistent. Occasionally
players have flirted with hitting .400 _ a mark last achieved by
Ted Williams (.406) in 1941 _ but never in the last month of the
season. And DiMaggio's streak has never been seriously threatened;
no player has reached 50 games, and Pete Rose's 44-game streak in
1978 stands as the closest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run is a unique sports event,'' Fay Vincent, the
former baseball commissioner, said. ``No other sport has anything
like it. Everything in football requires two or more people. On one
team one guy can hit a home run and change everything. It's the
single most dramatic one-man event. There's so much magic that
surrounds a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   And when one man, let alone two, pursues the record, fans
everywhere watch. It has engulfed fans at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Reich, a lawyer, who has represented players in three of the
four major professional team sports, recounted a recent experience
at a Cardinals' game in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario Lemieux wanted to see McGwire,'' said Reich, who took
the former hockey superstar to the game. ``We went in the dugout
before the game, and McGwire gave him a bat. Then he hit a home run
and Mario was one of the first to jump up and give him a standing
ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf is another star athlete who has become enthralled
with the home run chase. ``I'm very excited about it and I check it
every day,'' she said. She is one of only five players to win
tennis' Grand Slam, but when told that no one had ever hit 62 home
runs, she acknowledged ``Well, I guess that's tougher then.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from other sports acknowledge the allure of the
home-run pursuit. ``I'm a hockey fan first and foremost,'' said
Gary Bettman, commissioner of the National Hockey League, ``but the
energy and excitement are contagious.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people, even casual sports fans, have become caught up
in the McGwire-Sosa onslaught, too.
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh, senior vice president and executive editor of ESPN,
related that on the day Sosa hit his 56th home run, Wednesday, he
called his wife, and ``she knew Sosa had hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As wonderful an athlete as Michael Jordan is,'' Walsh added,
``and as great as his achievements are, I don't think there was
that kind of excitement as the Bulls were setting their record. I
can't think of another record that has the same excitement to it as
the home run record.'' As executive vice president of Elias Sports
Bureau, the best-known official sports statistician, Steve Hirdt
spends his life dealing in numbers and records. Nothing comes close
to the home run record, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attention given to it this year solidifies that
argument, if there ever was an argument,'' Hirdt said. ``I think
it's the sexiest record in sports. It's appealing both to casual
fans and dyed-in-the-wool fans. It's a very easy concept to
understand even for someone who isn't interested in baseball at
all, and the more you know about baseball the more you realize how
difficult it is to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Further explaining his assessment, Hirdt cited three ``really
important'' components for a good record that this one has:
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, the home run is baseball's signature play. Second, a
home run is something that is difficult to gerrymander. Three, it
has an unyielding time limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's daily schedule enhances the interest. Every day for
six months, the drama of such a race builds.
</P>
<P>
   The home run record, of course, dates further back into sports
history than those in other sports, and its creator is seen as the
reason interest in it has been sustained for more than seven
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all tied up in Babe Ruth; it's tied up in that
mythology,'' Reich said. ``It's punctuated now by the fact that
McGwire reminds people of that Ruthian mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, said Steve Greenberg, president of Classic Sports, is an
American icon. ``His is the name that was associated with that
record for the better part of our lifetimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' Hirdt noted, ``the first record that got people
interested in records.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said other sports' records don't rank with the one
Ruth established, first with 59 home runs in 1921, then with 60 in
1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average fan probably doesn't know those other records,''
he said, alluding to the quiz. ``I'm an average sports fan. I don't
know who holds the record for goals in a season in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of baseball, probably the best-known record, at least to
some of the people interviewed, is the 100 points that Wilt
Chamberlain scored in an NBA game March 2, 1962. Hirdt said the
number itself makes it attractive, as does the player who achieved
the number.
</P>
<P>
   But Hirdt also said, ``In baseball, you have only a certain
number of turns in a season to do something, whereas in other
sports you can achieve records a little more easily by deciding to
do so, giving the ball to a running back to gain a record number of
yards or giving a player enough shots in basketball so he can score
a certain number of points.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg agreed that the Chamberlain record was a great
achievement, but he added, ``On the other hand, it was one night.
He also averaged 50 points a game that season. That's amazing. But
basketball isn't baseball. With all due respect to Wilt and David
Stern, it wasn't then and it isn't now. It doesn't capture the
heart of America like baseball does.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the National Football League's best-known records was the
2,003 yards O.J. Simpson gained rushing in the 1973 season. And
that was before he really became well known. But his record has
been eclipsed, and the 2,105 yards that Eric Dickerson gained in
1984 is not a number that comes readily rolling off even football
fans' lips.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Hirdt suggested, it was the number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because O.J. Simpson was right at the 2.000 mark, that had a
lot to do with it,'' he said. ``More people are familiar with O.J.
Simpson aside from his more recent notoriety than Eric Dickerson at
2,105.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, the sports agent, recalled Lemieux's chase of Wayne
Gretzky's consecutive-game scoring streak in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to break it until his back went out,'' Reich
related. ``But even that wasn't like this. The record for goals in
a season was a blow-the-roof-off record, but it's not even close.
This is the ultimate.'' In recent weeks, Reich said, he has been at
parks in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
``The excitement is unbelievable over this,'' he said. ``People
can't get enough of this. This is mythology in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, though, is captive to the chase. When Jim Fassel,
the New York Giants coach, was asked if he was following the home
run race, he said, ``I only read football news in the paper. If I
catch it on the television at the right time, then I'll follow it.
Otherwise I'm asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   But he readily acknowledged that football has no record that
compares. ''A home run in baseball,'' he said, ``is the ultimate
when it comes to records and that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf was asked if hitting 62 home runs is harder than
winning a grand slam in tennis? ``How many people have done this?''
she asked. Told no one had hit 62, she said, ``Well, I guess it's a
bit tougher then.'' Part of the answer, then, to Question 4 on the
test is 61. And the player who hit that many home runs was Roger
Maris. But everybody knows that. How many know that Emmitt Thomas
scored a record 25 touchdowns in 1995, that Chamberlain scored a
record 4,029 points in the 1961-62 NBA. season and Gretzky scored a
record 92 goals in the 1981-82 NHL season?

SENATOR CASTIGATES CLINTON IN SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat
known for his independence and personal probity, said Thursday in a
dramatic address on the Senate floor that President Clinton's
``immoral'' relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky hurt the country,
but he stopped short of calling for censure.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman bluntly said Clinton's sexual relationship with an
employee half his age in the workplace and in the vicinity of the
Oval Office ``is not just inappropriate, it is immoral. It is
harmful because it sends a message about what is appropriate
behavior to children. The president's behavior with Miss Lewinsky
... has, I fear, compromised his moral authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Democrat said Clinton's behavior warranted some
type of rebuke, a statement that could help set the stage for some
sort of congressional action that would indicate disapproval but
sidestep an impeachment and removal from office. But ``it is
premature to do so ... until we have received the report of the
independent counsel and the White House's response to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In stern terms, Lieberman said: ``The transgressions are too
consequential for us to walk way and leave the impression for our
children today and our posterity tomorrow that what he acknowledges
he did within the White House is acceptable behavior for our
nation's leader. On the contrary, as I have said, it is wrong and
unacceptable and should be followed by some measure of public
rebuke and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since Clinton publicly admitted on Aug. 17
to an ``inappropriate'' relationship with the former White House
intern that a fellow Democrat has addressed the issue on the Senate
floor. There were few senators in the chamber as Lieberman spoke.
</P>
<P>
   But moments after the speech, two other Democrats, Senators Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, hailed
Lieberman for his comments. Their remarks signaled deep Democratic
dissatisfaction with Clinton's behavior and his public admission.
Two Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Senator
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, also praised Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, Clinton's deputy press secretary, did not criticize
Lieberman in reacting to the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has great respect for Senator Lieberman because
of the key role he has played in the president's accomplishments on
behalf of the American people,'' Toiv said. ``It's always hardest
to hear criticism from a friend, but I am sure the president will
consider Senator Lieberman's words with the same care with which
they were delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman had considered calling for a formal censure of Clinton
but was urged against taking that step by the Senate Democratic
leaders and by White House officials. ``It seems to me that talk of
impeachment and resignation at this time is unjust and unwise,'' he
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Clinton had ``diminished the office he holds and
the country he represents.'' He said Clinton's wrongdoing was
``serious'' and his assumption of responsibility for his behavior
``inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He failed to show that he understood his behavior had
diminished the office he holds and the country he serves and that
it is inconsistent with the mainstream American values that he has
advanced as president,'' said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is a deeply religious man known for personal
rectitude. He was among the group of centrist Democrats, including
Clinton, who established the Democratic Leadership Council to steer
the party back to the middle after Walter F. Mondale's presidential
defeat in 1984. Lieberman described his first public statement on
Clinton's admission the most difficult of his public career.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged Clinton's assertion that his behavior was private
and a matter that should concern only his family. Lieberman said
Clinton's private behavior was the public's business because
Clinton, as president, had the obligation to set an example to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we or he thinks it fair or not, the reality is that in
1998 a president's private life is public,'' Lieberman said during
his 25-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton had undercut the efforts of parents to teach
their children the value of honesty and undermined the trust the
American people have in the president's word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has hurt his credibility and perhaps his chances
of moving his policy agenda further,'' said Lieberman. ``But the
harm extends beyond the political arena. The misconduct may be
reinforcing one of the worst messages being delivered by our
popular culture, which is that values are fungible. And I am
concerned that his misconduct may help to blur some of the most
important bright lines of right and wrong in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Clinton's public admission last month, Lieberman
said: ``My immediate reaction to this statement was deep
disappointment and personal anger. I was disappointed because the
president of the United States had just confessed to engaging in an
extramarital affair with a young woman in his employ and to
willfully deceiving the nation about his conduct. I was personally
angry because Clinton had jeopardized his administration's historic
record of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lieberman's speech, Kerrey took to the floor and said
Clinton's behavior was ``serious and unquestionably public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral dimension that may be more important than any
legislation we have done,'' said Kerrey.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan thanked his colleague from Connecticut for ``saying
what needed to be said and saying it in a manner that gives us hope
at a time of profound despond.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, who at 71 is the oldest of the senators who spoke,
said, ``I am the older of the three and therefore have sinned the
most. But we have to resolve this. The senator did not call for any
immediate precipitous action. We have a process in place, imperfect
in many respects. In time and a not distant time a point of
decision will come to the Congress and it will be for us to
discharge our duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic members of Congress have said Clinton's public
statements failed to adequately express genuine regret. But they
have felt constrained from speaking out. Only one Democrat,
Representative Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, who is leaving office
this year, has called for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   When Senator Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican, urged his fellow
Republicans on Tuesday to back a formal censure resolution against
the president during a GOP policy luncheon, his suggestion was
dismissed as premature by his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Even senators like Bob Smith, the New Hampshire Republican who
has called for Clinton to resign, now say that Congress should not
act until after it receives a report from Starr.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Nearly 13 years ago, Roger Maris died of lymphatic cancer at age 51
in a Houston hospital. The obituaries recounted what, by and large,
was a sad story of a man trapped by his success, a man whose
accomplishments were never fully appreciated.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, the man who hit 61 home runs in 1961 for the New
York Yankees and was largely vilified for breaking Babe Ruth's
record is being viewed in a kinder fashion.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Mark McGwire enters this weekend's series against
Cincinnati at Busch Stadium with 59 home runs. It seems a foregone
conclusion McGwire, and perhaps Chicago's Sammy Sosa (56 homers),
will break Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shannon has a unique perspective on this summer of power.
Shannon is a broadcaster for the Cardinals; he could be behind the
microphone when McGwire breaks Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years ago, after Maris was traded from the Yankees
to the Cardinals, Shannon and Maris were teammates on the 1967 and
'68 St. Louis teams that won two National League pennants and one
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon and Maris remained close friends until Maris' death, and
Shannon senses that baseball fans are taking a closer look at what
the soft-spoken but iron-willed Maris had to endure in that
record-breaking season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's going to happen is that now Roger is going to
be looked at in a different light,'' Shannon said Wednesday night
from Miami, where McGwire hit a pair of home runs against the
Florida Marlins. ``Before, Roger was the villain, the bad guy who
wiped out Ruth's record. Now, it's like he's kind of the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new era as far as Roger Maris is concerned. I wish he
could be here for it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were, Shannon thinks Maris would be pulling for McGwire to
break the record. In addition, Maris would appreciate that fans
across the nation are pulling for either McGwire or Sosa _ or both
_ to set a new mark.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case in 1961, when Maris had to overcome both
the stigma of chasing Ruth and having legendary teammate Mickey
Mantle competing with him for the record in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be loving this,'' said Shannon. ``First, the fact that
everybody is pulling for these guys, I think he'd relish that. He'd
be right there, pulling for them, too. I think Roger would have
loved to sit down and talk to these guys about what they're going
through and what he went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think if he were here, he'd be pulling for McGwire. Mark
is a Cardinal and Roger was a Cardinal, so he'd probably be a
little biased for McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris found happiness in his two seasons with the Cardinals, his
final two in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He was out of the glare of New York, where he was booed by the
fans in his final seasons with the Yankees and had a running feud
with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Maris, who was born, raised and buried in Fargo, N.D., clearly
was uncomfortable in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   When Maris went from the Kansas City Athletics to the Yankees in
a seven-player deal Dec. 11, 1959, the trade was significant
because of the players the Yankees gave up, not those they
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Don Larsen, who pitched a perfect game for the Yankees in the
1956 World Series, and outfielder Hank Bauer, a veteran who had
been with the team since 1948 and was popular among his teammates,
went to Kansas City. In those days, being traded to Kansas City was
roughly equivalent to being sent to Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Maris? He was a 25-year-old outfielder who had played three
seasons with Cleveland and Kansas City for teams that went a
combined 215-246. Maris had a total of 58 home runs and 203 RBIs in
388 games in the majors and had not hit above .273 _ decent numbers
but hardly enough to turn heads in the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Maris, the Yankees acquired light-hitting infielder
Joe DeMaestri, who was out of baseball by 1961, and first baseman
Kent Hadley, who played only 55 games for the Yankees in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   New York also gave up young infielders Norm Siebern, who had
several good years with the A's, and Marv Throneberry, who became
``Marvelous Marv'' in a later incarnation with the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of trades, this one was a yawner. What happened during
the next two seasons, however, turned New York and the rest of the
baseball world upside down.
</P>
<P>
   From nowhere, Maris was the man who threatened Ruth's
single-season record of 60 home runs, who outshone teammate Mantle.
Among Yankees fans, Maris was an outsider who was stalking two of
the most deified legends of the historic franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, it wasn't Maris against Ruth or Maris against Mantle as
much as Maris against the tradition of baseball's proudest and most
successful team.
</P>
<P>
   Astros coach Matt Galante was 17 and living in Brooklyn in 1961.
Galante admits he was not a Yankees fan. In fact, he despised the
team that had beaten his beloved Dodgers in the World Series five
times from 1947 to 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Galante remembers the feeling running against Maris as the
assault on Ruth's record unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mantle would have been better from a New Yorker's point of
view,'' said Galante. ``Maris wasn't a Yankee, you know what I'm
saying? He was traded over to the Yankees. In a lot of people's
minds, the Yankees were (Yogi) Berra and Mantle and (Phil) Rizzuto
and that core. It was almost like an outsider was doing this, even
though he had Yankee pin stripes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mantle was the hero of New York, for Yankees fans. You always
heard about Mantle because he was a great player and he was a
Yankee. Mantle was a guy who was out on the town, always in the
papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy (Maris), he wasn't that rowdy Yankee that you thought
of like Ruth and Mantle. He was a nice guy, just a nice guy who
didn't even seem like a Yankee. He was a traded guy who nobody knew
much about. He wasn't part of that core.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantle finished the 1961 season with 54 home runs, a remarkable
achievement considering he batted behind Maris in the lineup.
Though Maris, Mantle and teammate Bob Cerv shared an apartment in
Queens during the '61 season, it was reported often that summer
that Maris and Mantle did not get along and that they had an icy
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Shannon, Mantle benefited from Maris' presence and
enjoyed their friendship immensely.
</P>
<P>
   As the New York media bore down on Maris, Mantle finally was
given some peace. He often kidded Maris about having to deal with
the pressure that Mantle previously had shouldered alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, the guy who really loved all the attention
Roger was getting was Mantle,'' said Shannon. ``Before Roger got
there and started going after the record, Mickey was the whipping
boy. After Roger got there that year, Mickey was the fair-haired
boy and Roger became the whipping boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger told me that Mickey used to laugh like crazy about that.
You know, they lived together, and whenever Maris would talk about
the media, Mantle would give him a look and say, `How's it feel,
big boy? I've been down that road.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maris wasn't ready for the onslaught of attention he received in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year with the Yankees, he hit .283 with 39 homers
and 112 RBIs and was named American League Most Valuable Player. In
his first year in New York, Maris enjoyed a cordial relationship
with the fans and media.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Maris became the player who stalked Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1961, it didn't seem as if Maris would threaten any
records. In mid-May, he was batting .210 with four home runs. Maris
finished May with five homers in the final week. He was on his way
to history.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' best day was July 25, when he hit two homers in the first
game of a doubleheader against the White Sox, then belted two more
in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, he reached 40 and passed Mantle for good.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, commissioner Ford Frick ruled that if anyone
were going to break Ruth's record, it would have to be done in 154
games. The schedule had been boosted to 162 games that year because
of the game's first expansion (bringing in the Los Angeles Angels
and Washington Senators).
</P>
<P>
   If the record homer were hit after the 154th game, it would be
noted in the record book with an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   By Sept. 9, Maris had 56 homers. He had three weeks and 20 games
to hit five homers. With the relentless pressure closing in on him,
Maris went into a power drought. He didn't hit No. 57 until Sept.
16, following with No. 58 the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Maris tied Ruth's mark in the Yankees' 159th game, on Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   He was still at 60 on the final day of the season but responded
with No. 61 against Boston rookie Tracy Stallard in the fourth
inning. After the game, his quotes spoke volumes of what he had
been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ordeal is over,'' Maris said. ``A thing like this can make
a nervous wreck of you. The pressure was terrific _ mentally much
more than physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what it is to put up with something like this
for two months. People around you all the time. You can't eat, you
can't sleep _ you can't even think. Maybe I wouldn't do it all over
again if I had the chance. Sometimes, I feel it wasn't worth the
aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I never hit another home run, this is the one they can
never take away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris was never the same after 1961. His top home-run total
thereafter was 33 in 1962. A wrist injury robbed him of much of his
power in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he went to St. Louis in 1967, he was a shell of his
former self, hitting a combined 14 homers in 225 games with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a power guy at all by the time he came over to St.
Louis,'' said Astros manager Larry Dierker, who faced Maris a
couple of times while pitching for Houston. ``He was a good, solid
player. I think the thing that we were all amazed by was that he
was a lot better all-around ballplayer than we all imagined and
less of a home-run hitter than we all imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   What also struck Dierker was the way Maris quietly went about
his business. There was no strut, no bravado, nothing that would
indicate this was a player who had broken the single-season
home-run mark only six seasons earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a very good guy, but it was almost like he was
having no fun,'' said Dierker. ``He wasn't like the Babe or the
Mick. He was like, beige, you know. Just kind of beige. He was a
home-run hitter who acted like a utility guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris retired after the 1968 season to run a beer
distributorship in Gainesville, Fla. _ a plum he received from
Cardinals owner August A. Busch Jr. for playing in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Maris stayed away from baseball until 1984, when he returned for
Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium at the request of Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Maris was undergoing cancer treatment by that time. He died Dec.
14, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon said he has had several conversations with McGwire this
summer about Maris, and McGwire has come to appreciate the ordeal
of having the nation watch each and every at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one thing that's come out of this is that it's
illustrated just how difficult this feat is and how difficult it
was for Roger Maris to accomplish,'' said Shannon. ``More and more
people realize the adverse conditions Roger went through, with
everybody openly against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Mark, during a press conference the other day, said that
everybody is pulling for him, and it's tough to handle. In his
(Maris') case, everybody was pulling against him. What's coming out
is just how strong a person Roger was. He was tough as nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get closer to it (McGwire's quest for 62), I'm thinking
about him a lot. I know he's looking down and watching with a big
smile on his face.''

CLINTON'S VISIT COINCIDES WITH WIDESPREAD OPTIMISM IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see NIRELAND-CLINTON)  
 (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ If President Clinton visited Moscow
at one of Russia's most trying moments, he came to Belfast at one
of Northern Ireland's most promising.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unexpected momentum here toward firming up the terms
of the April peace settlement, and for the first time people are
expressing confidence that the conflict between the two warring
religious communities that has cost more than 3,200 lives in the
past three decades is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the type of violence we have seen for 30 years
has ended, and we are entering a new phase in the type of approach
we have to the political process,'' said Seamus Mallon, the
snowy-haired deputy leader of the new power-sharing Northern
Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Emblematic of the change was the appearance Thursday of Mallon
and the Assembly's leader, David Trimble, enthusiastically if
awkwardly waving at crowds of cheering people who turned out on a
brilliantly sunny day in Belfast to greet Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   People have been accustomed to see them instead facing down the
public with grim news briefings on the intransigence of their
political opponents and then ducking into the drab government
buildings where peace talks dragged on for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent weeks, people were also unaccustomed even to seeing
them together because Mallon is a Catholic and Trimble a
Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Wood, the former information officer of Britain's Northern
Ireland Office, looked out over the gathering of Catholic and
Protestant politicians gabbing together as they awaited Clinton in
Waterfront Hall on Thursday morning and said: ``Just a couple of
years ago this scenario would have been unthinkable. If someone had
tried to script it, they would have been told, `Go lie down and get
over it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The harsh tone of public life here that had long been
characterized by a no-compromise, no-surrender attitude began to
change with the signing of the accord in April and the campaigns
for public approval in a referendum in May and for the election in
June of the Assembly that the pact created.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident that has animated the halting process was one
that was aimed at stilling it _ the bombing by renegade Catholic
guerrillas in Omagh on Aug. 15, which killed 28 people and injured
more than 200 others, the highest death toll of any single episode
in Ulster's bloody history.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Keaveny, who buried two of the victims, said he
felt that in a horrible way the Omagh bomb could end up being a
``catalyst for peace.'' He said, ``I have a feeling this was the
end of the violence and the beginning of a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   The group that planted the bomb, which calls itself the Real
IRA, is made up of disaffected members of the Irish Republican Army
who left the organization because it adopted a cease-fire 14 months
ago and, through Sinn Fein, its political wing, held a role in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA had vowed to disrupt the peace agreement with
violence. But it has found itself isolated by public revulsion,
condemned by Sinn Fein and made the target of emergency anti-terror
laws passed early Thursday morning by the British and Irish
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, representatives of the Real IRA said that in a
coordinated 90-minute period earlier this week, senior IRA
officials visited the homes of dissidents and ordered them to
disband. ``In the last 48 hours threats have been received from
fellow republicans,'' a spokesman said. He complained that the
action ``sullies the name of republicanism.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new era'' that Keaveny spoke of picked up particular pace
this week with an announcement by the main IRA that it had set up a
special unit to find the bodies of people abducted in the 1970s. In
addition, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams again denounced the Omagh
bombing, said violence in Northern Ireland was ``a thing of the
past, over, done with and gone,'' and committed his party to the
effort to disarm paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Trimble, once a hard-line tribal politician, was
showing off his new cross-community colors with a reworking of the
long notorious comment of the original Northern Ireland Assembly's
first speaker 75 years ago: ``This is a Protestant parliament for a
Protestant people.'' In Trimble's version, ``This is a pluralist
parliament for a pluralist people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of the accelerated pace of events had to do with the visit
of Clinton, who was welcomed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair
as the U.S president who had done more for peace in Northern
Ireland than any other.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks introducing Clinton on Thursday, Trimble said he
would talk with anyone who had a proven interest in peace _ a
statement of significance, because he has never spoken directly to
Adams in public and has been threatening to block Adams from taking
a position in the Ulster cabinet that the Sinn Fein vote total
entitles him to. Trimble's argument was that Adams had not declared
the war over and was not cooperating with plans to disarm
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinn Fein leader addressed both complaints in his comments
this week, and the expectation is that Trimble will now seek the
approval of his own party to end to its snub of Adams. ``Nothing
beats talking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble is to meet Adams in a gathering of party leaders he has
called for Monday, and the face-to-face talks that the two men have
never had could follow later in the week. An end to their personal
estrangement would ease widespread fears of a disruptive deadlock
over the makeup of the new cabinet, clearing the last major
impediment to setting up the government called for in the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The problems ahead are dense and formidable, but they concern
organizational complexities rather than the structural issues that
have continually imperiled the accord. The new Assembly is to take
over the power now exercised here by London in February.
</P>
<P>
   David McKittrick, an author of several reference books on
Northern Ireland, said in a column in The Independent of London on
Thursday that the violently polarized politics he had witnessed his
entire life seem to have yielded its grip on the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at this early stage, the new institutions and structures
are providing a political coherence that Northern Ireland has never
known before,'' he said. ``The ultimate aims of Unionists and
republicans are as far apart as ever, but the agreement has already
delivered an unexpectedly firm area of common ground.''

COMMENTARY: THE DAYS OF SEPTEMBER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September of 1998, when it seemed that some Americans would
lose money in the stock market and others might even lose jobs,
America and its government focused on nations they felt were to
blame, and on what American policy should be toward them. Russia,
Indonesia, Japan and so on.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In September of 1998, when it has become a reality for decades
past and a probability for decades ahead that terrorists selected
Americans for death, the United States and its government pays
attention only after a terrorist attack, and then briefly. The
United States had no international anti-terrorist policy that was
either consistent, effective, understood by the world or that
frightened terrorist nations. Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya and so on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historians of the future will write paragraphs like those two.
They will try to explain why the strongest country in the world
could not deal with terrorism, its troops and its masters. But
Americans can figure out the reasons right now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans cannot get their heads around the fact that those
two-bit countries have us on the run politically and even
militarily. And in the high reaches of our government dwell
officials of medium ability, without sufficient power of
intellectual constancy to understand the past, see the present and,
through both, envision and lucidly discuss the future.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top foreign-affairs officials could not answer
questions from Ohio college students without trembling. The way the
administration has managed foreign affairs leads our allies and
beneficiaries to tell us to get lost, and Saddam Hussein just to
dispatch a vassal to slap us down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I believe the attacks against Afghanistan and the Sudan were
justified in a war against killers who cannot defuse generations of
hatred or its bombs. But Washington created the impression that
Osama bin Laden was Dr. No _ the fountainhead of world terror. The
job is to deal with terrorist groups and the terrorist nations
without which they could not exist long _ both halves of a poison
mushroom, not one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody believe that two Libyan intelligence officers
decided all by themselves to blow up Pan Am 103, thoughtfully
keeping the secret from their commander, Colonel Gadhafi?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tries to deal with Iran
through its president, Mohamed Khatami. Sometimes the U.S. press
calls it her finest moment. Could she find time to tell him that we
would appreciate his suggesting publicly that the ayatollahs who
control Iran stop sending certain daily planes into
Syrian-controlled Lebanon? I mean the ones loaded with killing
material destined not only for Israel _ oh, that _ but for chosen
enemies worldwide.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saddam is the terrorist who influences most other terrorists.
The United States is now so weak in mind and muscle that it allows
him to bar U.N. inspections _ again and again.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter is making it hard to think only about stocks and
bonds. A former Marine major, he headed U.N. inspectors assigned to
track down the Iraqi and foreign network that Saddam uses to
conceal the renewal of his nuclear, chemical and biological weapon
programs. The Ritter team needed one more surprise inspection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was scheduled for Aug. 10, and canceled Aug. 8, on U.S.
demand. Ritter resigned _ to tell Americans what they should know.
He testified Thursday before a Senate committee. He says that
despite the cancellation, and U.S. interventions, earlier
inspections showed the network began and ended at Saddam's office
door. We do not have to be inspection experts to understand what
that means.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As long as Saddam exists, so will Iraq's plans to become a power
in weapons of mass destruction _ for itself and for selected
traveling terrorists. Washington apparently does not want that
advertised, possibly because after six years in office the Clinton
administration has no plan to make him non-exist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now please note well: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ritter nor any of the other U.N. inspectors believe that
without enforcement Saddam will allow the full inspection he
promised. That would end his programs for weapons of mass
destruction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this September of 1998, Ritter told senators that without
effective inspections, Saddam Hussein would have nuclear weapons
within three years. And he said that without that inspection Saddam
would have bacteriological weapons in six months.

CHERNOMYRDIN RALLIES FORCES FOR ANOTHER TRY AT CONFIRMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also RUSSIA-MOOD)  
(js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia's political crisis heads for its next
showdown, on Friday, Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
rallied new forces Thursday to try and stop the Communist-led lower
house of parliament from rejecting his nomination a second time.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy in danger of following its currency into free
fall, the pressure to find a way out of a looming constitutional
confrontation intensified. President Boris Yeltsin proposed late
Thursday to reopen talks on sharing power with the
opposition-dominated lower house, the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   It was the collapse of a similar accord, tentatively reached
last weekend, that set the stage for Chernomyrdin's overwhelming
rejection by the lower house on a first vote on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Chernomyrdin is rejected again on Friday, as many observers
predict, then Yeltsin, whose authority is now at the lowest ebb of
his seven-year presidency, faces a politically agonizing choice. If
he resubmits Chernomyrdin's nomination and it is rejected a third
time, he would have to disband the lower house and call for new
parliamentary elections, an expensive and unsettling option for a
country gripped by a depression.
</P>
<P>
   Or the president could drop Chernomyrdin as a cause not worth
fighting for and put forward a compromise candidate. Among those
most often mentioned are Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federation
Council, the upper house of parliament; Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov;
or, possibly, one of the increasingly powerful regional governors.
</P>
<P>
   As the political heat rose in Moscow on Thursday, Chernomyrdin
met 50 regional leaders in his office in the Russian government
building, lobbying support for a nonbinding vote on his candidacy
in the upper house of parliament on Friday. The upper house is made
up of leaders of regional governments and legislatures, whose
influence has been growing, as the authority of the central
government here has waned.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation, while not decisive, could sway deputies in
the lower house, who have become increasingly mindful of the
opinion of their local political bosses. So far the regional
leaders have been divided in their support for Chernomyrdin, with a
significant bloc emerging on Thursday that called for Yeltsin to
submit another nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to the lower house on Friday afternoon,
Chernomyrdin is due to present what he has described as a radical
plan of action to extract Russia from its economic paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, an economic reformer whom Yeltsin installed
Wednesday as an acting deputy prime minister, has called for tight
currency controls, including a currency board, an experiment that
has proved successful in reining in wayward economies like
Argentina and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov met Thursday with a former fiance minister of
Argentina, Domingo Cavallo, an expert on currency boards who is
among the figures here to discuss how to rescue the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble took another plunge Thursday, to 13.4 to the dollar on
electronic interbank trading, sending new shivers through a
financial system that is teetering on the edge of collapse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's address on Friday could end a week of guessing
about what he would do with the economy if he is confirmed as prime
minister. The lower house has pressed for a program that would
reinstate some elements of the state-dominated Soviet system,
including price controls and a new infusion of rubles to prop up
ailing industries.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov has vowed to block any new printing of rubles, which he
said would only lead to hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   In an about-face on Thursday, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of an
ultranationalist party, announced that he would switch camps and
support Chernomyrdin's nomination. Zhirinovsky, known for his
extravagant behavior and last-minute reversals, said he still
shared the Communists' distaste for Chernomyrdin and his policies,
but feared serious consequences if the lower house continued to
block the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first vote was a purely political gesture,'' Zhirinovsky
said, adding that it was a ``form of protest.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the defection of the 51 votes that Zhirinovsky
controls, the numbers in the lower house still do not add up to a
victory for Chernomyrdin, experts said. Speaker Gennady Seleznyov
said he expected no more than 150 of 450 members to support
Chernomyrdin, who won 94 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, the largest in the lower house, still
resolutely opposes Chernomyrdin, and several other smaller leftist
parties have also held firm, at least publicly. But some of those
have reportedly been negotiating with Chernomyrdin's team over
ministerial portfolios and may also be awaiting the recommendation
of the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov met Thursday with Valentin Yumachev, head of Yeltsin's
presidential administration, to discuss a new draft of the accord
of last weekend, submitted by the Kremlin with ``slight
corrections.'' The first accord would have redistributed some of
the president's considerable powers to the parliament, giving it a
greater role in naming and dismissing governments. The pact would
have also imposed a moratorium on the parliament's votes of no
confidence in the government and halted impeachment proceedings
against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a second defeat for Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin could
face one of the most significant decisions of his presidency, as
well as one of his last. Chernomyrdin, baron of the Russian gas
industry before serving for five years as prime minister, is a
major figure who has built a long list of IOU's over the years. His
candidacy has been backed by the financial and industrial tycoons,
and on Thursday he received a strong endorsement from his successor
at the gas monopoly, Gazprom.

CLINTON AIDES RELEASE NEW DETAILS ABOUT LEWINSKY RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Foreshadowing President Clinton's defense against
the independent counsel's upcoming report to Congress, the
president's legal advisers are releasing new details of Clinton's
efforts to help Monica S. Lewinsky get a job and explanations of
what happened to gifts he gave the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, hope releasing
the information will convince people Clinton did not obstruct
justice, an allegation they expect from Kenneth W. Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the advisers said, Clinton sought to help Lewinsky
get a job in July 1997, five months after aides now say Clinton
ended a sexual relationship with her. At one point, according to
advisers, Clinton asked whether Lewinsky might fit into a job at
the Old Executive Office Building, next to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   To some people, such questions would be interpreted as a
presidential order, suggesting Clinton may have been obstructing
justice by trying to get Lewinsky a job to keep her quiet. But,
Clinton's advisers said Thursday, Lewinsky was so distrusted by
some top White House officials that no job was offered.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky felt abandoned after failing to land a job at or next
to the White House, Clinton advisers said, and her anger toward
Clinton and others was soon recorded in secretly taped
conversations with Linda R. Tripp, followed by the revelation of
the sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   This, at least, is the scenario presented by advisers close to
Clinton and familiar with his grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. The
advisers provided a series of details about how the relationship
between Clinton and Lewinsky ended and what Clinton did to help
Lewinsky deal with the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers provided these details Thursday because they
believe the actions show the president did not push his aides to
rehire Lewinsky or get her a job recommendation after his initial
request was rebuffed. Clinton's advisers said this shows the
president did not try to obstruct justice by getting her a job in
exchange for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   But to Starr and his prosecutors, the same set of events may be
viewed differently. To prosecutors, the revelations that Clinton
took even more steps to help Lewinsky get a job than has been
previously acknowledged might show the depth of the president's
personal efforts to help the intern and thus perhaps keep her
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers say a physical relationship between Clinton
and Lewinsky began around November 1995, continued after Lewinsky
was transferred to the Pentagon in April 1996 and ended in February
1997. That is earlier than has been stated in some reports.
</P>
<P>
   After February 1997, Lewinsky visited Clinton at the White House
at least once a month but did not have sexual relations, the
advisers said. Lewinsky told Clinton she considered her transfer to
the Pentagon a blot on her record and asked to be moved back to the
White House, the advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked a senior personnel aide, Marsha Scott, whether
Lewinsky could get a job at the Old Executive Office Building, an
adviser said. But Scott rejected the idea after other aides told
her that Lewinsky was ``stalking'' the president, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Former federal prosecutor Robert Ullmann of Boston said there is
a fine line between helping a friend and obstructing justice. ``A
prosecutor can argue that anything he did for a potential witness
had an improper motive,'' Ullmann said, ``but obviously people do
favors for people they know for all sorts of reasons that have
nothing to do with obstructing criminal investigations.'' Ullmann
said it might be difficult for Starr to prove Clinton was
obstructing justice in the July 1997 effort to get Lewinsky a job
because ``that is before she became a centerpiece of Starr's
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing months, as it became more likely that Paula Jones
would be allowed to bring her sexual harassment lawsuit against the
president, Clinton took other steps to try to help Lewinsky get a
job. He asked his friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr. to help Lewinsky and
also asked a White House official to consider writing a job
recommendation for her. Jordan did help Lewinsky get a job offer in
New York that was later rescinded. The White House official did not
make the job recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also examining whether Clinton tried to conceal
the fact that he gave gifts to Lewinsky. Clinton's gifts included a
T-shirt from the Black Dog restaurant on Martha's Vineyard, a
photograph of the president and a beach wrap-around dress. The
gifts were subpoenaed last December by lawyers in the Jones case.
Starr is investigating whether Clinton instructed Lewinsky to
return the gifts to his secretary so Jones' lawyers couldn't obtain
them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky reportedly testified to the grand jury that Clinton
told her to give the gifts to his secretary, Betty Currie. As
Lewinsky reportedly recalled it, Clinton said she didn't have to
turn over gifts that weren't in her possession. If true, that might
be evidence that Clinton tried to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's advisers said Currie gave a different version,
telling the grand jury Lewinsky called her to come over and
retrieve the gifts, according to Clinton advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the advisers said, the gifts were modest
mementos Clinton presented to many White House workers. Moreover,
Clinton advisers said the president gave Lewinsky other gifts after
the subpoena in the Jones case was issued, thus undercutting
suggestions Clinton wanted to conceal the items.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is in the interest of Clinton advisers to say
Currie collected the gifts at Lewinsky's direction _ instead of
being asked by Clinton _ because that would help clear the
president of possibly obstructing justice. It may be impossible to
determine who actually said what until the transcripts of the
testimony by Clinton, Currie and Lewinsky are released. Still, the
efforts at ``spinning'' the explanation about the gifts shows that
Clinton aides are concerned it could become a central part of
Starr's case.
</P>
<P>
   But another source close to the investigation _ and who does not
believe Clinton's explanation _ said the president's advisers are
trying to taint Lewinsky's credibility. The source, who does not
want to be identified, questioned why Currie would have collected
the gifts from Lewinsky unless Clinton had told her to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers feel confident they have dismissed another
potential obstruction of justice allegation, the ``talking points''
that Lewinsky presented to Tripp, instructing her one-time friend
to say she knew of no improper relationship between Clinton and
Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer who later said the
president made an improper advance toward her.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, many analysts suggested the talking points
were orchestrated at the White House, perhaps with Clinton's
knowledge. But, according to Clinton advisers, Lewinsky reportedly
told the grand jury she wrote them on her own.

ESPN, FOX PLAN EXTENSIVE HOME RUN COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It won't be all home runs all the time, but it will be pretty
close as both ESPN and Fox air this holiday weekend's record chase
by Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the lineup: Friday night ESPN airs the Reds-Cardinals
game at 8. Saturday Fox has Reds-Cardinals at 1 p.m. On Sunday, if
McGwire is at 60 home runs, Fox will air Reds-Cardinals at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day, ESPN airs the Cardinals-Cubs game at 2 p.m.
Tuesday night, Fox will show Cardinals-Cubs at 8 if either McGwire
or Chicago's Sammy Sosa has 60. For Wednesday, ESPN is still
debating whether to air the 7:30 Cardinals-Reds game.
</P>
<P>
   Both networks hastily rescheduled programming to enhance their
chances of showing the home run that breaks Roger Maris's all-time
record of 61, set in 1961. St. Louis slugger McGwire enters the
weekend with 59, Sosa with 56.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still debatable whether the home run chase is good
baseball, it clearly gets good ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge sports story,'' said ESPN spokesman Josh
Krulewitz. ``It's all happened so fast. We all knew McGwire was
creeping up to the record, but now he has hit the accelerator and
is actually on the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, McGwire hit his 55th home run on ESPN's Sunday
night telecast. The cable sports giant earned a 5.5 rating, its
highest this year. The 22 Sunday night games have averaged a 2.5.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's highest baseball rating ever was a 7.5 in 1995 when
Baltimore's Cal Ripken played in his 2,131st straight game,
breaking Lou Gehrig's record.
</P>
<P>
   Fox senior producer John ``Flip'' Filippelli is excited about
airing the historic homer. ``McGwire will get all of the
attention,'' said Filippelli. ``We will have several cameras
isolating him, all the reaction, all the sound bites _ everything
will be around McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Filippelli said that because the Reds and Cardinals are not in
playoff contention, Fox will focus on McGwire, McGwire, McGwire. On
Tuesday night, Filippelli said, more attention will be paid to Sosa
and the Cubs because they have a shot at the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The home run chase has added poignancy for Filippelli, who
received Maris's autograph as a 9-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maris was one of my favorite players,'' he said, ``and
breaking his record transcends the game.''

 &HT;    Chasing history: McGwire bats for the ages
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On rare occasions, baseball braces for a great achievement,
knowing that it is on the verge of a memorable moment: Hank Aaron
circling the bases after breaking Babe Ruth's all-time home run
record; Cal Ripken circling Camden Yards after surpassing Lou
Gehrig's consecutive game streak.
</P>
<P>
   Another such moment is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire returns to St. Louis _ a town that knows a little
about baseball tradition _ with 59 home runs this season, just two
away from what was thought to be the unbreakable record that Roger
Maris set 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Maris has breathed life into a sport that seemed
determined to kill itself this decade. At home or on the road, fans
jam the ballpark to see McGwire, showing up as early as three hours
before the game to watch him launch majestic blasts in batting
practice. He receives huge ovations from rival crowds, and even
opposing players seem awed by his performance.
</P>
<P>
   He's closing in on the record rapidly _ five home runs in his
last 12 at-bats _ and the excitement level in St. Louis is rising
just as fast.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning tonight, the Cardinals face the Cincinnati Reds for
three games, before the Chicago Cubs and Sammy Sosa, who has 56
homers, come in for two games Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All five games at Busch Stadium, capacity 49,625, are sold out,
and scalpers are asking as much as $2,500 for a ticket. Even so,
that price would be a bargain for the fan who retrieves the
history-making ball: A home-shopping network has offered $250,000
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Media representatives are arriving in droves from around the
world. More than 1,200 media requests have been handled, about the
number that baseball receives for its All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Every boy in St. Louis seems to be wearing a Cardinals jersey
with McGwire's No. 25 on the back. Signs tracking McGwire's
home-run total hang from school buildings, tops of billboards and
mailboxes. McGwire memorabilia is hot, the hottest being a $20
T-shirt with his face on the front and the words ``The Quest for
62'' on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Outside town, aboard the Casino Queen on the Mississippi River,
26 television sets have been set up in the sports bar. Reception
has been a problem when the boat is cruising the river, but casino
officials plan to install a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in Atlanta will have a slightly more difficult time
following the chase over the Labor Day weekend than fans on that
gambling ship or elsewhere in the St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game will be televised on ESPN at 8 p.m. Originally
the game was to be shown only in St. Louis, but ESPN negotiated
Thursday for the rights to carry it nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game will be televised to much of the nation on Fox
at 1 p.m., but Atlanta viewers will get the Braves-Mets game.
Expect cutaways to the Cards-Reds game whenever McGwire comes to
bat.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game will be televised only if McGwire is at 60 or 61
home runs, on Fox at 4 p.m., after the network's early NFL game. If
he's still at 59, the game will be at 2:1 p.m. and will not be
televised here.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's game will be televised on ESPN at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has left Fox sports executive director Ed Goren
dizzy. ``It's the most complicated equation I've ever faced,''
Goren said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, perhaps the only one whose head isn't spinning from all
the hoopla, spent Thursday with his family. He appears eager to
break the record but cautions that he might not be the only one to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not look too far ahead,'' he said after hitting two home
runs Wednesday night in Florida. ``We have a whole month of the
season left. There's a great, great possibility that there's going
to be two or three guys (who break the record). I wouldn't rule out
Ken Griffey,'' who has 47 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is batting just .154 against the Reds this season, and
has been walked 11 times. Tonight, he will face Pete Harnisch, who
has given up one home run to McGwire in eight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, part of a pitching staff that has allowed the
second-most homers in the league _ 164 in 140 games _ certainly
doesn't want to be remembered as the pitcher who gave up the homer
to tie or beat Maris' mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the whole world's hoping we give up home runs to the
guy, but we've got jobs to do,'' Harnisch said. ``Hey, I'm as much
a fan as anyone else when I'm not pitching and I'm sitting home
watching TV. But when I'm out there, I've got a job to do, and I'm
trying to get him out.''

 &HT;    Why are baseballs flying out of ballparks in great numbers?
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox New Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As manager of the Chicago Cubs, Jim Riggleman
watches his own player, Sammy Sosa, with a smile. But when he
watches Mark McGwire against his team, he grimaces.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that on any pitch Sosa and McGwire can catapult a
baseball far into the great beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Why are baseballs flying out of ballparks in great numbers?
Already this season, 22 players have hit 30 or more home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last eight to 10 years, hitters have made a lot more
progress than pitchers,'' Riggleman told The Chicago Tribune.
``Hitters have gotten stronger and the parks have gotten smaller.
Hitters are recognizing the forkball now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 20 years ago that San Francisco manager Roger Craig
developed and pushed the split-finger fastball. Hitters, though,
have caught up with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers are going to have to come up with something to even
the score again,'' Riggleman said. ``Maybe they'll have to raise
the mound. All I know is that it has made it frustrating for a
manager. You think you have the game in hand and, boom, the ball is
over the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, the most players to hit 40 or more homers in the
same season was eight _ and that was 1961 when Maris hit his 61. It
also was an expansion year, just as this season is an expansion
year that thins out the pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, 12 players hit 40 or more home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago relief pitcher Rod Beck says he doesn't care if Mark
McGwire is taking andro or nitro or Cheerios, what he is doing is
amazing. But he makes another point. He says baseballs used to be
so soft he could move the cover with his fingers. Now you can use a
baseball to sink an 8-ball.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the way McGwire is locked in, he probably
could use a pool stick and whack a baseball 450 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has 59 homers and it's the first couple of days in
September . . . and that's a joke,'' teammate Tom Lampkin says.
``This can't be happening. It's daily. It's nonstop. It's
continuous disbelief. We just laugh and shake our heads. There is
nothing you can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories abound about Roger Maris losing his hair and his
appetite during his chase of Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't the case for McGwire. They call him Big Red because
of his hair and he doffed his cap to show everybody his hair is
firmly in place and said, ``It's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day before he hit home runs Nos. 58 and 59, McGwire went
to lunch in Fort Lauderdale with Lampkin and performed a Ruthian
feat. Babe Ruth was known for his gastronomical abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Well, McGwire ate a steak, a teriyaki chicken breast, a bowl of
chicken noodle soup, rice pilaf, a baked potato, a plate of salad
and washed it all down with two large jugs of iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   If he had eaten another steak, he might have hit three homers.

   The lower deck in right field was jammed. So were the bleachers
in right center. But most of the rest of mammoth Yankee Stadium _
which then could hold 70,000 _ was empty as Roger Maris strode to
the plate to face Boston Red Sox rookie Tracy Stallard with one out
in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Only 23,154 were in attendance at ``the House that Ruth Built''
and most were not there on Oct. 1, 1961, to be a part of baseball
history. The real lure was a chance to hit the lottery. Buy a
ticket to the last game of the season and maybe catch a $5,000
home-run ball.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 61 is a magical number _ the most revered in sports.
Thirty-seven years ago, it carried an asterisk; it would count only
if someone could reach it in 154 completed games.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Ford Frick's ruling to protect Babe Ruth _ his old
friend _ had sapped much of the excitement out of the last few
games of the 1961 season. After a summer of suspense, anything now
would be almost anticlimactic. Officially, the race was over.
</P>
<P>
   Except to Maris. After all he had put up with, the 27-year-old
outfielder was determined not to let the season end without at
least one more home run.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2:42 p.m. on a bright Sunday in the Bronx. There was no
national TV coverage, but New Yorkers not interested in the
football Giants' game at Washington could tune into the Yankees on
WPIX (Channel 11). It was Phil Rizzuto's turn in the TV booth. He
always did the fourth inning, giving Mel Allen and Red Barber a
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two balls, no strikes on Roger Maris. Here's the windup.
Fastball, hit deep to right! This could be it! Way back there! Holy
Cow, he did it! Sixty-one for Maris! Look at 'em fight for that
ball out there!''
</P>
<P>
   Sal Durante, a 19-year-old truck driver from Brooklyn, won the
battle. He received $5,000 as promised by a California restaurant
owner, who eventually gave the ball back to Maris.
</P>
<P>
   The player almost no one considered worthy of beating Ruth's 60
homers had hit 61 _ while not technically breaking the record. The
homer brought Maris _ booed on the road and sometimes even at home
_ vindication, if not happiness.
</P>
<P>
   As Maris circled the bases with his head down, his mind went
blank, he later said. But he wouldn't have had a catchy quote
anyway. Certainly not for the sportswriters who had hounded him for
months. He had to be pushed out of the dugout by his teammates to
wave his cap to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what I have to show for those 61 home runs?''
Maris was quoted as saying after he retired in 1968. ``Nothing.
Exactly nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball Maris hit for No. 61 is now in the National Baseball
Hall of Fame, as is his bat. Maris, who died in 1985 at age 51 of
lymphatic cancer, is not. The asterisk was not removed from his
record until six years after his death.
</P>
<P>
   `Wanted to be one of the guys'
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted was to be a good ballplayer, hit 25 or 30 homers,
drive in around 100 runs, hit .280 and help my club win pennants,''
Maris said. ``I just wanted to be one of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris was the American League MVP in both 1960 and 1961, but
finished his injury-plagued 12-year career in 1968 with a .260
lifetime average. He had 275 home runs, meaning that he hit 22
percent of his career homers in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   No player seemed less suited for the national spotlight. He was
uncomfortable around strangers, quick to anger and unwilling to
compromise on anything. He just wanted to do his job and be left
alone by the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what it is like to put up with something like
this for two months,'' Maris said late in the 1961 season. ``People
around you all the time. You can't eat. You can't sleep. You can't
even think.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire feels for what Maris must have gone through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got a lot of people rooting for us,'' McGwire said.
``He didn't. He had fans rooting against him. He had the media
rooting against him. Two strikes against you like that playing in
New York City isn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming before ESPN, sports-talk radio and always-present
television cameras, the media onslaught that Maris faced was
minuscule compared with what McGwire and Sammy Sosa must deal with
today.
</P>
<P>
   Badgered by the press
</P>
<P>
   ``It was usually just 15 or 20 reporters with notepads, and no
TV cameras,'' remembers Leonard Koppett, who covered the Yankees
for the New York Post. ``You have more people covering a routine
ball game now. But Maris wasn't ready for the attention, and the
Yankees didn't do anything to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fishel was the Yankees' public-relations director. Later, he
said he regretted not thinking of having mass press conferences at
scheduled times. In 1961, Maris was badgered for hours before and
after every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a lot easier for Maris today,'' Koppett
said.
</P>
<P>
   The friction between Maris and the media didn't intensify into a
war until the next season. But there is no question that few
members of the press corps wanted Ruth's record broken. The same
with most of the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there were five people in the country not
connected to Maris in some way that wanted him to do it,'' Koppett
said. ``If someone had to do it, the choice was Mickey Mantle. Not
Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   They were the M&AMP;M boys _ Mantle and Maris, Murder and Mayhem.
With Mantle batting behind him, Maris was not walked intentionally
a single time as their homer spree became the talk of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to boo me,'' Mantle recalled before his death.
``Then Roger came along, and I was the hero, and he was the one
they gave a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   By late July, Maris had 40 homers and Mantle 38, as balls flew
out of American League ballparks in the first year of expansion to
10 teams and a 162-game schedule. Frick _ who had ghostwritten
articles for Ruth while a sportswriter _ made his ruling. Ruth's
record must be broken in 154 completed games. Anything done after
that would be listed separately with a ``distinctive mark.''
</P>
<P>
   The home-run race continued, and in Maris' hometown of Fargo,
N.D., TV sportscaster Bill Weaver, now 78, decided to put a Western
Union ticker in his office. Every night, Weaver and Maris' father,
Rudy, would huddle around the ticker and wait for news.
</P>
<P>
   Maris alone
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way news traveled in those days,'' Weaver said.
``The machine would sound, and the first thing that would come over
was `HR.' Then there would be some more ticking and it would say
``N.Y.' And then there would come an `M' and an `A,' and I would
look at Rudy, and he would look at me, and we would hold our
breaths. Would it be Maris or Mantle? When it said `Maris,' we
would jump around.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Weaver would break into NBC programing with a bulletin for
Maris' hometown fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a two-man battle on Sept. 10. Maris had 56 homers
and Mantle 53. But Mantle came down with a virus and soon was
knocked out of the race. Announcer Allen sent Mantle to a Manhattan
doctor noted for treating celebrities. The doctor gave Mantle a
shot, but the needle hit a bone by mistake. An infection developed
and Mantle missed most of the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Maris, a well-built 6-feet, 200 pounds, was alone to face the
pressure, which became worse and worse. He hit two homers in
Detroit to reach 58, but he was booed, got in an argument with a
fan and hid from the press after one game. Small patches of his
hair in the back of his crew cut were falling out.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he had one game left to beat Frick's edict _ and Ruth's
record. It was Sept. 20, and the Yankees were in Baltimore. Maris,
overcome with nerves, walked into manager Ralph Houk's office.
According to Houk, Maris was crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the end of my rope,'' Maris reportedly told Houk. ``I
can't take it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Calmed by Houk, Maris played against the Orioles and almost
caught the ghost of Ruth in the Babe's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Maris hit No. 59, off Milt Pappas, in his second at-bat. Then in
the seventh inning, against reliever Dick Hall, he almost blasted
No. 60. But his long drive went foul. He batted once more in the
ninth, but grounded out weakly to first against knuckleballer Hoyt
Wilhelm, a future Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure builds
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won 4-2 before 21,032 to clinch first place. The
pennant race was over, and so was the homer race, as far as Frick
was concerned. The headlines read, New York Slugger Falls One Short
of Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   But the season still had eight games to go.
</P>
<P>
   Maris went homerless in a three-game series in Boston. ``I
though the pressure would be off me,'' Maris said. ``But I was
wrong. It is worse than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Yankees Stadium, a relieved Maris hit No. 60 off Jack
Fisher of Baltimore before 19,401. He then took the next game off,
going shopping with his wife, who was visiting New York after
giving birth to the couple's fourth child earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   Three games against Boston remained. It took until the last one
for Maris to connect.
</P>
<P>
   Stallard, the victim, refuses to talk about the homer now. But
after the 1-0 loss, he said: ``I'm not going to lose a lot of sleep
over it. The guy hit a bunch of homers off other pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   `He was misunderstood'
</P>
<P>
   No. 61 made headlines around the country, but most papers played
the story on the sports front, not Page 1. None of the top sports
columnists was at the game, most taking the day off in preparation
for the World Series, which would begin the following Wednesday
against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times ran a profile of Maris in its Man in the News
feature. It was headlined Angry King of Swat and quoted Maris as
saying, ``Even the Yankee clubhouse attendants think I'm tough to
live with. I guess they're right. I'm miffed most of the time,
regardless of how I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems Maris was loved only by his family, hometown fans and
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was misunderstood,'' said former Yankee second baseman
Bobby Richardson, who delivered the eulogy at Maris' funeral in
Fargo. ``He was a private man. He didn't take much to the acclaim
and adulation of the hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris is buried in Fargo's Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery, beneath
a diamond-shaped headstone. No. 9 is in pinstripes taking a mighty
left-handed swing. Each side of the bat is chiseled 61 _ for the
year and for his home-run total. At the base of the marker are the
words ``Against All Odds.''

 &HT;    Maris museum not on beaten path
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harried shoppers hurry past, most oblivious to the hometown
hero's life on display just outside their glance. It's hard to find
time for history when you have school clothes to buy.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa get closer to 61 home runs,
more people are starting to stop and stare at the New York Yankees
uniform with No. 9 on the back, the historic baseballs or the
grainy black-and-white film.
</P>
<P>
   The West Acres shopping mall in Fargo, N.D., is home not only to
Sears and the Gap but also to the Roger Maris Museum.
</P>
<P>
   West Acres _ the largest mall within a 200-mile radius _ pulls
in 2 million shoppers a year. It isn't known how many have stopped
this summer at the museum, which really is a mamoth 72-foot-long
trophy case 10 feet high and 12 feet wide. There is no admission
charge, and the guest book is manned only part-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are following the home-run race, but it really
hasn't had a dramatic effect on the museum,'' curator Jim
McLaughlin, 73, said. ``Folks here kinda take it for granted, and
we're too far out of the way to get many tourists. But we do get a
few. We've had people come from Chicago and Denver just to see the
museum. And a farmer from Ohio who was here for a show recently
passed up his tour to come over and spend some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris spent only 11 of his 51 years living in Fargo, which is
just across the Red River from Minnesota. But he went to high
school in the city of 70,000, played his first minor-league season
here and always considered it home.
</P>
<P>
   Maris, who lived in Gainesville, Fla., after he retired, was
approached about a museum while attending the 1983 American Legion
World Series in Fargo. At first, he was against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want that much attention,'' McLauglin said. ``But
Moose Skowron, one of his old Yankees teammates, was with him and
thought it was a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris relented, but with two conditions: The memorabilia had to
be placed where people could easily see them, and no admission
could be charged.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin and Bob Smith, a longtime family friend, flew to
Gainesville and brought back more than 100 items in a rented
U-Haul. The museum was dedicated on June 23, 1984. A year later
Maris was dead, a victim of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 160 items on display in the museum _ including
Maris' high school football uniform, photographs with presidents
Truman, Kennedy, Reagan and Ford, and the Hickok Belt, awarded
Maris as the athlete of the year in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlights of the museum for most visitors are the
home-run balls and the film narrated by Mel Allen that captures
each Ballantine Blast from 50 through 61.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 11 home run balls are in the museum. Missing is No.
61 _ which is in the National Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown,
N.Y., along with Maris' bat _ and No. 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger's story was that the fellow who caught No. 59 in
Baltimore owned a meat market,'' McLaughlin said. ``He told Roger
he would give it to him if he came to his store. Then the fellow
said he could have it for $2,500. Roger left. He didn't think it
was worth it.

 &HT;    Nine things you probably didn't know about Roger Maris
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1
</P>
<P>
   Name change
</P>
<P>
   He was born Roger Eugene Maras _ not Maris. The spelling was
officially changed by the family in 1955, after Roger had played
three years in the minors. Roger's father, Rudy, was tired of going
to games and hearing fans and opposing players deride his son as
Mar-ass. Asked later in a questionnaire about why his name was
changed, Maris replied: ``Immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   2
</P>
<P>
   Almost a Sooner
</P>
<P>
   Maris was a standout high school football player at Shanley
Catholic in Fargo, N.D., and was offered a scholarship by coach Bud
Wilkinson to play at Oklahoma. But Maris, who set a national record
in 1951 with four kickoff returns for touchdowns in one game,
lasted only a few days in Oklahoma. ``I wasn't cut out for
school,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   3
</P>
<P>
   Housemates
</P>
<P>
   Some columnists had them feuding, but Maris and Mickey Mantle
actually lived together during the 1961 season. They shared a
modest apartment in Queens with fellow outfielder Bob Cerv, while
their families remained in Kansas City and Dallas, respectively.
Maris regularly cooked breakfast for his housemates.
</P>
<P>
   4
</P>
<P>
   Short porch
</P>
<P>
   It was only 296 feet down the right-field line at old Yankee
Stadium, and Maris, a left-handed batter, was a dead pull hitter.
But 31 of his 61 homers were hit on the road.
</P>
<P>
   5
</P>
<P>
   Batting order
</P>
<P>
   Maris hit fourth _ behind Mantle _ in 1960, his first year with
the Yankees. But Ralph Houk switched the order when he became
manager in 1961. Maris drew 90 walks in '61, none intentional. Babe
Ruth had Lou Gehrig batting behind him in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   6
</P>
<P>
   Rainout
</P>
<P>
   Maris actually hit 62 homers in 1961. But he lost one when an
early-season game at Baltimore was rained out. Mantle had homered
in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   7
</P>
<P>
   At-bats
</P>
<P>
   Although his team played eight fewer games, Babe Ruth had almost
as many plate appearances when he hit 60 homers in 1927 as Maris
did in 1961. Ruth came to bat 678 times; Maris 684. The 1927 and
'61 teams both played tie games.
</P>
<P>
   8
</P>
<P>
   Asterisk
</P>
<P>
   In his ``asterisk ruling,'' commissioner Ford Frick declared
that Ruth's home-run record had to be broken in 154 games _ the
length of the American League schedule until 1961. However, Maris'
61 never really carried an asterisk. Both Maris and Ruth were
listed in the record books until 1991, when commissioner Fay
Vincent ruled that only Maris' record stood.
</P>
<P>
   9
</P>
<P>
   Numbers
</P>
<P>
   Maris boycotted Yankee Stadium after his trade to St. Louis but
relented in the early 1980s. His No. 9 was retired on Oldtimers'
Day in 1984 and a plaque unveiled in the stadium's monument park.

 &HT;    Maris' son has mixed feelings
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Maris was 13 months old when his father, Roger, hit No.
61, and he has spent a lifetime living with the record. Naturally,
he'll be sad when the mark falls, he said, but glad that his dad is
finally geting some of the recognition he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's finally getting his due,'' said Kevin, baseball coach at
Oak Hall School near Gainesville, Fla. ``It's really helped boost
him in the light of a new generation of kids that didn't really
understand who Roger Maris was and what he accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, the third of six children, drove 5 1/2 hours to Atlanta
in August to meet Mark McGwire when the Cardinals were playing the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely mixed emotions,'' said Kevin, 38. ``I think
anytime anybody sets a record ... they don't want to see the record
just gone. I think they'd be lying if they told you different. Even
if it is broken, dad will still be American League record-holder.''
</P>
<P>
   And if his father were alive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's enjoying every bit of it,'' Kevin said. ``I'm
sure he's watching every swing from up there.''

 &HT;    Falcons' biggest woe is poor attendance
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jessie Tuggle, who has been around longer than any other current
Atlanta Falcon, has seen a lot in his 11 seasons. But two things at
least he's never witnessed: a Falcons' victory in the road-opener
and a win at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   So when Tuggle and his teammates line up to play the Panthers
Sunday in Ericsson Stadium, the middle linebacker will be chasing
down a couple personal demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize it had been 12 years since we won one (a
31-10 win at New Orleans in 1986); that's kind of amazing,'' said
Tuggle, who is 0-11 in road openers, beginning with his rookie
season in '87. ``All I really remember is a lot of them (for a
total of five) were in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   But as season-openers go, this one is about far more important
matters than snapping that ugly streak, or the one that has seen
the Falcons lose all three games played in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons franchise lost between $8 million and $10 million
last season, when their second straight miserable start _ 1-7,
after an 0-8 mark in 1996 _ doomed the team in the eyes of fans,
who stayed away by the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta sold an average of 48,003 ticket per game last year,
ranking 28th out of 30 NFL teams, ahead of only Tennessee and
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 39,841 bothered showing up, meaning that 8,162 _
17 percent _ had tickets each week but found another way to spend
their time.
</P>
<P>
   At least this game can be seen on television (Fox, Channel 5)
unlike all of those home games, which have been blacked out locally
for the past two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a chance to make a very important impression on
potential paying customers. The Falcons have sold about 42,000
tickets for the Sept. 13 home-opener at Philadelphia, some 30,000
of them season tickets, down from 31,219 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Dome's capacity is 71,228, and team president Taylor
Smith said the Falcons need to sell an average of ``about 55,000''
tickets to begin thinking about black ink after two years of red
ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is huge,'' said Rob Jackson, vice president of
marketing &AMP; sales. ``It's important for fans to see the
improvements (head coach) Dan Reeves has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more than 5,000 decisions away from selling that Dome
out, because we know that most of those decisions (are) going to be
almost four tickets per decision. We've got to get these casual
fans interested in our product, and it's a 3 1/2-hour commercial
every time we're on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   History says it will be a hard sell. The Falcons have had just
seven winning seasons in 32, and 13 of the last 15 seasons have
been below .500. Although they're 16-16 in season-openers, home or
away, the Falcons are 9-22-1 in all road-openers.
</P>
<P>
   After their miserable start last season, the Falcons won six of
eight and hope to build on that finish.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NFL went to a 16-game schedule in 1978, of the 269
teams that lost opening games, 209 (77.7 percent) did not make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking to have a winning record, and make the
playoffs, that shows you how important winning the opening game is,
particularly against an (NFC West) division opponent,'' Reeves
said. ``We're trying to win fans, so it's certainly important for
us to start as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Even players realize that this game is big for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a lot of people watching, and if we win,
it will help the following week,'' wide receiver Terance Mathis
said. ``And not only do we (at least) need to win in the last
seconds, we need to go out there and have a great performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win a game on the road decisively, people say,
'What's this team about?' and maybe they'll come watch. If you
pound on them on the road, there's no question you're a good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Smith knows the Falcons are facing an uphill battle, one
made more difficult because many of metro Atlanta's 3 million
residents are not natives. The team's track record also has created
a deeply rooted pessimism about the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's deserved, because we haven't been a consistent
winner,'' Smith said. ``It's a great market, a great city to be in,
but because of our history, we've put ourselves in this position.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be successful, we have to build the fan base. There
are a lot of people who have not been won over, the million or so
people who have moved to Atlanta the past 10 years. And a lot of
others are skeptics, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are guaranteed just $4 million per year in Dome
revenue, a number that goes up only when stadium revenues go past a
certain point. In comparison, the Dallas Cowboys get $40 million in
stadium revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Falcons' slice of the pie from the NFL's new TV
deal figures to increase quite a bit, from about $42 million last
year to an average of about $73 million over the next eight years,
the salary cap likewise took a big jump this season, pushing
payroll up by more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are trying hard to change their image, and generate
money through game-day revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and his staff have worked out corporate sponsorships
with Ingles supermarkets, Georgia Power Co., Delta Air Lines,
Arby's, Sprint, Reebok, among others. They're helping foot the bill
for increased and upbeat advertising and promotion, and some of the
companies are buying tickets by the thousands for some games.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the emphasis is the team's new radio contract with
Jacor Communications, which has more than 100 stations around
Georgia, and with WAGA/Channel 5.
</P>
<P>
   But image isn't everything. It won't matter that the Falcons
have the lowest average ticket price in the NFL at $32.15 if the
product isn't very good. Getting that family or that group of four
to spend what is calculated to be an average of $185 per foursome
on parking, tickets, beer, soft drinks, souvenirs and a program is
in large measure out of Jackson's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we see it, we have different layers of fans,'' he said.
``The die-hards who are going to be at the Dome all the time, fans
who will go to a few games and the casual fans, those who might
listen on the radio or watch on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got that casual fan out there who's not going to
stay home from Stone Mountain Park; he's going to cut the grass, go
picnicking, ride his bike or something. We've got to get these
casual fans interested in our product. And if we play well,
especially on TV, that's very big.''

   NEW YORK _ Death spoke its name in a dozen languages.
</P>
<P>
   When Swissair Flight 111 plunged into the inky waters off Nova
Scotia Wednesday night, it took an uncommon number of lives of
dogged humanitarianism. It claimed a tireless battler against the
scourge of AIDS and researchers perched on the seemingly fathomless
frontiers of science.
</P>
<P>
   It took a contingent of U.N. workers settled into a flight as
familiar and reassuring to them as the evening commuter train,
people who intrepidly hopscotched across the tender borders of
war-torn nations but met their end near a tranquil fishing village.
But most starkly it visited heartache on a dozen countries on two
continents.
</P>
<P>
   The cold statistics of the disaster were merciless. All 215
passengers and 14 crew members on the plane bound for Geneva from
Kennedy Airport in New York died.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger roster was something of a kaleidoscope of the
world's nations. Swissair said there were 136 passengers from the
United States, 30 from France and 28 from Switzerland. A half-dozen
came from the United Kingdom and three from Italy. There were two
passengers from Greece mixed in with solitary travelers from Saudia
Arabia, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Spain, Iran, St. Kitts and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Air disasters rarely excuse anyone. Two of the victims were mere
infants. One man was bumped off two other flights that night before
getting a seat on the one that would never land.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday night, Swissair had not yet released the
passenger manifest of Flight 111, as officials continued the grim
task of notifying relatives. However, colleagues and relatives
confirmed the identities of some of those who boarded the doomed
airliner.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Mann, who helped shape the international campaign
against AIDS, was traveling on the flight with his wife, Dr. Mary
Lou Clements, to attend AIDS-related meetings in Geneva. A public
health physician, he founded the Global Program on AIDS in 1986 for
the World Health Organization. In 1990, he resigned in bitter
protest against WHO's failure to move faster, and recently he
became the first dean of a new public health school at Allegheny
University of the Health Sciences in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clements was an epidemiologist and vaccine expert who headed
the center for immunization research at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Hygiene and Public Health. Both she and her
husband were 51 and lived in Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gostin, a director of the Georgetown University-Johns
Hopkins University Program on law and public health who knew Mann
for some 20 years, remembered Thursday how he had accompanied Mann
on the first day he entered the WHO building in Geneva: ``It was
literally Jon and one Swiss secretary. He built that program within
a matter of years to be, by far, the largest disease- prevention
program in the history of the WHO. That alone, his mobilization of
the world against AIDS, is his greatest legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Mann, one of Mann's daughters, is a student of Gostin's at
Georgetown University Law Center. Gostin said he spoke to her only
hours before the crash and she mentioned that her father was
contemplating moving overseas to reapply his zeal to international
work.
</P>
<P>
   To workers at the United Nations, the nightly Flight 111 was
affectionately known as the U.N. airbus because it served as
something of a commuter flight for officials and diplomats
shuttling back and forth between the secretariat in New York and
the European headquarters in Geneva. ``This is a flight that so
many of us take routinely that I think it spooked a lot of us,''
said Fred Eckhard, the U.N.'s senior spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Few Swissair 111 flights lift off without at least a few U.N.
people buckled into their seats. And thus as soon as U.N. workers
learned the flight number, they knew that some of their people were
gone.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials identified seven staff members or associates,
including Mann, as having perished in Wednesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families of all the
victims, and in particular to the relatives and friends of all
those who lost their lives in the service of the ideals of the
United Nations,'' said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan from
Durban, South Africa, where he was attending the summit meeting of
nonaligned nations.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included Pierce Gerety, 56, an American lawyer who
had devoted his life to the plight of refugees. Only an unlikely
convergence of events put him on the plane. According to his
brother, Tom Gerety, president of Amherst College, he had a ticket
for a KLM flight to Amsterdam. It was overbooked and he was bumped
along with some others. He was put on a Swissair flight. It was
canceled. His consolation was a ticket on Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of operations for the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees in the ravaged Great Lakes region of Central Africa,
including Rwanda, Gerety seemed to spend more nights in tents with
refugees than he did in his own home. Wherever war, famine and
social unrest uprooted people from their homes, he was there. Time
and again, he stared death in its face and scared it off.
Associates said he was shot at, narrowly evaded bombs and never
shied from jumping aboard a rickety plane for a perilous flight
into the bush. They could only wonder how he could die in the
comfort of a gleaming commercial jet.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Calvert-Mazy, 37, a French social worker and therapist
who worked as senior welfare officer in the Geneva headquarters of
the refugee unit, also died in the crash. She had counseled
refugees in Bosnia, Mali and Rwanda, and had transferred to Geneva
in June so she could spend more time with her husband and baby.
</P>
<P>
   Others victims among the U.N. family were Joachim Bilger and
Ludwig Beaumler, Germans who were respectively the controller in
the office of internal oversight and productivity and the senior
director for international and operational affairs with the World
Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva.

   Two officials with UNICEF were on the flight. Yves de Roussan, a
Canadian, worked with adolescents who were abandoned or ran afoul
of the law and was UNICEF's regional adviser for Central and
Eastern Europe. Ingrid Acevedo, 32, an American who was director of
public relations for UNICEF's U.S. National Committee, was on her
way to attend a meeting to plan for an annual communications
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   As an expression of mourning, all 185 flags of the U.N.'s member
states were taken down Thursday at the U.N. complex perched along
the East River in midtown Manhattan. The blue and white U.N. flag
was lowered to half-staff in both New York and in Geneva. A
memorial service was planned in Geneva for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had its share of chronic fliers. It was small wonder
that Norman Scoular was on a plane flight Wednesday night. Last
year, in carrying out the demands of business, he spent 337 nights
in hotel rooms. Scoular, 45, a Scottish-born resident of
Manchester, England, was the chief executive of Sylvania Lighting
International, which had been recently acquired by SLI Inc. of
Canton, Mass., and of which he had become chief operating officer.
After meeting with SLI officials, he had boarded Flight 111 to go
to Geneva to shut down an office there.
</P>
<P>
   Don Scheer was a 49-year-old biochemist from Norfolk, Mass., who
journeyed the globe promoting his discoveries. He was in fact
tiring of the travel and Tuesday night told his brother, Jerry,
that after one more trip to Europe to tout a product he designed to
separate DNA strands, he was going to sink into his couch, flick on
his 35-inch television and scream his lungs out for the Cleveland
Indians, the team he loved. Scheer took Flight 111 with his wife,
Diane. He was going to Budapest and then planned to join her in
Greece for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought the Indians stunk and weren't going anywhere, but
that was his team,'' said Jerry Scheer, laughing for a minute as he
remembered that last conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved sports,'' Jerry Scheer said. ``We talked about
college football coming up. We talked how on Thanksgiving we were
going to watch three football games in a row. And then I told him,
``Have a safe trip.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., said that it
lost both a physicist and a guest researcher in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Kinder-Geiger, 36, a German citizen who was an associate
theoretical physicist at the laboratory, was on his way to Trento,
Italy, where he was to speak at a physics workshop. He then planned
to continue his work at a particle physics laboratory in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Per Spanne, 53, a Swedish citizen, was a guest researcher at
Brookhaven's Synchrotron Light Source facility. His career was
rooted in finding new ways to use X-rays to diagnose disease and
for high-resolution imaging of objects. He helped pioneer a
technique known as phase-contrast microtomography that allows
detailed images of the interior of solid objects.
</P>
<P>
   As is always true with international flights, even in the last
gasps of summer, some of the passengers were bound for pleasure.
John Mortimer, 75, a former executive of The New York Times, had
boarded the flight with his wife, Hilda, 69, on their way to a
vacation in the south of France. Mortimer had joined The Times in
1965 as the paper's industrial relations director and held several
personnel and industrial relations positions before, in 1982, being
named assistant to the president of New York Times Co. He retired
at the end of 1983. Mrs. Mortimer was on the staff of various
non-profit organizations engaged in education exchange and other
international issues. They lived in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Nelson was on Flight 111 to carry out a good deed and for
love. She was to meet her boyfriend, Edward Fierastale, in Geneva.
They were then traveling to Grenoble, where he was going to propose
to her and she was going to help her sister, Judy, nine months
pregnant, give birth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson, 35, was a naturopathic doctor who spurned drugs in
favor of natural agencies like herbs and sunshine. She recently
closed her practice in Mystic, Conn., and was about to open an
office in Manhattan, where her parents live. ``You couldn't get an
appointment with Tara,'' said her mother, Sheila, who was in tears.
``It would take six months. She was so successful. And she met her
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster inevitably has its other side, those individuals whose
moments of vacillation saved their lives. Marc Rosset, 27, the
Swiss tennis player, told reporters at the U.S. Open that he was
booked on the doomed Flight 111 after his first-round defeat forced
his early departure from the tournament. Not long before he was due
at the airport, he said he chose to stay one more day to get in
some practice with the top-level hitting partners available at the
tournament.

SENATE DEMOCRATS TRY TO COUNTER ARMS INSPECTOR'S CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Del., Ind., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats mounted a careful counterattack
Thursday against the American who resigned in protest last month
from the weapons inspection team in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The senior inspector, William Scott Ritter Jr., Thursday
repeated his charges that the Clinton administration had blocked
efforts by U.N. inspectors to ferret out Iraq's clandestine
biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs, even as
Washington publicly supported the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare joint hearing of Senate committees, Democrats praised
Ritter's dedication and candor, and even agreed with his
frustration over the administration's decision to seek a diplomatic
resolution rather than confront Iraq when it stymied inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also said that using military force to compel Iraq
to allow the inspections was a complicated political and diplomatic
decision that was not up to Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That responsibility to take the nation to war is above your
pay grade,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking
Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., told Ritter, ``I admire your
singlemindedness even though I may disagree with you on the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan politics infused Thursday's hearing of the Armed
Services and Foreign Relations Committees. Democrats temporarily
blocked the hearing even before it started, arguing that senior
administration witnesses who could rebut Ritter are out of the
country traveling with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   To allow the hearing to proceed, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott put the Senate in recess and took the unusual step of
personally escorting Ritter to the witness table in the packed
Senate hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show my support for a man of courage,'' Lott said
in an interview later.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress is increasingly critical of
the administration's handling of foreign policy crises, from Iraq
to North Korea to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are again at a serious crisis point with Iraq,'' said Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``No one appears to be quarterbacking a game
plan in which intrusive inspections continue and produce results.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, 37, a former Marine intelligence officer, has said that
between last November and this August, the administration made at
least seven efforts to stymie an investigation by the U.N. Special
Commission, known as Unscom, which is charged with destroying
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has undermined Unscom's efforts through
interference and manipulation, usually coming from the highest
levels of the administration's national security team,'' said
Ritter, citing Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said the United States, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
and the Security Council were complicit in the decision to avoid a
confrontation with Iraq, in order to maintain the embattled
international sanctions against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq provokes a confrontation, knowing there will be no
consensus in the Security Council, and knowing they'll get a
concession,'' said Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said that two separate inspections _ one in July and
another in August _ were canceled, despite ``hard intelligence''
about the location of ballistic missile components and information
about how Iraq was concealing other forbidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that without an aggressive inspections program,
Iraq could rebuild its nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals
within six months. Ritter said Iraq possessed the components for
three nuclear weapons, and lacked only the necessary fissile
material to complete the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted Thursday that they still
support the U.N. inspections, but reserved the right to weigh the
projected gains from any inspections against the political and
diplomatic down side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect this guy,'' said an administration official about
Ritter. ``But the U.S. is given a fair amount of information. And
the moments are rare when an inspection goes for something like
this and is successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats voiced agreement that Ritter had
forced Congress and the administration to review the policy toward
Iraq, and to examine whether they have the stomach to use force,
even unilaterally, to back up the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to make some fundamental decisions about
whether to follow a policy of containment or deprive Iraq of its
weapons of mass destruction,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.

   NEW YORK _ As relatives of passengers aboard Swissair Flight 111
filed into the Ramada Plaza Hotel at John F. Kennedy Airport
Thursday and huddled in a private conference room to wrestle with
their grief, the scene carried poignant echoes of July 1996, when
families reeling from the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800
gathered under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar sense of astonishment over what had
happened. There was a similar hunger to know how and why.
</P>
<P>
   But what appeared to be missing, at least for now, was the
rancor. For while TWA drew fury from some relatives and politicians
for taking too long to confirm Flight 800's passenger list and not
tending aggressively enough to families' needs, Swissair and Delta,
the U.S. carrier through which some passengers had booked their
tickets, seemed intent on avoiding those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, director of the mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said there was ``no comparison'' between the actions of
Swissair and Delta and those of TWA two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an extraordinary amount of care and attention
paid to the details, which can make a horrendous situation that
much more horrendous,'' Hauer said Thursday. ``I've seen questions
get answered, and I've seen needs get met quickly, efficiently and
with great compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who stormed television news programs in
1996 to attack TWA, offered Swissair and Delta nothing but praise
at a press conference early Thursday evening at the Ramada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines have handled this exceptionally well from the
beginning,'' the mayor said. ``Not only did they have plenty of
people, but they had people trained to know how to deal with this
kind of situation.''

RENO RENEWS INQUIRY INTO ISSUE ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two years of rejecting calls for an outside
investigation of spending by the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign,
Attorney General Janet Reno has seized on a Federal Election
Commission audit to reopen the Justice Department's review of
whether an independent prosecutor should examine the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the findings of FEC field auditors, subpoenaed by
the Justice Department, strongly questions the legality of a
multimillion advertising campaign underwritten by the Democratic
National Committee in 1996 that indirectly helped the Clinton-Gore
campaign, government officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The summary memorandum grew out of a routine financial review of
the 1996 presidential election that is due to be completed by the
end of the year. The memo concluded that so-called party ``issue
ads'' paid for by the DNC were really thinly veiled Clinton-Gore
re-election ads and thus violated campaign spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno decides to proceed with an outside inquiry after a
90-day preliminary review, President Clinton could be a pivotal
subject because he was deeply involved in the ad campaign. He
approved scripts for the ads and discussed the ads with his
political consultants. A former political adviser, Dick Morris, the
architect of the advertising campaign, called the president the
``day-to-day operational director of our TV-ad campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, James Kennedy, a White House spokesman, called the
use of the issue ads ``entirely legal and appropriate.'' Kennedy
emphasized that the ads were ``cleared by legal counsel'' and did
not violate campaign spending limits. ``We are confident that, at
the end of its review, the Justice Department will arrive at a fair
conclusion based on the facts and the law,'' Kennedy said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, met with Reno's
advisers to persuade the Justice Department to postpone a decision
on the issue until the preliminary audit findings are reviewed by
the election commission, the officials said. He is said to have
also urged Justice Department officials to keep the focus of the
inquiry on the campaign instead of Clinton. On Thursday, Kendall
would not discuss the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers who have seen the FEC memo, the auditors
concluded that the Democratic issue ads contained electioneering
messages that could have violated federal election laws. Issue ads
are supposed to be generic party messages, not appeals for specific
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors also found that the issue ads paid for by the DNC
should be counted as contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign. If
the auditors' conclusions are upheld by the FEC, the Clinton-Gore
campaign could be sanctioned and fined for exceeding the spending
limits that apply to publicly funded campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's aides expect that she will use the auditors' conclusions
to advance to a 90-day preliminary investigation, a step that could
lead to appointment of an independent prosecutor, the officials
said. That decision, which is expected next week, would represent a
stark reversal for the attorney general, who has stated
emphatically on three separate occasions that the Justice
Department's investigations into the ads uncovered no evidence of
any crime.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, Reno has appeared to soften in her resolve
to avoid an outside inquiry into campaign finance issues. Within
the last week, she has ordered two 90-day inquiries, one into Vice
President Al Gore's statements about his telephone solicitations
from the White House and another intotestimony to a Senate
committee by Harold Ickes, a presidential adviser, about White
House involvement with the Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   An independent counsel's inquiry into the issue ads, however, is
potentially far broader than those likely to emerge from the Gore
or Ickes matters, because it goes to the heart of the financing of
the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said on Thursday that despite
Reno's past unwillingness to invoke the independent counsel
statute, she has not altered her interpretation of the law. In
July, when Reno appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, she
defined what appeared to be a narrow approach to applying the
independent counsel law to violations of federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law governing these allegations is far from clear and it
is impossible to conclude on what we know that anyone could have
violated it knowingly and willfully,'' Reno said. ``At the same
time, the FEC is pursuing this and if they determine that there is
evidence, they will refer it to us and if it reflects on a covered
person and is specific and credible with respect to a covered
person, I will trigger the act.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In contrast to her past refusals to refer the Democratic issue
ads to an independent prosecutor, Reno quickly seized on the
auditors' memo even before the FEC itself reached any conclusion on
the matter. The FEC commissioners have not yet reviewed the final
1996 audit, and the Clinton-Gore campaign has only recently
submitted its response challenging the auditors' conclusions. In
the past, the commissioners have sometimes rejected the conclusions
of the auditors. The commission itself has also lost some court
battles in attempts to restrict issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Justice Department's focus appears to be on the
Democrats, election commission auditors have also questioned the
legality of issue ads paid for by the Republican National Committee
that benefited the campaign of Bob Dole, the party's 1996
presidential candidate. A lawyer for the Dole campaign declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore campaign defended the legality of the ads, as
did Democratic Party officials. In an interview, Joseph Sandler,
the DNC's general counsel, said, ``Our view is that the audit
report isn't evidence of anything.'' A spokeswoman for the election
commission declined to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler said he and Lyn Utrecht, the Clinton-Gore campaign's
general counsel, sat in on virtually all of the creative meetings
where the issue ads were designed to make sure that they did not
run afoul of election laws. Sometimes, the lawyers had heated
arguments with Morris and the creative team over how prominently
the president and his re-election message should be featured in the
party ads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the highly technical nature of federal election
regulations governing issue advertising, Sandler said ``It won't
shock me that lawyers would disagree'' about the legality of the ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The ads fall in a murky and relatively untested area of election
law. The political parties are allowed to underwrite advertising as
long as the ads do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of
specific candidates. While federal candidates must pay for their
own ads with contributions that are limited by the election laws,
the political parties can pay for a big portion of their
advertising with unlimited contributions from wealthy individuals,
corporations and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the issue ads were among the first accusations
to emerge from the 1996 campaign. During the president's
re-election, Democrats poured $42 million of party funds into an
advertising blitz designed by Clinton and his campaign consultants.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno weighs her decision, the political parties have joined
in a lawsuit to expand the use of issue ads. Their lawsuit against
the Federal Election Commission, filed earlier this year by the
Republican National Committee and the Ohio Democratic Party, is
pending. Republicans have announced plans for a multimillion issue
ad campaign focusing on the scandals of the Clinton administration
and calling for more honesty in government.

SENATE PANEL UNEXPECTEDLY DEFERS BANK REFORM BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the last minute Thursday, the Senate Banking
Committee postponed consideration of a bill to overhaul the
nation's banking laws as an unexpected dispute emerged over banking
services for low-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the bill was delayed for two weeks after an early
morning session in which Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, announced that
he would offer an amendment to weaken provisions in the bill
requiring new financial companies to provide services to low-income
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's proposal would have unraveled a carefully arranged set
of amendments worked out by banking, insurance, brokerage and
consumer groups to assure that the committee would pass the bill
and move it to the Senate floor. The measure would sweep away
Depression-era restrictions that separate banks from the insurance
and securities industries.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, Congress has debated whether to make it
easier for financial-services conglomerates to be created. In a
historic vote in May, the House approved a measure allowing for
those changes. Momentum had been building in Congress for the
Senate to take up the measure before adjourning in October instead
of forcing Congress to begin the process over again next year.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 90 financial-services lobbyists lined up outside
the Senate Banking Committee room and with the meeting about to
begin, word of the postponement began to spread through the
hallways.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the meeting was to begin, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., the chairman of the committee, issued a statement saying
that although the panel had ``made substantial progress in
resolving the major issues that have divided the financial services
community for years, we have not been able to resolve all of the
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet lobbyists for banks, insurance companies and Wall Street
firms expressed confidence Thursday that the measure still had a
chance of passing, although few welcomed the delay. ``This delay
came as an enormous surprise to all of us,'' said Kenneth Guenther,
spokesman for the Independent Banks Association of America. ``But
the bill is not dead in any way. It still has surprising momentum
and bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Gramm amendment would have eliminated
provisions that extend requirements of the Community Reinvestment
Act to new financial-services conglomerates _ even though
conglomerates like Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
have said they are willing to accept these rules, which require
banks to extend loans in areas in which they collect deposits.
Historically, Gramm has strongly opposed any requirements on banks
to provide services to low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Gramm has heartfelt and strong objections to the CRA
act, and his views have been plain from the beginning,'' said Larry
Neal, a spokesman for the senator. Neal said that Gramm supported
the bill except for the expansion of the requirements for
low-income areas.

CHIEF U.N. INSPECTOR REPORTS MORE INTERFERENCE FROM IRAQ  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector for Iraq said
Thursday that the government of Saddam Hussein had gone beyond its
decision to block surprise inspections and is now interfering with
routine monitoring operations.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector, Richard Butler, told the Security Council about
the deteriorating situation in Iraq as the United States and
Britain moved to keep comprehensive sanctions on the Iraqis until
they resume cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations introduced a resolution Thursday condemning Iraq
and putting future sanctions reviews on hold. The measure is
expected to be voted on next week, probably after more negotiations
with Iraq's supporters, the Russians and Chinese. Security Council
members will study the draft resolution over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission, said Thursday
that he had been able to carry out only the increasingly
circumscribed activities that Iraq permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is less than the whole monitoring program,'' he told
reporters. ``We are doing no disarmament work.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler told the Council that Iraq had blocked the commission on
three occasions since Aug. 5, when the Iraqis stopped allowing new
on-site inspections and said they would allow only long-term
surveillance and monitoring of previously designated sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the second week of August, Butler said, the Iraqis refused
information about and access to equipment used for test-launching
their Samoud missile, saying it was outside the mandate of the
commission, known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, inspectors were told that they could not return to a
previously visited site because it was a military area. The Iraqis
had threatened in the past to exclude all military sites, which
would in effect gut large parts of the inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, Iraqis barred inspectors from a place where missile
parts had been tagged and stored by UNSCOM for further observation.
Iraq said the area was not a ``declared site,'' a distinction that
appears to have been turned into a new reason for denying access.
</P>
<P>
   In all such cases, refusals of access raise suspicions that the
material sought may have been removed and possibly returned to use
in prohibited weapons programs. Iraq must abolish all chemical,
biological, nuclear and certain missile systems as well as the
means of producing them for sanctions to end. With no support for
military action to enforce Baghdad's compliance, however, Iraq and
the Security Council appear to be settling in for a long standoff,
or another mediation effort by the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   British and American diplomats are banking on the growth of what
one envoy called ``a rising tide'' against the Iraqis, who have
been confident for a year that sanctions will be gone by the end of
1998. The Russians and Chinese, however, have continued to argue
for including encouraging overtures to Iraq, hoping that rewards
for cooperation will budge Baghdad in ways that threats will not.
</P>
<P>
   The British and American resolution introduced Thursday makes a
gesture in that direction, saying the Council will ``respond
favorably to future progress made in the disarmament process.''
</P>
<P>
   But some diplomats say that this does not go far enough, and
that if the Council had rewarded Iraq in July by closing the
nuclear inspection file and switching to long-term monitoring, Iraq
might not have become so obstructive a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese, Russian and other diplomats also favor a review of
relations with Iraq and possibly a restructuring of UNSCOM,
following Iraqi accusations that Butler and his inspectors have
overstepped their authority.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms of UNSCOM and Butler were resurrected after an
American inspector, William Scott Ritter Jr., resigned from the
commission, accusing the Security Council and Secretary-General
Kofi Annan of giving ground to the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative, said in an interview
on Monday before accompanying President Clinton to Moscow, where
Iraq was discussed among aides from both sides, that he saw no
likelihood of changes in UNSCOM, especially at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butler is safe because of his strong relationship with the
secretary-general,'' Richardson said. ``It's in the best interests
of the Security Council and the U.N. to keep such a credible
independent force like Butler doing his job. I think that despite
this latest scuffle, Butler has improved his standing with other
Security Council members besides Britain and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Annan has been much more supportive of Butler
behind the scenes than many believe to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in American policy from threatening Iraq militarily to
building a diplomatic front against Baghdad in the Security Council
has been welcomed by some pivotal members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a blessing,'' said Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's
representative and the chairman of the Council's Iraq sanctions
committee. ``Unilateral actions are very dangerous. We have enough
anger in the world. Why do we want to provoke more gaps between us
in the Western world and the Arabs? If we can contain Iraq in a
reasonable way, and I believe we can, is that not better than using
force?''
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro and several other envoys said there is no nation that
wants to tolerate Iraqi defiance or allow Iraq to escape sanctions
unilaterally, despite all its grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they comply,'' Monteiro said of the Iraqis. ``Then we
see what we can do to take them on board.''

   PEGGYS COVE, Nova Scotia _ The reek of jet fuel suffused the
salt spray Thursday as scores of search vessels, from Canadian
naval frigates to small fishing boats, criss-crossed dozens of
square miles of sea blanketed with the detritus of disaster _ a
child's ``Hello Kitty'' daypack, bits of fuselage, and corpses
rolling in the heavy swell.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers aboard Swissair Flight 111 apparently spent their
final terrifying minutes Wednesday night struggling into survival
gear while crew members gave safety instructions and the pilot made
a desperate descent toward the safety of Halifax International
Airport after reporting smoke on board.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 jet smashed into the cold Atlantic
about five miles south of this picturesque fishing village, killing
all 229 people aboard the flight bound for Geneva from New York's
John F. Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian investigators, the crash occurred 16 long
minutes after the pilot radioed the first distress call reporting
smoke in the cabin and passengers were told to ready themselves for
an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the several dozen bodies retrieved from the sea Thursday
were clad in life jackets. Most were so badly mutilated, however,
that it was impossible to determine whether they had suffered burns
or other injuries that might suggest an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash remained a mystery, although officials in
Ottawa and Washington were quick to downplay the possibility of a
terrorist bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preliminary indications do not point toward terrorism or
some other criminal activity,'' said Jim Margolin, a spokesman for
the FBI, adding that the federal law enforcment agency had not
dispatched a team to Canada. Investigators are working on the scene
at New York's JFK airport, however.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers Thursday night had all but abandoned hope of finding
survivors. ``We are continuing to look, but the sea is cold, and
time is passing,'' said Commander Rick Town of the Canadian Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels and aircraft continued to scour the sea in a massive
effort to locate the nearly 200 bodies still missing, but the
emphasis of the search was shifting to a ``technical search'' for
flight recorders and wreckage that might explain the horrific
crash.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of victims were Americans; Swissair reported that
136 passengers and one crew member were United States citizens. The
dead included Dr. Jonathan Mann, a former professor at Harvard's
School of Public Health and a pioneer in the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair, an international airline with one of the world's best
safety records, refused to release passenger lists until all family
members were notified. In addition to the Americans, a spokesman
said, the dead include 41 Swiss nationals, 30 French citizens and a
number of other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian search officials said it was impossible to give an
accurate count of bodies retrieved so far because searchers were
often finding only incomplete remains of humans torn apart by the
terrible impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene is very grisly, very confusing,'' said
Lieutenant-Commander Glenn Chamberlain of Canada's Maritime
Atlantic Command, specifying only that ``dozens'' of bodies had
been taken aboard vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was hampered by high waves and occasional rain
squalls, although visibility started improving around midday. Tides
and wind left debris spread across a wide swath of sea. The stench
of aviation fuel or the sight of torn bodies caused the eyes of
searchers to stream tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most terrible sight I've ever seen on the sea,''
said Craig Sanford, operator of a whale-watching boat that was
among the first vessels to reach the scene in the rain-lashed
blackness. ``There were bodies and pieces of people floating among
chunks of Styrofoam, cabin panels and luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the blackness of early morning, Canadian rescue
helicopters dropped parachute flares whose eerie orange glow
coupled with the sweep of searchlights provided the only
illumination for the fishing boats, naval frigates, Coast Guard
craft, police vessels and even a Dutch cruise ship that started
converging on the sea site within an hour of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out full of hope for survivors,'' said Major Donald
LeBlanc, pilot of a military Sea Stallion chopper that coursed over
the wreckage for hours before dawn. ``We had night vision goggles,
and were popping flares, but there was nothing to see but the
debris scattered everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The doomed aircraft was cruising at an altitude of 33,000 feet
in Canadian airspace a little over an hour after taking off from
New York at 8:18 p.m. Eastern time when the pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit and urgently requested permission to reverse course and
head for Boston's Logan Airport, according to Canadian
transportation safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   But air controllers directed Captain Urs Zimmermann to head for
Halifax because it was closer. Vic Derden, the &UR;  &LR; Canadian
Transportation Safety Board's investigator in charge of the
probe, &UR;  &LR; was asked by a reporter if it was accurate that rerouting
the plane consumed ``four or five minutes.'' Derden replied,
``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian air traffic controllers put the plane into a pattern to
dump its fuel. It was not clear whether fuel was jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Officials gave slightly conflicting time sequences, but the
plane apparently disappeared from radar view at 9:38 after
descending to 8,000 feet, where it was expected to dump over 200
tons of fuel in preparation for a crash landing. It hit the water a
few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Peterson, a security guard working a late shift near Peggys
Cove, was monitoring air traffic on his scanner radio. He told the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that he heard what may have been
the pilot's last frantic message. ``He said he was dumping fuel.
Then he said, `We're going down,''' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft plunged into rough seas between 20 and 30 miles
short of the runway after making a howling passage over Nova
Scotia's Aspotogan Peninsula. The precise site of the crash was
still unknown Thursday night and floating wreckage was strewn
within a radius of about 15 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was banging something loud, you could just tell something
was awful wrong,'' said Linda Reed , describing the plane as
shrieking so low over her family's home in the coastal hamlet of
Blandford that ``the windows rattled and the roof shook like it was
being ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple minutes later there came a sort of boom,'' she said.
``Then came only a silence.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours after the crash, there were persistent reports
of survivors, and Halifax's Queen Elizabeth II Hospital ordered
extra staff to stand by to prepare for an influx of injured.
</P>
<P>
   But the rumors were based on discovery of an empty life raft _
deflated and badly damaged _ and boat lights mistaken for rescue
beacons.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials will head the investigation into the crash
assisted by aviation safety investigators from the United States
and Switzerland. Forensic specialists from New England were also
headed for Nova Scotia to assist in the makeshift morgue at
Shearwater military base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will spare nothing in trying to discover all the reasons
for this tragedy,'' said Benoit Bouchard, chairman of the Canadian
Transportation Safety Board. ``We will be looking especially hard
at any possible lack of safety aspects that could have led to the
crash of Flight 111. Priority will be given to recovering the
aircraft's on-board flight recorders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it will be
immediately directed to the RCMP,'' he said, referring to the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials reported discovery of what appeared to be a
large section of fuselage resting in waters estimated to be 100
feet deep. Divers were reported ready to descend into the depths at
first light today as part of an investigation that could last
months.
</P>
<P>
   With its famous lighthouse, narrow harbor and brightly-painted
houses clinging like limpets to bare rocks rising from the sea,
Peggy's Cove is one of Atlantic Canada's most popular tourist
haunts. But Thursday the chartered buses and curious hordes were
replaced by media from across North America and Europe as the
village became command center for the recovery effort _ and a
drop-off point for vessels carrying grim cargo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 people were involved in the search, including
the crews of two Canadian warships, Coast Guard and police vessels
and an extraordinary flotilla of fishing boats and pleasure craft
that took risks on seas heaving with wreckage. The energies
directed by fishermen and other volunteers did not flag even after
it became obvious there would be no miracles, no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after you accept that, `No, we aren't going to find any
one alive out there,' you just keep going,'' said fisherwoman Ellen
Haynes, as she retrieved from the water a stuffed toy animal, a
woman's pocketbook, and a folder full of what appeared to be family
photos. ``You want to see these belongings returned to loved ones.
It isn't much, maybe, but it's what we can do.''

CLINTON URGES NORTHERN IRELAND TO STAND BY PEACE PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland _ President Clinton came to the
spiritual heart of this troubled land Thursday to urge its people
to stand by peace even as they are tested with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people attended a ``gathering for peace'' in
this historic city where St. Patrick built his stone church atop a
hill surrounded by lush green meadows and where Protestant churches
have added to the steepled skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for reminding us of one of life's most important
lessons, that is it never too late for a new beginning,'' Clinton
said to a cheering crowd after stops in Belfast, Omagh and Armagh.
``And remember, you will be tested again and again, but a God of
grace has given you a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, joined by British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, earlier consoled
the victims and families at Omagh where an Aug. 15 explosion in the
city center left 28 dead and 330 wounded. It was the worst
terrorist incident in 30 years of the Troubles, a term used to
describe the terrorist campaign and the strife in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``By killing Catholics and Protestants, young and old, men,
women and children, even those about to be born ... it galvanized,
strengthened and humanized the impulse to peace,'' Clinton told the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The president visited Northern Ireland for the second time in
three years to underscore his support for the Good Friday peace
plan that offers hope of a political end to the sectarian violence
between Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, approved by voters in Northern Ireland and Ireland
this spring, recreates a Northern Ireland Assembly to give both
Unionists and Nationalists representation while also reaffirming
Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom. The new
108-member assembly meets for the first time this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democratic underpinning of this agreement is now beyond
doubt or question. It is there by the will of the people and it is
our job to see the will of the people done,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived to banner headlines proclaiming a new
development in which David Trimble, first minister of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly, will meet next week with Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams. The announcement came after Sinn Fein, the
political arm of the Irish Republican Army, issued a declaration
saying violence must end.
</P>
<P>
   Adams sat in the audience at Belfast's Waterfront Hall where
Clinton made his first stop on a daylong tour of Northern Ireland.
Clinton and Blair were joined by Trimble, a Protestant, and Seamus
Mallon, the Catholic deputy first minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, as first minister, I will speak to anyone who
has the good of Northern Ireland at heart. But, of course, no
democrat can tolerate coercive threats. But once we can speak in
freedom, once we are agreed our only weapons will be our words,
then there is nothing that cannot be said; there is nothing that
cannot be achieved,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and others have wanted a tougher statement from Sinn
Fein. ``The path ahead is for true democrats only. And I cannot
reconcile seeking positions in government with a failure to
discharge responsibilities under the agreement to dismantle
terrorist organizations,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the U.S. national security adviser,
showed Clinton a copy of the newspaper highlighting next week's
meeting between Trimble and Adams as soon as the president stepped
off Air Force One after a flight from Moscow to Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the headline we wanted to see when we got here,''
Berger said. ``This is a very important step forward in terms of
the process of building peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In a private session between Clinton, Blair and the assembly
leaders, the president asked, ``What can I do to help?'' Clinton
had made a substantial political investment in the Northern Ireland
peace process, dispatching former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine to help broker the deal and repeatedly nudging
the process along.
</P>
<P>
   Later in his public address to the assembly members, Clinton
said, ``Difficult, sometimes wrenching decisions lie ahead, but
they must be made. And because you have agreed to share
responsibilities, whenever possible you must try to act in concert,
not conflict; to overcome obstacles, not create them; to rise above
petty disputes, not fuel them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on the assembly to ``decommission the weapons of
war,'' to form an executive council, to adopt a police force for
all people and bring an end to street justice and retaliations.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several deadly attacks since the peace accord
was voted into place, from the deaths of three young Catholic
brothers killed in a fire started by a bomb to the unprecedented
car bombing attack in Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be hard roads ahead. The terror in Omagh was not
the last bomb of the Troubles; it was the opening shot of a vicious
attack on the peace,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   At Omagh, the Clintons and Blairs met for more than an hour with
victims. After Clinton made a brief address to the families, he
talked to a 14-year-old girl blinded by the blast and her mother
who was working at the hospital as a radiologist the day of the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton was clearly moved by the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady as well as the Blairs also walked
down Market Street to view the devastation first hand. The car
bomb, set by extremists denounced by the IRA, destroyed surrounding
buildings on both sides of the street.
</P>
<P>
   The welcome in Northern Ireland proved a respite for Clinton
after a two-day summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin that
seemed to accomplish little in a nation beset by tremendous
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, Clinton's ideological kin, heaped praise upon the
president. ``I wish to say this to you: There is no president of
the United States of America that has done more for peace in
Northern Ireland than you,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons later flew to Dublin where they will spend two days
before returning to Washington.

GEPHARDT, IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, TRUMPETS PARTY'S ISSUES  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Trying to instill optimism about the November
elections, Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, arrived here
Thursday eager to snuff out talk of President Clinton's travails
with a rousing chorus of hard-core Democratic philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The word scandal or the name Monica Lewinsky did not drop from
Gephardt's lips once in his series of speeches at fund-raisers and
at a senior citizen center here. Instead, Gephardt, who angered the
White House last week with comments about possible impeachment
proceedings, tried to galvanize voters around the one strategy that
Democrats believe could bolster their party, or at least soothe it,
as the fall campaign season kicks off.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to talk about the issues because the issues are
important in people's lives,'' Gephardt, D-Mo., told supporters of
Peter Flood, who is challenging Rep. John Sununu, a Republican, in
New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we get our message across?'' Gephardt said. ``I believe we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his speeches Thursday took place, though, before a few
of his prominent counterparts in the Senate broke ranks with the
party leadership and denounced the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   On learning that Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut had
stopped just short of calling for Congress to censure the
president, but had excoriated him for ``immoral'' actions, Gephardt
seemed both bewildered and exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ought to get ahead of ourselves,'' he said.
``Let's not jump to conclusions. We need to deal with what's in
front of us. We'll take care of whatever comes, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gephardt rebuked the president for his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky just last week in calling Clinton's actions
``wrong and reprehensible,'' the congressman quickly tempered his
public comments. He had received angry phone calls from some
Clinton supporters and Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of
staff. Gephardt said that in a weekend telephone conversation, he
and the president spoke cordially about issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gephardt chose not to revisit the question of
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He has said he believes
that the president's public admissions have been sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   But answering reporters' questions earlier in the day, Gephardt
did not shy away from reinforcing his beliefs that a House
impeachment inquiry should be conducted in a ``fair and objective
way,'' without ``jumping to conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt also had sharp words for Republican leaders who were
drafting the framework for the inquiry and the report from the
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. So far, Gephardt
said, there has been no cooperation, an assertion disputed by
Republicans. Among other things, Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee say they are awaiting approval for money to hire more
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't talk to us,'' Gephardt said. ``If they do this the
way they have done everything in the past three years, it will not
be nonpartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the tension with Republicans, he cited the fact
that Abbe Lowell had yet to sign his contract to serve as minority
counsel because the Republicans had not yet approved the money for
it.
</P>
<P>
   And although Rep. Henry Hyde, the Illinois Republican who heads
the Judiciary Committee, has been praised as fair, and his lead
counsel, David Schippers, is a lifelong Democrat, Gephardt said he
was still concerned that the process could bog down in secrecy and
shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all has the appearance of being possibly bipartisan,'' he
said, ``but the proof is in the practice.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here in New Hampshire, where he campaigned for his party's
presidential nomination in 1988 and is expected to revisit the
trail again as a candidate in 2000, Gephardt tried to focus on the
Democrats' bread and butter issues, like education, managed health
care and Social Security. In his speeches, he cheered Clinton's
agenda on programs like education.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' prospects in the polls this year are far from
certain, consultants and strategists say. In an election that
favored incumbents from the start, the president's troubles could
hamper the enthusiasm of Democratic voters and keep even greater
numbers of them home.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats say fund-raising efforts have not suffered,
Republicans assert that they may take as many as 20 seats in
November. And some Republican candidates and incumbents are already
using the Lewinsky matter to chip away at the competition, framing
it in terms of values and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates and supporters said they simply wished
that the whole matter could be put to rest. The president has
behaved badly, they said, but his presidential record should speak
for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up believing I should look for the gold and iron in
everybody I came in contact with,'' Flood said, adding that he
would welcome a visit by the president. ``Clinton has a mother lode
of gold, only today it's his iron that's showing.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of Flood's supporter, Sharon Penasack, was decidedly
less upbeat about the political fallout surrounding Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's devastating,'' she said. ``I can see why any
politician wants to step away from this. I personally want to step
away.''

 &HT;    On Deck: New York Mets
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight at 7:40, Saturday at 1:15 p.m., Sunday and Monday
at 1:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: TBS will televise tonight and Sunday, Fox on Saturday
and Fox Sports South on Monday; WSB/750 AM will broadcast all four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, LHP Tom Glavine (18-5, 2.61
ERA; 10-4, 3.29 lifetime vs. Mets) vs. LHP Al Leiter (13-5, 2.47;
2-2, 2.12 lifetime vs. Braves); Saturday, RHP Kevin Millwood (14-8,
4.45; 1-0, 2.00) vs. RHP Bobby Jones (9-7, 4.14; 3-7, 5.38);
Sunday, RHP John Smoltz (13-3, 3.33; 8-7, 3.87) vs. RHP Rick Reed
(16-8, 3.27; 2-0, 3.89). Monday, LHP Denny Neagle (14-11, 3.69;
5-3, 4.05) vs. RHP Masato Yoshii (5-8, 3.91; 0-2, 8.39).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: The Mets lead the all-time series 201-199, but
the Braves have won all five meetings this season. ... Atlanta
closed the season's first half with a three-game sweep of the Mets
July 3-5 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mets leaders: Avg. _ John Olerud (.342). RBI _ Mike Piazza (93).
HR _ Piazza (28). SB _ Brian McRae (20). W _ Rick Reed (16). ERA _
Dennis Cook (2.10). SV _ John Franco (31).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: The Mets are in the middle of the NL wild-card race,
one game behind the Cubs. Their Tuesday loss in San Diego dropped
the Mets out of the wild-card lead for the first time since Aug.
17. ... When they won four of their last six games to finish 5-4
against the Giants, Dodgers and Padres on a West Coast road trip,
it marked the Mets' first winning West Coast trip since 1994 and
fourth in 18 such trips in the '90s. With three homers in each of
their last two games, the Mets hit 15 homers on that trip. ...
Since being acquired from Cincinnati, OF Lenny Harris has five
homers in 39 at-bats. He previously had hit just 20 career homers
in 2,775 at-bats (1,162 games). Edgardo Alfonzo has hit a
career-high 15 homers, nine in the last 30 games. ... When John
Franco recorded his 31st save Wednesday, it was also the 390th of
his career, tying him with Dennis Eckersley for second on the
all-time save list, 88 behind career leader Lee Smith. ...Todd
Hundley was scheduled to catch his first game Thursday since
undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery last Sept. 26 _ but it was
with the Mets' Class AAA Norfolk affiliate. After missing the first
88 games of the season, Hundley was activated July 11, playing as
an outfielder. After several fielding misadventures in left,
Hundley declared the outfield experiment a failure. He went on the
disabled list Aug. 28 with a sore right elbow and began a rehab
assignment Aug. 31 with Norfolk.

 &HT;    Tech receivers battle inexperience
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia Tech sophomore receiver Dez White was running a short
sideline pattern in a drill this preseason, one where he was
supposed to catch the ball and tap his feet for a few steps before
he got to the sideline. White caught the ball, started tapping and
somehow tripped over his feet and fell.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Rogers and Jon Muyres, who like White will start for the
first time at receiver on Saturday against Boston College, couldn't
help but laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they wouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   White was a freshman, nervous about his coaches' reactions.
Rogers and Muyres wouldn't even have been in the drill. Rogers was
working out with the running backs last year; Muyres was on the
defensive field as a free safety. But this year they could all
laugh, learn and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a receiver, you go full speed,'' White said. ``If
you don't do everything right, you'll end up on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   In the practices since Harvey Middleton and Derrick Steagall
departed, along with their 3,930 receiving yards and 22 touchdowns,
Tech'sreceivers have been toughened by remarks and articles
referring to them as a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken so much flak,'' White said. ``It's made us grow
together.''
</P>
<P>
   For at least one more day, the three players might be the best
judges of each other:
</P>
<P>
   Best hands: Currently, it's a tossup, while Mike Sheridan, the
only returning receiver, is still out with a knee sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Fastest: Both Rogers and White have been clocked in the 4.3
range in the 40. Rogers said Muyres has deceptively good speed.
</P>
<P>
   The best moves off the line of scrimmage: White.
</P>
<P>
   The best moves after a catch: Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   In the best shape: Not Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running (split end) one day I was out (with a sore
foot), running a bunch of deep cuts,'' Muyres said. ``He'd come
back in the huddle and bend over and say, `I've never felt like
this before.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I thought running backs did a lot of running,''
Rogers said. ``The receivers run more than any other guys on the
team. You've got to get in a different kind of shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The most experienced: White. He played 70 or 80 snaps at
receiver last year over a stretch of four or five games but only
one ball came his way. Still, White, who played mostly safety in
high school, has spent a year working with the receivers in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in there every day (last year) worried about how
practice was going to come out,'' White said. ``Now, I'm just more
relaxed and determined.''
</P>
<P>
   The most improved: Muyres. He earned a starting spot after a
strong spring practice, making the conversion back to offense where
he played two years ago as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of practice, the trio of players are ready for a
real test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time to get out there and show what we can do,''
Rogers said.

 &HT;    Williams ready for season to get going
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug Williams' demeanor is starting to change a little as he
moves closer to his place in college football history.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams leads Grambling University into Saturday's home
game against Alcorn State, he will coach his first game as the
successor to Eddie Robinson, college football's all-time winningest
coach. Williams, who coached at Morehouse College last season, has
been accommodating with all of the media requests and fan interest
leading up to the game, but he's ready to put all of it behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to get this first one over,'' said Williams who
returned to his alma mater eight months ago. ``The players are now
beginning to see a change in my demeanor. The volume of my voice
has changed. I'm getting less sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Tiger quarterback and Super Bowl MVP has been getting
three to four requests per day to appear on radio talk shows, and a
number of local and national writers have been in town on a daily
basis to witness the first preseason without Robinson since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand all of that, the interest in the changing of
the guard here,'' Williams said. ``But I've made sure that it
didn't interfere with practices. It hasn't been a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our players that we can't get caught up in all the hype
because, when all of that is over, it's going to come down to how
well they performed on the field. That's what's going to really
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to rebuild a tradition-rich program that has
fallen on hard times, Williams has tried to change the atmosphere
around a team that finished with back-to-back 3-8 records at the
end of Robinson's storied career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere now is more business-like,'' junior offensive
tackle Corey Bembry said. ``It's more competitive. You know that if
you don't work hard and prepare during the week, you aren't going
to play on Saturdays.'' How will the Williams' approach translate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the only thing I can guarantee,'' Williams said, ``is
that we'll play hard for 60 minutes. We'll compete.''

 &HT;    Georgia's terrors at tackle
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Athens _ When Georgia opens its season Saturday against Kent,
the Bulldogs will have a rookie quarterback, an inexperienced
receiving corps and a rebuilt offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Two things that won't change, however, are Georgia's anchors on
its offensive line _ senior bookends Matt Stinchcomb and Chris
Terry, perhaps the nation's best pair of tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say there might be a better tackle in the country, but I
don't believe there's two better tackles on one team,'' Georgia
coach Jim Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-6, 298-pounder from Parkview High, Stinchcomb played in
all 11 games as a freshman in '96 and earned his first career start
against Georgia Tech in the regular-season finale. He's started all
23 games since.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb was rated the third-best tackle eligible for next
spring's NFL Draft in preseason grades by National Football
Scouting, Inc., one of two services used by pro clubs. Wisconsin's
Aaron Gibson, rated the second-best senior available for the draft,
and Florida's Zach Piller were the only tackles rated ahead of
Stinchcomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Stinchcomb) might need a little more weight, but he's got a
big frame and long arms,'' said Bob Ferguson, vice president of
player personnel for the Arizona Cardinals. ``You can see he plays
hard. He looks like a blue-collar guy to me, and technically he
seems very sound.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gibson and Piller are both noted for their overpowering
strength, Stinchcomb, who has a 3.94 grade-point average in
business, says he uses technique and intelligence to dominate
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say my upper-body strength is sub-par,'' Stinchcomb said.
``My upper body has always lagged behind. I'm not overpowering up
top at all. I'm not going to annihilate a guy off the line and
drive him 10 yards back. But I've got long arms, so that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stinchcomb and cornerback Champ Bailey have a shot at
becoming Georgia's first consensus All-Americans since tailback
Garrison Hearst in 1992, some NFL insiders think that Terry could
move past Stinchcomb in the draft with a solid season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty underrated,'' Stinchcomb said, ``especially if you
take into account that he's only been doing this for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's in front of him,'' offensive line coach Chris
Scelfo said. ``He's growing into the position, and he knows what's
expected of him.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years, Terry, a 6-6, 290-pounder from Jacksonville,
was a little-used defensive end. He often was the odd man out in a
defensive front that included current NFL players Jason Ferguson
(N.Y. Jets), Jermaine Smith (Green Bay Packers) and Phillip Daniels
(Seattle Seahawks).
</P>
<P>
   ``I played behind some pretty good players on defense,'' Terry
said. ``I thought my time was going to come there. But when coach
Donnan came to Georgia, he told me he thought I could be a better
offensive tackle because of my height and size. Obviously, he was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb and Terry yielded only two sacks each last season,
Scelfo said. Stinchcomb graded at 90 percent or better blocking in
10 of 12 games; Terry graded over 80 percent in 8 of 12 contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those two tackles, we really feel like we'll be able to
run the football,'' Donnan said. ``And with an inexperienced
quarterback, that's going to be a must.

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, Sept.
2, about the political standoff in Moscow used a word erroneously
in a description of President Boris N. Yeltsin's news conference
comment on the nomination of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime

   PEGGYS COVE, Nova Scotia _ The reek of jet fuel suffused the
salt spray Thursday as scores of search vessels, from Canadian
naval frigates to small fishing boats, criss-crossed dozens of
square miles of sea blanketed with the detritus of disaster _ a
child's ``Hello Kitty'' daypack, bits of fuselage, and corpses
rolling in the heavy swell.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers aboard Swissair Flight 111 apparently spent their
final terrifying minutes Wednesday night struggling into survival
gear while crew members gave safety instructions and the pilot made
a desperate descent toward the safety of Halifax International
Airport after reporting smoke on board.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 jet smashed into the cold Atlantic
about five miles south of this picturesque fishing village, killing
all 229 people aboard the flight bound for Geneva from New York's
John F. Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian investigators, the crash occurred 16 long
minutes after the pilot radioed the first distress call reporting
smoke in the cabin and passengers were told to ready themselves for
an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the several dozen bodies retrieved from the sea Thursday
were clad in life jackets. Most were so badly mutilated, however,
that it was impossible to determine whether they had suffered burns
or other injuries that might suggest an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash remained a mystery, although officials in
Ottawa and Washington were quick to downplay the possibility of a
terrorist bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preliminary indications do not point toward terrorism or
some other criminal activity,'' said Jim Margolin, a spokesman for
the FBI, adding that the federal law enforcment agency had not
dispatched a team to Canada. Investigators are working on the scene
at New York's JFK airport, however.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers Thursday night had all but abandoned hope of finding
survivors. ``We are continuing to look, but the sea is cold, and
time is passing,'' said Commander Rick Town of the Canadian Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels and aircraft continued to scour the sea in a massive
effort to locate the nearly 200 bodies still missing, but the
emphasis of the search was shifting to a ``technical search'' for
flight recorders and wreckage that might explain the horrific
crash.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of victims were Americans; Swissair reported that
136 passengers and one crew member were United States citizens. The
dead included Dr. Jonathan Mann, a former professor at Harvard's
School of Public Health and a pioneer in the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair, an international airline with one of the world's best
safety records, refused to release passenger lists until all family
members were notified. In addition to the Americans, a spokesman
said, the dead include 41 Swiss nationals, 30 French citizens and a
number of other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian search officials said it was impossible to give an
accurate count of bodies retrieved so far because searchers were
often finding only incomplete remains of humans torn apart by the
terrible impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene is very grisly, very confusing,'' said
Lieutenant-Commander Glenn Chamberlain of Canada's Maritime
Atlantic Command, specifying only that ``dozens'' of bodies had
been taken aboard vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was hampered by high waves and occasional rain
squalls, although visibility started improving around midday. Tides
and wind left debris spread across a wide swath of sea. The stench
of aviation fuel or the sight of torn bodies caused the eyes of
searchers to stream tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most terrible sight I've ever seen on the sea,''
said Craig Sanford, operator of a whale-watching boat that was
among the first vessels to reach the scene in the rain-lashed
blackness. ``There were bodies and pieces of people floating among
chunks of Styrofoam, cabin panels and luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the blackness of early morning, Canadian rescue
helicopters dropped parachute flares whose eerie orange glow
coupled with the sweep of searchlights provided the only
illumination for the fishing boats, naval frigates, Coast Guard
craft, police vessels and even a Dutch cruise ship that started
converging on the sea site within an hour of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out full of hope for survivors,'' said Major Donald
LeBlanc, pilot of a military Sea Stallion chopper that coursed over
the wreckage for hours before dawn. ``We had night vision goggles,
and were popping flares, but there was nothing to see but the
debris scattered everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The doomed aircraft was cruising at an altitude of 33,000 feet
in Canadian airspace a little over an hour after taking off from
New York at 8:18 p.m. Eastern time when the pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit and urgently requested permission to reverse course and
head for Boston's Logan Airport, according to Canadian
transportation safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   But air controllers directed Captain Urs Zimmermann to head for
Halifax because it was closer. Vic Derden, the &UR;  &LR; Canadian
Transportation Safety Board's investigator in charge of the
probe, &UR;  &LR; was asked by a reporter if it was accurate that rerouting
the plane consumed ``four or five minutes.'' Derden replied,
``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian air traffic controllers put the plane into a pattern to
dump its fuel. It was not clear whether fuel was jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Officials gave slightly conflicting time sequences, but the
plane apparently disappeared from radar view at 9:38 after
descending to 8,000 feet, where it was expected to dump over 200
tons of fuel in preparation for a crash landing. It hit the water a
few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Peterson, a security guard working a late shift near Peggys
Cove, was monitoring air traffic on his scanner radio. He told the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that he heard what may have been
the pilot's last frantic message. ``He said he was dumping fuel.
Then he said, `We're going down,''' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft plunged into rough seas between 20 and 30 miles
short of the runway after making a howling passage over Nova
Scotia's Aspotogan Peninsula. The precise site of the crash was
still unknown Thursday night and floating wreckage was strewn
within a radius of about 15 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was banging something loud, you could just tell something
was awful wrong,'' said Linda Reed , describing the plane as
shrieking so low over her family's home in the coastal hamlet of
Blandford that ``the windows rattled and the roof shook like it was
being ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple minutes later there came a sort of boom,'' she said.
``Then came only a silence.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours after the crash, there were persistent reports
of survivors, and Halifax's Queen Elizabeth II Hospital ordered
extra staff to stand by to prepare for an influx of injured.
</P>
<P>
   But the rumors were based on discovery of an empty life raft _
deflated and badly damaged _ and boat lights mistaken for rescue
beacons.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials will head the investigation into the crash
assisted by aviation safety investigators from the United States
and Switzerland. Forensic specialists from New England were also
headed for Nova Scotia to assist in the makeshift morgue at
Shearwater military base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will spare nothing in trying to discover all the reasons
for this tragedy,'' said Benoit Bouchard, chairman of the Canadian
Transportation Safety Board. ``We will be looking especially hard
at any possible lack of safety aspects that could have led to the
crash of Flight 111. Priority will be given to recovering the
aircraft's on-board flight recorders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it will be
immediately directed to the RCMP,'' he said, referring to the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials reported discovery of what appeared to be a
large section of fuselage resting in waters estimated to be 100
feet deep. Divers were reported ready to descend into the depths at
first light today as part of an investigation that could last
months.
</P>
<P>
   With its famous lighthouse, narrow harbor and brightly-painted
houses clinging like limpets to bare rocks rising from the sea,
Peggy's Cove is one of Atlantic Canada's most popular tourist
haunts. But Thursday the chartered buses and curious hordes were
replaced by media from across North America and Europe as the
village became command center for the recovery effort _ and a
drop-off point for vessels carrying grim cargo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 people were involved in the search, including
the crews of two Canadian warships, Coast Guard and police vessels
and an extraordinary flotilla of fishing boats and pleasure craft
that took risks on seas heaving with wreckage. The energies
directed by fishermen and other volunteers did not flag even after
it became obvious there would be no miracles, no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after you accept that, `No, we aren't going to find any
one alive out there,' you just keep going,'' said fisherwoman Ellen
Haynes, as she retrieved from the water a stuffed toy animal, a
woman's pocketbook, and a folder full of what appeared to be family
photos. ``You want to see these belongings returned to loved ones.
It isn't much, maybe, but it's what we can do.''

DEMOCRATIC SENATOR DENOUNCES CLINTON ON LEWINSKY FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unleashing the swelling discontent among Democrats
about President Clinton, Sen. Joseph Lieberman denounced the
president's conduct in the Lewinsky scandal on Thursday as
``disgraceful'' and ``immoral'' and said the issue carried deep
moral consequences for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking forcefully yet deliberately in a 24-minute speech from
the Senate floor, Lieberman, a respected centrist Democrat from
Connecticut, punctured several of Clinton's explanations about
Monica Lewinsky, notably the president's assertion that his
relationship with her was a private issue within his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such behavior is not just inappropriate _ it is immoral,''
said the 56-year-old Lieberman, who was elected in 1988. ``And it
is harmful, for it sends a message of what is acceptable behavior
to the larger American family _ particularly to our children _
which is as influential as the negative messages communicated by
the entertainment culture.''
</P>
<P>
   While they were thoughtful and measured, Lieberman's remarks
were by far the most pointed of any Democrat thus far, and
threatened to undermine an intense drive by the White House and
leading Democrats to contain the political fallout from Clinton's
disclosure two weeks ago that he had an improper relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the talk of impeachment and resignation was
``unjust and unwise'' at this time. He stopped short of calling for
Congress to censure the president, as the senator had considered,
saying such a move would be premature. But he suggested there be
some sort of public rebuke of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's comments immediately prompted two of Lieberman's
Democratic colleagues, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and
Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, to break their silence and rise to the
Senate floor to praise Lieberman _ and offer more bristling words
for the president. And Republicans, including Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, lauded Lieberman's for what Lott termed his
``moral compass.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's grand jury testimony last month, Lieberman
became the first senator of either party to rise on the Senate
floor as it resumed session this week to address the disclosure.
When Lieberman began to speak, the chamber was relatively empty but
several of his colleagues soon came in. After his speech, the
senator sat alone, his hands folded in his lap, as colleagues from
both parties approached him. Sen. Thomas Daschle, the minority
leader, who had earlier this week tried to muzzle Lieberman and
other disaffected Democrats, put his arm around him.
</P>
<P>
   Other leading Democrats have scolded the president, but mostly
in terse statements; none had spoken out before Thursday about the
moral implications of Clinton's behavior. And many Democrats said
they feared that Lieberman's remarks would force Democrats who are
facing re-election in November to also speak at length about the
president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Standing calmly at his desk on the Senate floor and reading from
a text that advisers said he had been refining for several days,
Lieberman said he was provoked not only by Clinton's relationship
but by what he said was the president's failure to level with the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky not only
contradicted the values he has publicly embraced over the last six
years,'' Lieberman said. ``It has, I fear, compromised his moral
authority at a time when Americans of every political persuasion
agree that the decline of the family is one of the most pressing
problems we are facing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless,'' he continued, ``I believe the president could
have lessened the harm his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky has
caused if he had acknowledged his mistake and spoken with candor
about it to the American people shortly after it became public in
January.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was so concerned that Lieberman's words could be
politically devastating that Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of
staff, along with Daschle and others, implored him earlier this
week not to speak out at least until the president returned from
Russia and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman, unable to hold himself back any longer, said,
``The implications for our country are so serious that I feel a
responsibility to my constituents in Connecticut, as well as to my
conscience, to voice my concerns forthrightly and publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded in a low-key manner, careful not to
stoke the matter. ``The president has great respect for Senator
Lieberman because of the key role he has played in the president's
accomplishments on behalf of the American people,'' said Barry
Toiv, a White House spokesman. ``It's always hardest to hear
criticism from a friend. But I am sure the president will consider
Senator Lieberman's words with the same care with which they were
delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is the Senate's only practicing Orthodox Jew, and he
has often spoken out on moral issues. He is close to many
conservatives including William Bennett, a former education
secretary in the Reagan Administration, who, in his new book, ``The
Death of Outrage,'' also argued that Clinton's troubles have
threatened the moral foundation of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   His comments also carried particular weight because though
Lieberman and the president have clashed over matters such as
American policy toward Bosnia, the two have been longtime
confidants. Lieberman is chairman of the Democratic Leadership
Council, a moderate group, that Clinton headed before running for
president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lieberman's speech on Thursday evening could mark a turning
point in how members of Congress respond to the Lewinsky matter. As
the Watergate scandal was unfolding in March of 1974, Sen. James
Buckley of New York became the first conservative Republican to
call for President Richard Nixon's resignation. His remarks,
calling for ``an extraordinary act of statesman and courage,'' were
widely viewed as a major force in moving conservative opinion on
Capitol Hill against the president.
</P>
<P>
   With Lieberman's remarks, the tensions and anger within
Democratic ranks burst front and center. The White House had
already scrambled to respond to Democratic House candidates who
have said they do not want the president to campaign in their
districts. And senators in both parties said they spurned
entreaties from the White House for them to join the president in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go over there being asked Lewinsky questions
all the time,'' one Democratic senator said on Thursday, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``I'd rather talk about policy.''

WORST HAPPENS DESPITE AIRLINE'S BRILLIANT RECORD

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a safe airplane owned by one of the world's safest
airlines and flown by an unusually experienced crew.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wednesday's crash of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast
of Nova Scotia, only one MD-11 _ the second generation of the DC-10
_ had been destroyed in an accident. The last fatal accident for
Swissair was in Athens in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   All 229 aboard Swissair 111 died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The flight crew of Captain Urs Zimmermann, 50, and First Officer
Stephan Loew, 36, were both instructors with considerable
experience in the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   And still, the worst happened. While the cause of the crash is
yet to be determined, there are indications of an onboard fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great lingering fear, for lack of a better word, for
airmen is an inflight fire,'' said a veteran airline pilot who
Wednesday evening flew a Boeing 767 from Europe to New York's John
F. Kennedy Airport and who asked not to be identified. ``It can so
easily get out of control, your options are so limited and time is
so critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Swissair Flight 111, bound for Geneva, took off from Kennedy at
8:18 p.m. Wednesday with 215 passengers and a crew of 14 on board.
It was was handled by Federal Aviation Administration controllers
at the Boston Center in Nashua, N.H., as it flew over New England
and out into the Atlantic. Nothing seemed untoward.
</P>
<P>
   Supervision of the plane was handed off to Canadian controllers,
located in Moncton, New Brunswick, as Swissair 111 reached a point
in the Gulf of Maine, about 150 miles east of Nantucket and north
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers in Moncton handle virtually all airliners headed
to Europe from Boston and New York and from airports as far west as
Chicago and far south as Atlanta. This ``evening push'' is their
busiest time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Moncton controllers received the airplane, the
crew sent a distress message calling out ``Pan, pan, pan'' at about
9:15 p.m. (EDT). The crew reported there was smoke in the cockpit,
according to Tony Rushton, vice president of the Canadian Air
Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the precise language of aviation, the ``Pan'' call is not a
declaration of emergency, but rather the declaration of an
abnormality on board the airplane and that the crew may not follow
its flight plan.
</P>
<P>
   The crew then requested to head to Boston's Logan International
Airport. Swissair serves Logan and has a contract with Delta Air
Lines to perform maintenance work on its planes. Airlines usually
prefer to have planes land at airports where maintenance
relationships are already established.
</P>
<P>
   However, aviation sources said controllers informed the crew
that Logan was 192 miles away and Halifax International Airport was
42 miles away. The crew decided to go to Halifax and was vectored
toward that airport.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the pilot requested approval to dump fuel. ``It
was put into a pattern'' so it could dump the fuel, said Rushton,
who noted that he was relying on the recollection of controllers
who handled the plane, rather than radar tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear they were boring circles in the sky and dumping fuel,''
said one Federal Aviation Administration source.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel is jettisoned to lighten an aircraft on landing. The
maximum takeoff weight of an aircraft is always higher than the
maximum landing weight. A plane that is too heavy on landing may
overshoot the runway, or collapse its landing gear, or burst tires.
But in a life and death situation, aviation specialists said, a
pilot would declare an emergency and not use the ``pan'' call. Nor
would a pilot waste time dumping fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an aircraft is going to come out of the sky, no one is
bothering to ask the question: `What is the best weight to land
this aircraft at?''' said the veteran pilot. ``No one would stay
aloft just to dump fuel. It is simply nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is possible that the event on board seemed less of a
crisis than it was.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:25 p.m. (EDT) the pilot realized the gravity of the
situation and declared an emergency. It was the last transmission
received from the aircraft, Rushton said. About seven minutes
later, when the plane was between 10,000 and 8,000 feet altitude
the plane's identification signal disappeared from Moncton radar
scopes and controllers could not contact the airplane. They then
called search and rescue.
</P>
<P>
   For a few more moments, controllers could still see the blip of
the plane on the radar. Then it too disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the identifaction signal could have meant
only one thing: a complete electrical failure on board the aircraft
that would shut down the plane's transponder sending the
identification signal to radar. The loss of radio contact,
meanwhile, could be either because of an electrical failure or the
pilots had lost consciousness, succumbing to fumes in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of fumes that occur in a cabin of a burning airliner
are very quickly incapacitating,'' said the veteran pilot. ``The
crew can get pure oxygen. But it is possible, everyone on board was
dead when they hit the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, while Canadian officials are beginning their
investigation into the cause of the crash, some high ranking
transportation officials in Washington expressed dismay over the
slow pace with which the investigation is proceeding and expressed
concern about salvage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The US government offered to send US Navy salvage teams,
veterans of the TWA Flight 800 recovery operation in 1996, but the
Canadians declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they have their own Navy and they can do it,'' said
one National Transportation Safety Board official who asked not to
be identified. ``They can do it, but they will learn from the same
painful mistakes we learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 aircraft was delivered to Swissair in 1991. It had
35,998 flight hours and 6,554 takeoffs and landings. While the
successor to the DC-10, the MD-11 was a much more reliable aircraft
and underwent a full certification process from the FAA, as if it
was a brand new aircraft, rather than a derivative model.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft was positioned to do very well, but its
performance, in terms of range, did not live up to the advance
billing of its manufacturer, McDonnell-Douglas. Boeing, which
bought McDonnell-Douglas, had previously announced it would shut
down production of the plane in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, a
passenger advocacy group, said Swissair is ``among the world's
safest airlines. They are first rate and had not had a fatal
accident in 19 years. They have great maintenance, quality flight
training. Sometimes, even a good airline will have an aberational
event.''

<P>
   Still struggling with the aftermath of two strikes, the General
Motors Corp. reported Thursday that car and light-truck sales fell
36.4 percent in August. At the same time, the Ford Motor Co.
reported a stronger-than-expected 8.1 percent increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
   GM's lower sales pushed the industry down even though nearly all
auto companies selling vehicles in the United States reported
higher sales. Vehicle sales for the month totaled 1,229,989 cars
and light trucks, a decrease of 6.6 percent compared with sales in
the month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 675,173 cars were sold, down 8.8 percent, and truck
sales were off 3.8 percent at 554,816. The seasonally adjusted
selling rate dipped to 14.6 million cars and light trucks after
running at a rate of more than 16 million for the last three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the GM strike and the expiration of the loyalty
coupons,'' incentives that ran from April to July, ``these are very
strong numbers,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham
Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   GM sold 271,177 cars and light trucks during the month, a 36.4
percent decline compared with sales in August 1997. Car sales were
156,876, down 37.4 percent, and light-truck sales totaled 112,362,
down 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of nearly every model in GM's line dropped 30 percent to
40 percent. The largest sales declines were in vehicles with the
lowest inventories, such as full-size sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of GM's North American assembly operations were
closed for 54 days in June and July because of strikes by the
United Automobile Workers at two parts plants in Flint, Mich. GM's
plants are now operating on overtime to push inventory levels back
to normal in October.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of GM's August sales came in the last 10
days of the month. The level of sales in those 10 days were close
to the level of sales in the last 10 days of August 1997. For the
year so far, GM's vehicle sales trail 1997 sales by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Ford, sales were stronger than analysts expected. Ford
reported that its Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar divisions sold
323,599 cars and light trucks in August, an 8.1 percent increase
compared with figures from August 1997. Ford sold 129,527 cars, up
1.3 percent from a year earlier, and 189,809 light trucks, up 13.2
percent, a new industry record for monthly truck sales.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every major vehicle manufacturer reporting sales this
week experienced higher sales in August compared with those in the
month a year earlier; some set records.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the Chrysler Corp. were up 3.5 percent. Toyota
reported its best August ever for its Toyota and Lexus brands, up
10.9 percent. Sales of Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler-Benz, rose
75.8 percent, and BMW sales increased by 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen AG had its best August in 17 years, with a 71.3
percent increase in sales, passing full-year sales for 1997. Its
Audi brand enjoyed its best August since 1986, with sales up 37.7
percent. Volvo sales increased 8.5 percent, and Porsche AG sales
jumped 134.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru of America had its best August since 1989, with a 9.3
percent increase in sales. Mazda had its best month since March
1995, with sales up 37.8 percent. Kia Motors America reported sales
up 26.8 percent, and Nissan sales rose 2.9 percent. Isuzu sales
rose 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most automotive executives and automotive analysts predict the
industry will close the year on a high note despite the
roller-coaster behavior of the stock market and the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts generally indicate 1998 car and light-truck sales will
be about 15.5 million units, which would be the fifth consecutive
year of more than 15 million units sold.

<P>
   Dozens of bodies and bits of wreckage were recovered from choppy
seas off Nova Scotia on Thursday as officials sought to determine
why a Swissair jetliner bound from New York to Geneva began smoking
and fell into the Atlantic minutes short of an emergency landing in
Halifax Wednesday night, apparently killing all 229 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
   As Canadian naval vessels and a flotilla of fishermen searched
the crash site five miles off a picturesque village called Peggy's
Cove on Nova Scotia's south shore, it seemed unlikely that any
survivors would be found, though all hope was not abandoned. Many
of the victims' grieving families gathered in New York and Geneva,
and some were flown to Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims were Jonathan Mann, the first director of the
World Health Organization's AIDS program, and several other U.N.
officials whose work had taken them into hazardous regions,
including Pierce Gerety, a Harvard-educated lawyer who had worked
for years on behalf of refugees in strife-torn regions of Africa
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators said that, although the cause of the
crash was still a mystery and might not be learned for weeks or
months, there were no immediate indications that the wide-bodied
jet, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11, had been brought down by an
explosion or an act of criminality or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to indicate at this time any possibility or
suggestion of any criminal act,'' Terry Ryan, a deputy commissioner
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told a news conference.
Similar comments came from the White House, the FBI, Swissair and
Canadian and American air safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers, who retrieved at least 36 bodies, as well as body
parts and debris that included clothing, baggage and seat cushions,
spotted in the afternoon what seemed to be a large piece of the
aircraft intact _ perhaps the fuselage, containing many of the
victims and the flight data recorders _ in about 120 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, unlike Trans World Airlines Flight 800, which blew up
without warning in the sky off the south shore of Long Island soon
after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport on July 17, 1996,
with a loss of 230 lives, investigators said Swissair Flight 111
apparently did not explode, but ran into trouble about 15 minutes
before it crashed and did not break up until it hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing the doomed flight, investigators said the plane
left Kennedy Airport at 8:17 p.m. and, nearly an hour later, was
out over the Atlantic in Canadian airspace, cruising at 33,000 feet
about 320 miles east-northeast of Boston, when the pilot radioed
air controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, at 9:14 p.m. that there
was smoke in the cabin, its source unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Gerden, the investigator in charge for Canada's National
Transportation Safety Board, said the pilot proposed going back to
Boston's Logan Airport for an emergency landing, and had begun
turning when the Canadian controller told him that Halifax
International Airport was closer, only about 70 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, identified by Swissair officials as Urs Zimmermann,
50, aided by the co-pilot, Stefan Low, 36, turned again toward
Halifax and flew on for 11 minutes, gradually descending to 9,600
feet, according to radar tracking data. During that time, the
passengers and crew were told of the emergency and put on life
jackets, which were later found on some bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit crew and the controllers at Moncton spoke to one
another at various points as a rescue center at Halifax was
notified and arrangements to clear the way for the landing were
made. As the plane crossed over the south shore of Nova Scotia and
headed inland toward Halifax Airport 30 to 40 miles away, however,
it suddenly changed course again, apparently after the pilot
concluded that he had to dump some of his fuel at sea, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said it was the pilot's decision to do this, probably
because an emergency landing is safer without heavily loaded fuel
tanks, or because the plane might have been easier to land without
the extra weight. In any event, radar tracking data showed that the
plane circled left and flew in a wide arc over land, down St.
Margaret's Bay and out over the ocean again, traveling at little
more than half its normal cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the aircraft was too heavy to land while
approaching Halifax and had to dump some fuel,'' Gerden said. ``My
understanding is that he would have turned or maneuvered somewhat
to dump the fuel prior to attempting the landing because he was too
heavy to land.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:25 p.m., the fuel dumping began _ rescuers later reported a
heavy odor of fuel on the water _ and, for reasons that were
unclear Thursday, the crew raised its distress call to a formal
mayday emergency. Five minutes later, at 9:30 p.m., under moonless
but clear skies, the plane suddenly plunged into the ocean.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The plane, when it fell, was about 40 miles, or 7 to 10 minutes
of flying time, short of Halifax Airport, officials said, and there
no explanation why it happened. No one suggested that the plane had
dumped too much fuel and run out. And no one suggested that the
pilot's decision to twice divert his course _ first to head for
Boston and then, with Halifax Airport less than 40 miles away, to
circle around back to sea and dump fuel _ had been a judgment
error.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in Peggy's Cove, Blandford, Hubbards and other coastal
towns, many of them already in bed _ it was 10:30 p.m., local time
_ reported hearing the sputtering noises of an aircraft passing
overhead, and then a thunderous crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting with my husband outside by the little cottage
behind our house, by the water,'' said Sharon Hoagland, 48, of
Hubbards, on St. Margaret's Bay, 10 miles from the crash site. ``We
heard a huge sound. Initially I thought it was thunder. Then we
herd a smaller second rumble. It was a thunderous boom, but there
was no rain, no lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Blandford, Mabel Schnare, was at her son's house by
the water. ``I heard this big noise,'' she said. ``My, oh my, I
said to myself. What does this fool think he's doing, flying so
low. It was so loud I thought it would hit the house.'' A moment
later, the house shook violently.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Comdr. Glenn Chamberlain, a spokesman for the Canadian Navy
and Coast Guard's joint rescue command center in Halifax, said that
local boaters with intimate knowledge of treacherous coastal waters
_ fishermen, lobstermen and others _ provided invaluable aid in the
early hours after the crash. Many ran down and pushed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's people who recognized that this was a tragedy, that
people needed help, and they didn't pause to think _ they just went
and helped,'' Chamberlain said. The seas, relatively calm at the
time of the crash, grew to angry 10 foot swells through the night
as drenching rains fell and winds rose to a howl.
</P>
<P>
   Within 40 minutes of the crash, the small boaters were joined by
Canadian Navy and Coast Guard vessels: frigates, cutters, supply
ships, helicopters and other craft, including police boats. Flares
rocketed aloft and fell slowly on parachutes, and the night search
recovered the first bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy weather forced a suspension until dawn, after which
the small boaters were sent home. By late morning, the operation
involved more than 1,500 search and rescue personnel on land, sea
and in the air. A makeshift morgue was set up aboard the Canadian
supply ship, HMCS Preserver, which had decks for helicopters and a
crew of 250.
</P>
<P>
   A small armada of search vessels, led by the Canadian frigate,
HMCS Ville de Quebec, hunted on a grid that was gradually expanded
from 5 square miles to 10 or more square miles. Several seaborne
helicopters were joined by land-based planes flying out of
Shearwater, a Canadian Forces base at Dartmouth, across Halifax
harbor from the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   A large morgue also was set up at Shearwater, and bodies, as
they were recovered, were to be flown there, officials said.

NEW HOLLYWOOD STUDIO WRANGLES OVER PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the high-tech vision that was supposed to
make the dream in Dreamworks come true, the first newly built
Hollywood studio in nearly 60 years, nestled in a 1,000-acre tract
amid the coastal wetlands where Howard Hughes built his giant
seaplane, the Spruce Goose.
</P>
<P>
   But now Dreamworks SKG, the studio partnership of Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, is threatening to
pull out of the proposed Playa Vista development in the Ballona
Wetlands just north of Los Angeles International Airport. And city
officials here are warning that if Dreamworks goes, the whole
residential-office-retail project may be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a classic clash of Hollywood egos and New York investors,
and it involves not only money but also local power politics and a
newly resurgent real estate market in a battle for a piece of the
booming movie business that has filled up existing studio space and
helped fuel the region's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the developers, led by the investment houses of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., want to
impose more costs and conditions for building the new studio than
Dreamworks is willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, in anonymous sniping in the trade press and
leaked letters, each side has accused the other of bad faith and of
working to sabotage the deal. The developer's camp has questioned
whether Dreamworks, which is still feeling its way nearly four
years after its founding, really wants to build its own studio
after all, while Dreamworks allies speculate that the developer is
trying to get higher-paying tenants and a better return on its
investment now that the local real estate market is hot again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreamworks has given all that it can give,'' Katzenberg wrote
to the developers last month in a letter that also included threats
to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are truly at a point where we cannot, and will not, give
any more,'' he added in the letter, a copy of which was sent to
Mayor Richard J. Riordan, Gov. Pete Wilson and other officials. The
letter has since become public and has led to the latest round of
wrangling over a project that has been stalled for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks wants enough land to build and operate its own
headquarters and studios, up to 15 state-of-the-art sound stages at
a cost of about $200 million. But the developer, Playa Capital,
which took control of the site last year after the original
investors' financing collapsed, now wants to develop at least some
studio space on its own, and then lease it back to Dreamworks or
other users at rates that Dreamworks officials say are unrealistic
and exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world of stupid ideas, that's an Olympic winner,'' said
one senior Dreamworks executive, speaking on condition of anonymity
and adding that it would be far preferable for the studio to
continue renting production space as needed from existing studios.
</P>
<P>
   But in an intense public lobbying campaign this week, Dreamworks
has hardly behaved like a player ready to fold its cards. Instead,
it has repeatedly flashed them, enlisting the vocal support of
state and local officials to reinforce its position that its
involvement is crucial to the overall project's success.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has offered to help mediate, and even the head of the
Motion Picture Association, Jack Valenti, has weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the city and state originally agreed to provide more
than $70 million in incentives and employment tax credits to the
project on the basis of Dreamworks' involvement in it, and local
community and environmental groups long wary of development in one
of the last remaining stretches of coastal wetlands in greater Los
Angeles also lent their support, largely on the basis of
Dreamworks' tenancy and a plan to restore much of the wetlands.
This week such groups warned the developer against upsetting that
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent statements by the new owners of Playa Vista force me to
question those commitments,'' City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who
represents the area, said this week. ``Their recent statements that
Dreamworks doesn't fit their vision for Playa Vista make me suspect
that they plan to return to their earlier plans to build hotels and
office complexes. This is contrary to the vision they promised
us.''
</P>
<P>
   State transportation officials have also warned that the
developer could lose millions of dollars earmarked for road
improvements that were contingent on Dreamworks moving to the site.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Denniston, president of Playa Capital, issued a
statement on Wednesday noting that the developer cannot deviate
from the current city-approved plan without additional review and
city council approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this condition not as a constraint but rather as a
testament to our conviction to stand by our promises,'' Denniston
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks announced its plan with great fanfare three years ago
in the old hangar where the Spruce Goose was built in World War II.
The new studio, the first one built here since Warner Brothers
moved to the San Fernando Valley in the 1930s, was to be the anchor
of a special media district that would create nearly 9,000 jobs and
3,000 housing units and generate billions of dollars in revenue for
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a full-fledged studio, the quality of the job is
higher, the pay level is higher and there's a sense of endurance
and continuity,'' Valenti said in a telephone interview from Paris
this week. ``It's the difference between owning your car and
renting one.''
</P>
<P>
   But after months of financing problems and public wrangling with
Dreamworks, the original local developer, Robert Maguire, lost
control of the project last year, and the studio had to begin
negotiations over again with the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   The project was also held up by litigation by some environmental
groups, although a federal court has so far temporarily barred work
on only 16 acres, most of it centered in a freshwater marsh,
pending a fuller review by the Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the local real estate market had sharply
rebounded, and the new owners and the moguls spent much of the last
year haggling over terms.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the tax credits, transportation subsidies and
intangible marquee value that Dreamworks would bring to the
project, the developer agreed to give the studio a plot of land _
Dreamworks says it was 35 acres _ at no cost. But the studio
contended that it needed 12 more acres, and reluctantly agreed this
summer to pay the developer $20 million for it, according to
Katzenberg's letter.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Katzenberg wrote, the developer increased the price to
more than $48 million, an amount Katzenberg dismissed as
``completely unacceptable.'' And Dreamworks said the developer sent
a subsequent proposal offering even less free land, and the idea of
divided control of the sound stages, in which Dreamworks would
control some and Playa Capital the rest. It was this proposal that
appeared to particularly outrage the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a better deal with most of the studios around town
today than we would have with Playa Capital,'' one Dreamworks
official said. ``They simply do not understand this business at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Playa Capital officials declined to comment in any detail on the
negotiations, except to say, as the vice president of corporate
affairs, David A. Herbst, put it: ``The bottom line is we want to
make it happen. We want to do whatever we can to make Dreamworks a
part of Playa Vista.''
</P>
<P>
   But one person close to the negotiations, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said that the developer had been renting out the vast
old Hughes hangar and surrounding buildings as sound stages since
1994, and that there still seemed room for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the Dreamworks partners themselves had
varying views of the project, with Spielberg pressing hardest for
it while Geffen, who became a billionaire in the record business
and has always liked to operate with low overhead, was reluctant to
invest so heavily in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, who cut his teeth as a young city hall aide in the
administration of former Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York, has
taken the lead in negotiations, and one Dreamworks official said
the partners now seemed more united in their determination to
proceed, if not at Playa Vista then by expanding their existing
operation on the Universal Studios lot or some other site.

WORST HAPPENS DESPITE AIRLINE'S BRILLIANT RECORD

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a safe airplane owned by one of the world's safest
airlines and flown by an unusually experienced crew.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wednesday's crash of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast
of Nova Scotia, only one MD-11 _ the second generation of the DC-10
_ had been destroyed in an accident. The last fatal accident for
Swissair was in Athens in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   All 229 aboard Swissair 111 died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The flight crew of Captain Urs Zimmermann, 50, and First Officer
Stephan Loew, 36, were both instructors with considerable
experience in the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   And still, the worst happened. While the cause of the crash is
yet to be determined, there are indications of an onboard fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great lingering fear, for lack of a better word, for
airmen is an inflight fire,'' said a veteran airline pilot who
Wednesday evening flew a Boeing 767 from Europe to New York's John
F. Kennedy Airport and who asked not to be identified. ``It can so
easily get out of control, your options are so limited and time is
so critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Swissair Flight 111, bound for Geneva, took off from Kennedy at
8:18 p.m. Wednesday with 215 passengers and a crew of 14 on board.
It was was handled by Federal Aviation Administration controllers
at the Boston Center in Nashua, N.H., as it flew over New England
and out into the Atlantic. Nothing seemed untoward.
</P>
<P>
   Supervision of the plane was handed off to Canadian controllers,
located in Moncton, New Brunswick, as Swissair 111 reached a point
in the Gulf of Maine, about 150 miles east of Nantucket and north
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers in Moncton handle virtually all airliners headed
to Europe from Boston and New York and from airports as far west as
Chicago and far south as Atlanta. This ``evening push'' is their
busiest time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Moncton controllers received the airplane, the
crew sent a distress message calling out ``Pan, pan, pan'' at about
9:15 p.m. (EDT). The crew reported there was smoke in the cockpit,
according to Tony Rushton, vice president of the Canadian Air
Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the precise language of aviation, the ``Pan'' call is not a
declaration of emergency, but rather the declaration of an
abnormality on board the airplane and that the crew may not follow
its flight plan.
</P>
<P>
   The crew then requested to head to Boston's Logan International
Airport. Swissair serves Logan and has a contract with Delta Air
Lines to perform maintenance work on its planes. Airlines usually
prefer to have planes land at airports where maintenance
relationships are already established.
</P>
<P>
   However, aviation sources said controllers informed the crew
that Logan was 192 miles away and Halifax International Airport was
42 miles away. The crew decided to go to Halifax and was vectored
toward that airport.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the pilot requested approval to dump fuel. ``It
was put into a pattern'' so it could dump the fuel, said Rushton,
who noted that he was relying on the recollection of controllers
who handled the plane, rather than radar tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear they were boring circles in the sky and dumping fuel,''
said one Federal Aviation Administration source.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel is jettisoned to lighten an aircraft on landing. The
maximum takeoff weight of an aircraft is always higher than the
maximum landing weight. A plane that is too heavy on landing may
overshoot the runway, or collapse its landing gear, or burst tires.
But in a life and death situation, aviation specialists said, a
pilot would declare an emergency and not use the ``pan'' call. Nor
would a pilot waste time dumping fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an aircraft is going to come out of the sky, no one is
bothering to ask the question: `What is the best weight to land
this aircraft at?''' said the veteran pilot. ``No one would stay
aloft just to dump fuel. It is simply nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is possible that the event on board seemed less of a
crisis than it was.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:25 p.m. (EDT) the pilot realized the gravity of the
situation and declared an emergency. It was the last transmission
received from the aircraft, Rushton said. About seven minutes
later, when the plane was between 10,000 and 8,000 feet altitude
the plane's identification signal disappeared from Moncton radar
scopes and controllers could not contact the airplane. They then
called search and rescue.
</P>
<P>
   For a few more moments, controllers could still see the blip of
the plane on the radar. Then it too disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the identifaction signal could have meant
only one thing: a complete electrical failure on board the aircraft
that would shut down the plane's transponder sending the
identification signal to radar. The loss of radio contact,
meanwhile, could be either because of an electrical failure or the
pilots had lost consciousness, succumbing to fumes in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of fumes that occur in a cabin of a burning airliner
are very quickly incapacitating,'' said the veteran pilot. ``The
crew can get pure oxygen. But it is possible, everyone on board was
dead when they hit the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, while Canadian officials are beginning their
investigation into the cause of the crash, some high ranking
transportation officials in Washington expressed dismay over the
slow pace with which the investigation is proceeding and expressed
concern about salvage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The US government offered to send US Navy salvage teams,
veterans of the TWA Flight 800 recovery operation in 1996, but the
Canadians declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they have their own Navy and they can do it,'' said
one National Transportation Safety Board official who asked not to
be identified. ``They can do it, but they will learn from the same
painful mistakes we learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 aircraft was delivered to Swissair in 1991. It had
35,998 flight hours and 6,554 takeoffs and landings. While the
successor to the DC-10, the MD-11 was a much more reliable aircraft
and underwent a full certification process from the FAA, as if it
was a brand new aircraft, rather than a derivative model.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft was positioned to do very well, but its
performance, in terms of range, did not live up to the advance
billing of its manufacturer, McDonnell-Douglas. Boeing, which
bought McDonnell-Douglas, had previously announced it would shut
down production of the plane in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, a
passenger advocacy group, said Swissair is ``among the world's
safest airlines. They are first rate and had not had a fatal
accident in 19 years. They have great maintenance, quality flight
training. Sometimes, even a good airline will have an aberational
event.''

VILLAGE KNOWN FOR QUAINTNESS IS CHANGED FOREVER BY CRASH

<P>
   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ Troy Kruger, a young refueler at
Halifax International Airport, heard the voice on the radio in his
truck on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot in an unknown plane was carrying on an urgent, barely
controlled conversation with the man in the airport tower.
</P>
<P>
   What Kruger did not know was that the voice belonged to the
pilot of Swissair Flight 111 and that he had only moments earlier
told air-traffic control that he was ``one level below an
emergency,'' according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot circled back, heading toward Boston, they said.
Air-traffic control advised him that Halifax was closer, 50 miles
away. The pilot turned around and flew on.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, his voice was being heard in Halifax by Kruger,
the tower operator, and a pilot on the ground named Andrew Arthur.
``He said there was smoke in the cabin, that it was an extreme
emergency,'' Arthur said. ``I wasn't sure it was a big plane, but
when he said he was going to dump 208 tons of fuel, I knew it was a
major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With smoke filling the plane, the pilot guided the MD-11,
carrying 229 people, to within 30 miles of the Halifax airport.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and Kruger stepped outside and stared up at the sky. ``We
were waiting for the lights to come down, something, anything. But
nothing came,'' Arthur said. ``You could hear the tower guy's sigh,
almost like he was crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the villages that dot the forested south shore
near Halifax, hundreds of people sat in square houses with the kind
of pitched roofs you find in a child's drawings. At the same time,
they all heard it. The boom, the thunder. And they felt it, the
noise that rattled their windows.
</P>
<P>
   In Hubley, Alice Wilson and her son heard what she said
``sounded like a plane, but all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bayswater, Harris Backman and his son Steve heard a loud
clap, preceded by a sickly whirring, like ``a plane trying to take
off and failing,'' said Backman's wife, Audrey.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, numerous emergency 911 calls came in,
reporting the sounds of a plane in distress.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the Backmans got a call from the local Coast
Guard Auxilliary office, where they are volunteers. Father and son
rode into the night on a boat to search for survivors of what was
now known to be a terrible plane crash. Instead, they found bits of
plane and bodies that none of them want to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Buckley, captain of a whale-watching ship from Peggy's
Cove, was shocked to see that the emerald sea was wearing a new set
of jewels: One white sneaker, a lady's glove, bits of paper, a
lonely floating teddy bear, an airpline wing, floating like a razor
blade in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley squinted his dark eyes against the horror.
</P>
<P>
   Merv Morash of Hackett's Cove said the sound reminded him of May
27, 1981, when an Canadian Air Force Thunderbird crashed near here
and he was sent to clean it up. That date remained with him, he
said, because it was such an awful sight. But this? ``My God,'' he
said, standing the day after on a rock, looking out to the sea for
something, some sign.
</P>
<P>
   All he saw was a large gray Navy tanker called the Preserver.
According to Constable Brad Reid, the spokesman for the Royal
Canadian Mounted Patrol in Halifax, the Preserver is equipped with
both a hospital and a morgue, but the hospital was not needed.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 a.m., 17 bodies had been found. Fishermen asked for body
bags, then more body bags. By 12:30 p.m., 36 bodies were taken to
the ship, one to shore.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they all were taken to the Shearwater military base,
where six teams of specialists under the watch of the coronor's
office did their scientific best to find names and pasts for what
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, searchers were aided by good weather, a dramatic
change from the previous night's rain and high seas. But 120 feet
under the sea, a hunk of plane, still intact, sat mute in the
darkness.

CRASH SCENE: `IT'S PRETTY NUMBING TO SEE THAT KIND OF CARNAGE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ A picture postcard turned Thursday
into a scene from hell.
</P>
<P>
   This quaint, rock-ribbed village, one of the most idyllic spots
on Canada's Atlantic coast, became the staging area for the search
following the crash of Swissair Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   At first it was to be a point of search and rescue, but after a
brief flurry of hope and speculation in the ink-dark hours before
dawn, the prospect of survivors dimmed and then burned away with
the fog.
</P>
<P>
   Daybreak brought a scene from one of the coastal rescue novels
that dot eastern Canada's literary landscape. But death usually
comes up from the deep, not down from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   On the misty horizon were the dim outlines of Canadian Navy
vessels. Skittering in and out of the flimsy-looking dock were
local fishing craft that joined the gruesome scouting mission,
retrieving soggy wallets and purses, shoes and ties along with
bodies and pieces of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get really used to it, but you accept it,'' said
Robert Murphy, deputy fire chief at nearby Seabright.
</P>
<P>
   The search effort pressed on into Thursday night and Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like 7-Eleven,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Jacques Fauteux of the
Rescue Coordination Center. ``We carry on day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after dark Thursday, Fauteux refused to give up hope of
finding a survivor, which other officials said was a brave but
improbable position, especially in the face of Swissair's
declaration that all aboard were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fauteux said that as a mariner he could never count out ``sheer
will power.''
</P>
<P>
   Lives have been lost at Peggy's Cove less dramatically than in
the crash of a jumbo jet. Among the marine tragedies that Murphy
recalled from his years in the Halifax County emergency service was
a woman being washed off the thrusting boulders that make this
point one of the first sights a visitor is likely to head for in
Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Clapboard and shingle houses line the shore and winding roads.
Lobster traps are stacked about. The scene is completed by a stubby
white beacon, with a red turret and a steady, phosphorescent green
light that is a silent reminder of the terror that the changeable
sea and weather can hold.
</P>
<P>
   The initial search Thursday was hampered by rains from the tail
end of Hurricane Danielle. But for much of the day, a bright,
warming sun seemed to mock the urgent bustle of the emergency
workers and their grim task.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of radio tape, which seemed to be played as an
interminable loop by a local station, told what was really going
on: ``Call after call is asking for body bags.'' In the night,
yellow-orange flares, with two-million candle power, gave the
search scene a touch of Dante. Harsh search lights from hovering
helicopters created a similar effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty numbing to see that kind of carnage,'' said Jim
Buckley, who sped to the search site in his whale-watching boat.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers feared that tuna and mackerel nets, which provide
the livelihood for many in the area, would complicate the search,
snagging debris and making it difficult for the boats to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Initially the jarring thud of the crash made some coastal
residents believe they were hearing thunder and that an unexpected
storm _ if any storms in this part of the world are truly
unexpected _ was moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crash awakened many, it was news to many in nearby
Halifax, the provincial capital, when they awoke.
</P>
<P>
   A Halifax taxi driver said he had ``popped in the tape for
`Titanic,''' then went directly to bed when the newly released
video finished.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was a reminder that the Halifax area has long lived
with dramatic tragedies. The city is home to a cemetery with the
remains of more than 100 unclaimed victims of the ``unsinkable''
ocean liner's deadly brush with a North Atlantic iceberg in 1912.
Halifax ships were called on then to pick up the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Halifax was rocked by a thundering explosion in 1917 when an
empty freighter struck a loaded munitions ship in its harbor. Two
thousand were killed and the north part of the city flattened. Some
old buildings still bear marks from the blast. Scientists count it
the largest manmade explosion before the nuclear age.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the slumbering taxi driver was rousted by his
dispatcher to ferry reporters from the Halifax airport to Peggy's
Cove and other assembly points for the region's latest emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The airport learned about the distress of SR111 while the flight
was still aloft. Preparations for an emergency landing were under
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had all the fire trucks ready,'' said Andrew Arthur, 23,
a fueler and pilot for the Avitat private aviation service.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Arthur, who was out on the taxiway, said he didn't
grasp the gravity of moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really understand the panicky situation,'' he said.
``I assumed it was a small commuter plane,'' of which Halifax sees
a lot more than jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   But then he heard the distress in the voice of the air traffic
controller from Moncton, New Brunswick, who was attempting to talk
the Swissair pilot to a touch-down in Halifax. And he heard how
much fuel the plane was trying to dump _ tens of thousands of
pounds _ to ensure a shorter landing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Arthur said, the Moncton controller gave a desperate
sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's all we can do,'' the controller said, as the
plane disappeared from radar.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal residents felt the shockwaves of the MD-11 hitting the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   At Peggy's Cove, the first of what may be many sad, frantic days
was about to begin.

MINNESOTA GOVERNOR CALLS ON CLINTON TO BRING END TO PILOTS STRIKE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abandoning his neutral stance in the pilots' strike against
Northwest Airlines, Gov. Arne Carlson of Minnesota Thursday called
on President Clinton to order the pilots back to work, but the
White House stood firm against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The move came on the sixth day of the pilots' strike and a day
after Northwest laid off more than half its 51,000 workers, many of
whom live in Minnesota, saying that it could not afford to keep
paying them if it was not operating.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Midwest governors have already called on the White
House to intervene. But Carlson, a Republican in the state where
Northwest has its headquarters and where there is wide sympathy for
the pilots, had been reluctant to urge such action, a course that
the pilots oppose and Northwest quietly favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was everyone's hope that the strike could be resolved
without the president taking this action,'' the governor said.
``But now as we enter the sixth full day of this strike with no end
in sight, I believe it is time for the president to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that the president appreciated the views of
Carlson and other officials but that Clinton felt that the best way
for the strike to be resolved was for the two sides to return to
the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Talks broke down on Friday, hours before the strike deadline set
by the pilots, and have not resumed since. The pilots want a 14
percent wage increase over three years to make up for pay cuts they
took to help save the airline from bankruptcy in 1993. They also
say they want increased job security. Northwest has offered 9
percent over four years, saying it could not afford more.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have agreed to meet on Saturday in Chicago with a
federal mediator to determine whether full-fledged contract
negotiations would be productive.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also said Thursday that it was suspending its
advertising campaign critical of the pilots during the Labor Day
weekend because of the meeting on Saturday. The two sides have been
warring with each other in print and television advertising in
Detroit, Minneapolis and other cities. The pilots previously said
that they had stopped their advertising.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rodney Slater, Clinton's secretary of
transportation, ordered Mesaba Airlines and Express Airlines I, two
Northwest-affiliated commuter carriers that have stopped flying as
a result of the strike, to come up with a plan to resume service to
17 cities in 11 states by the end of Friday. Under a federal
program, Washington subsidizes flights to the cities because
airlines say it would impossible to make money serving them.
</P>
<P>
   But both of the carriers said Thursday that complying with the
secretary's order would threaten their viability and therefore
their long-term service to the 17 cities.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what step the Transportation Department would
take next.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Railway Labor Act, the president has the power to
force the pilots back to work for 60 days while a special emergency
board tries to come up with a solution acceptable to both sides if
he believes that the strike is disrupting the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who has been leading the forces
against White House intervention, said in an interview Thursday
that the economic impact of the strike had been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a national economic impact here,'' Oberstar said.
``The two parties really have to overcome their mutual animosities
and reason together.''

   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ The area where the Swissair jet went
down Wednesday night is still under the control of search and
rescue officials here, and investigators have not yet begun to look
for the ``black boxes,'' the cockpit voice recorder and flight data
recorders, that are most likely to provide important clues to the
reason for the plane's flight path and for the crash itself,
officials here said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they concentrated on looking for bodies _ even
survivors, a spokesman for the Halifax Search Coordination Center
insisted Thursday evening. The search area is spreading because of
the wind and tides.
</P>
<P>
   Even 24 hours after the jet crashed, apparently plunging
abruptly in the last few thousand feet, Lt. Commander Jacques
Fauteaux said someone might have survived. ``Sometimes, scientific
figures don't actually work, if you have will power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the rescue workers, about 1,200 of them at any given time,
still in charge, the chairman of the Transportation Safety Board,
Benoit Bouchard, said in an interview that investigators had not
yet begun looking for the black boxes. Each recorder is equipped
with a ``pinger'' that is supposed to emit a regular sonar signal
when it is immersed in water, and the pinger can be located by
towing a listening array behind a ship.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bouchard said, the only available clues are the
radar tapes, which will be reviewed beginning on Friday, and the
tapes of conversations between the pilots and controllers at
Monckton (New Brunswick) Center, which handles transatlantic
traffic handed off from Boston or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard said that the crew of the Swiss Air plane, an MD-11,
had radioed that they had smoke in the cockpit at 10:14 local time
(9:14 P.M. ET) and had disappeared from radar at 10:30 p.m. In that
16 minutes he said the plane had begun to divert toward Halifax,
and then made a circle apparently to dump fuel.
</P>
<P>
   For many big planes, the maximum takeoff weight exceeds the
maximum permissible landing weight, with the weight of the fuel
being more than the landing gear can handle as the plane thumps
down under the runway. In normal operation, this is not a problem
because the fuel is burned en route.
</P>
<P>
   In crashes at sea, investigators usually look for the flight
data recorder and pocket voice recorders to determine what parts of
the plane they need to recover from the ocean floor. An exception
was the crash two years ago of TWA Flight 800, when the cockpit
voice recorder and flight data recorder did not appear to offer
them any clues, so they tried to recover the whole airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valujet crash in 1996, of a DC 9 that went down in the
Florida Everglades shortly after take-off from Miami, the flight
data recorder noted a pressure spike that gave strong evidence of
an explosion. That, combined with the recovery of some of the
cargo, gave clear indication the source was hazardous oxygen
generators.
</P>
<P>
   How long before the Canadian authorities try to recover the
black boxes is not clear. Fauteaux would not say how many bodies
had been recovered and no effort had begun to recover those under
water, which might be the majority of the passengers and crew. He
pledged, though, that searchers would explore ``every possible
avenue to find survivors, if survivors there are.''
</P>
<P>
   The search area is expected to expand as time passes. Searchers
are using infrared sensors, to find objects that are a different
temperature from the sea, including bodies and aircraft parts. They
are also using detectors to look for magnetic anomalies, indicating
large pieces of metal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fauteaux, in response to a question, said he did not know if
Canadian authorities would request help from the United States.
Water depth at the scene of the crash is about 120 feet, he said;
that is not nearly as deep as other spots from which pieces of
aircraft wreckage, large and small, have been found and raised.

BUSH PROPOSES $400 MILLION CONSUMER TAX CUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush proposed Thursday a $400
million consumer tax cut, including repeal of the sales tax on
nonprescription drugs, diapers and health aids, except birth
control devices such as condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also proposed a sales tax exemption for Internet access and
a sales-tax holiday in late July through early August 2000 on
inexpensive clothing for school children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a direct way to return money to Texas families,'' Bush
said. ``These tax cuts are for the people who pay the bills _ the
moms and dads who buy diapers and school clothes for their children
and the senior citizens who spend a disproportionate share of their
income on over-the-counter medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro called the
proposal a flip-flop by a governor who last year proposed a
half-cent general sales tax increase to pay for his property tax
reduction plan. Mauro said Bush's plan last year would have raised
taxes on all the items he now proposes eliminating from sales
taxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is talking out of both sides of his mouth,''
Mauro said. ``Last year, Governor Bush tried to raise the sales tax
by $1.6 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sales-tax cut proposal is the latest offering to voters
from the state's Democratic and Republican candidates as they try
to take advantage of a projected $3.7 billion state budget surplus
that could grow to as much as $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are proposing that we should spend up the surplus on a
bunch of new government programs,'' Bush said Thursday. ``I
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges of the next session will be to resist
the temptation to spend all the money and fuel future big
government,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will make more proposals as the campaign goes
along, and indicated some may involve spending. When asked about
it, Bush declined to rule out a teacher pay raise, which Mauro has
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Bush's tax cuts would take effect in September 1999, but
the sales-tax holiday on children's clothing would not occur until
2000. Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the sales tax holiday
would be for one year but would be extended into the future if the
economy allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush previously had proposed several business tax cuts,
including a research and development tax credit for high-tech
businesses and a proposal to exempt companies with less than
$100,000 in annual sales from the state franchise tax.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lieutenant governor candidate Rick Perry has endorsed
Bush's tax cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lieutenant governor candidate John Sharp has proposed
a larger franchise tax cut, exempting businesses that earn $250,000
a year or less. Sharp also proposed a one-time sales tax holiday in
August 1999 on children's clothing and school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also has proposed a tax cut. His would eliminate the sales
tax on motor vehicles and pay for it by doubling the tax on liquor
and tobacco. Mauro said the tax cut would save Texas families more
than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes exempting sales taxes on over-the-counter
medicine will be more meaningful to Texans than cutting the sales
tax on motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (a motor vehicle sales tax cut) generally affects people
one out of every seven years. I believe in affecting people's lives
every year,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his proposal will save Texas families an average of
$70 a year and will benefit low-income families and senior citizens
the most.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro said the tax increase Bush proposed last year would
have increased state tax revenues on over-the-counter medicine by
$12 million, on diapers by $8.8 million and on health aids by $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything Bush says today should be taken with a grain of
salt,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in an op-ed article in 1997 that his tax plan would
cost average families $71 a year in increased sales taxes but save
them $333 a year in property taxes. For renters, the property tax
cut was expected to create savings in rents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won passage of a far less aggressive property tax cut paid
for by a state budget surplus. That property tax cut saved
homeowners $140 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush budget analyst James LeBas said birth control devices were
left out of the tax cut on health aids because the idea was to give
a break to people with injuries or long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about a situation where people are treating an
injury: Band-Aids, gauze, ice bags, corn pads, canes. We're talking
about not adding a tax insult to injury,'' LeBas said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and lieutenant governor candidates are not the only
ones talking about the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In the race from state comptroller, Republican Carole Keeton
Rylander has proposed an additional $1 billion in state property
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Paul Hobby has said it would be better to use the state
surplus to pay off state debt. He said the state is paying up to
$500 million a year now on debt service.

 &HT;    Elliott: Gordon too good to be cheater
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Elliott thinks it's resources, talent and application, not
doctored tires, that has the Hendrick Motorsports team of driver
Jeff Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham at the top of the Winston
Cup points standings.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he was unaware until Wednesday of the post-race
controversy coming out of last week's race at New Hampshire. And in
his opinion, it's mostly a matter of Gordon being able to outrun
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott relates to Gordon's situation. That's the way it was in
the mid-1980s, before restrictor plates, when Elliott won 29 times
from 1985 to '89. And everybody thought he was cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to what they're going through,'' Elliott said.
``When you win as much as they have, people are going to believe
you cheated. I really don't think Jeff and Ray are doing anything
wrong. They don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said it's not usual for a team with the resources of
Hendrick Motorsports to be as successful as it is without cheating.
He also disagrees with Jack Roush, Martin's team owner, who said
``two tires have never, never made it where a car can go out and
outrun a car with four new tires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At Michigan, two tires ran as good as four,'' Elliott said.
``Same with Loudon; they ran just as good. There are certain race
tracks where it doesn't matter, and in my opinion, Michigan and
Loudon are two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Roush complained to NASCAR officials Sunday after Martin
finished second to Gordon for the fourth time in the last six
races. That race followed the pattern of the Pepsi 400 at Michigan,
where a late two-tire change brought Gordon's car to life, winning
a race Martin seemed to have under control.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR apparently had suspicions before Roush called for tires
to be checked after Sunday's race. The tires were confiscated after
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Roush offered another theory for Gordon's late-race revival _
that Gordon's Chevrolet was capable of doing more all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is precipitated by the advantage the Chevrolet has
over the Fords, since NASCAR shortened and narrowed our spoiler
earlier this year,'' Roush told the Charlotte Observer. ``They may
be laying back, and then turning it on at some point so as to
capitalize on that advantage to ice this championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-tire change late in the race then allows them to
present the appearance that their comeback stems from having a
brilliant crew chief and a driver who turns in a heroic effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Roush said all he wants is for his driver to have a fair shot at
winning the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is at the top of his game,'' Roush said. ``We don't want
him to lose the championship because somebody is doing something
that is outside the bounds of the spirt of NASCAR's rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin contends the impounding of tires was routine. There are
no hard feelings between the two, he said, even though Roush and
Evernham engaged in a shouting match in the garage after the New
Hampshire race. Notes: NASCAR announced a 34-race schedule Thursday
for the 1999 season, one more than a year ago. In addition, both
Atlanta races were given new dates _ one better than last year and
one worse.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Primestar 500 moves from March 8 to March 14, which
should be a move toward nicer weather. The season-ending NAPA 500
wasn't so fortunate. It moves two weeks later, from Nov. 8 to Nov.
21.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex, south of Miami, is
the newest addition. Running on Nov. 14, it also will be the site
of the season-ender for the BGN Series teams.

JUDGE ORDERS MICROSOFT TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Thursday ordered lawyers for
Microsoft Corp. to produce documents detailing the company's
relationship with Apple Computer Inc. and Intel Corp., saying
allegations that Microsoft bullied those companies may be relevant
to the antitrust case scheduled for trial later this month.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also agreed to consider in two weeks Microsoft's
requests to either narrow the scope of the case or to delay by
months the Sept. 23 start of the trial if the company has to defend
broader antitrust claims.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers, who originally focused their attention on
Microsoft's competition with Netscape Communications Corp., told
the judge that evidence concerning Microsoft's conduct toward Apple
and Intel, as well as Bristol Technology Inc., Caldera Inc.,
RealNetworks Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc., may help them
demonstrate a pattern of illegally anti-competitive conduct by
Microsoft. Bristol, Caldera and Sun have filed private antitrust
lawsuits against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers are resisting the government's exploration of
the company's relationship with companies other than Netscape,
saying that the tactic is unfair because it comes so soon _ 20 days
_ before the start of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft warned yesterday that if it is to defend against
charges surrounding all those companies, it will need months more
to prepare .
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is trying to expand its case at the eleventh
hour by adding a multitude of new allegations and topics to the
case,'' Microsoft attorney John Warden said after the hearing. ``We
don't think the trial should be expanded to include these
allegations ... but they're groundless and we'll rebut them if
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden said that if the government wanted to litigate other
issues beyond Microsoft's handling of the browser market, it should
file another case against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department Special Trial Counsel David Boies said the
evidence about companies such as Apple and RealNetworks will help
prove a pattern of misconduct by Microsoft, which stands accused of
illegally attempting to exploit a monopoly on computer operating
systems to gain share in the market for Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   The government believes Microsoft tried to persuade Intel, a
chip manufacturer, to stop developing software, Apple to stop
marketing its QuickTime multimedia technology for use with Windows,
and RealNetworks Inc. not to share its technology with Microsoft's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft went to Apple and said, `You ought to get out of the
business of selling QuickTime for Windows, and if you will agree to
get out, we will agree to help you in other areas,''' Boies said.
``That is part of a pattern that helps demonstrate the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies also accused Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates of trying to
get Apple to help Microsoft undermine Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's substantial expansion of the case,'' he
told reporters. ``What is at issue here is additional evidence of
the claims that have already been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said he would consider a request
to narrow the scope of the trial _ as well as any request to delay
the trial _ at a hearing Sept. 17. In the meantime, Microsoft must
produce the documents sought by the government, including papers
referring to various meetings between high-ranking Microsoft
executives and employees of Apple and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also ordered Microsoft to make available to government
lawyers databases detailing pricing and other issues associated
with Microsoft's sale of Windows licenses to computer
manufacturers. Microsoft said it would comply promptly with the
judge's order.

 AMD Chips Away at Intel   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
This should be the finest hour for Advanced Micro Devices and its
flamboyant founder, Jerry Sanders.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At long last, AMD is giving its hated rival, industry leader
Intel, a run for the money. Its inexpensive K6 chip took Intel by
surprise &UR;  &LR; and is stealing some market share. But instead, AMD has
not made a profit for four successive quarters and doesn't foresee
one until the fourth quarter of this year. It's lost $120 million
so far this year. The stock is hovering near its 12-month low.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 61, the chairman and chief executive, has come under
fire for his lavish compensation, and he faces increasing pressure
to turn the company around.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing woes stalled production of its flagship computer
chip, and when those problems were solved, the other elements of
AMD's business faltered in the face of the worst chip recession in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As Dan Scovel, semiconductor analyst with Fahnestock and Co.
in New York, puts it: ``AMD knows how to spend money, and Intel
knows how to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Scovel was referring to AMD's 1995 purchase of &UR;  &LR; chip firm
NexGen for $860 million, his statement also appears true in other
areas. Unlike Intel's spartan Santa Clara offices, AMD occupies a
dazzling new building in Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In an interview at AMD's headquarters this week, where a bust
of Sanders graces the spacious lobby, Sanders wore his trademark
gold bracelet and sported a trim white beard grown during a
two-week vacation at his Malibu beach house.
</P>
<P>
   His natty pinstripe suit was made by his Beverly Hills tailor,
Jack Taylor, who also made the CEO a suit that raised eyebrows at
the Robertson Stephens Semiconductor Conference in San Francisco
this summer. A close examination of that suit revealed that the
pinstripes were actually his name in tiny block type running the
length of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is Sanders' obsession. In the interview, he alternately
referred to the company as ``corrupt'' and ``unethical'' and
charged that it lies about its achievements, strong-arms customers
and produces a ``piece of s_ Celeron chip'' designed to compete
with AMD's K6.
</P>
<P>
   Although AMD won a long legal battle with Intel in the 1980s,
Sanders still says that fight distracted AMD and kept it from
becoming a chip superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is the Bill Clinton of microchips,'' Sanders said.
``Everybody loves their performance, but there's a character
flaw.''
</P>
<P>
   An Intel spokesman declined to respond to any of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanders has his strengths, but he has his weaknesses,'' said
analyst Scovel, who started in semiconductors 15 years ago at AMD,
as one of ``Jerry's kids.'' ``You put him on a level playing field
and he'll outsell anybody. He's plain good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the K6 taking hold, Scovel said, AMD is ``back in the
game full force with a viable competitive offering.'' AMD is also
able to stay close to Intel in manufacturing, he said, using the
latest processes to build chips effectively.
</P>
<P>
   A deal with Motorola will give AMD even more manufacturing
strength, Sanders said. And AMD &UR;  &LR; is proceeding with equipping a $2
billion fabrication plant in Dresden, Germany, and is putting $1.8
billion this year into its fab in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a meaningful long-term player, our goal is to have a 30
percent unit share,'' said Sanders. He said AMD has about 12
percent market share now, making it No. 2 after Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders pointed out that AMD is virtually the only major chip
company not to announce any layoffs or workforce reductions this
year.
</P>
<P>
   His sights are now set on the future. He wants to more than
quadruple output to 50 million chips per year, but some analysts
see that as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does he think he's doing with all that fab capacity?''
asks Linley Gwennap, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an
industry newsletter. ``There's only so much market there. Intel is
not willing to give up that much of the PC market to AMD.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dataquest analyst Nathan Brookwood thinks that the low-end
segment will grow so dramatically that AMD and National
Semiconductor's Cyrix unit can gain more market share even if Intel
makes inroads.
</P>
<P>
   Gwennap sees the criticisms of Sanders as justified. ``All
you've got to do is look at the bottom line,'' he said. ``For the
past couple of years, it hasn't looked very good. And he's the
boss.''
</P>
<P>
   As the boss, Sanders has reaped a sweet compensation package.
Even with a $30,000 pay cut last year, he still had a $1 million
salary, with, which other benefits took him up to $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite CEO,'' scoffed Graef ``Bud'' Crystal, a noted
critic of lucrative executive compensation packages. ``W.J. Sanders
III _ I hope there's never a fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   A large institutional shareholder, the California Public
Employment Retirement System, or CalPERS, has been after Sanders to
relinquish his chairmanship for several years. CalPERS releases
note that $100 invested in AMD in 1992 would have been worth $98 in
1997, while $100 invested in its peer group of 500 technology
stocks rose to an average $369.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said a high-tech company needs to have one person serve
as chairman and CEO, both setting and implementing policy in a
fast-changing environment. ``This is just a wooden rule'' CalPERS
has, to oppose joint titles, he said. ``They don't understand how
technology works.''
</P>
<P>
   If he has detractors, Sanders also has admirers. He is the
chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association and will lead an
SIA group to China next week. He will receive the prestigious Noyce
Award _ named for Intel founder Robert Noyce _ along with LSI Logic
founder, chairman and CEO Wilf Corrigan, this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But even people who see Sanders leading AMD back to the black
note the long-term challenges are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edelstone, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in San
Francisco, said AMD's slips on K6 production cost the company
dearly last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the semiconductor industry in a slump, AMD must
deliver its next chip, the K7. ``Here the risk factor goes up
considerably,'' Edelstone said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders maintains an optimistic outlook on virtually every
challenge before him. He knows that AMD hasn't always done what
it's promised in the past, but he said the company is meeting its
publicly stated goals this year, and will continue to do so next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is AMD finally making money in microprocessors, but
Sanders sees a comeback in flash memory and in programmable logic
devices _ two of the divisions getting hammered in the current
slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than be a Roman candle, and have one brief flurry where
the stock rockets up, we have elected to build for the longer
term,'' Sanders said. ``We have built a bridge to cross the moat on
Intel. ... The single word I would use to define AMD is momentum.''

 Microsoft Must Hand Over Evidence   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
A federal judge ordered Microsoft Corp. yesterday to turn over
information, including communications with Apple Computer and Intel
Corp., that the government says will bolster its landmark antitrust
case against the software giant.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The ruling is a setback for Microsoft, which wants to keep
the case as narrowly focused as possible.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson goes a step
further by letting the Department of Justice use the new
information to broaden the case, Microsoft says it will seek to
postpone the scheduled September 23 trial date by as much as six
months.
</P>
<P>
   However, such a delay could backfire against Microsoft,
antitrust experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm Microsoft, I'd be really thoughtful about asking for a
delay because it benefits the government as much as it does
Microsoft,'' said Rich Gray, an intellectual-property attorney at
Bergeson, Eliopoulos, Grady &AMP; Gray in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is accused of violating antitrust laws by bundling its
Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system
software and using licensing agreements with computer-makers and
Internet service providers to cut off a competing browser from
Netscape Communications of Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Yesterday, Jackson ruled in favor of a Justice Department
motion that Microsoft turn over documents that the government hopes
will show that Microsoft has exerted pressure on industry allies
like Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents the government sought were any communication
between Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Senior Vice President
Paul Maritz, and any Intel representatives from 1995 to 1997. Also,
the government requested correspondence from Microsoft executives
Eric Engstrom and Chris Phillips to any representative of Apple
from 1996 to this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's motion stated that the new information
showed ``evidence of Microsoft's attempts to induce others,
including Intel and Apple, to take action to hamper Netscape ... or
to undermine the threat they pose to Microsoft's monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that the government was trying to ``transform
this case into a ... `kitchen sink monstrosity' '' by introducing
evidence that did not directly deal with the browser issue central
to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not rule on Microsoft's motion against broadening
the scope of the case but indicated that he was leaning toward the
government's side when he told Microsoft lawyer John Warden, ``My
view of the case as raised by the (government's) complaint is not
as narrow as yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said the company would comply
with Jackson's order as soon as possible, though he said it still
was unclear how many documents were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue was never that we wouldn't produce the documents,''
Cullinan said. ``The issue is basically whether the government
should be allowed to rewrite and expand its case at the last
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wall, a partner with McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &AMP; Enersen of
San Francisco, said the government's case was weakened in June when
a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft's browser was legally
integrated into the Windows 95 &UR;  &LR; operating system.
</P>
<P>
   So the government, as in many monopoly cases, needs to bolster
its case by using the ``classic antitrust argument'' that there was
a wide pattern of monopolistic abuse, said Wall, a former Justice
Department attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiff in an antitrust case tries to create a stew,''
Wall said. ``You try to put some meat and potatoes in to make it an
interesting stew. They (the government) obviously thought the broth
was a little thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has scheduled a September 11 hearing on Microsoft's
motion to dismiss all or part of the case. Another hearing is
scheduled for September 17 on Microsoft's motion to avoid
broadening the scope of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he allows the case to be expanded, he should grant a delay
_ and most judges would _ to give Microsoft time to respond to the
new allegations,'' Wall said.

 Behind the Scenes at Robertson Stephens' Investment Arm   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Now that the divorce between Robertson Stephens and BankAmerica
(soon to be NationsBank) has been finalized this week, the
investment bank's former money management group is going through
some separation anxiety.
<TEXT>
<P>
   BankBoston closed its buyout of Robertson Stephens earlier this
week, giving the technology boutique yet another new moniker:
BankBoston Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   The deal rids NationsBank, which bought the former Montgomery
Securities, of the duplication dilemma it would have faced when the
Charlotte bank officially takes over BofA in October. (Montgomery
and Robby would have overlapped considerably).
</P>
<P>
   The odd guy out in this complicated merger mess has been Robby's
struggling investment arm, which is still owned by BofA but on the
block.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the fund group _ Robertson Stephens Investment
Management _ is still trying to get its house in order before being
sold.
</P>
<P>
   The investment arm has filed documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that would allow it to merge one of its
underperforming funds into another fund, which itself has been
lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   In a story reported in the financial trade paper InvestmentNews,
Robertson Stephens Investment Management is seriously mulling a
plan to merge its malnourished Developing Countries Fund into its
small-cap value Partners Fund. Developing Countries has been unable
to attract enough new investors to cover its costs, confirms a
Robertson Stephens Investment Management spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Developing Countries isn't expected to turn around
in the near future, the spokeswoman says. Across the board,
emerging markets funds have been hammered largely by the Asian
economic crisis. But Robby Investment's Developing Countries fund
has performed even worse than its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Fund analysts question the logic behind rolling an emerging
markets fund into a small-cap value fund because the categories are
so vastly different and don't usually coexist. For its part, Robby
Investment is saying that no final decision has been made, and it
is considering other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if implemented, the move is curious at best. And it
raises questions as to whether there are any serious outside
suitors interested at all in buying Robby Investment.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently some sort of deal is in the works. Robby
Investment President Randy Hecht ``doesn't see a definitive
agreement shaping up until the end of September,'' the spokeswoman
says.
</P>
<P>
   What's the word on the Street? Investment banking and money
management sources speculate that the fund group's management may
be holding out to buy the unit at a discount.
</P>

RAVENS' WOODSON SAID TO VIOLATE DRUG POLICY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rod Woodson of the Baltimore Ravens, a member of the National
Football League's 75th anniversary team, violated the league's
substance-abuse policy last month when he refused to take a second
random drug test, according to executives from several teams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, one of the best cornerbacks to play the game, did not
fail the drug test, but according to the league's drug policy, a
refusal to take a test counts as a failure. Therefore, Woodson
entered Stage 1 of the league's substance-abuse program. It calls
for an evaluation by a psychiatrist, as well as an increase in
random drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodson, who has never failed a drug test, refuses to take
another random test, he could be suspended for four games.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the secrecy of its drug program, no one in the NFL is
allowed to comment, and neither are officials from the players
association. Woodson could not be reached for comment and his
agent, Eugene Parker, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Players are randomly selected by the league's computer for
testing for illegal substances such as marijuana or cocaine and
performance-enhancing substances such as steroids and
androstenedione. Woodson was tested and, according to NFL team
executives, passed the test.
</P>
<P>
   But the following day, Woodson's name was again randomly
generated by the computer. The league executives said some players
during the season are randomly selected four, five or even six
times and most do not complain or refuse to take the test. Each
player in the NFL is randomly tested each season at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson was infuriated when he was selected again, saying he had
already been tested only a day earlier and he was not going to be
tested again, several team executives said. He stormed out of the
testing area and, one team executive said, ``was very nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, after Woodson had calmed down, he took the
second test and again did not test positive for any illegal or
banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NFL was upset with Woodson for refusing to take the
test at first. The league felt that someone of his stature _ a
future Hall of Famer _ should have taken the test and not set a bad
example for other players.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens' owner, Art Modell, said he had no knowledge of
Woodson's situation. The NFL and players association have been
discussing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   There are three things that could happen:
</P>
<P>
   1. Woodson remains in Stage 1, is evaluated by a therapist who
determines he does not have a problem, and since he has not failed
any tests, he is released from the program.
</P>
<P>
   2. The NFL could reach a compromise with the union on Woodson's
behalf and Woodson could be reprimanded or fined in place of being
in the drug program.
</P>
<P>
   3. The NFL could stick to the letter of the law and Woodson
would remain in the program. Woodson could then appeal and an
arbitrator would either uphold the NFL's decision or throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, however, will play in the team's opener against his old
team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, on Sunday.

SATELLITE TO STUDY SUN IS REVIVING FROM DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The disabled SOHO spacecraft is responding to
commands and slowly recovering from a series of ground control
errors that almost caused the loss of the valuable scientific
observatory, officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are gradually reawakening the joint American-European
spacecraft, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, which went
silent more than a month ago. Astronomers believe it may be
possible to have the $1 billion spacecraft back in operation in a
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint news conference held here and in Paris by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European
Space Agency, officials released results of an investigation board
into how controllers lost communication with SOHO on June 24, when
it spun out of control and could not get adequate power from the
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has concluded that there were no anomalies onboard
the SOHO spacecraft, but that a number of ground errors led to the
major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft,'' the panel's
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The board, made up of engineers and officials from the two space
agencies, said the loss of SOHO was a direct result of operational
errors, a failure to adequately monitor the status of the
spacecraft and the use of rescue procedures that had not been
adequately tested.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Bonnet, the European agency's director of science,
said from Paris that there was no single cause or single individual
responsible for what happened to the spacecraft, but that numerous
factors and people were at fault. ``The report points a finger at
nobody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The solar observatory was launched on Dec. 2. 1995. SOHO is
equipped with special instruments to study sunlight at different
wavelengths and to analyze particles and magnetic fields generated
by the Sun. The satellite orbits at a point between Earth and the
Sun where the gravity of each body cancels out the other and keeps
the craft in a stable spot.
</P>
<P>
   Since its launching, SOHO has made numerous major discoveries,
including rivers of charged particles flowing over the surface of
the Sun and the first detection of sunquakes, and has charted
streams of plasma moving from the Sun to Earth as well as 51 comets
passing near or colliding with the Sun, said Dr. Joseph Gurman,
NASA's project scientist for the mission.

   Although the spacecraft was designed to operate for only two
years, scientists had hoped to continue the mission into the next
century, as the Sun goes through a period of maximum activity.
</P>
<P>
   The report released on Thursday said controllers had lost
control of the craft during a maintenance period in which several
recalibration operations normally done separately were compressed
together. This resulted in using new procedures for the first time,
which led to problems.
</P>
<P>
   No one noticed that one of three gyroscopes, spinning devices
that help stabilize the craft, was turned off after it was tested,
the report said. Computer instructions sent to the craft that would
be used in case of emergencies required this gyroscope to be
running, it said, and when the craft later went into this safety
mode when problems arose, the trouble cascaded.
</P>
<P>
   The control team did not adequately check the status of the
craft while trying to bring it back on line and used a series of
new instructions written in previous months to streamline
operations that had not been adequately tested, the board said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended a series of procedural changes and testing
of computer programs that it said should prevent such problems in
the future.

MICROSOFT ORDERED TO PROVIDE MORE ANTITRUST EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge ordered the Microsoft Corp.
Thursday to give the Justice Department reams of new evidence that
government lawyers say will bolster their antitrust case against
the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers had argued that the new evidence, intended
to demonstrate that the company pressured and bullied the Intel
Corp., Apple Computer and the Real Networks Corp., should not be a
part of the case since it was not specifically mentioned in the
original lawsuits filed by the Justice Department and 20 states on
May 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things are the subjects of whole trials,'' John
Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, complained to Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson of United States district court at a hearing Thursday
afternoon. ``There has to be an end to bringing in new matters that
we have to be prepared to defend ourselves against.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden warned that Microsoft would ask for a six-month delay in
the trial, which is scheduled to begin in just three weeks, if the
company was suddenly required to defend itself against all of the
new evidence, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department lawyers argued that it was common and
natural to come upon new evidence during pretrial discovery and
research. And once the judge satisfied himself that the government
was asking for evidence only to bolster existing charges against
Microsoft _ not new charges _ he ordered the company to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would hear Microsoft's request for a substantial
delay during another scheduled hearing later this month. And the
judge noted that he could, if he chose, rule to exclude the new
evidence at that time.
</P>
<P>
   With the new evidence, government lawyers say they plan to show
that Microsoft used its dominant position in the market for
computer operating systems to force companies that competed with it
in other areas to cede the market to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the Justice Department and 20 states said they
would use the material to show that Microsoft tried to force other
companies to end any support for the Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape makes a browser, the software used to navigate the
World Wide Web, that is the principal competition to Microsoft's
browser, and Microsoft's many-faceted effort to win the competition
with Netscape is the central focus of the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new evidence shows that Microsoft has gone out and
engaged in the same kinds of anti-competitive behavior with other
companies as they did with Netscape,'' said David Boies, a Justice
Department lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Warden told Jackson that Microsoft had only recently learned
that government lawyers were interested in Microsoft's interactions
with these other companies, leaving the company no time to prepare
a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers said they had asked numerous questions on
these subjects during pretrial interviews that had been under way
for weeks. But, Warden said, ``Dribbling stuff out in the course of
depositions, during expedited proceedings, does not constitute
adequate notice.''

NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS IN CHINA SEEMS TO DECLINE, RIGHTS GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The number of criminals executed in China appears to
have dropped significantly in the last year, since the passage of a
new criminal law that restricts use of the death sentence, human
rights monitors say. But they emphasize that China still executes
far more people than any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on Chinese news media accounts of executions, a new
report to be released by Amnesty International on Saturday
estimates there were about 3,000 executions in 1997, down from
4,367 the year before. The group cautioned that since the Chinese
government guards the number of executions as a state secret, the
actual number may be far higher than its estimate and the apparent
drop may be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   But prominent judges in China have also noted the trend. John
Kamm, a San Francisco businessman and human rights activist who
frequently visits China, said that this week a supreme court judge
told him there had been a ``big, big drop'' in the number of
executions since the criminal code was enacted last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Catherine Baber, a researcher for Amnesty International in
Hong Kong was reluctant to celebrate. ``It may well be that there
is some reduction,'' she said. ``But we're playing blind. It would
help matters a lot if the Chinese government would back up its
claims with numbers and document the crimes involved.
</P>
<P>
   With Mary Robinson, the U.N. human rights commissioner due to
arrive here this week, the klieg lights are on China's human rights
record. China has promised to sign the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, Convention, but has not specified when.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the revision in the Criminal Procedure Code, which
took effect in October 1997, does afford defendants at least
somewhat improved protection from capital punishment, at least on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese judges have traditionally enjoyed broad discretion in
handing out sentences, including death sentences, which have been
given for a wide range of crimes including rape, murder, forgery,
corruption, drug trafficking and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts have long complained that Chinese courts are
so arbitrary and inconsistent that some criminals who were executed
were charged with relatively minor offenses. For example, Ma
Zhaochen, a peasant from Henan Province, was sentenced to death two
years ago after a string of petty robberies, that brought him a
total of $1600.
</P>
<P>
   The new Criminal Procedure Code gives judges some guidelines as
to when the death penalty may be considered, stipulating for
example that only robberies involving banks or the theft of
cultural relics merit execution, Kamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with the past, it says that pregnant women and juvenile
offenders cannot be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm, who has for seven years coaxed and reasoned with the
Chinese government to gain the release of prisoners held for their
political and religious beliefs, said that Chinese officials have
showed greater willingness to discuss aspects of their justice
system since the summit meeting between President Clinton and
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   After two and a half years of stonewalling, the Ministry of
Justice has started to provide Kamm with information about
prisoners he has inquired about. In 1995, as part of Kamm's
``Prisoner Information Project,'' the government agreed to give him
information on a list of 100 people who were in jail.

</HEADLINE>

 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Pierce Gerety, a Harvard-educated lawyer who
briefly considered the priesthood but instead devoted his life to
helping refugees trapped in the maelstroms of war and disaster
around the world, died on Wednesday night in the crash of the
Swissair jetliner off Nova Scotia. He would have been 57 next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gerety worked for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees as the
director of operations for the region of Central Africa
encompassing Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika, an assignment that
took him to Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. He was admired by other
humanitarian workers for his astuteness, wry humor and coolness in
the face of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had probably been in more physically dangerous situations
than anyone else in the refugee field,'' said Robert DeVecchi, the
retired president of the International Rescue Committee, which
originally hired Gerety to work with Cambodian refugees in
Thailand. ``He was equally comfortable briefing a head of state or
pulling a Vietnamese fishing boat out of the water,'' DeVecchi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerety's brother Tom, who is president of Amherst College, said:
``Pierce was shot at a lot. It seemed like he was constantly
courting risk and always pretty much got away scot-free.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ironic, Tom Gerety added, that his brother lost his life
on one of the world's safest airlines, flying to one of the world's
safest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Gerety was born into a family in Fairfield, Conn., that
valued public service. His father, Pierce Joseph Garety Sr., was
appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to supervise the
admission of refugees entering the United States after World War
II.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The younger Gerety graduated from Yale University in 1962 and
studied theology and philosophy at the Institute Catholique in
Paris, where he found time to set up a soup kitchen. He considered
becoming a Roman Catholic priest until he fell in love with a young
Frenchwoman, Marie de la Soudiere. They married and went off to
India to work for the Catholic Relief Services.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years Gerety returned home to attend Harvard
Law School, receiving his law degree in 1971. Ignoring more
lucrative prospects, he became a Legal Aid lawyer in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little impatient with American law,'' Tom Gerety said
of his brother. ``He wanted to be out and among people in crisis
and need.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Pierce Gerety approached the International Rescue
Committee and volunteered to go to Thailand and help with Cambodian
refugees who had fled their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a person with a very quick intelligence, an intuitive
sense of a situation and what needed to be done with the resources
at hand,'' said DeVecchi, who quickly hired him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Gerety became a legal officer at the headquarters of
the U.N. High Commissioner in Geneva, but soon began pushing to get
back into the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a quality of impatience and of a desire to go out and
live on the edge,'' Tom Gerety said. ``It was not dogmatic or
ideological. He retained this almost Catholic passion for working
with the poorest of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Gerety moved through a series of taxing assignments,
helping Eritrean refugees in the Sudan, Afghan refugees in Pakistan
and Vietnamese refugees in the Philippines. Even so, acquaintances
describe him as upbeat, if sometimes cynical about human nature.
</P>
<P>
   He was lent to the U.N. Children's Fund in Somalia, where a
warlord, Mohammed Aidid, took to kidnapping humanitarian aid
workers. Gerety walked into the warlord's armed camp and coolly
negotiated their release.
</P>
<P>
   Gerety returned to the refugee agency and was appointed last
year as its director of operations in Central Africa, where he and
other U.N. officials pleaded with the Congolese rebel leader Lauren
Kabili on behalf of the Rwandan refugees who were being
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   After the risks he took, friends said, Gerety wanted to spend
more time with his wife, who directs the International Rescue
Committee's program for children affected by wars, and their three
children, Pierce, Sebastian and Maeve. Gerety is also survived by
his mother, Helen, of Southport, Conn., and two other brothers,
Peter, a lawyer in Fairfield, Conn., and Miles, a lawyer in
Redding, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very proud of his children and very much in love with
his wife, and vice versa,'' said Susan Walker, a coordinator of the
International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, who first met Gerety in
Thailand. ``It was a joy to see them.

CRASH INQUIRY BEGINS AS GRISLY SEARCH FOR BODIES CONTINUES

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Searchers, by air and sea, scoured the
gray Atlantic on Thursday for wreckage and remains from the crash
of a Swissair jumbo jet that killed all 229 aboard, including 136
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian law enforcement and transport authorities, beginning
what could be a months-long investigation, refused to rule out
terrorism as a cause but said there was no immediate reason to
believe that a criminal act downed the New York-to-Geneva flight
near this provincial capital. A Swissair official contended the
plane was ``in perfect working order.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government agencies, including the FBI, monitored the
search and assisted the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All initial information indicates that it was an accident,''
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said in Washington. President
Clinton, traveling in Northern Ireland, said, ``We are deeply
grieved.''
</P>
<P>
   At least seven United Nations' staff members were on the flight,
which a spokesman for the world organization likened to ``the U.N.
airbus'' because it shuttled daily from New York, the U.N.
headquarters, to the Swiss city where many of its international
agencies have offices. Swissair said passengers were from 14
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers was a key AIDS researcher, Dr. Jonathan
Mann, a former professor at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of Flight 111 alerted air controllers to a crisis,
including smoke inside the cockpit, within an hour of departing
from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and was being
directed toward an emergency landing at Halifax. Efforts to
stabilize the three-engine MD-11 failed, and 10 minutes before it
was expected at Halifax the plane crashed in the Atlantic Ocean
about five miles off picturesque Peggy's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   The plane went down about 10:30 p.m. Atlantic time Wednesday
(9:30 p.m. EDT), with 215 passengers, including two infants, and 14
crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Peggy's Cove and Blandford, the two points at the
southern end of St. Margarets Bay, reported hearing a
window-rattling thud.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis, from the time that the plane was at 33,000 feet and
the crew reported smoke until it disappeared from controllers'
radar, lasted about 15 minutes, Canadian officials said. The final
communication from the plane, aviation sources said, was the
pilot's message of ``pan, pan, pan,'' the ultimate distress call.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers were apparently aware that the plane was in
trouble. Searchers reported that at least some of the corpses were
wearing life vests. Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive officer of
Swissair's parent group, said in Zurich, Switzerland, that the crew
had prepared the passengers for an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   At midday Thursday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said 36
bodies had been recovered from the chill waters, but RCMP Lt. Cmdr.
Glen Chamberlain almost immediately added that his agency would not
update the count soon. He indicated that was because the number of
severed body parts being found made it difficult to determine how
many different bodies had been located.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as confusing, as grisly as that,'' Chamberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies and body parts as well as small pieces of the plane
and crash debris were taken aboard a flotilla of boats that
included official Canadian vessels and fishing craft from the
villages that dot the coast southwest of Halifax. Sorting of the
recovered items, primarily clothing and baggage, and possible
reassembly of the plane was expected to be carried out at Canadian
Forces Base Shearwater in Dartmouth, across the harbor from
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was scattered over a six square mile area, Canadian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nova Scotia Premier Russell MacLellan said searchers had ``a
good idea where the plane rests,'' in up to 150 feet of water. RCMP
officials said, however, it was not certain when divers would
attempt to recover the two crucial recorders that should have
captured the cockpit conversation and instrument readings from the
crippled plane.
</P>
<P>
   Without that data, said Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's
Transportation Safety Board, theories of what happened to the
flight were speculation, and he offered no interim judgment on what
downed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the data gathering process,'' said Dick Derden, chief
accident investigator. He commiserated with victims' families as
well as the public: ``I know everyone would like to know'' the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The crash comes about two years after another jumbo jet bound
from New York to Europe crashed in the Atlantic. TWA Flight 800, a
Boeing 747, went down in July 1996 off Long Island, N.Y. The cause
of the crash has not been pinpointed, although attention focused on
electrical and fuel-vapor problems in an empty center fuel tank.
U.S. government investigators have ruled out foul play. Families of
the TWA victims have accused the U.S. investigators of
foot-dragging and indecision.
</P>
<P>
   Families and friends of the Swissair passengers were offered
consolation and grief counseling at the New York and Geneva
airports, and Swissair said it would fly relatives to Halifax,
where local officials began searching for 900 hotel rooms as the
summer tourist season tapered off.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard and Derden were questioned closely about the decision
of air traffic controllers at Moncton, New Brunswick, to have the
Swissair flight attempt to land at Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   Derden confirmed that the pilot, identified by Swissair as Urs
Zimmermann, first asked to be diverted to Boston and had turned
back toward the U.S. city when he was told by a Moncton controller
that Halifax was closer. At that point, a Canadian aviation source
said, the plane was about 200 miles from Boston and 50 miles from
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot indicated the plane was too heavy to land immediately
at Halifax and apparently began to dump more than 100,000 pounds of
jet fuel in the waters off Halifax. With a fuel load for a
trans-Atlantic flight, the plane would have been so heavy that it
could have been unable to stop before running off the Halifax
runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have turned or maneuvered'' in the dumping process,
Derden said, refusing to assess what that might have meant in the
flight's final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Georges Schorderet, chief financial officer of Swissair parent
SAirGroup, said the MD-11 entered service in August 1991 and was
overhauled about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This airplane was in perfect working order,`` Schorderet said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard said he had consulted with Jim Hall, chairman of the
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, who had dispatched
agents to Canada. Under an international agreement, the United
States, as home of the aircraft's manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas
(since bought by Boeing), and Switzerland, as home of the plane's
licensing owner, can participate in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already had wonderful collaboration,'' Bouchard said
during an afternoon news conference at Peggy's Cove.

LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LOSES HUSBAND'S FINANCING IN GUBERNATORIAL
RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross announced Thursday that
her husband had withdrawn most of the financial backing for her
gubernatorial candidacy, forcing her to drastically scale back her
campaign and curtail the extensive round of television advertising
that most politicians say is critical to her success in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to
challenge Gov. George Pataki, attributed the campaign retrenchment
to what she described as a ``substantially reduced contribution
from my husband,'' Wilbur Ross Jr., a senior managing director of
Rothschild Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She left little doubt, in a generally cheerful interview, that
Ross had essentially cut the legs out from under what had been the
grander ambitions of his wife's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am entering the final stage of my campaign with a much
lighter pocketbook,'' Ms. McCaughey Ross declared. But she said she
was not discouraged, adding that her husband had promised enough
money to pay for some advertisements in the last six days of the
race, and pledging to turn her adversity to her advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an empowering event,'' Ms. McCaughey Ross said, after
returning from a campaign stop at a pizza shop in lower Manhattan,
where she said she was cheered by a lunch-time crowd. ``I am $2
million lighter and going strong. It was such a wonderful feeling
to hear people say, `You go girl!'''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Ms. McCaughey Ross capped weeks of turmoil
in her campaign, with senior staff aides streaming out and some
Democratic supporters expressing second thoughts about backing her.
Taken together, the events suggested that her campaign _ which had
once been seen as formidable, in part because of her husband's
promise of support and in part because she is the only woman in the
Democratic field _ is in danger of becoming marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said she was not prepared to discuss the
reasons for her husband's withdrawal of the donation. ``It was for
reasons unrelated to this campaign, for personal and financial
reasons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who was in Anchorage, Alaska, on business, did not return
telephone calls Thursday. His associates said his decision was
based, in part, on his own financial difficulties, the result of
losses in the stock market, and, in part, on polls that persuaded
him that his wife's chances of becoming the next governor of New
York were not good.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross, addressing a question that had been raised
by many of her supporters as she and her husband engaged in an
unusually public negotiation over his commitment to her political
career, said that their marriage remained intact. ``We're fine,''
she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said Thursday evening that Ross was taking
back $2.25 million he had put into her campaign. She said that
would leave her husband's total overall contribution _ including
cash and in-kind contributions in the form of rent for the town
house that serves as her campaign headquarters _ at $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that money has already been spent on staff, polling and
petition drives. Asked if her husband might give her more money,
Ms. McCaughey Ross laughed and said, ``I am sure he would prefer to
speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said her husband's remaining money, plus
whatever funds she could raise, would go to television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television advertising will be less extensive than my
supporters and I had originally hoped,'' she said, though she
asserted it would be ``competitive and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates of the couple put the advertising figure at around
$800,000. The ads are to be filmed this weekend and are to start
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But even this latest modest promise by Ross was greeted
cautiously by his wife's supporters, some of whom said they were
shellshocked by the latest turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the candidate and her husband have been promising
that the television campaign was imminent, and disenchantment has
grown with each passing week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll believe it when I see it,'' one of Ms. McCaughey Ross'
supporters said Thursday about the latest promise.

BIZARRE COINCIDENCES LIVEN HOME RUN RECORD CHASE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, separated by three home runs in
their quest to break Roger Maris' record, take a bizarre
coincidence into their games Friday night as their spirited rivalry
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, only two away from tying the 37-year-old record, is at
home in St. Louis, facing the Cincinnati Reds, the only National
League team that has not allowed any of his 59 home runs. Sosa
plays in Pittsburgh, where the Chicago Cubs open a weekend series
with the Pirates, whose pitchers are the only ones in the league
who have not given up any of his 56 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   With four home runs in his last five official times at bat,
McGwire conceivably could reach 62 before the end of the weekend,
but he'll have to do better against the scheduled starters, Pete
Harnisch, Dennis Reyes and Brett Tomko, and their relief help, than
he did in the first six games between the teams in the first half
of July.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire not only didn't hit a home run against the Reds, but he
also managed to get only two hits in 13 at-bats. He walked 11
times. The only game the Reds didn't walk him was the one in which
he only pinch-hit. He did not face Harnisch, Friday night's
starter, in any of those games.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch and Tomko have given up 21 home runs each, making them
the team leaders in that department.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is on a torrid home run streak, hitting 12 in the
Cardinals' last 17 games and in only 52 at-bats. He didn't play in
one of those games, pinch-hit in another and was ejected in yet
another after heatedly disputing a called third strike in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last Monday that Sosa caught McGwire, hitting his
55th home run against Tomko at Wrigley Field in Chicago. But just
as he has whenever Sosa has tied him, McGwire responded almost
immediately. The next night, against the Marlins in Florida,
McGwire cracked his 56th and 57th home runs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, Sosa chipped away at McGwire's lead,
hitting a home run against Jason Bere of the Reds. But in
consecutive at-bats that night against the friendly Florida
pitchers, McGwire created an even wider gap, slugging Nos. 58 and
59.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa appeared in five of the six games the Cubs played against
the Pirates in July, collecting four hits in 20 at-bats and
striking out nine times. The Pirates walked him only twice.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to face Jason Schmidt Friday night, Sean
Lawrence Saturday night and Chris Peters Sunday. The Cubs beat
Schmidt and Peters in July.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the record is broken this weekend, the series in St.
Louis and Pittsburgh will serve only as a prelude to the two-game
series in St. Louis next Monday and Tuesday. Those are the days the
Cubs will visit Busch Stadium, setting up the prospect of a
shootout for the record between the two challengers.
</P>
<P>
   In their previous head-to-head confrontations, McGwire hit his
11th, 12th, 46th, 48th and 49th home runs while Sosa hit his
seventh, 44th and 48th.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last game with the Cubs, in fact, that got McGwire
out of his drought. He had hit only two home runs in the Cardinals'
previous 18 games when he suddenly connected for a pair against
Terry Mulholland and Matt Karchner of the Cubs. That explosion
triggered the torrent of home runs that has placed him on the
threshold of the record of 61 that Maris set in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   There will be one difference in the games the Cardinals and the
Cubs will play. The Cardinals are not in a race for a postseason
spot; the Cubs are. They hold a one-game lead over the Mets, who
play the Atlanta Braves this weekend. Sosa has said his first
priority is to play in October. McGwire doesn't have that option
this year.

CONNECTICUT SENATOR CALLS CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR `IMMORAL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign of the political trouble lying ahead,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a moderate Democrat and longtime ally of
President Clinton, harshly rebuked the president Thursday for his
``immoral'' relationship with Monica Lewinsky and for lying about
it for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who said the president had ``compromised his moral
authority,'' was the first member of either party to criticize
Clinton from the Senate floor since he went on national television
to acknowledge his affair with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president apparently had extramarital relations with an
employee half his age and did so in the workplace in the vicinity
of the Oval Office. Such behavior is not just inappropriate, it is
immoral,'' said Lieberman, whose association with Clinton goes back
almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator said that while he feels ``deep
disappointment and personal anger,'' toward the president, it would
be ``unjust and unwise'' for Congress to consider any formal action
against Clinton until the legal process plays out.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-minute speech by Lieberman was immediately praised by
Republican Majority Leader Trent Lott and by two other moderate
Democratic senators _ Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, who earlier this
week urged Democrats to stick with the president, put his arm
around Lieberman and whispered to him privately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Clinton was in Ireland on Thursday and had not heard
Lieberman's remarks, said White House spokesman Barry Toiv, adding
that Clinton has ``great respect'' for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always hardest to hear criticism from a friend, but I am
sure the president will consider Sen. Lieberman's words with the
same care with which they were delivered,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials had known Lieberman was preparing a
statement and feared he might deliver it while Clinton was meeting
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin earlier this week. At the
urging of White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, Lieberman
agreed to delay his remarks until the Russian leg of Clinton's trip
was over.
</P>
<P>
   While calling talk of impeachment and resignation ``premature,''
Lieberman urged other lawmakers to speak out against the immorality
of Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky not only
contradicted the values he has publicly embraced over the last six
years,'' Lieberman said. ``It has, I fear, compromised his moral
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he disagrees with Clinton's contention that the
public should not be inquiring into his private affairs. ``I
disagree that this is nobody's business,'' the senator said. ``The
reality is that, in 1998, the president's private life is public.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Clinton have known each other since 1970, when
Clinton, then a law student at Yale University, was a volunteer in
Lieberman's first political campaign _ a run for the U.S. House _
which he lost. Lieberman is chairman of the Democratic Leadership
Council, a moderate group once headed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman called the president's public statements _ both on
Aug. 17 and his remarks this week from Russia _ inadequate. The
senator said Clinton should fully accept responsibility for his
extramarital affair and for his seven-month lie.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan praised Lieberman for saying ``what needed to be
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey shared Lieberman's view that a White House affair is not
simply a private matter and echoed Lieberman's call for Clinton
``to go far further than what he did`` in his Aug. 17 confession.
``It was not just inappropriate behavior,'' the Nebraskan said.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan agreed. ``It was not adequate,'' he said, adding that
Lieberman's remarks reflected ``the full measure of that
inadequacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January, independent counsel Kenneth Starr has been
investigating whether Clinton lied under oath or engaged in an
illegal cover-up of his relationship with Lewinsky. Starr and his
team of prosecutors are preparing a report that is expected to
arrive at the Capitol in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials in the House are preparing to receive the
report and to conduct a closed-door review to determine if an
formal impeachment inquiry should be held. If articles of
impeachment are voted out of the House, the Senate would be called
on to hear the case and decide whether to remove the president from
office.

 By JOSEPH BERGER and JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ A day after an unemployed school aide was
arrested for the murder of one woman and was first suspected in the
death of seven others, new questions arose Thursday over how
aggressively police pursued complaints from at least two
prostitutes who contended that they were assaulted by the suspect
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of four of the women that the school aide, Kendall
Francois, 27, is suspected of murdering over two years have been
removed from his parents' house here near the campus of Vassar
College. But officials said that they knew there still were more
bodies to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Georgiana Johnson, hovering at the crime scene, said that her
daughter, Debbie Annan, who was not killed, had twice told police
that she barely escaped alive from an encounter with Francois, who
had picked her up on the corner of Academy and Montgomery Street,
took her to his home for paid sex and attempted to strangle her.
Mrs. Johnson said that her daughter, then an addict and prostitute
who occasionally assisted police in undercover drug operations, had
given detectives Francois' name and address as early as last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally ignored her,'' said Mrs. Johnson, one of many
friends and relatives of the victims who stood outside 99 Fulton
Ave. Mrs. Johnson added that her daughter now lives in Ocala, Fla.,
clean of her crack addiction and is working double shifts as a
cashier at a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   A similar story was told by a second woman, a one-time
prostitute who now lives outside Poughkeepsie, in Dutchess County,
and was interviewed on tape by WCBS radio's Irene Cornell. The
woman said that she told police that Francois had tried to strangle
her in November 1996, a month after the first disappearance in the
case. She remembered that during the assault Francois suddenly
stopped himself from choking her and said: ``Oh my God, I almost
did it again.'' She too managed to escape and flagged down a squad
car from the town of Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lanza, afternoon producer for the station, declined to
identify the woman, but said she told them that after the incident
she was interviewed twice more by police, once shortly after the
disappearance of the seventh woman missing in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. William Siegrist, a spokesman for the investigating task
force made up of detectives from both the city and town of
Poughkeepsie as well as the state police, would not comment on the
specific complaints. But he defended police handling of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the complaints that came to us were handled in a proper
manner and we have done everything we can to solve this crime,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also denied that because seven of the eight women were street
prostitutes, police were lackadaisical. ``I've tried to maintain
that these women were human beings and should be treated with as
much respect as any other person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the ramshackle house where Francois lived, investigators
in white jump suits and goggles continued their search for remains
and Mrs. Johnson talked about her daughter's inability to get the
attention of police, saying: ``They didn't even take a report.''
</P>
<P>
   But another parent of a possible victim offered a drastically
different account of how police had pursued the case.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Barone, whose daughter Gina disappeared on Dec. 9,
1996, said investigators followed every lead and interviewed every
person she had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They absolutely did their job,'' Mrs. Barone said. ``They
picked up on it the day I reported her missing, and took it from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Barone, a well-dressed woman accompanied by two nieces,
spoke with uncanny calm, despite the fact that her daughter, a drug
addict since the age of 12, was expected to be among the
decomposing bodies inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my head, I'd come to terms with it,'' Mrs. Barone said. ``I
had a feeling she was gone all this time. I always felt when the
good Lord thought I was ready to hear it, I'd hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchess County district attorney, William Grady, declined
to give details of the long investigation into the missing
prostitutes, all of whom are now presumed dead and inside Francois'
house. But the district attorney said that many women had come
forward with accounts of ``rough sex'' with Francois. All of their
stories were taken seriously, the district attorney said,
regardless of their background or demeanor. ``But just because
incidents took place doesn't mean arrests can happen,'' he said.
``You need probable cause, sufficient evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Thursday wheeled out a fourth body on a stretcher from
the green clapboard house in which Francois lived with his parents,
McKinley and Paulette Francois, and a teen-age sister, Kirstyn.
They also brought a supply of new rakes and shovels presumably to
dig up more remains or evidence.

IN SOMETHING LIKE A DEBATE, KOHL DEFENDS WHILE A RELAXED SCHROEDER
TAUNTS HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the closest thing to a televised
presidential debate before elections this month, Chancellor Helmut
Kohl gave a rambling defense Thursday of his role as a statesman
and the architect of German reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Looking avuncular and almost unaware that he is in danger of
losing his bid for re-election in just a few weeks, Kohl, 68,
squared off in parliament against the man who now leads him in
popularity polls: Gerhard Schroeder, 54, the Social Democratic
Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, appearing confident and relaxed in his speech,
accused Kohl of having fallen completely out of touch with the
needs of the country and the demands of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of a chancellor is to bring the country together,''
Schroeder taunted. ``There was a time you understood that. But in
the meantime you seem to have totally forgotten it.''
</P>
<P>
   The faceoff had been built up in German media as a climactic
rhetorical duel, the only direct confrontation between Kohl and
Schroeder before the elections on Sept. 27. It was not a debate,
but rather a pair of speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules Thursday, the two candidates merely delivered
rival statements to parliament on the ostensible issue of debating
the latest government budget. There was little opportunity for
spontaneous repartee, clever riposts or other displays of quick
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who has been chancellor for 16 years, is in the toughest
fight of his career. With nationwide unemployment at 10.7 percent _
and nearly twice that high in the formerly Communist eastern half
of the country _ Kohl is lagging behind Schroeder in most polls by
three to six percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has adamantly refused Schroeder's demands to take part in
any sort of American-style debate on prime-time television,
probably because the chancellor cannot begin to compete with his
challenger in performing before the cameras. Kohl often exudes a
homey warmth and an endearing lack of pretentiousness, but he is
also an obese man who wanders into long reminiscences and speaks
indistinctly.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, by contrast, has mastered the art of being at ease
before cameras and projecting a wide range of emotions from humor
to righteous passion.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday, Kohl talked for nearly an hour about his
historical accomplishments as a statesman. He dwelt proudly on his
role in uniting East and West Germany, blasting Schroeder and the
Social Democrats for fretting about the costs.
</P>
<P>
   He talked at length about his role in creating a single European
currency, though that is a change that most Germans are skeptical
about.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, wearing a charcoal-colored suit and striped silk tie,
hammered away at the idea that Kohl has been in power too long and
allowed Germany to sink into record levels of unemployment while
raising taxes ever higher.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also taunted the chancellor about not entering a true
debate. ``I read all the time I can't be pinned down,'' he said,
alluding to criticisms that he has not given enough detail about
his positions on issues. ``Well, come on then, pin me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's performances reinforced the sense that the election
campaign is less about deep policy differences than it is about
images and personalities. Kohl is campaigning on the image of
stability and security, as well as his status as Europe's most
influential leader. His campaign slogan is ``World Class for
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is campaigning on the promise of dynamism and personal
abilities. A pragmatist who has tried to blur his party's Socialist
traditions, he is running on an ambiguous idea of forging a ``new
middle'' that defends Germany's generous social programs while
promoting a vaguely pro-business agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates Thursday pledged their allegiance to roughly
similar concepts for broad tax reform as well as to a continuation
of Germany's social-market economy. Both endorsed continued heavy
financial support for eastern Germany, mired in depression and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl accused Schroeder and the Social Democrats of being
ambivalent supporters of reunifying with East Germany, a charge
that Schroeder denied. Kohl also accused the Social Democrats of
blocking tax reform for the last several years, only to support
their own plan now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like one of Pavlov's experiments with dogs,'' Kohl said.
``You just look at me, and you're already against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder focused on the argument that Kohl has fallen
completely out of touch. ``At the beginning of our campaign, we
Social Democrats said `Thank you Helmut, but enough is enough,' ''
he said. But now, he continued, ``your people don't even say thank
you.''

TWO HASIDIC DYNASTIES UNITE IN BROOKLYN GALA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were 8,000 guests, not including those peering
down from the rooftops. The police closed the streets in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to allow for a chuppa, or wedding canopy,
and afterwards the crowd squeezed so tightly into the reception
hall that several people collapsed from heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   If the wedding of Chaim Halberstam and Raiza Meisels lacked the
simple charm of a small ceremony (a banquet for 5,000), it did not
lack fanfare. To many Hasidic Jews, the couple's marriage this week
was nothing less than the royal wedding of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect match,'' said Rabbi Israel Steinberg, a friend
of both families. ``There's a boy. There's a girl. He comes from a
royal family. She comes from a royal family. It brings the Hasidim
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for its ethnic neighborhoods and in-your-face temperament,
Brooklyn might seem like a shallow pool for blue blood. But to the
Hasidim, the ultra-Orthodox Jews who arrived from Europe after
barely surviving the Holocaust, Brooklyn is the place of their
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   This week's wedding joined two grandchildren of the leaders of
two of the largest Hasidic groups, a union that to many symbolized
the renewed vitality of their movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the two biggest dynasties in the Hasidic world,''
said Schabse Sturman, a member of the Bobover Hasidic movement.
``You connect each other. Both of these groups are people who came
out of concentration camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically reserved and wary of the modern world, the Hasidim do
enjoy a big wedding. The ceremony on Tuesday all but paralyzed
Williamsburg, as thousands of residents streamed onto Bedford
Avenue and Ross Street to witness the vows in a celebration that
began at 4 p.m. and lasted into the early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials estimated the crowd at 8,000, but the Hasidim
put the figure as high as 20,000. At the reception, guests filled
three potato sacks with personal checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an historic event,'' said Moshe Blau, who attended the
ceremony. ``People were waiting for this event. People came from
Israel, London, Belgium, Switzerland and Paris. They came from all
over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   What they saw was a marital merger of two leading international
Hasidic dynasties, the Bobovers of the Borough Park neighborhood in
Brooklyn and the Satmars of Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old groom is a grandson of the Bobover Grand Rabbi,
Shlomo Halberstam. The 18-year-old bride is a granddaughter of the
Satmar Grand Rabbi, Moses Teitelbaum. The two grand rabbis are the
descendants of the first Hasidic leaders in Europe. They are also
first cousins and close friends.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, a day after the wedding, 2,000 people
gathered at the Bobover Synagogue on 15th Avenue in Borough Park
for the first of six celebrations that will continue into next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding and the six successive celebrations symbolize the
seven days in which God created the world. Wearing their best black
velvet hats and long black coats, the Bobover men filled bleachers
and tables, swaying and singing and clapping as the groom sat
beside his grandfather, Grand Rabbi Halberstam. It seemed as much a
pep rally as a wedding celebration.
</P>
<P>
   At 91, the grand rabbi seemed invigorated, clapping and dancing
in a glittery purple frock well past midnight. When he offered a
blessing, the boisterous crowd hushed in silence.
</P>
<P>
   The groom seemed a little tired; he rested his chin on his hand
and listened as one rabbi after another bestowed various Yiddish
blessings on him. Eventually, he took the floor to dance with
family and friends, though not with his bride.
</P>
<P>
   She was out of sight, in keeping with Hasidic tradition. She and
other women held a candle-lighted dinner on the balcony above.
``It's beautiful,'' said one woman, reluctant to speak about the
wedding. ``Ask the old men. They know better.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``old men'' apparently arranged the whole thing. Chaim
Sieger, a prominent Bobover, said the couple first met in February
or March. The grandfathers, ruminating on a merger, apparently
gathered the two families at a private home. Eventually, the couple
was left alone in a dining room for a few hours. Like many arranged
Hasidic marriages, the initial meeting is critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she looks at him and doesn't like him, it's over,''
Steinberg said. Apparently Ms. Meisels liked Halberstam. In the
spring, after a second meeting, the couple became formally engaged.
The grandfathers were pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is married, the young Halberstam's future is
apparently predetermined. ``First, he'll study for a while, and
then he'll eventually wind up to be a teacher,'' Sieger said. One
day, he could wind up as the grand rabbi. His lineage is considered
``royal blue blood,'' Sieger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the possibility, because he's a son after a son after a
son,'' said Sieger, noting that the ascension could take decades.
``We're talking 50 years down the line.''

HURRICANE POUNDS FLORIDA WITH FLOODS AND TWISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A hurricane lashed Florida's Panhandle coast with winds
of 80 miles an hour, crossing the coast in the darkness of the
early morning hours and killing three people.
</P>
<P>
   But the hurricane, named Earl, spared the state major damage
before moving into Georgia and the Carolinas as a weaker storm.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed near St. Helena Island in South Carolina
in a tornado spawned by the storm, emergency officials said. In
Florida, the bodies of two fishermen were found off Panama City,
one on a beach near the town and the other 10 miles at sea.
Injuries were few and mostly minor, Florida officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Downgraded to a tropical storm, the storm was traveling through
the southeastern states with sustained winds of 45 miles an hour
and was expected to stay inland through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the size of the storm and how erratic it was, for
the most part we got out pretty well,'' said Ann Rowe, a
spokeswoman with the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Rated as a Category 1 hurricane, the mildest classification,
Earl approached with menacing winds of 100 miles an hour but lost
some of that punch as it went ashore near Panama City, a beach area
of about 35,000 residents that bulges with tourists in the summer.
But it was storm surges of 7 to 12 feet that caused the most
damage, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen counties along the coast south and southwest of
Tallahassee reported heavy beach erosion, damage to more than 1,100
homes, submerged coastal roads and more than 15,000 residents
without electric power. Six counties reported tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who wanted to return home on Thursday after being
evacuated were sometimes blocked by impassable roads. Gov. Lawton
Chiles, who asked the federal government for a disaster declaration
to insure financial aid, said most damage was caused by flooding
and a surge that some residents said was worse than previous
hurricanes that have pounded the area recently. Comprehensive
damage reports were note expected for a day or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we got quite a bit of water,'' the governor said
at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   But state tourism officials said the hurricane caused ``little
to no damage'' to tourist destinations of the Panhandle. Panama
City, Destin, Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach all had reported
favorable conditions for travel during the upcoming Labor Day
weekend, they said, and beaches, golf courses and campgrounds were
open.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was less relaxing in areas like Shell Island, a small
community in Wakulla County, where 26 boats, ranging from small
fishing vessels to large cabin cruisers, washed away from a marina
and were bobbing atop the water in front lawns.

THE PURSUIT OF THE PURSUERS, THEN AND NOW  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not hard to imagine how Roger Maris would handle the news
media if he were making his assault on Babe Ruth's record of 60
home runs in 1998. The shy, small-town man from Minnesota and North
Dakota wearied of the pack of reporters who chronicled his 61-home
run season in 1961. What if hundreds of reporters tailed him from
city to city, many from cable television and radio outlets unheard
of 37 years ago? What if a Howard Stern lackey taunted him with
tawdry questions?
</P>
<P>
   A clue to Maris' feelings can be found in ``Roger Maris:
Reluctant Hero,'' an ESPN Classic documentary. Recalling her
husband's funeral in Fargo, N.D., in 1985, Pat Maris said,
``Somebody said to me isn't it funny all these reporters are here,
just freezing by the grave site, and Roger is probably just
laughing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Managing the pressure of nightly questioning without screaming
is a formidable task, so Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire should be
admired for their handling of the news media. Sosa has been a
delight all along; McGwire has loosened during his recent tear.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, after slugging his 58th and 59th home runs
in Florida, McGwire faced a post-game news conference. The sight of
reporters seated in neat rows, not jammed around his locker
shouting questions, delighted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed myself,'' he said with a smile, a reference to
exceeding his 58 home run total last season. ``I feel pretty proud
of passing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, McGwire and Sosa will get their documentaries. A&AMP;E's
``Biography'' series will probably have them done by November. But
Maris is a harder subject. He was most at ease with his wife and
six children, not with a world that did not welcome his surpassing
of Ruth's record. He would have preferred to play his career in
quiet Kansas City, never having been traded to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Classic's melancholy hourlong film captures his reticence
(Tuesday, at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN and 10 p.m. on ESPN Classic), using
home movies, archival footage and interviews with teammates,
friends, family and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most reserved, quiet individual I think I ever
knew,'' said Bobby Richardson, a former Yankee second baseman.
``And so I think the press portrayal was not the real Roger
Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably true. Baseball historian Robert Creamer remembers
seeing a gentle Maris, playing with his young children during
spring training. But that image did not prevail. Perhaps if Maris
had hit 61 home runs 10 years before, he might have had an easier
time. But he came along just as the press was growing more
adventurous and seeking something more than pat answers to softball
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The press railed when he refused to talk to reporters after a
mid-September game and was shocked when he sat out the 159th game,
after his 60th home run. He relaxed by walking around Manhattan
with his wife. ``The press couldn't quite understand that,'' Pat
Maris said in the film, ``but he just felt like he really had an
awful lot of pressure and he really needed the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever problems Maris had with the press in 1961, the film
notes that they worsened in 1962. After columnist Jimmy Cannon felt
snubbed by Maris, Cannon unleashed an attack accusing Maris of
``treacherous smallness.''
</P>
<P>
   So Maris was happy to leave New York's harsh glare after the
1966 season for the calm of St. Louis. Now, McGwire is a beloved
monument in St. Louis, and Sosa is delighting Chicago. But both
might as well be playing in our backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and ESPN spent the past week jockeying to take the
McGwire-Sosa saga to an audience broader than the teams' markets,
and they persuaded major-league baseball to let them shift coming
local games to national telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will show Friday night's 8 p.m. Cincinnati-St. Louis game.
Fox will show Saturday's 1 p.m. Reds-Cardinals game to 61 percent
of the country; viewers of other games, like the Braves-Mets, will
see McGwire bat during live updates.
</P>
<P>
   If McGwire or Sosa stands at 60 or 61 by Sunday, Fox will show
the Reds-Cardinals game to 80 percent of the country; the rest will
see the Dallas-Arizona football game. Meanwhile, ESPN is holding
discussions with major-league baseball about picking up Sunday's
game if Fox does not. For ESPN, carrying full games will ensure
showing all home runs; on Wednesday, ESPN inexplicably failed to
cut live from its baseball coverage of an Angels-Indians game to
McGwire's 58th and 59th home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will carry the Cubs-Cardinals game on Monday, Labor Day. On
Tuesday, the Fox-owned cable network FX will carry the
Cubs-Cardinals game; if McGwire or Sosa has 60 or 61, the telecast
will shift to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're still talking about this next week,'' said Ed Goren,
co-executive producer of Fox Sports, ``put me in a doggie bag.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're watching cartoons or soap operas or sitcoms but not
any of the games, baseball has authorized other networks to show
clips of the 62nd home run as quickly as they wish, rather than
waiting until the game ends.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no way to escape the assault on Roger.

   As relatives of passengers aboard Swissair Flight 111 filed into
the Ramada Plaza Hotel at Kennedy International Airport Thursday
and huddled in a private conference room to wrestle with their
grief, the scene carried poignant echoes of July 1996, when
families reeling from the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800
gathered under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar sense of astonishment over what had
happened. There was a similar hunger to know how and why.
</P>
<P>
   But what appeared to be missing, at least for now, was the
rancor. For while TWA drew fury from some relatives and politicians
for taking too long to confirm Flight 800's passenger list and not
tending aggressively enough to families' needs, Swissair and Delta,
the U.S. carrier through which some passengers had booked their
tickets, seemed intent on avoiding those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, director of the mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said there was ``no comparison'' between the actions of
Swissair and Delta and those of TWA two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an extraordinary amount of care and attention
paid to the details, which can make a horrendous situation that
much more horrendous,'' Hauer said Thursday. ``I've seen questions
get answered, and I've seen needs get met quickly, efficiently and
with great compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who stormed television news programs in
1996 to attack TWA, offered Swissair and Delta nothing but praise
at a press conference early Thursday evening at the Ramada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines have handled this exceptionally well from the
beginning,'' the mayor said. ``Not only did they have plenty of
people, but they had people trained to know how to deal with this
kind of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight 111 went down on Wednesday around 9:30 p.m. EST, and by
1:10 a.m., according to a spokesman for Swissair, the airline was
providing information on the identity of passengers to relatives
over a special telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it took nearly 20 hours for TWA to provide a
passenger manifest to New York City officials who repeatedly
requested one.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Merlis, a senior vice president with the Air Transport
Association, a trade group that represents U.S. airlines, said the
Family Assistance Act, a federal law passed in 1996 in response to
criticisms levied against TWA, compels airlines to work as quickly
as possible to release passenger lists following crashes, even at
the expense of errors. Although it applies only to crashes in the
United States, Merlis said, most airlines have adopted that
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair and Delta also hustled to make flight arrangements for
relatives who wanted to travel to Halifax, Nova Scotia, near the
site of the crash. Charter flights from both Geneva and Newark were
scheduled to arrive there Friday. The airlines also flooded both
the Ramada in New York and the airport in Geneva with airline
officials, grief counselors and clergy to talk to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But even such painstaking accommodations could do little to
assuage survivors' sorrow. At the Geneva airport, as the passenger
list was read out loud Thursday, relatives hearing the names of
loved ones broke into sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was there,'' one person blurted out. ``Oh, my God.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the conference room in the Ramada, the somber atmosphere was
interrupted at one point by a woman's uncontrollable screaming.
Darren Mudge, a Salvation Army officer who was there, said she was
quickly taken out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing can become contagious, because everyone is
right there, on the edge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors at the Ramada outnumbered relatives 3-to-1; many had
rushed automatically to the hotel as soon as they heard about the
crash because they remembered the important role they had played
for relatives in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some relatives of the passengers aboard TWA Flight
800 began making plans to travel to Halifax to offer support to the
newly grieving mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, who would
be gathering there.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Becker of St. Petersburg, Fla., whose 19-year-old
daughter, Michele, was killed aboard Flight 800, said late Thursday
night that the Flight 800 families were merely awaiting an
assurance from Delta that they would be able to see the relatives
of passengers who died on Swissair Flight 111.

CLINTON IS DENOUNCED IN SENATE BY LONGTIME ALLY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton and Joe Lieberman go back a long way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Clinton, then a Yale Law School student, worked as a
volunteer in Lieberman's campaign for the Connecticut state Senate,
often going door to door throughout the state to promote him.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years later, as the presidential primaries were about
to begin, U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman repaid Clinton by becoming the
first lawmaker from the North to endorse him for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He offers the country a whole new generation of leadership,''
Lieberman said of Clinton at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, that bond of loyalty was broken when the
56-year-old junior senator from Connecticut took to the Senate
floor to chastise the president for ``immoral'' behavior and to
express anger that Clinton had deceived him.
</P>
<P>
   Given who he is, Lieberman's somber, heartfelt speech should not
have been surprising. The Senate's only practicing Orthodox Jew, he
does not work on the Sabbath except when the Senate has votes late
on Friday nights _ and then he walks four and a half miles home
from Capitol Hill to Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   A man who calls his mother every day, Lieberman has crusaded
during his decade in the Senate for a more moral America. In 1995
he fought hard to win Senate approval of a requirement that new
televisions be equipped with an electronic device to enable parents
to block out programs that contain objectionable material. He has
also pressed manufacturers of video games and the music industry to
stop selling products with obscene and violent material.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also built a reputation as being willing to put
his personal values over party interests and has broken ranks with
Clinton before.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Clinton's presidency, Lieberman was the strongest voice
among Senate Democrats in criticizing the administration on moral
grounds for not taking tougher action to stop ``genocide'' in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   To the administration's dismay, Lieberman joined forces with
Republican Senate Leader Bob Dole to co-sponsor legislation to
unilaterally end the arms embargo against the Bosnian government to
help the Bosnians win the war against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he rankled fellow Democrats when he emerged as the
Democrat who was toughest on his fellow party members at hearings
of the Senate committee investigating possible campaign finance
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a loyalty higher than just that of party,'' he said
then. ``My loyalty is to the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Lieberman has waited to see what his colleagues were
doing before stating his position, earning the nickname ``Hamlet on
the Potomac.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he originally announced his support for Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas, then withdrew that support just before the
confirmation vote after learning of accusations that Thomas had
sexually harassed Anita Hill when they worked at federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, when Clinton needed all the Democratic votes he
could muster for his budget-balancing plan, Lieberman wavered _ on
national television _ before eventually supporting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But even when he disagreed with the president, Lieberman went
out of his way not to criticize him personally.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.

WALTER L. MORGAN, 100, MUTUAL FUND PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (bl)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter L. Morgan, a pioneer of finance who founded an early
mutual fund that sailed through the booms and busts of seven
decades, died Sept. 2 at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Pennsylvania. He was
100 and lived in Bryn Mawr.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan headed the Wellington Fund for 42 years until he retired
in 1970. The fund, which later became a mainstay of the Vanguard
Group, started with $100,000 pooled by a handful of Morgan
relatives and Pennsylvania business people, and it grew into one of
the nation's biggest mutual funds, with $23 billion in assets and
900,000 shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   As a young accountant in the boom years before the 1929 stock
market crash, Morgan put together an assortment of stocks, bonds
and government securities that he thought would be less risky than
competing funds that were borrowing money and concentrating on
stocks at wildly inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much speculation, and stocks were just too high''
before the 1929 break in prices, he recalled in an interview with
the Vanguard newsletter last summer. Morgan's fund, originally
called Industrial &AMP; Power Securities Co., sold U.S. Steel at $258 a
share and watched the stock plummet to $24 as the Depression set
in, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He renamed the fund in 1935 for the Duke of Wellington, the
19th-century British general who defeated Napoleon. ``Words like
`industrials' and `power' sort of fell out of favor with investors
after the crash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, he hired John Bogle, a fellow Princeton University
alumnus, and eventually made him his successor at Wellington. They
had met when Bogle was an undergraduate writing a thesis on the
tiny and contentious mutual fund industry of that era.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle went on to found the Vanguard Group of mutual funds.
Vanguard named its main building in Valley Forge, Pa., for Morgan
as part of a celebration of his 100th birthday in July. Seven
thousand employees in the company's U.S. and foreign offices signed
birthday cards.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan had continued to work twice a week at his Vanguard office
until he broke a hip last winter, said Michael Robinson, a longtime
associate.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Morgan attended the Hillman
Academy and was the last surviving member of the Princeton class of
1920. After graduation, he studied accounting and for a time was
the youngest certified public accountant in Pennsylvania. But he
bridled at his paycheck, starting at $28 a week with a big
accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked for a raise, my boss told me he wasn't
particularly smitten with my work,'' Morgan said in the interview
last summer. He joined another firm and helped wealthy people
prepare their tax returns. ``It didn't take me long to realize that
they needed investment counsel as well as tax advice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he married Helen Dugan of Bryn Mawr, who survives.
</P>
<P>
   A football fan, Morgan contributed to the cost of a new stadium
that will be dedicated at Princeton on Sept. 19, and he financed
several scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   He was a trout fisherman and liked to hunt with his favorite
English setter, Ticker Tape, on his farm near Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan restored and supported the historic Morgan House, which
was built by an ancestor, Edward Morgan, in 1695 in Kulpsville, Pa.
Other relatives included Daniel Boone, a grandson of Edward Morgan,
and Daniel Morgan, who fought in the Revolutionary War. He was an
eighth-generation descendant of an early Welsh colonist with family
ties to David Rittenhouse and other well-known regional families.
</P>
<P>
   He was a music fan with eclectic tastes that included Dixieland
and Wagner. He was an honorary director of the Philadelphia
Orchestra and the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. He also
collected antique furniture and fine wines and was a member of the
Commanderie de Bordeaux, a French wine society.

GOP DROPS EFFORT TO REMOVE ELECTION COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ky.)  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate Republican agreed Thursday to drop an
effort to oust Lawrence Noble, the general counsel of the Federal
Election Commission who has aggressively pursued accusations of
campaign spending violations.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat reflected a recognition that the matter would have
split the party's moderates and conservatives and stalled the
movement of 13 spending bills that Congress must pass to provide
the government with money in time for the start of the 1999 fiscal
year on Oct. 1. The Noble matter was attached to the spending bill
for the Treasury Department and Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in the House and Senate wanted Noble, whose job
has had no term limit, to face re-election by the election
commission's six members every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's agreement, future general counsels will have to
be renewed every six years, but Noble will essentially be
grandfathered into his job until 2008. Then, Noble, who began
working for the government in 1977, will be 55 and have 30 years of
government service _ allowing him to retire with benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats declared a victory in shielding Noble, who has called
for a ban on unregulated contributions to political parties, or
``soft money,'' and who initiated an investigation against the
Christian Coalition and Gopac, the political action committee once
headed by Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the maneuver to undermine Noble
was a blatant effort by Republicans to influence an independent
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Recent changes within the commission have eased Republican
concerns that Noble could move unchecked against Republican
interests, making his ouster less urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats suggested that any effort to weaken the commission
would undermine Republican calls for an independent counsel to
investigate fund raising by President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who had led the fight against
Noble, said Thursday that he was dropping his opposition because
Democrats were making a fuss, although they did not have the votes
to block it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides said McConnell was under enormous pressure from
Republican leaders to drop his opposition to Noble. With just five
weeks to go until adjournment, the House and Senate have sent only
one of the 13 bills to the president for his signature. Once the
Noble matter was out of the way, the Senate passed the Treasury
bill on a vote of 91-5.

may be that popcorn doesn't have to rule the summer box office. The

Kuryakin, the brooding, mysterious Russian operative in the 1960s

the world, the Mount Vernon Museum of Incandescent Lighting. Why do
people collect? It is taken for granted that art is worth
collecting, but collectors collect pretty much everything, without
necessarily thinking that what they collect has esthetic or
monetary value. I spent a few days poking around unusual museums

   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ Although there are few clues as yet
to the cause of Wednesday night's crash of Swissair Flight 111, the
chairman of Canada's transportation safety board said Thursday
evening that the plane disappeared from radar at ``7,000 or 8,000
or 9,000 feet,'' about 16 minutes after pilots first alerted
controllers about smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The finding could indicate an abrupt plunge into the sea by the
jumbo jet, whose pilots up until then had been descending from a
cruising altitude in hopes of making an emergency landing in
Halifax, about 35 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with most of the wreckage of the plane sitting in about
120 feet of water, safety investigators say they have little to
work with in determining the cause of the crash. They expect to
begin reviewing radar tapes of the plane's flight path on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The area where the jumbo jet crashed is still under the control
of search and rescue officials here, and investigators have not yet
begun to look for the black box flight recorders that are most
likely to provide important clues to the reason for the plane's
flight path and for the crash itself, officials here said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they concentrated on looking for bodies _ even
survivors, a spokesman for the Halifax Search Coordination Center
insisted Thursday evening. The search area is spreading with the
wind and tides.
</P>
<P>
   Even 24 hours after the jet crashed, Lt. Commander Jacques
Fauteaux said someone might have survived. ``Sometimes, scientific
figures don't actually work, if you have willpower,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the rescue workers, about 1,200 of them at any given time,
still in charge, the chairman of the Transportation Safety Board,
Benoit Bouchard, said in an interview that investigators had not
yet begun looking for the black boxes. Each recorder is equipped
with a ``pinger'' that is supposed to emit a regular sonar signal
when it is immersed in water, and the pinger can be located by
towing a listening array behind a ship.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bouchard said, the only available clues are the
radar tapes and the tapes of conversations between the pilots and
controllers at Monckton (New Brunswick) Center, which handles
transatlantic traffic handed off from Boston or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard said that the crew of the Swissair plane radioed that
there was smoke in the cockpit at 10:14 local time (9:14 p.m. ET).
Sixteen minutes later, at 10:30 p.m., the plane disappeared from
radar.
</P>
<P>
   In that 16 minutes, he said, the plane had turned toward Halifax
and then circled to the west and south, apparently to dump fuel.
For many big planes, the maximum takeoff weight exceeds the maximum
permissible landing weight, with the weight of the fuel being more
than the landing gear can handle as the plane thumps down on the
runway. In normal operation, this is not a problem because the fuel
is burned en route.
</P>
<P>
   By aviation standards, the plane that crashed Wednesday was
fairly young, having been put into service in August 1991. With an
engine under each wing and one in the tail, the MD-11 is a longer,
wider and more efficient version the DC-10, which is still flown by
many airlines around the world. It can seat 285 to 410 passengers,
but Swissair Flight 111 was configured to hold 239 passengers in
three classes, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   The 229 lives lost in the crash are the first deaths to result
from a crash of an MD-11 jetliner since the model entered
commercial service in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The jet, manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corp., now part of
Boeing Co., has had its share of troubles, namely the deaths of two
passengers in 1993 after a plane pitched violently in flight and a
crash landing in Newark, N.J., last year in which a Federal Express
cargo jet flipped over and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   But in its brief history the MD-11's problems have been more
commercial than safety-related. It has most recently been popular
as a cargo jet with carriers such as Federal Express. But earlier
this year, Boeing announced that it would stop production of the
plane in 2,000 because there were too few buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In crashes at sea, investigators usually look for the flight
data recorder and cockpit voice recorders to determine what parts
of the plane they need to recover from the ocean floor. An
exception was the crash two years ago of TWA Flight 800, when the
cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder did not appear to
offer them any clues, so they tried to recover the whole airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 crash of a Valujet DC-9 that went down in the
Florida everglades shortly after take-off from Miami, the flight
data recorder noted a pressure spike that gave strong evidence of
an explosion. That, combined with the recovery of some of the
cargo, gave clear indication the source was hazardous oxygen
generators.
</P>
<P>
   How long before the Canadian authorities try to recover the
black boxes is not clear. Fauteaux would not say how many bodies
had been recovered and no effort had begun to recover those under
water, which might be the majority of the passengers and crew. He
pledged, though, that searchers would explore ``every possible
avenue to find survivors, if survivors there are.''
</P>
<P>
   Fauteaux, in response to a question, said he did not know if
Canadian authorities would request help from the United States.
Water depth at the scene of the crash is about 120 feet, he said;
that is not nearly as deep as other spots from which pieces of
aircraft wreckage, large and small, have been found and raised.

<P>
   Officials from nine Latin American nations, who are in
Washington for a two-day meeting with the International Monetary

ARE YOU READY FOR NFL OVERKILL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An horrific horde of NFL hors d'oeuvres to chomp on, food for
thought as to why the start of American professional football this
Sunday hasn't been declared a national holiday _ it's just a fluke
that it fits into Labor Day weekend this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ On a spin tour about a month ago before a group of media
groupies in Pasadena, CBS Sports President Sean McManus calmly
proclaimed: ``There is no project in the history of this company _
and not just the history of CBS Sports, but the history of the CBS
Corporation _ that has ever been given more funding, more
attention, more resources or more priority than the relaunching of
the NFL on CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, the most vital blip on CBS' radar was making sure
Dick Van Dyke was locked into a ``Diagnosis Murder'' contract for
as long as he's physically able to move laterally with a hypodermic
syringe.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Poltrack, CBS's executive vice president in charge of
planning and research, has admitted something crazy: On network
promos alone, CBS has used the equivalent of $150 million in
advertising time just to remind everyone that the NFL is back on
its network.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, all movies today have huge advertising budgets. But keep
in mind, they could have !ital!sold!off! that time and
!ital!made!off! a hundred-and-fifty mil but chose instead to raise
its self-worth and boast about its most recent programming purchase
to anyone who cared.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the past four autumns, KCBS Channel 2 has filled Sunday
afternoon programming with...
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man,'' says station general manager John Culliton. ``A lot
of junk. I know a lot of knives were sold.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part because of the return of the NFL to the network
docket, KCBS' ``Sports Central'' will become the channel's largest
commitment to a sports show.
</P>
<P>
   At times during the NFL season when CBS has just an early game,
``Sports Central'' could run from about 1-to-5 p.m., leaving
co-hosts Jim Hill and Bret Lewis plenty of banter time with
reporter Lisa Guerrero, XTRA's Steve Hartman and former Chargers
concussion-abused quarterback Stan Humphries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Central'' will actually begin with a pre-taped 8-to-9
a.m. show _ a pregame to CBS' ``NFL Today'' pregame _ where the
focus will be on previewing the games shown to L.A. that day and
include some discussion of the gambling lines with the head of the
Caesars Palace sports book.
</P>
<P>
   Culliton admits that without advertising support, the show
couldn't expand to such proportions, both in time commitment and
talent hired. But with the NFL in tow, local advertisers have
climbed over each other to support ancillaries shows like this.
That spills over into the affiliates' other prime-time programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was above and beyond a smart decision for the network,''
said Culliton, whose CBS owned-and-operated affiliate has had to
pay part of the freight for the network's rights fees. ``This
station stands to make a lot more money that it otherwise wouldn't
be making.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means they didn't sell that many knives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some didn't read the fine print in the new NFL agreement until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN pulled off an Olympian feat by locking up the
rights to all NFL highlights shown over the TV airwaves from 10
a.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The impact could be felt less by shows like KCBS' ``Sports
Central,'' which has talking heads to fill time, but more with the
three-man staff at Fox's ``Overtime.'' Each can show only six
minutes of game highlights in that time window. Don't be stunned if
``Sports Central'' uses much of that highlight reel time on
Chargers games, with Humphries and Hartman there for local opinion
and CBS established as the AFC network.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net is also limited with highlights in that window.
In the all-roads-lead-to-Disney mentality, the idea is for ESPN to
monopolize the highlights for its ``NFL Prime Time'' show from
4-to-5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disney, also trying its darndest to make ``Sunday Night
Football'' seem so much like ``Monday Night Football'' that it even
has Hank Williams Jr. doing a theme song for the ESPN game, hasn't
made much ado about reminding folks that Monday's kickoff will be
at about 5:20 p.m _ or when many L.A. commuters are frantically
trying to find the AM station with Jack Buck and Hank Stram calling
the game on their car radios.
</P>
<P>
   (Clue in: Buck and Stram no longer do MNF calls. And XTRA-AM 690
has the national coverage, if the Valley boundaries allow you to
obtain the signal).
</P>
<P>
   The 40-minute-earlier kickoff is clearly to benefit East Coast
prime-time viewers at the expense of the West Coast audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as curious as you are as how this will shake out,'' said
Al Michaels, the only West Coast member (Brentwood) of the MNF
crew. ``For someone who has walked into the house at 6:30 for the
last 26 years, there could be a one-sided game that determines
whether or not to stick with the broadcast. The research department
apparently knows more than we do about it. In my informal polls, I
haven't heard anyone say, `That's too early.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels' poll did not include the greater Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reinforcing the idea that enough is never enough, CNN's
one-hour NFL preview show will air at 7 a.m. local time. That'll be
4 a.m. Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's again-expanded two-hour infomercial begins at 8 a.m. and
will have Hootie and the Blowfish as the in-studio band for Week 1.
</P>
<P>
   God bless the NFL. &QL;

BACKSTRETCH, NOT BACK NINE, FOR NAKATANI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Del Mar season enters its final weekend, Corey Nakatani
holds a comfortable but hardly insurmountable lead in the jockey
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Quick, somebody hide his golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   When Nakatani was in the same position with two weeks left in
the Hollywood Park meeting in July, he missed four racing days to
play in a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. The absence cost
him the riding title, which went to Chris McCarron, who won 52
races to Nakatani's 50, and forced him to miss an important race
aboard Manistique, who won the Hollywood Oaks under Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Horsemen saw Nakatani's golfing spree as a case of misplaced
priorities. Someone suggested that the men and women of the press
box, in addition to naming the best horse, jockey and trainer of
the meet, also vote for ``Golfer of the Meet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 27-year-old jockey and his agent defended the decision,
saying they simply followed through on a commitment to the
tournament sponsors, a commitment made before Nakatani knew about
Manistique or the possibility of a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much racing, a rider needs a break every once in a
while,'' agent Bob Meldahl said. ``He'd been invited to do this for
three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an agent, you say, `This isn't the right time.' But, you
know what, there never is a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani, a wrestler at Northview High in Covina and a good
all-around athlete despite standing 5-foot-1, finished 22nd in the
tournament, won by former hockey star Mario Lemieux, but was best
among first-time participants. He collected $5,048.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he believes, he won some valuable
national-television exposure for horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show what good athletes jockeys are, and I think I
did that,'' Nakatani said. ``I played very well in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those who criticized his decision, he said, ``That's
their opinion. I don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It boils down to how much value you attach to a track riding
title, which offers no tangible reward but does bring valuable
publicity, not to mention pride. Nakatani seems to care less about
titles than most jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``All riding titles mean is that you're having a great meet,''
he said. ``I'd rather ride the right horses for the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani, whose last title came at Santa Anita in 1996 and whose
first Del Mar title came in 1994, is on the verge of winning this
one because he's riding more of the right horses for more of the
right people.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of on- and off-the-track crises and controversies
sapped his desire in 1996-97, Nakatani said he had ``gotten over
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Meldahl said he is demonstrating that newfound devotion by
accepting mounts of all kinds, including cheap claiming horses he
used to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've realized you've got to take care of the trainers that
take care of you,'' the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the last five days at Del Mar, Nakatani had 35
victories, including stakes winners Sharp Cat, Tuzla, See You Soon,
Sicy d'Alsace and Daring General.
</P>
<P>
   Second with 28 is Gary Stevens, who is injured and out for the
rest of the meet, leaving Alex Solis, with 27, as the only jockey
with a chance to catch Nakatani.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar will run through Monday, take a break Tuesday, and tack
on closing day Wednesday. After the Los Angeles County Fair opens
Thursday in Pomona, Nakatani will head to Belmont Park in New York
for some weekend stakes mounts, including Gentlemen in the Sept. 19
Woodward Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets off to a good start at Belmont, he might continue
riding there until the start of Santa Anita on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   But if he doesn't, it's time for golf.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Down the stretch: &LR;  River Bay will try to add the Del Mar
Handicap to his Southern California stakes victories when the Bobby
Frankel-trained 5-year-old faces six horses at 1] miles on
Saturday. He'll carry 123 pounds, three more than Dowty, and will
have Solis riding.
</P>
<P>
   That race is not to be confused with Sunday's Del Mar Breeders'
Cup Handicap, a main-track mile that will be led by Old Trieste.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Del Mar Derby will feature Ladies Din, the Oceanside
and La Jolla winner, and Keene Dancer, an eastern shipper.
</P>
<P>
   The meet ends with Wednesday's Del Mar Futurity, with Worldly
Manner trying to make it three straight for trainer Bob Baffert by
emulating Silver Charm and Souvenir Copy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leading men: &LR;  In the space of four days, the jockeys' and
trainers' records for victories in a career at Del Mar fell to
Laffit Pincay and Ron McAnally.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay's 890th winner in 23 seasons was Lady Cadet in an
allowance race on Wednesday. Bill Shoemaker had 889 winners at Del
Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 51, who returned Sunday from a collarbone fracture, now
is within 200 of Shoemaker's world record (8,833).
</P>
<P>
   McAnally got his 375th Del Mar winner, one more than Farrell
Jones' record, when King Clef won an allowance turf race on
Sunday. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats mounted a careful counterattack
Thursday against the American who resigned in protest last month
from the weapons inspection team in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The senior inspector, William Scott Ritter Jr., Thursday
repeated his charges that the Clinton administration had blocked
efforts by U.N. inspectors to ferret out Iraq's clandestine
biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs, even as
Washington publicly supported the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare joint hearing of Senate committees, Democrats praised
Ritter's dedication and candor, and even agreed with his
frustration over the administration's decision to seek a diplomatic
resolution rather than confront Iraq when it stymied inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also said that using military force to compel Iraq
to allow the inspections was a complicated political and diplomatic
decision that was not up to Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That responsibility to take the nation to war is above your
pay grade,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking
Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., told Ritter, ``I admire your
singlemindedness even though I may disagree with you on the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan politics infused Thursday's hearing of the Armed
Services and Foreign Relations Committees. Democrats temporarily
blocked the hearing even before it started, arguing that senior
administration witnesses who could rebut Ritter are out of the
country traveling with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   To allow the hearing to proceed, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott put the Senate in recess and took the unusual step of
personally escorting Ritter to the witness table in the packed
Senate hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show my support for a man of courage,'' Lott said
in an interview later.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress is increasingly critical of
the administration's handling of foreign policy crises, from Iraq
to North Korea to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are again at a serious crisis point with Iraq,'' said Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``No one appears to be quarterbacking a game
plan in which intrusive inspections continue and produce results.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, 37, a former Marine intelligence officer, has said that
between last November and this August, the administration made at
least seven efforts to stymie an investigation by the U.N. Special
Commission, known as Unscom, which is charged with destroying
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has undermined Unscom's efforts through
interference and manipulation, usually coming from the highest
levels of the administration's national security team,'' said
Ritter, citing Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said the United States, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
and the Security Council were complicit in the decision to avoid a
confrontation with Iraq, in order to maintain the embattled
international sanctions against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq provokes a confrontation, knowing there will be no
consensus in the Security Council, and knowing they'll get a
concession,'' said Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said that two separate inspections _ one in July and
another in August _ were canceled, despite ``hard intelligence''
about the location of ballistic missile components and information
about how Iraq was concealing other forbidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that without an aggressive inspections program,
Iraq could rebuild its nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals
within six months. Ritter said Iraq possessed the components for
three nuclear weapons, and lacked only the necessary fissile
material to complete the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted Thursday that they still
support the U.N. inspections, but reserved the right to weigh the
projected gains from any inspections against the political and
diplomatic down side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect this guy,'' said an administration official about
Ritter. ``But the U.S. is given a fair amount of information. And
the moments are rare when an inspection goes for something like
this and is successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats voiced agreement that Ritter had
forced Congress and the administration to review the policy toward
Iraq, and to examine whether they have the stomach to use force,
even unilaterally, to back up the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to make some fundamental decisions about
whether to follow a policy of containment or deprive Iraq of its
weapons of mass destruction,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.

   Dr. Jonathan Max Mann, a pioneer in the international campaign
against AIDS and a founder of a movement to link health issues with
those of human rights, died Wednesday night alongside his wife, Dr.
Mary Lou Clements-Mann, a vaccine scientist at Johns Hopkins School
of Hygiene and Public Health University, in the crash of Swissair
Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia. He was 51 and lived in
Columbia Md.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and Dr. Clements were on their way to Geneva to attend a
series of global strategy sessions on AIDS, sponsored by the World
Health Organization and the United Nations. On Thursday, Gro Harlem
Brundtland, the former prime minister of Norway who is now the WHO
director general, led a memorial service attended by about 80
colleagues on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting tears, she said Mann ``was the kind of person who
changed the course of events by his dedication, conviction and
commitment. He had a burning engagement for human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann, who spent a good portion of his career at the Harvard
School of Public Health, came to international prominence in 1986
when he founded and became the first director of the WHO's Global
Program on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said he was unusual among public health officers
because he was both fierce and sensitive at the same time, and took
on great challenges with an apparent disregard for their
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan was the architect of the global mobilization against
AIDS,'' said Dr. Daniel Tarantola, a senior policy adviser for the
director general of WHO. ``He said many times that the way you
define a problem will determine what you do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
appeared uncontrollable and seemed to create a kind of political
paralysis among health officials around the world. ``Jonathan
determined to project an image of the epidemic that was one of a
disease that could be managed, could be controlled in some ways,''
Tarantola said. ``He defined the problem not only as a terrible
viral disease, but as a social problem to be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   He started the AIDS program with a single assistant and built it
over four years into the WHO's largest program in history,
employing 280 people and expending $109 annually in its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although mild-mannered, he could be a passionate speaker. In
1989, at an AIDS Action Committee dinner in Boston, he said: ``In
the last few years we have gained confidence that as individuals
and all together we are not condemned passively to allow the
disease AIDS or the fears and forces which it can unleash to
dominate us. Against AIDS we will prevail together, for we will
refuse to be split, or to cast into the shadows those persons,
groups and nations that are affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. June Osborne, who had worked with Mann throughout his career
and is president of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, which is
dedicated to improving medical education, said of him: ``He brought
the world together in a practical, unprecedented way. When he was
head of the Global Program, he had developed bilateral working
relations between the WHO and 155 countries around the world. He
got the developing countries to buy, for at least a time, the idea
that we really had a common cause _ to work on this deadly
epidemic.''

</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Mann's zeal on the issue brought him into conflict
with the WHO director general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, and in March
1990 Mann resigned in protest over the organization's failure to
move faster.
</P>
<P>
   Mann went on to raise the point that improved health care
methods, instruments and technology would not alone solve world
health issues. Instead, he said, many diseases and other health
problems are rooted in social issues like education and the status
of women and in the continuing violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, with funds and assistance from Albina du Boisrouvray,
whose son died while on a medical mission in Africa, founded and
became first director of the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for
Health and Human Rights at the Harvard University School of Public
Health. There, he founded the journal Health and Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   He also organized the first world conference on health and human
rights, held at Harvard in 1996. ``Jonathan was a critical player
in this new field,'' Tarantola said, ``bringing together two worlds
that had never spoken to each other _ the world of doctors and
scientists and medical officials, with the world of human rights
activists and lawyers. They had two completely different jargons,
and there was at first only cacophony. But now they speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Mann loved the role of founder. When
Allegheny University in Philadelphia asked him to become the dean
of a new school of public health, he seized it, beginning the
position in January.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Curran, dean of the Rollins School of Public Health at
Emory University in Atlanta, hired Mann on a Centers For Disease
Control project early in Mann's career. The job brought him to what
was then the African nation of Zaire and a hot spot of AIDS
research. to found a program in an atmosphere of suspicion and
hostility. Although the Project SIDA at first seemed to have little
chance of success it came to be regarded as the most innovative and
important center of AIDS research in Africa, until President Mobutu
Sese Seko dissolved it in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It was always safe for scientists and institutions to think of
AIDS as a virus, a transmissable infection, Curran said. But Mann
structured it ``as a human rights issue, and a global rights issue.
He really was a spiritual leader as well as a scientific leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In one line often remembered by colleagues, Mann said at the
World AIDS Summit meeting he had organized in London in 1988: ``We
live in a world threatened by unlimited destructive force, yet we
share a vision of creative potential... AIDS shows us once again
that silence, exclusion and isolation _of individuals, groups, or
nations _ creates a danger for us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann was born in Boston and grew up in Newton, Mass. His father,
the late James Mann, was a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, and
his mother, who still lives in Newton, Mass, was a librarian.
Jonathan Mann and earned a BA degree in history from Harvard
University, magna cum laude. He earned an MD from Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, then returned to the
Harvard School of Public Health for a master's degree in public
health. From 1975 to 1977, he worked for to the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta as an epidemic intelligence service officer.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New Mexico in 1977 to become state epidemiologist
and chief medical officer of the state Health Services Division,
where he remained until 1984.
</P>
<P>
   After his terms at Project SIDA and the Global Program on AIDS,
he returned to the Harvard School of Public Health, where he first
directed the International AIDS Center and then the Bagnoud Center
for Health and Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the editor of the influential two-volume work ``AIDS
in the World,'' which contains of scientific, practical and human
rights articles on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harvey Fineberg, provost of Harvard University and a
colleague of Mann, said that one of Mann's most characteristic
remarks combined both passion and invitation. ``He used to say to
us, `People say there is no use trying to change the world. But if
we don't try, will it change?' ''
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Marie-Paule Bondat, ended in divorce in
1996. Mann is survived by Ms. Bondat of Boston; their three
children, Naomi, Lydia, and Aaron; his mother, Ida, of Newton,
Mass.; two brothers, Gerald, an obstetrician in Northern
California, and Joshua, a rabbi in Israel; and a sister, Carol, a
rancher in Wyoming.

 &HT;    Leard has a tough act to follow at Auburn
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ Ben Leard had a number of worries prior to
Auburn's season-opener with Virginia Thursday night at Jordan-Hare
Stadium. A lot them, however, had nothing to do with the No. 16
Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem has been getting enough tickets to take
care of my family,'' said Leard, the sophomore from Hartwell who
made his first college start in Thursday night's
nationally-televised game. ``I don't know where they all come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   This was nothing new for Leard, who had to come up with 40
tickets for family members last November when Auburn played at
Georiga, as everybody in the Leard clan wanted to make the short
drive from Hartwell to Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally had to have a talk with my mom about getting this
thing under control,'' Leard said. ``I can't spend my college
career being a ticket broker.''
</P>
<P>
   With the family's ticket needs fulfilled, for this week at
least, Leard could finally turn all of his attention to Thursday
night's game where he would be very much in the spotlight. For
against Virginia, Leard had the unenviable task of replacing
Dameyune Craig, who threw for 3,277 yards and 18 touchdowns while
leading the Tigers to a 10-3 record last seson. Craig was the
leader and the focal point of the Auburn offense for two seasons.
Thursday night the mantle was officially turned over to Leard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people are going to compare me to Dameyune and I can't
do anything about that,'' said Leard, who threw only two passes
(completing one) as Craig's backup last season. ``But I can't be
Dameyune. I can only be myself. That was something he taught me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leard said his job going into Thursday night's contest was to
keep his mistakes to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's simple,'' said Leard. ``The coaches are not
asking me to win the game. They are asking me not to lose it. I'm
supposed to get the ball to the right people at the right time and
make sure we don't turn it over. If I can do that, I'll be okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia arrived at Auburn Thursday night with what many think
will be its best team since 1990, when the Cavaliers were ranked
No. 1 deep into the season. Virginia is solid on offense, with
quarterback Aaron Brooks and running back Thomas Jones, but its
hopes for a big season hinge on a defense that returns nine
starters from a unit that finished No. 24 in the nation in 1997.
The Cavs defense was led by strong safety Anthony Poindexter, a
consensus All-American.

 &HT;    Millions urged for prisons
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alto, GA -- He argues that Georgia's prisons are not critically
overcrowded, but Department of Corrections Commissioner Wayne
Garner wants taxpayers to spend nearly $149 million on three new
prisons next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 4,500 beds the three prisons would provide,
Garner said Thursday he needs to expand existing prisons to hold
1,900 additional beds at a cost of almost $6 million more. While
the new prisons were part of Garner's annual budget request, it is
the first such expansion request in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As the prison population has continued to grow, private
contractors have begun building three prisons with 4,600 beds, the
last of which is expected to go on line by January 2000. Georgia
has more than 38,000 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Corrections Board approved Garner's $952 million budget
request and will send it on to the governor and the General
Assembly. The board noted that sentencing disparity is stretching
the system, making it difficult to predict how many prisoners must
be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Frazier and other board members plan to suggest legislation
to limit judges' options in order to reduce differences in
sentences for similar crimes. A House committee has been studying
structured sentencing this summer. Using a computer analysis of
more than 700,000 sentences issued since 1990, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution in February reported wide disparities in the
average prison sentences given for the same crimes among Georgia's
46 judicial circuits. The toughest circuits hand down sentences
that are at least two to three times as long _ and sometimes six
times as long _ as the shortest ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know how much this is costing them,'' Frazier
said. ``That's $25 for each man, woman and child in this state. We
need to take a look at uniform sentencing.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Georgia invested in significant prison building
was in 1989, when sheriffs threatened to sue the state if the
corrections department did not pick up sentenced inmates backed up
in their crowded jails. The Legislature raised the sales tax 1
percentage point and used most of that money to fund 9,400 prison
beds. In recent months, Garner has handled the influx of inmates by
retrofitting low-security facilities, such as prison boot camps and
probation detention centers, so they could hold more dangerous
felons. He also has ``triple-bunked'' inmates in cells designed to
hold two men and has put bunks in common areas in cell blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said his budget request was based on a projection by the
governor's budget office that Georgia will need 4,500 more prison
beds by the end of 2000. The Parole Board, meanwhile, has estimated
that Georgia needs to immediately build 14,000 prison beds to meet
a demand that could crush the system within five years.

KENYA BOMBING DEFENDANT'S LAWYER MAY BE REPLACED 
</HEADLINE>
  
8  nypt 9   (  af11)  
 By BENJAMIN   WEISER12   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lawyer for one of two defendants charged in the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya may be replaced Friday at a
hearing in U.S. district court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined precisely why Magistrate Judge Kevin
Fox has moved to change the lawyer for Mohammed Saddiq &UR; 13 &LR; 
Odeh &UR; 14 &LR; , the defendant. But the lawyer, Jack Sachs &UR; 15 &LR; , said he
was told that the reasons involve his ability to carry two
potential death penalty cases at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Sachs &UR; 15 &LR;  was assigned to represent
Odeh &UR; 14 &LR; , he was also appointed to defend a man in an unrelated
capital case, involving interstate kidnapping and murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs &UR; 15 &LR;  said Thursday that he believed that he could handle
both matters, and that he hoped to continue to represent Odeh &UR; 14 &LR; 
if his client so desired.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh &UR; 14 &LR;  was charged last month with conspiracy to commit
murder, use of a weapon of mass destruction, and 12 counts of
murder, one count for each of the 12 Americans killed in the
Nairobi bombing. If he is convicted, Odeh &UR; 14 &LR;  could face a maximum
term of life in prison or death.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs &UR; 15 &LR;  said he had already met with Odeh &UR; 14 &LR;  four times at
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and interviewed
him extensively. He said he had also interviewed Odeh's &UR; 14 &LR;  wife,
who remains in Kenya, by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's to be a change, it has to be done by the judge,''
Sachs &UR; 15 &LR;  said. ``I would like to keep the case, but I have to go
with whatever is decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs &UR; 15 &LR;  is one of about 150 lawyers who are eligible to be
appointed by judges to represent indigent defendants in U.S.
district court in Manhattan, and reimbursed by the government for
their work. In capital cases, the burden on lawyers is considered
to be so large that defendants are provided with two lawyers paid
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs &UR; 15 &LR; , 69, said he has been practicing law in U.S. court in
Manhattan since the early 1970s &UR; 16 &LR; . He said he is currently a sole
practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal complaint against Odeh &UR; 14 &LR; , prosecutors have said
he had denied taking part in a direct role in the embassy bombings
but admitted to being a member of a terrorist group run by the
wealthy Islamic militant, Osama &UR; 17 &LR;  bin Laden, whom the authorities
suspect is behind the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors also said he accepted some responsibility for
the attacks as a member of the bin Laden group. The bombing in
Kenya killed 258 people and wounded thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
   After Odeh &UR; 14 &LR;  was charged last month, Sachs &UR; 15 &LR;  denied to
reporters that his client had confessed to any role in the
bombings. But he said Odeh &UR; 14 &LR;  did acknowledge being a member of
the bin Laden organization.

 &HT;    Gov. Bush proposes tax cuts
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday proposed funneling some
of the projected state budget surplus back into Texans' wallets _ a
diaper, a cough and a cut at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In a plan that would save an average Texas family about $35 a
year, Bush called for scrapping the sales tax on over-the-counter
medicine, diapers and health aids, including bandages, foot-care
products and other items used to treat health problems.
</P>
<P>
   After some discussion with his staff, Bush, a champion of
abstinence, decided that condoms and other non-prescription
birth-control devices would not be included in the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a direct way to return money to Texas families,'' Bush
said at a news conference at a South Austin drug store. ``These tax
cuts are for the people who pay the bills. The moms and dads who
buy diapers and school clothes for their children, and the senior
citizens who spend a disproportionate share of their income on
over-the-counter medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cut package, with an annual bottom line of $200 million,
also includes ending the sales tax on Internet access and a
establishing a two-week, back-to-school moratorium on sales tax on
clothing and footwear. The moratorium would occur every year in
late July and early August.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers announced by Bush reflect savings to taxpayers if
the products were exempted from the state's 6.25 percent sales tax.
Actual savings would be greater because local governments also tax
the products. For example, Austin residents pay a combined sales
tax of 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush became the latest politician to offer his two cents on tax
cuts, a popular campaign theme this year in the wake of projections
that the state will have an additional $6.3 billion in additional
revenue to spend by the end of the 2000-2001 budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan drew backing and criticism from his Democratic
opponent, Land Commissioner Garry Mauro. Mauro, who is campaigning
on a theme of ``filies first'' said he is ``very happy because the
debate is going to be about how we help Texas families and not how
we help the rich and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted that Bush _ as part of his semi-successful
property tax cut plan in 1997 _ had proposed raising the state
sales tax from 6.25 percent to 6.75 percent, a change that would
have increased the levy on the items he now wants to exempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago he proposed raising those same taxes,'' Mauro
said. ``I wonder if it's just an election-year ploy instead of a
reflection of his basic values.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, when he announced his candidacy Nov. 17, has proposed
eliminating sales taxes on cars, pickups and minivans, a change he
said would save Texans $1.8 billion a year. Mauro also has proposed
a tax increase: doubling the levy on mixed beverages, liquor and
tobacco products. Overall, he said, his tax overhaul would amount
to more than $1 million in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tax cut is much smaller than mine,'' Mauro said of Bush's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan offers smaller, but more frequent savings. For
example, the more you change the baby, the more you save. The Mauro
plan offers savings in large chunks by scrapping the sales tax on a
big-ticket item: the family vehicle. The tax saving on the purchase
of a $22,000 vehicle would be $1,375. But Texans who enjoy an
occasional mixed drink or like to smoke or chew would pay increased
taxes in years in which they do not buy a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that Mauro's cut would only mean money for people who
buy vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It generally effects people one out of every seven years,''
said Bush. ``I believe in affecting people's lives every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cutting proposals come after State Comptroller John
Sharp projected in July that the state would have a $3.7 billion
surplus when the two-year budget cycle ends next August. Sharp also
predicted state revenues will increase by $2.6 billion during the
2000-2001 budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, wants to
spend some of the state's prosperity on a back-to-school moratorium
on sales tax on school supplies and clothing under $50, as well as
a college-scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Perry, Sharp's GOP opponent, has sided with Bush's tax-cut
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget surplus belongs to the taxpayers of Texas, not to
the government,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas state government is among many enjoying strong economies.
A recent report by the National Conference of State Legislatures
showed that lawmakers around the country this year approved tax
cuts totaling $3.8 billion. Fifteen states cut taxes by 1 percent
or more. Only one state, Wyoming, raised taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three states also socked away some of the money, putting
it in rainy day funds or other accounts earmarked for leaner times.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas politicians pitched tax-cut plans, a prominent Texas
economist said that's exactly the wrong way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 11th-hour politicking,'' said Bernard Weinstein,
director of the Center for Economic Development at the University
of North Texas. ``Because of the economic uncertainty . . . I would
rather have that money in reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said stock market volatility and economic woes around
the world could turn the Texas economy around.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who will offer up more tax cuts in coming weeks, said his
overall plan will include a cushion for just such a contingency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have seen recently there seems to be some skittishness
on the stock market,'' he said. ``So I think it is really important
for those of us who intend to be around to have some cushion in the
budget to make sure that we don't commit it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas lawmakers, when they last met in 1997, approved a $1
billion property tax cut for homeowners, some of which was lost to
local tax increases. The reduction was what was left of Bush's
ambitious, unsuccessful plan to cut homeowners' property taxes by
$3 billion, a proposal that included raising the state sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has more tax cuts up his sleeve, as well as
proposals for spending additional money on public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' he said when asked if he will proposed a teacher
pay raise. Mauro is proposing a $6,000 pay hike for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush previously has proposed a plan to exempt some small
businesses from the franchise tax. Combined with a cut aimed at
encouraging research and development, the Bush business tax plan
would cost the state $250 million over a two-year budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he opposes using the surplus to roll back the state
sales tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My judgment is that it is best to target the sales tax cuts.
It is best to say that diapers matter to guys like you who have had
a plethora of children,'' he told a reporter who has four kids.

   Just three-and-a-half hours before the first day of school
Thursday, teachers went on strike in the largest district in
Monmouth County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout in Middletown &UR; 14 &LR;  Township came as predawn
bargaining failed after two years of futile negotiations and frosty
relations between the sprawling suburb's 800 teachers and its
school board. The strike guaranteed a rocky start to the new school
year for 10,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were wage increases, the possible loss of teacher
preparation time and proposals that all teachers pay part of their
health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Students arrived at their schools to find regular teachers
walking the picket lines, and substitutes and administrators
staffing classrooms and straining to handle book distribution and
other typical routines of a new academic year. Students were
dismissed after four hours because of the strike, said Karen &UR; 15 &LR; 
Kondek &UR; 16 &LR; , a spokeswoman for the Middletown &UR; 14 &LR;  school board.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials complained bitterly that board officials had
gone to state court Wednesday afternoon and sought a back-to-work
order even before a last round of talks had started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unheard of to seek a restraining order hours before
bargaining begins,'' said Karen &UR; 15 &LR;  Joseph, a spokeswoman for the
New Jersey Education Association, the statewide teachers' union.
``Clearly, this board of education had no intention of settling
this dispute last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The district did get the restraining order during the night, but
Ms. Kondek &UR; 16 &LR;  said that the board did not plan to seek contempt
citations against the strikers until court deputies had served all
of them with the order.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Joseph said Middletown's &UR; 14 &LR;  teachers were still angry that
the board invoked a rarely used state labor law in late July to
impose a contract consisting of its ``last best offer'' for the
1998-99 academic year. In the 30 years since passage of the law,
school boards have imposed contracts nine times on teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joseph said Middletown's &UR; 14 &LR;  union would not agree to a new
contract until the board rescinded the imposed contract, which
replaced a contract that ended two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The imposed contract provided for an annual pay increase of 2.8
percent for five years. The union wants an average annual increase
of 4 percent for six years, to match the average increase that
other districts in Monmouth have granted recently, Ms. Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Belluscio &UR; 17 &LR; , a spokesman for the New Jersey School
Boards Association, said that a law passed in 1985 raised salaries
for starting teachers to $18,500 from about $13,000. Now, it is
about $31,000, Belluscio &UR; 17 &LR;  said.
</P>
<P>
   School boards in New Jersey facing these steadily increasing
wage costs have looked for savings by requiring teachers to pay
higher deductibles &UR; 18 &LR;  and a share of the premiums for health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Middletown's &UR; 14 &LR;  board is trying now to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the board persuaded voters to approve a $78 million
bond issue, the largest in the state, to finance repairs and
additions to the township's two high schools and three middle
schools.
</P>
<P>
   To produce savings elsewhere, the board wants to take away one
of the two preparation periods that middle school teachers have and
require all teachers to pay $600 to $1,900 a year for health
insurance premiums, depending on their family size and years of
service, school officials said. Both of these conditions are part
of the imposed contract, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joseph, the union spokeswoman, said Middletown's &UR; 14 &LR; 
teachers were resisting because no other district in Monmouth
County had those conditions. In the last round of bargaining, the
teachers offered to contribute to premiums for dental insurance and
increase their co-payment &UR; 19 &LR;  for prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the school board did not respond with a
counteroffer until 4 a.m. Thursday, a half-hour before the strike
deadline and too late to prevent the walkout.

SHELL AND TEXACO TO JOIN EUROPEAN REFINING AND SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco said Thursday they would combine
their refining and marketing businesses in Europe, a step that
could further speed a trend toward cutting costs and capacity as
the industry struggles with declining profit.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the second major combination in Europe, following
a decision in 1996 by British Petroleum and Mobil to merge their
refining and sales units _ a move that has squeezed about $500
million a year out of operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance announced Thursday would cement Shell's leadership
position in Europe, where Texaco has been a laggard. Even though
the European market may have slower growth potential than do some
developing regions, Shell and Texaco said that by joining some
operations they could save about $200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance would combine Shell's 17 refineries in Europe with
Texaco's in Pembroke, Wales, and in the Dutch port of Rotterdam,
where it owns 35 percent of a refinery. Shell has 12,954 gasoline
stations in Europe and employs 25,000 in refining and marketing,
while Texaco has 2,984 stations and 4,300 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The venture between BP and Mobil led to the closing of one
refinery and a reduction of European service stations to 8,400 from
9,000. The two companies cut more than 2,000 jobs from a total work
force of 17,500.
</P>
<P>
   The combinations in Europe are part of an industry-wide trend
toward consolidating ``downstream operations'' _ refining and
marketing. Last year, for example, Shell, Texaco and the Saudi
state oil company agreed to combine their refining and marketing in
the United States with the goal of saving $800 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   While the European cost-cutting by companies is not expected to
have an immediate effect in the United States, the trend could in
the long term make it harder to export petroleum products from
Europe. On the U.S. East Coast, imports of gasoline from Europe
have often helped ease tight supplies during periods of peak
demand, like summer.
</P>
<P>
   As world refining capacity gets tighter, consolidation in Europe
will have an impact on profit margins from refining and on gasoline
prices in the United States, said Frederick Leuffer, an oil analyst
with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``It will take some time, though,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the combination of Shell and Texaco refining in Europe,
which together supply about 15 percent of Europe's needs, is not
expected to lead to any major cuts in capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Europe still has 5 percent to 10 percent more capacity that it
needs to meet demand, said Greg Quine of J.P. Morgan Securities in
London. ``It's next to impossible to close a refinery in Europe,''
he said, adding that cleanup costs would be huge and that unions
and governments could be expected to oppose a major closing. The
venture requires regulators' approval.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., has been seeking a way to
improve its refining business for some time. Talks with Shell began
last year, which resulted in a memorandum of understanding to form
an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, which is the world's largest publicly traded oil company,
will own 88 percent of the venture; Texaco will have 12 percent.
Together, the two will control 19 refineries and be able to process
2.1 million barrels of oil a day, or about 15 percent of European
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Texaco rose 43.75 cents Thursday, to $57.6875.
U.S.-listed shares of Royal Dutch Petroleum, which owns 60 percent
of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, gained 75 cents, to $45.4375.

TWO FORMER STRATTON OAKMONT OFFICIALS INDICTED ON FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ind.)   (af)  
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two former principals of a defunct brokerage firm,
Stratton Oakmont Inc., have been indicted in an international
securities fraud and money laundering scheme that federal
prosecutors say tried to manipulate the stock of two small
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, unsealed Thursday in U.S. district court in
Brooklyn, charges Jordan Ross Belfort, 36, Stratton's former
chairman, and Daniel Mark Porush, 41, its former president, with 27
counts of securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud,
money laundering, conspiracy to launder monetary instruments and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   While Belfort and Porush both have a long history of run-ins
with securities regulators, the charges in the indictment are the
first against them that have the possibility of long prison
sentences, federal prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The two each face a maximum sentence of 20 years and fines of up
to $10 million. They each could also be required to forfeit $5
million of personal property.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Porush was accused of perjury, also a criminal
offense, in connection with an insider trading investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Belfort and Porush said Thursday that their clients
were innocent and would fight the charges in court.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants set up a complex web
of foreign bank accounts and corporations to secretly buy millions
of shares of underpriced stock in two companies they secretly
controlled: Dollar Time Group, a retail chain, and the Aquanatural
Co., a water purification and dispensing equipment provider.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the shares were issued to a company owned or
controlled by the two men that falsely claimed to be a foreign
entity. Under an exemption to Securities and Exchange Commission
registration requirements, such companies can issue stock at
below-market prices without filing a registration statement.
</P>
<P>
   The stock must be issued to foreigners who will hold it for at
least 41 days before reselling it into the U.S. market. The
defendants are accused of pressuring Stratton employees to resell
the shares to clients, at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants earned profits of at least about $5 million on
the scheme, said Joel Cohen, an assistant U.S. attorney. They also
tried to bribe potential witnesses to help conceal their scheme, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments are the latest run-in for officials of Stratton
Oakmont, which was based in Lake Success, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, five former Stratton principals and a broker were
barred from the securities industry as part of a settlement with
the SEC. They were also ordered by a National Association of
Securities Dealers arbitration panel to pay an Indiana retiree
$13.1 million, including $10.5 million in punitive damages, in the
largest investor award ever.
</P>
<P>
   In January, regulators announced that the brokerage firm would
be liquidated by a court-appointed trustee.

THREE TROOPERS AND SUSPECT SHOT IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLINGTON, Conn. _ A man whose mobile home held an arsenal of
firearms and explosives opened fire on three state troopers without
warning Thursday after two of them tried to question him about a
neighbor's complaint of vandalism, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the exchange of gunfire, all three troopers were wounded, as
was the shooter, identified as Edward Premo, 40, a tractor-trailer
driver for the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just ambushed them. Simple as that,'' said Lt. Lawrence
Gibeault of the Connecticut State Police. ``We have no idea why.''
</P>
<P>
   After ambulances had taken away the four wounded men,
investigators discovered that the trailer had been booby-trapped
with homemade explosives. Troopers from the bomb squad closed the
road for two miles in either direction as they worked to defuse the
explosives, which officials described as unspecified
``anti-personnel devices.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounds to the troopers, one of whom was a rookie less than
two months out of the academy, were described as serious but not
life-threatening. The troopers were listed in stable condition
Thursday night at Johnson Memorial Hospital in nearby Stafford
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Premo was under armed guard Thursday night and listed in stable
condition, also at Johnson Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers who responded to the initial complaint were
identified as Mark Pelletier, who has been on the job five years,
and Michael Hogue, who graduated from the State Police Academy on
July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper 1st Class James Reidy, a 14-year veteran, received the
most serious wounds of the three when he responded to his
colleagues' radio call of ``shots fired.'' The troopers' ages and
towns were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers required surgery, but Premo did not, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Premo had at least two handguns and at least one
assault rifle, which he used to fire on the troopers. The charges
against him, which police said would include attempted murder, were
still being determined Thursday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inside Premo's sagging brown trailer, police said, officers
found about 50 devices that can be used to maim or kill, including
four homemade bombs and three crude land mines made with shotgun
shells mounted on wooden blocks, with fishing line to trip the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Among the books seized from the trailer were ``Homemade
Semtex,'' ``Highly Explosive Pyrotechnic Compositions'' and an Army
manual, ``Unconventional Warfare Techniques and Devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland canceled a trip to Washington on Thursday and
visited the wounded troopers at the hospital. ``They were shook up,
obviously, but they're pretty rugged young men,'' he said. '
</P>
<P>
   The shootout began after a woman who lives near Premo called
police at 7:50 a.m. to say that someone had vandalized her vehicle.
Willington, a small town in northeastern Connecticut, has no police
force and is served only by state police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always say there's no such thing as a routine call,'' said
Lt. Ralph Carpenter, the chief spokesman for the state police.
``This is proof.''
</P>
<P>
   The call came from River Road, just four miles from the police
barracks in Tolland where the troopers are stationed. The caller
said she suspected Premo of damaging her car. Carpenter said that
when the two troopers went to interview him, Premo met them in his
driveway, pulled out a pistol and started shooting, hitting them
both several times. The two returned fire, took cover and called
for backup.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said Premo went somewhere _ behind a tree or back in
the house _ and got an assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, Reidy, who kept a four-leaf clover under his
visor for luck, slowed down in front of the trailer and was shot
three times before he was even able to get out of his cruiser,
police said. The suspect used the crook of a tree to steady his aim
as he shot, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Reidy was was unable to steer his car, which rolled until a
passer-by grabbed the wheel, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   A man in a pickup truck drove past while the shooting was going
on, dialed 911 and made a U-turn back to the firefight. Lt. Col.
Timothy Barry, the commander of field operations, said the suspect
aimed at the passing driver, but returned to firing at the
troopers. The man stayed to warn other troopers responding that the
suspect was still crouched by a hedge in front of the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, the bomb squad was still working and investigators
had not been able to search the mobile home. It became obvious the
investigation would be long when the police escorted a portable
toilet past the roadblock. Police dogs were brought in, and a
helicopter borrowed from the Massachusetts State Police buzzed the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Willington, in the hills of northeastern Connecticut, is a small
New England town where citizens vote in a 270-year-old meeting
house and the town office is housed in a former button factory.
Most of the 6,300 residents commute to Hartford or the University
of Connecticut in Storrs.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they could find no criminal record for Premo in
Connecticut and planned to check nearby states.
</P>
<P>
   Premo went to work for the Postal Service in 1992, Since 1995,
he had driven a truck for the postal service in Hartford.

<P>
   Scores of bodies and bits of debris were recovered from choppy
seas off Nova Scotia on Thursday as officials sought to determine
why a Swissair jetliner bound from New York to Geneva began smoking
and fell into the Atlantic minutes short of an emergency landing in
Halifax Wednesday night, apparently killing all 229 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
   As Canadian naval vessels and a flotilla of fishermen searched
the crash site five miles off a picturesque village called Peggy's
Cove on Nova Scotia's south shore, it seemed unlikely that any
survivors would be found, though all hope was not abandoned. Many
of the victims' grieving families gathered in New York and Geneva,
and some were flown to Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims were Jonathan Mann, the first director of the
World Health Organization's AIDS program, and several other U.N.
officials whose work had taken them into hazardous regions,
including Pierce Gerety, a Harvard-educated lawyer who had worked
for years on behalf of refugees in strife-torn regions of Africa
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators said that, although the cause of the
crash was still a mystery and might not be learned for weeks or
months, there were no immediate indications that the wide-bodied
jet, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11, had been brought down by an
explosion or an act of criminality or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to indicate at this time any possibility or
suggestion of any criminal act,'' Terry Ryan, a deputy commissioner
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told a news conference.
Similar comments came from the White House, the FBI, Swissair and
Canadian and American air safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers, who retrieved at least 36 bodies, as well as body
parts and debris that included clothing, baggage and seat cushions,
spotted in the afternoon what seemed to be a large piece of the
aircraft intact _ perhaps the fuselage, containing many of the
victims and the flight data recorders _ in about 120 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, unlike Trans World Airlines Flight 800, which blew up
without warning in the sky off the south shore of Long Island soon
after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport on July 17, 1996,
with a loss of 230 lives, investigators said Swissair Flight 111
apparently did not explode, but ran into trouble about 15 minutes
before it crashed and did not break up until it hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing the doomed flight, investigators said the plane
left Kennedy Airport at 8:17 p.m. ET and, nearly an hour later, was
out over the Atlantic in Canadian airspace, cruising at 33,000 feet
about 320 miles east-northeast of Boston, when the pilot radioed
air controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, at 9:14 p.m. that there
was smoke in the cabin, its source unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Gerden, the investigator in charge for Canada's National
Transportation Safety Board, said the pilot proposed going back to
Boston's Logan Airport for an emergency landing, and had begun
turning when the Canadian controller told him that Halifax
International Airport was closer, only about 70 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, identified by Swissair officials as Urs Zimmermann,
50, aided by the co-pilot, Stefan Low, 36, turned again toward
Halifax and flew on for 11 minutes, gradually descending to 9,600
feet, according to radar tracking data. During that time, the
passengers and crew were told of the emergency and put on life
jackets, which were later found on some bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit crew and the controllers at Moncton spoke to one
another at various points as a rescue center at Halifax was
notified and arrangements to clear the way for the landing were
made. As the plane crossed over the south shore of Nova Scotia and
headed inland toward Halifax Airport 30 to 40 miles away, however,
it suddenly changed course again, apparently after the pilot
concluded that he had to dump some of his fuel at sea, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said it was the pilot's decision to do this, probably
because an emergency landing is safer without heavily loaded fuel
tanks, or because the plane might have been easier to land without
the extra weight. In any event, radar tracking data showed that the
plane circled left and flew in a wide arc over land, down St.
Margaret's Bay and out over the ocean again, traveling at little
more than half its normal cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the aircraft was too heavy to land while
approaching Halifax and had to dump some fuel,'' Gerden said. ``My
understanding is that he would have turned or maneuvered somewhat
to dump the fuel prior to attempting the landing because he was too
heavy to land.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:25 p.m., the fuel dumping began _ rescuers later reported a
heavy odor of fuel on the water _ and, for reasons that were
unclear Thursday, the crew raised its distress call to a formal
mayday emergency. Five minutes later, at 9:30 p.m., under moonless
but clear skies, the plane suddenly plunged into the ocean.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The plane, when it fell, was about 40 miles, or 7 to 10 minutes
of flying time, short of Halifax Airport, officials said, and there
no explanation why it happened. No one suggested that the plane had
dumped too much fuel and run out. And no one suggested that the
pilot's decision to twice divert his course _ first to head for
Boston and then, with Halifax Airport less than 40 miles away, to
circle around back to sea and dump fuel _ had been a judgment
error.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in Peggy's Cove, Blandford, Hubbards and other coastal
towns, many of them already in bed _ it was 10:30 p.m., local time
_ reported hearing the sputtering noises of an aircraft passing
overhead, and then a thunderous crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting with my husband outside by the little cottage
behind our house, by the water,'' said Sharon Hoagland, 48, of
Hubbards, on St. Margaret's Bay, 10 miles from the crash site. ``We
heard a huge sound. Initially I thought it was thunder. Then we
herd a smaller second rumble. It was a thunderous boom, but there
was no rain, no lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Blandford, Mabel Schnare, was at her son's house by
the water. ``I heard this big noise,'' she said. ``My, oh my, I
said to myself. What does this fool think he's doing, flying so
low. It was so loud I thought it would hit the house.'' A moment
later, the house shook violently.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Comdr. Glenn Chamberlain, a spokesman for the Canadian Navy
and Coast Guard's joint rescue command center in Halifax, said that
local boaters with intimate knowledge of treacherous coastal waters
_ fishermen, lobstermen and others _ provided invaluable aid in the
early hours after the crash. Many ran down and pushed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's people who recognized that this was a tragedy, that
people needed help, and they didn't pause to think _ they just went
and helped,'' Chamberlain said. The seas, relatively calm at the
time of the crash, grew to angry 10 foot swells through the night
as drenching rains fell and winds rose to a howl.
</P>
<P>
   Within 40 minutes of the crash, the small boaters were joined by
Canadian Navy and Coast Guard vessels: frigates, cutters, supply
ships, helicopters and other craft, including police boats. Flares
rocketed aloft and fell slowly on parachutes, and the night search
recovered the first bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy weather forced a suspension until dawn, after which
the small boaters were sent home. By late morning, the operation
involved more than 1,500 search and rescue personnel on land, sea
and in the air. A makeshift morgue was set up aboard the Canadian
supply ship, HMCS Preserver, which had decks for helicopters and a
crew of 250.
</P>
<P>
   A small armada of search vessels, led by the Canadian frigate,
HMCS Ville de Quebec, hunted on a grid that was gradually expanded
from 5 square miles to 10 or more square miles. Several seaborne
helicopters were joined by land-based planes flying out of
Shearwater, a Canadian Forces base at Dartmouth, across Halifax
harbor from the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   A large morgue also was set up at Shearwater, and bodies, as
they were recovered, were to be flown there, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, Steve Duncan, chief superintendent of criminal
operations of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Roy Bears, an
official of Canada's National Transportation Safety Board, were
saying that a large section of the aircraft had been found about
120 feet under water. They did not say whether it had been detected
visually or by sonar.
</P>
<P>
   But they noted that if it was a large section of the fuselage,
it might yield many of the victims and the plane's cockpit voice
recorder and its flight recorder, the so-called black boxes that
detail a plane's movements, speed, altitude, fuel, electrical
systems and other vital information.
</P>
<P>
   American air safety experts were sent to assist Canadian
investigators, who had primary responsibility for the recovery
operations and the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of relatives and friends of the victims gathered
overnight at the airports in New York and Geneva, many of them
distraught or in states of shock. Grief counselors and Red Cross
workers were on hand to give assistance, and officials of Swissair
and Delta Air Lines, Swissair's U.S. partner, provided lounges and
other aid. Flights were arranged to take family members from Europe
and the United States to Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   In Halifax, 900 rooms were reserved for families of the victims,
along with transportation to Peggy's Cove, a village of 60
residents that was founded in 1811 and, with its lighthouse and
fleet of small boats, is one of the most picturesque in the
Maritime Provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair officials said the plane that crashed was put into
service in August 1991 and had been overhauled in August and
September last year. ``This airplane was in perfect working
order,'' said Georges Schorderet, chief financial officer of
Swissair's parent, Sairgroup. The jet had completed more than 6,000
flights in 35,000 hours aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The three-engine MD-11 _ with big jets on each wing and one in
the tail _ is known for reliability, aviation experts say. About
180 are in service, many of them as cargo carriers. Boeing, its
manufacturer, has announced plans to discontinue the model in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the worst since Swissair was founded in 1931. The
airline's last fatal crash occurred on Oct. 7, 1979, when one of
its DC-8s overshot a runway in Athens while trying to land and
burst into flames, killing 14 people.
</P>
<P>
   There were expressions of sympathy from around the world. In
South Africa, where he was attending a meeting, the U.N.
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, spoke of the loss of eight
colleagues. President Clinton, who was told of the disaster as he
left Moscow for Belfast, also expressed sorrow.

KENYA BOMBING DEFENDANT'S LAWYER MAY BE REPLACED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resent to correct garble. No changes)   (af)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lawyer for one of two defendants charged in the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya may be replaced Friday at a
hearing in U.S. district court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined precisely why Magistrate Judge Kevin
Fox has moved to change the lawyer for Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, the
defendant. But the lawyer, Jack Sachs, said he was told that the
reasons involve his ability to carry two potential death penalty
cases at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Sachs was assigned to represent Odeh, he
was also appointed to defend a man in an unrelated capital case,
involving interstate kidnapping and murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said Thursday that he believed that he could handle both
matters, and that he hoped to continue to represent Odeh if his
client so desired.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh was charged last month with conspiracy to commit murder,
use of a weapon of mass destruction, and 12 counts of murder, one
count for each of the 12 Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing.
If he is convicted, Odeh could face a maximum term of life in
prison or death.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said he had already met with Odeh four times at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and interviewed him
extensively. He said he had also interviewed Odeh's wife, who
remains in Kenya, by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's to be a change, it has to be done by the judge,''
Sachs said. ``I would like to keep the case, but I have to go with
whatever is decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs is one of about 150 lawyers who are eligible to be
appointed by judges to represent indigent defendants in U.S.
district court in Manhattan, and reimbursed by the government for
their work. In capital cases, the burden on lawyers is considered
to be so large that defendants are provided with two lawyers paid
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, 69, said he has been practicing law in U.S. court in
Manhattan since the early 1970s. He said he is currently a sole
practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal complaint against Odeh, prosecutors have said he
had denied taking part in a direct role in the embassy bombings but
admitted to being a member of a terrorist group run by the wealthy
Islamic militant, Osama bin Laden, whom the authorities suspect is
behind the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors also said he accepted some responsibility for
the attacks as a member of the bin Laden group. The bombing in
Kenya killed 258 people and wounded thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
   After Odeh was charged last month, Sachs denied to reporters
that his client had confessed to any role in the bombings. But he
said Odeh did acknowledge being a member of the bin Laden
organization.

WEST: `THIS IS THE PLACE I BELONG'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The imaginary scales in Jerry West's psyche were at
a perfectly weighted deadlock: On the side marked ``resign'' were
the immense stresses of running one of the NBA's top franchises. On
the other scale, marked ``stay,'' were the great joys of doing that
same job.
</P>
<P>
   Balanced scales meant indecision for the 60-year-old executive
vice president, who contemplated walking away after 16 years at the
helm of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But then the scales tipped hard. There was his commitment to
young stars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the emotional
investment West had made in this dynasty-in-waiting, his feelings
of loyalty. And, finally, the look on the faces of West's two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some pretty long faces,'' West noted. Ryan and Jonnie West,
ages 19 and 10 _ and perhaps Shaq's two biggest fans _ wouldn't let
Dad walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) absolutely love the Lakers, and they particularly love
(O'Neal).... There was one point when my two boys came into the
room... and the first question out of their mouths was, `Are you
still gonna get season seats?'''
</P>
<P>
   The West family's seats are safe, as is the future of the
Lakers, with Jerry West's signing of a four-year contract extension
Thursday morning. The deal, reportedly worth $3.5 million annually,
goes into effect in 1999 and runs through the 2002-03 season.
</P>
<P>
   A burned-out, stressed-out West spent the summer considering
everything from a sabbatical to resignation to retirement. And he
also considered at least one tempting, highly lucrative and
``challenging'' opportunity elsewhere that he declined to detail.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two weeks ago, just before West departed for his home away
from home in West Virginia, Lakers owner Jerry Buss offered the new
contract _ which, West insists, is ``not something that I asked
for.... This isn't about money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the offer clearly influenced his decision. West requested a
small alteration in the deal, and on the evening of Aug. 27, Buss
called and agreed to the change. A short while later, around 12:15
Friday morning, West's months-long quandary ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place I belong,'' West told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is he might not have reached that conclusion without
an assist from the labor-troubled league. NBA owners imposed a
lockout of players July 1, halting all business and giving league
executives an extended vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A godsend,'' West said of the lockout, ``because once the
(June 24) draft was over, I could start to work on myself.... I can
honestly tell you that if we had not had this time, I may not have
made this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   West's departure could have thrown a remarkably stable franchise
into turmoil. After 16 years under West, the Lakers could have ably
moved forward under his close protege, general manager Mitch
Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   But it is West's personality and his legacy as player and
executive _ with three NBA championships and seven Finals
appearances _ that helps attract marquee players like O'Neal and
Bryant. Both young stars had hinted they might leave after next
season if West resigned, and West said his commitment to O'Neal
especially weighed heavily on him.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lakers can again concentrate on reclaiming the
franchise's past glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always told you I felt he would stay because the Lakers
without Jerry is like a hamburger without a bun,'' coach Del Harris
said. ``He's been such a central part of our success here for so
many years, that was an important thing for the Lakers to maintain
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Had West decided to walk away, it would not have been to pursue
another NBA job.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to go anywhere else would have been ridiculous,'' West
said. ``I don't care what kind of offers they were. I probably
couldn't have faced myself when I got up in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss was reportedly out of town but issued a statement praising
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has meant more to the Los Angeles Lakers franchise than
Jerry West,'' Buss said. ``Since 1960 he has brought talent,
intelligence, class, dignity _ and success _ to this team, this
city and this organization. Keeping him here will ensure that the
Lakers will be one of the best-run franchises in sports well into
the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The new deal virtually guarantees West's career will end where
it began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would very definitely think this would be my last
contract,'' West said, then added with a laugh, ``I'll probably die
behind that desk.''

LILY TOMLIN IN ADVERTISING DEBUT WITH FIDELITY'S PETER LYNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lily Tomlin, who once searched for signs of
intelligent life in the universe, is joining Peter Lynch to help
investors search for signs of intelligent life on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tomlin and three of her comedic characters will appear with
Lynch, the former mutual fund manager, in a television, print and
poster campaign for Fidelity Investments that carries the theme
``Key things every investor should know.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious campaign by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in
Boston, which begins Sept. 11, is meant to develop a brighter
personality for the Fidelity brand as it educates Americans about
their finances _ and peddles, in a low-key manner, Fidelity
products like mutual funds and brokerage services.
</P>
<P>
   That the odd couple's campaign comes as investors nervously
monitor the gyrations of stocks, bonds and currencies around the
world is a coincidence because the ads have been under development
for six months. But the campaign addresses such timely topics as
volatility and risk; in one commercial, Lynch, exercising on a
treadmill, informs Ms. Tomlin, playing her Valley Girl character
Suzie as a ``stress technician,'' that stocks have declined ``25
percent or more four times since 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign marks the first time that a celebrity has appeared
in advertising for Fidelity, which is part of FMR Corp. It is also
the first time that Lynch, who used to manage the Fidelity Magellan
Fund, is being used as a spokesman by Fidelity, where he is now
vice chairman of Fidelity Management and Research Co.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the campaign represents the first advertising work for
Ms. Tomlin, she said Thursday as she, Lynch and Fidelity executives
discussed the ads at a news conference in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tomlin confirmed a tale often told on Madison Avenue that
she once turned down an offer from AT&AMP;T to appear in a commercial
as Ernestine, the snippy telephone operator whose nasal rendition
of ``One ringy-dingy . . . two ringy-dingys'' became a national
catch phrase when she performed on ``Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also didn't believe in investing in the stock market in
those days,'' Ms. Tomlin said ruefully, because ``my politics
wouldn't allow me to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the error of those ways now,'' she added, as a result of
``my own money dribbled away'' by business managers who would
invest ``in limited partnerships and all kinds of convoluted
syndicates that they put people like me in in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I would like people to be empowered by having a share in
this country and some security for the future,'' particularly
``women and young people,'' Ms. Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When only an elite group has a stake in the future,'' she
added, ``that's divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch could not quite match Ms. Tomlin's humorous asides at the
news conference. She slyly jabbed at stock market arcana like the
Elliott wave theory and the perhaps apocryphal ``McClellan
oscillator,'' and sagely advised that ``the two most important
things I've begun to learn a little too late in life are to wear
more sunscreen and to invest.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked which Fidelity funds she owned, Ms. Tomlin replied:
``An equity utilities fund and a growth and income fund. Does that
make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   But Lynch drew chuckles for some of his frank remarks. He
derided investors who freak out when indexes fall sharply; after
all, he asserted, residents of Minnesota ``don't panic and say,
`This is the end of the world''' when temperatures plunge in
wintertime.
</P>
<P>
   And Lynch mocked timing stock purchases and sales to months of
the year by likening that strategy to buying a house based on the
name of the street on which it is situated.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch acquits himself well in the commercials with Ms. Tomlin.
(He appears without her in corporate spots, which begin running
Sept. 5, that focus on Fidelity's experience and service.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the commercial in which Lynch trods the treadmill
alongside Suzie, he discusses the pitfalls of ``information
overload'' with Ms. Tomlin's character of Judith Beasley, the
tasteful homemaker, and talks about the futility of chasing ``hot
tips'' with Ms. Tomlin's character of Pauline, a short-tempered
clerk at the motor vehicle bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Lily Tomlin telling her fans `Put your money here,'''
said Gail Schoenbrunn, senior vice president and group creative
director at Hill, Holliday, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.
Rather, she added, depicting Ms. Tomlin as her characters is an
effective method to illustrate ``the different kinds of
situations'' about which investors need to be informed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tomlin collaborated with the agency on the campaign, Ms.
Schoenbrunn said, sending tapes of her performances to help select
which characters to feature and ``corresponding a lot by e-mail''
on the scripts. The ads eschewed famous characters like Ernestine
or Edith Ann, the bratty child, she added, because ``we were
concerned it not appear as if the celebrity was overtaking the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, though, a celebrity at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get people to sit up and take notice,'' said
Stephen Cone, president at Fidelity Customer Marketing and
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using Lily and Peter together gets more attention than
garden-variety financial service advertising,'' he added, ``with
people looking at pie charts on computer screens or your
ever-popular landscape scenes of footprints in the desert or
airbrushed older people riding on horseback on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   A second celebrity may appear in a campaign Fidelity plans to
introduce in October; Adweek and USA Today reported recently that
Don Rickles would appear in those ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not necessarily the case,'' Cone said. ``I haven't
finalized the next spots yet. The only person we have under
contract at the moment is Lily.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a contradictory stance for a company that asks its
customers for financial information, Cone declined to discuss how
much Fidelity would spend on the campaign through the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company has its little rules,'' Cone said of Fidelity's
consideration of ad spending as proprietary information, ``and this
is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU NV,
Fidelity spent $90 million last year on advertising.

LEHMAN EXPECTS RUSSIAN TURMOIL TO HELP CUT NET BY $60 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said Thursday that the
financial turmoil in Russia and other developing countries would
reduce its net income by $60 million for the three months ended
Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street brokerage firm said it had expected its net
income for its third fiscal quarter to be about $211 million but
now estimates that it will come in at $151 million, a sharp fall
from the $197 million net income it reported in the period a year
earlier. Lehman also said its earnings for the first three quarters
of its fiscal year would be about $662 million, up from $462
million for the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's estimates follow similar announcements from many U.S.
and European financial institutions, including Citicorp, Chase
Manhattan, Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Barclays PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, analysts said Thursday, U.S. and European
institutions have lost billions of dollars as they have had to
write off their holdings of Russian debt.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock market has stumbled in recent weeks, the shares of
brokerage firms have been particularly hard hit, and Thursday was
no exception. Lehman's stock fell $3.75 a share, to $38.375, down
sharply from $85 on July 13, its high for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Revised forecasts by First Call Corp. published Thursday for the
three months ending Sept. 30 show a cut of 11 percent in Lehman's
expected earnings per share, to $1.36 a share. Similar revisions of
analysts' consensus estimates for third-quarter earnings predict
reductions of as little as 3 percent for Charles Schwab and as much
as 52 percent for Bear Stearns, according to First Call, the
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the bad news is out yet, some analysts fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's potentially more to come _ Latin America appears to be
deteriorating,'' said Joan S. Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson.
``And hedge funds, which might have been meeting margin calls at
the end of August might not be by the end of September.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Lehman estimate, however, was better than some analysts
had expected. ``Not bad for a trading house, actually,'' said John
Keefe, president of Keefe Worldwide Information Services. ``It was
one of the smaller numbers among the capital markets brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman spokesman William Ahearn declined to elaborate on the
announcement and said the firm would provide more information in
the coming weeks, when it released full results for its third
quarter.

N.J. DISTRICT'S SCHOOL YEAR BEGINS WITH STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resent to correct garble. No changes.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just three-and-a-half hours before the first day of school
Thursday, teachers went on strike in the largest district in
Monmouth County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout in Middletown Township came as predawn bargaining
failed after two years of futile negotiations and frosty relations
between the sprawling suburb's 800 teachers and its school board.
The strike guaranteed a rocky start to the new school year for
10,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were wage increases, the possible loss of teacher
preparation time and proposals that all teachers pay part of their
health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Students arrived at their schools to find regular teachers
walking the picket lines, and substitutes and administrators
staffing classrooms and straining to handle book distribution and
other typical routines of a new academic year. Students were
dismissed after four hours because of the strike, said Karen
Kondek, a spokeswoman for the Middletown school board.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials complained bitterly that board officials had
gone to state court Wednesday afternoon and sought a back-to-work
order even before a last round of talks had started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unheard of to seek a restraining order hours before
bargaining begins,'' said Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New
Jersey Education Association, the statewide teachers' union.
``Clearly, this board of education had no intention of settling
this dispute last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The district did get the restraining order during the night, but
Ms. Kondek said that the board did not plan to seek contempt
citations against the strikers until court deputies had served all
of them with the order.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Joseph said Middletown's teachers were still angry that the
board invoked a rarely used state labor law in late July to impose
a contract consisting of its ``last best offer'' for the 1998-99
academic year. In the 30 years since passage of the law, school
boards have imposed contracts nine times on teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joseph said Middletown's union would not agree to a new
contract until the board rescinded the imposed contract, which
replaced a contract that ended two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The imposed contract provided for an annual pay increase of 2.8
percent for five years. The union wants an average annual increase
of 4 percent for six years, to match the average increase that
other districts in Monmouth have granted recently, Ms. Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards
Association, said that a law passed in 1985 raised salaries for
starting teachers to $18,500 from about $13,000. Now, it is about
$31,000, Belluscio said.
</P>
<P>
   School boards in New Jersey facing these steadily increasing
wage costs have looked for savings by requiring teachers to pay
higher deductibles and a share of the premiums for health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Middletown's board is trying now to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the board persuaded voters to approve a $78 million
bond issue, the largest in the state, to finance repairs and
additions to the township's two high schools and three middle
schools.
</P>
<P>
   To produce savings elsewhere, the board wants to take away one
of the two preparation periods that middle school teachers have and
require all teachers to pay $600 to $1,900 a year for health
insurance premiums, depending on their family size and years of
service, school officials said. Both of these conditions are part
of the imposed contract, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joseph, the union spokeswoman, said Middletown's teachers
were resisting because no other district in Monmouth County had
those conditions. In the last round of bargaining, the teachers
offered to contribute to premiums for dental insurance and increase
their co-payment for prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the school board did not respond with a
counteroffer until 4 a.m. Thursday, a half-hour before the strike
deadline and too late to prevent the walkout.

LATIN AMERICA TELLS IMF ITS ECONOMIES ARE SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearful of being swept up in the financial turmoil
that has devastated Asia and Russia, officials from nine Latin
American nations said Thursday that their economies were basically
sound and should not be penalized indiscriminately by panicky
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving for the start of a two-day meeting with the
International Monetary Fund, the officials said that they were not
seeking any international financial help, and that they were taking
the difficult steps needed to weather a storm that is threatening
to batter much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is doing its homework,'' said Mexican Finance
Minister Jose Angel Gurria. ``Markets are certainly overreacting
and not discriminating at all. Everyone is thrown in the same
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration praised the progress of many Latin
American countries. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, arriving for
the meeting, said that what transpires in the region was profoundly
important to the United States and that many Latin governments had
``accomplished a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors paid little heed to those messages. Financial markets
across Latin America fell sharply Thursday, one day after Colombia
devalued its currency. Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating
agency, downgraded its rating of Brazil's foreign-currency debt,
setting off an 8.6 percent decline in the main stock-market index
there.
</P>
<P>
   The worries about Latin America are growing as Rubin prepared to
meet on Friday in San Francisco with Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa. Rubin is expected to keep the pressure on Japan to
strengthen its banking system and do more to pull its economy out
of the doldrums and help the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that the global financial unrest spreads through
Latin America, it will only increase the risks to the U.S. economy
and to investors on Wall Street, where there is concern that
corporate earnings will suffer as growth slows or evaporates in
Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and other big markets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the combination of Latin America's checkered
economic history and the current turmoil in global markets all but
assured that the region was in for a bumpy ride at a time when
investors are looking for the safest places to put their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a region with high external debt numbers and a history
of default in a world that's currently experiencing a flight to
quality,'' said Phil Suttle, an international economist at J.P.
Morgan in New York. ``In that situation, it's a tough world for
Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela attended the meeting, along with Rubin
and Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the fund's unstated agenda might have been to
warn the Latin nations not to expect much help if they ran into
trouble, because the IMF has been warning for months that it is
running short of money to finance further bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   But IMF officials said they would make clear to the Latin
nations that money would be there to support countries that took
the necessary difficult steps to whip their economies and financial
systems into shape.

N.J. GOVERNOR TO STUMP FOR REPUBLICANS IN 6 STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Nev., Ariz., N.M., Calif., Hawaii, N.J.)   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman begins a weeklong,
six-state campaign swing in Montana on Friday. Along the way, she
will raise money for fellow Republicans and try to bolster the
campaigns of more than a dozen candidates, as well as her own
standing within the party.
</P>
<P>
   Although some political analysts had predicted that Whitman's
narrow re-election victory last fall would reduce the number of
invitations she gets from across the country, her office said that
had not been the case. Whitman administration officials said that
27 state party organizations had asked her to help raise money or
join candidates on the campaign trail this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is welcoming Whitman's arrival. Her role as a
prominent leader of the Republican Party's moderate wing, and her
support of abortion rights, is expected to attract anti-abortion
protesters at some stops.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Koutnik, the executive director of the Christian
Coalition of Montana, said she had been besieged by telephone calls
from members of her group who said they were outraged that Whitman
was campaigning on behalf of Republicans in their state.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has mounted a national campaign to abolish the pro-life
plank of the GOP platform,'' Mrs. Koutnik said. ``We don't want her
basically stumping to have us somehow overlook our deeply help
convictions on the most fundamental issue to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana Republican Party chairwoman Sue Aleksich-Akey said that
opposition to Whitman's visit by some of the party's more
conservative members had not dampened enthusiasm for the
$50-a-person fund-raising event that the governor is attending
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected at the event are Gov. Marc Racicot and Rep. Rick
Hill, the state's most prominent Republican on the ballot this
year. Hill differs with Whitman on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the Christian Coalition took after us, our phone
has been ringing off the hook with reservations,'' Ms.
Aleksich-Akey said. ``I am a very good Republican. I vote for
Republicans even if I disagree with them on a single issue.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been Whitman's mantra for the national Republican
Party. She has repeatedly urged party members to stop focusing on
abortion rights and to start emphasizing fiscal issues, like
cutting taxes and controlling government spending.
</P>
<P>
   During her trip to Montana, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,
California and Hawaii, Whitman is scheduled to appear with
candidates who both support and oppose abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have consistently campaigned for people who don't share my
position of that issue because I don't believe it to be the
dominant issue,'' she said, as she prepared to leave on her trip.
``I don't believe that you become a national party by drawing lines
in the sand and saying you have to be ideologically pure on one or
two issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she was making the trip because she was raised to
believe in the importance of supporting Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the daughter of the state chairman and a national
committeewoman,'' she said. ``I was brought up to be supportive of
other candidates. And that's what I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   And since education, lower taxes and safer streets were major
campaign themes for most of the candidates, she said that she
intended to talk a lot about her efforts in New Jersey to improve
public schools, cut taxes and reduce crime.

POSITIONS AVAILABLE AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bruins concluded training camp Thursday with a Rose Bowl
scrimmage designed, in part, to evaluate personnel at three
positions:
</P>
<P>
   Tailback, where Antelope Valley High graduate Jermaine Lewis,
Keith Brown and DeShaun Foster are competing to replace Skip Hicks.
The Bruins will announce a starter today, but Toledo stressed that
all three will play against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Foster, who scampered 45 yards on his
first carry Thursday and was again the most impressive runner, will
not start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a freshman, he's made a few mistakes, and he's still
learning,'' Toledo said. ``The upperclassmen have not hurt
themselves so that they should be beaten out.''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety, where Eric Whitfield, Jason Stephens and Tod
McBride opened camp vying for Shaun Williams' position.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are two. McBride, whose bad knees limit his coverage
skills, has moved to strong safety behind Larry Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield is a superb athlete, one of UCLA's best, but tends to
short-circuit in coverage situations. Stephens is a redshirt
freshman with no game experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll know (today),'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is moving Atkins to free safety and sliding the
available personnel to the strong side. McBride, for one, is more
suited for its run-support demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is getting some work at free safety, but he won't be the
starter,'' Toledo said. ``If the free safeties don't do the job,
our contingency is to move Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker, where Michael Wiley, Santi Hall and Ali
Azziz are competing. One will start, one will play second string.
The third will slide to the other side behind Brendan Ayanbadejo.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley is the best athlete, but Hall, a redshirt freshman, is an
intriguing talent with his 243-pound frame and 35-inch vertical
jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a very bright future,'' outside linebackers coach Bob
Field said. ``But he was a little behind the other two in terms of
conditioning in fall camp. He's running extra to try to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   QB corner: Second-string quarterback Drew Bennett is slowly
regaining his form after a rough start. Thousand Oaks resident
Scott McEwan has improved, but not enough to challenge Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point where I feel (Bennett) is an
adequate backup now,'' Toledo said. ``He was putting too much
pressure on himself. He knows if something happens to Cade
(McNown), he would have to lead the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Snapper situation: Two subtle but significant personnel losses
from last season were long snappers Chris Rubio (place kicks) and
Mark Weisman (punts).
</P>
<P>
   So far, walk-on Jeff Grau is the No.1 snapper on kicks and tight
end Ryan Neufeld the top punt snapper.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Pierce Gerety, a Harvard-educated lawyer who
briefly considered the priesthood but instead devoted his life to
helping refugees trapped in the maelstroms of war and disaster
around the world, died on Wednesday night in the crash of the
Swissair jetliner off Nova Scotia. He would have been 57 next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gerety worked for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees as the
director of operations for the region of Central Africa
encompassing Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika, an assignment that
took him to Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. He was admired by other
humanitarian workers for his astuteness, wry humor and coolness in
the face of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had probably been in more physically dangerous situations
than anyone else in the refugee field,'' said Robert De Vecchi, the
retired president of the International Rescue Committee, which
originally hired Gerety to work with Cambodian refugees in
Thailand. ``He was equally comfortable briefing a head of state or
pulling a Vietnamese fishing boat out of the water,'' De Vecchi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerety's brother Tom, who is president of Amherst College, said:
``Pierce was shot at a lot. It seemed like he was constantly
courting risk and always pretty much got away scot-free.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ironic, Tom Gerety added, that his brother lost his life
on one of the world's safest airlines, flying to one of the world's
safest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Gerety was born into a family in Fairfield, Conn., that
valued public service. His father, Pierce Joseph Garety Sr., was
appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to supervise the
admission of refugees entering the United States after World War
II.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The younger Gerety graduated from Yale University in 1962 and
studied theology and philosophy at the Institute Catholique in
Paris, where he found time to set up a soup kitchen. He considered
becoming a Roman Catholic priest until he fell in love with a young
Frenchwoman, Marie de la Soudiere. They married and went off to
India to work for the Catholic Relief Services.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years Gerety returned home to attend Harvard
Law School, receiving his law degree in 1971. Ignoring more
lucrative prospects, he became a Legal Aid lawyer in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little impatient with American law,'' Tom Gerety said
of his brother. ``He wanted to be out and among people in crisis
and need.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Pierce Gerety approached the International Rescue
Committee and volunteered to go to Thailand and help with Cambodian
refugees who had fled their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a person with a very quick intelligence, an intuitive
sense of a situation and what needed to be done with the resources
at hand,'' said De Vecchi, who quickly hired him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Gerety became a legal officer at the headquarters of
the U.N. High Commissioner in Geneva, but soon began pushing to get
back into the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a quality of impatience and of a desire to go out and
live on the edge,'' Tom Gerety said. ``It was not dogmatic or
ideological. He retained this almost Catholic passion for working
with the poorest of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Gerety moved through a series of taxing assignments,
helping Eritrean refugees in the Sudan, Afghan refugees in Pakistan
and Vietnamese refugees in the Philippines. Even so, acquaintances
describe him as upbeat, if sometimes cynical about human nature.
</P>
<P>
   He was lent to the U.N. Children's Fund in Somalia, where a
warlord, Mohammed Aidid, took to kidnapping humanitarian aid
workers. Gerety walked into the warlord's armed camp and coolly
negotiated their release.
</P>
<P>
   Gerety returned to the refugee agency and was appointed last
year as its director of operations in Central Africa, where he and
other U.N. officials pleaded with the Congolese rebel leader Lauren
Kabili on behalf of the Rwandan refugees who were being
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   After the risks he took, friends said, Gerety wanted to spend
more time with his wife, who directs the International Rescue
Committee's program for children affected by wars, and their three
children, Pierce, Sebastian and Maeve. Gerety is also survived by
his mother, Helen, of Southport, Conn., and two other brothers,
Peter, a lawyer in Fairfield, Conn., and Miles, a lawyer in
Redding, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very proud of his children and very much in love with
his wife, and vice versa,'' said Susan Walker, a coordinator of the
International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, who first met Gerety in
Thailand. ``It was a joy to see them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when it seemed that this 1998 U.S. Open was
going to make a habit of parceling out the drama in tiny doses,
Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi received simultaneous scares
Thursday. A pair of unintimidating but intriguing challengers
summoned the audacity to trip up the former Open champions before
they had even reached the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sampras and Agassi took a humble stumble, neither took
the big fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the four-time Open champion who can tie Roy Emerson's
career record of 12 Grand Slams by staying on track for a fifth
U.S. Open title, was menaced by Stanford's Paul Goldstein, a
256th-ranked wild card whose main tour experience consists of a
single victory in the first round here, courtesy of an opponent's
default.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Goldstein may have been a neophyte, but through
two sets it was Sampras, with his racquet flailing like a fly
swatter, his shots straying like buckshot and a grimace of disgust
on his face, who played like a pretender before settling down to
business with a 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those days where I wasn't playing that
great, just had to try and find a way to get through it, and I
did,'' said Sampras, who was not offended by the
challenger-friendly hooting and hollering that emanated from the
packed gallery once word leaked out that the big man on campus was
taking a ribbing from a genuine underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't any big deal,'' Sampras said. ``You just have
to shut it out. It wasn't like they were rooting against me, they
were just pulling for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein admitted it had been his hope to keep things
competitive and keep Sampras engaged in Louis Armstrong Stadium,
the court where Sampras won all four of his Open titles, ``for at
least an hour.'' Instead, helped along by 24 unforced errors in the
first set by the top-seeded player and 19 more in the second,
Goldstein prolonged Sampras' discomfort for 2 hours 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's distress lasted even longer. After drawing an
interesting second-round opponent in Guillaume Raoux, who warmed up
for this Open by knocking its defending champion, Patrick Rafter,
off his pedestal two weeks ago in New Haven, Agassi proceeded to
joust with him for 2 hours 56 minutes. The mood in the half-empty
stadium was lethargic when the Las Vegan, wearing tent-sized black
shorts beneath his baggy white smock, strutted through the first
two sets like a little penguin. But things heated up once Raoux
caught Agassi napping and sent the match into a fifth set, with
Agassi winning, 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a little up and down, tweaking the idiosyncrasies
of my game,'' Agassi said. ``I was really frustrated with myself
for letting it get to the fourth set, it was careless tennis, and
you can't afford to have that happen or you're going to be in the
fifth. I think it certainly was a wake-up call of sorts for me to
be up two sets and not to close it out.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting his Grand Slam wake-up call from Raoux, Agassi
gave one of his own to the USTA and its Davis Cup administrators,
who might be under the mistaken impression that he plans to play if
the team reaches the final. He is refusing to face Italy later this
month in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was in my back yard, I wouldn't walk out the back
door,'' said Agassi, whose charity gala in Las Vegas takes place
the same weekend as the semifinal. Though Agassi agreed to
represent the United States against Italy if it chose a West Coast
site, he decided not to play after the USTA selected Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me three phone calls and we could easily have played in
Vegas,'' Agassi said. ``Davis Cup has always been very important to
me, but year after year it never ceases to amaze me what decisions
get made without the players' input. I'm tired of it and have no
interest in playing the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, all of the prominently seeded women zipped through
their assignments without a hitch, and without losing a set. Faced
with a second-round test against Iva Majoli of Croatia, who cost
her last year's Grand Slam sweep by defeating her in the French
Open final, the Open's defending champion, Martina Hingis,
negotiated it with escalating ease, 7-6 (7-4), 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport, seeded second and still chasing her first
career Slam along with Hingis' top ranking, trounced 34-year-old
Lori McNeil of Houston, 6-1, 6-1. And fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario, the defending French Open champion and this Slam's 1994
champion, eliminated Fabiano Zuluaga, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, a breakthrough finalist last year and seeded
fifth this year, patched up her differences with the WTA by
affixing the tour's logo patch to the shoulder of the racy key lime
swimsuit-turned-tennis-tube she wore for her 6-1, 6-3 demolition of
Anne Kremer. Williams was fined $100 for failing to wear the patch
for her first-round match, and faced a $500 fine if she repeated
the transgression Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though her sponsor, Reebok, claimed she was contractually
obligated not to add the logo to any of the seven sleeveless
outfits it designed for the Open, and though her coach and father,
Richard, threatened a lawsuit against the tour, Williams downplayed
the brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the missing patch had been restored to her outfit,
Williams said: ``Deviation is common among humans. It just seems I
am always in the middle after controversy, so it is nothing new for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams last year deflected the mess that ensued after her
infamous semifinal collision with Irina Spirlea prompted her father
to call Spirlea ``a tall, white turkey'' with racist intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really separate from those type of things,'' said
Williams, who termed her bump with Spirlea accidental and said she
bore no grudges.

OLD WESTBURY TO BE MODEL FOR NEW SUNY STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Old Westbury, N.Y., campus of the State University of New
York has had a reputation in recent years for having some of the
weakest students and lowest graduation rates among SUNY's 64
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 30-year-old college, which has an unusually high
percentage of minority students and has largely been ignored by
SUNY administrators for more than a decade, is about to become a
kind of demonstration project for the SUNY board and its efforts to
remake the university.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees have charged Old Westbury's new interim president,
Dr. W. Hubert Keen, with transforming the campus. And he will lay
out his vision in a speech to the college Friday, calling for
higher admissions standards, a more rigorous general education
base, less reliance on taxpayer support and more public
accountability through a system of clear measurements.
</P>
<P>
   He will also recommend a ``zero-tolerance'' policy to remove
students who break campus rules, as well as a substantial
building-and-repair program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan of action promises a fundamental transformation of
SUNY at Old Westbury,'' Keen said. ``We will graduate only students
who meet the standards being demanded by the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Keen's ideas closely resemble those of the SUNY
trustees, who say they want to attract better students to the
university and improve its quality. They are also trying to shape a
performance evaluation system that will determine which campuses
get more money and which get less. And they are trying to develop a
core curriculum that they can apply on all campuses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Keen, who applauds all of those initiatives, was appointed in
the spring with enthusiastic backing from the SUNY board and from
the institution's College Council, an advisory board that has
played an active role recently in trying to find a way to bolster
the Long Island college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Hubert's own philosophy was consistent with where the
SUNY board is headed,'' said William Howell, a businessman who is
chairman of the council. He said that he had been impressed with
Keen because he seemed to be someone who could work with the
college's multiple constituencies in turning a vision into reality.
</P>
<P>
   While the trustees work to put their ideas into effect at all of
SUNY's 64 colleges, Keen will be focused on a 605-acre campus with
about 3,700 students _ about half of them members of minority
groups _ and a faculty of 120 full-time and 100 part-time members.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken biologist who was not known for making waves as
provost of the City University of New York's York College, he
sought to play down the possible upheaval from his plan in a
telephone interview this week. He said he preferred to think of it
as a series of ``bold steps'' rather than something
``revolutionary'' or ``radical.'' And he was quick to say that any
transformation must be the result of a ``consensus-building
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of reform attitude among the faculty,''
he said, adding that even before his arrival in June, the faculty
and staff at Old Westbury had begun to conduct their own
self-examination in response to SUNY's request that all colleges
review their missions.
</P>
<P>
   Although faculty members at Old Westbury have not yet heard
Keen's proposals, many of them are eager to improve the college
physically and educationally, and to receive more support from
SUNY.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is hopeful,'' said Gretchen Johnson, an associate
professor in teacher education and the new chairwoman of the
college's faculty senate. ``A lot of faculty are a little worried
about whether we will be able to maintain the original mission of
the college, but realize there needs to be change to support that
mission better.''
</P>
<P>
   The original mission of Old Westbury called for it to serve
``nontraditional students,'' including adults and high school
students who were not well prepared for college.
</P>
<P>
   One question Old Westbury will face as it considers the Keen
plan is whether it is possible to raise admissions criteria and
still maintain its diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Keen would like to require a score of at least 1,000 on the
College Board's SAT exams, slightly below the national average of
1,017. Old Westbury does not now require that applicants take the
SAT, but those who have submitted scores in recent years have
scored less than 750 on average, substantially lower than the
proposed cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   Keen said he believes Old Westbury could raise its admissions
criteria and still maintain its diverse mix ``because Old Westbury
is an institution already identified by ethnic students and
minorities as a place they will feel welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be more respected for the steps we are taking
here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carroll, president of the Empire Foundation, a
conservative research group that studies public higher education in
New York state, said the strategy for Old Westbury is just what is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student body is just ridiculous; the place is like a
mediocre high school,'' he said.

KENYA BOMBING DEFENDANT'S LAWYER MAY BE REPLACED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resent to correct garble. No changes)   (af)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lawyer for one of two defendants charged in the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya may be replaced Friday at a
hearing in U.S. district court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined precisely why Magistrate Judge Kevin
Fox has moved to change the lawyer for Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, the
defendant. But the lawyer, Jack Sachs, said he was told that the
reasons involve his ability to carry two potential death penalty
cases at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Sachs was assigned to represent Odeh, he
was also appointed to defend a man in an unrelated capital case,
involving interstate kidnapping and murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said Thursday that he believed that he could handle both
matters, and that he hoped to continue to represent Odeh if his
client so desired.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh was charged last month with conspiracy to commit murder,
use of a weapon of mass destruction, and 12 counts of murder, one
count for each of the 12 Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing.
If he is convicted, Odeh could face a maximum term of life in
prison or death.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said he had already met with Odeh four times at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and interviewed him
extensively. He said he had also interviewed Odeh's wife, who
remains in Kenya, by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's to be a change, it has to be done by the judge,''
Sachs said. ``I would like to keep the case, but I have to go with
whatever is decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs is one of about 150 lawyers who are eligible to be
appointed by judges to represent indigent defendants in U.S.
district court in Manhattan, and reimbursed by the government for
their work. In capital cases, the burden on lawyers is considered
to be so large that defendants are provided with two lawyers paid
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, 69, said he has been practicing law in U.S. court in
Manhattan since the early 1970s. He said he is currently a sole
practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal complaint against Odeh, prosecutors have said he
had denied taking part in a direct role in the embassy bombings but
admitted to being a member of a terrorist group run by the wealthy
Islamic militant, Osama bin Laden, whom the authorities suspect is
behind the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors also said he accepted some responsibility for
the attacks as a member of the bin Laden group. The bombing in
Kenya killed 258 people and wounded thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
   After Odeh was charged last month, Sachs denied to reporters
that his client had confessed to any role in the bombings. But he
said Odeh did acknowledge being a member of the bin Laden
organization.

SENATE CANDIDATES STRESS AID FOR THE YOUNG, OLD AND ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a speech that her aides billed as a major policy
address, Geraldine Ferraro said Thursday night that government
should help relieve some of the financial burden borne by families
of the chronically ill, and she called for a comprehensive federal
regulation of the long-term-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponents in New York's Democratic primary race for U.S.
Senate _ Mark Green and Charles Schumer _ also avowed their
commitment to protecting the vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking during an upstate campaign swing Thursday, Green, the
New York City public advocate, concentrated on programs to help
children. And Schumer, a congressman representing parts of Brooklyn
and Queens, emphasized his record of defending Medicare and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro spoke in New York City before the Democratic Leadership
for the 21st Century, a group of under-40 Democratic advocates. She
devoted much of her speech to an attack on the Republican
incumbent, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, whom she described as an enemy of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, which her campaign staff finished writing barely
an hour before she was to deliver it, Ferraro referred to her
personal experience of caring for elderly relatives and emphasized
what she has claimed are her special concerns for women's issues.
She said that most providers of care in the home, whether family
members or hired nurses, are women.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the cost of long-term care, Ferraro proposed a program
of federal grants to subsidize home care, tax deductions for
long-term-care insurance and a federal law that would permit
employees to use unpaid leave to take sick relatives to doctors'
appointments. ``Long-term care,'' she said, ``requires long-term
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next few days, during the Labor Day weekend, much of the
action in the Democratic race for Senate will take place outside of
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro is scheduled to set out Friday on a four-day road tour
that will take her to Binghamton, Ithaca, Rochester, Syracuse,
Albany and a handful of towns in between. She was in Buffalo
earlier this week, as was Schumer. Green was there Thursday and is
in the midst of his own campaign tour to Democratic outposts in the
northern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   But for big-city Democrats, it can be chilly up north.
</P>
<P>
   At the state fair in Syracuse, Green found himself rebuffed in
his efforts to greet and shake the hands of passers-by. ``There are
a few more Republicans up here than in Manhattan,'' he remarked
before settling for a barbecue lunch of pulled-pork sandwiches. ``I
am getting that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Green found the reception friendlier in Rochester, where he
inaugurated what he called, in a dig at a favorite Republican
theme, his ``Green Family Values Tour.'' Accompanied by Mayor
William Johnson, one of his more ardent backers, he told a friendly
group of assembled Democrats that he wanted to create a social
security system for children that would feature universal health
insurance for children and pregnant women and finance the
renovation of schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a campaign upstate is not expensive in terms of money _
the price of television and radio advertising is much less than in
the New York City market _ but can be costly in time. Still,
campaign strategists say that to ignore the upstate Democratic
organizations and officials during the primary would be to court
trouble in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Green, in particular, have actively sought the
endorsement of local politicians in upstate counties. ``They do
help provide credibility to voters who may not be as familiar with
the candidate,'' said Monroe County Democratic chairman Robert
Cook, who has decided to stay neutral in the Senate primary.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has spent about one day a week upstate during the last
few weeks. He spent a day in Buffalo this week and said he would go
back before the Sept. 15 primary. His television ads in other
upstate markets began running this week.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than his opponents, Schumer has tried to tailor his
message to reach different audiences. This week, he jumped into a
local controversy and urged a Buffalo managed-care company to
include among its providers a popular network of Catholic
hospitals. His television ads in upstate cities emphasize his
commitment to job programs and urban development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of anti-New York feeling,'' Schumer said in an
interview, but I think I've shown upstate people I care about the
same things they do.'' He said he did change his demeanor or his
opinions to fit the geography. ``I am pretty much the same wherever
I go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer spent Thursday close to home, expounding on his record
of support for Medicare, Social Security and pension reform to the
elderly residents of the Prospect Park Residence in Brooklyn, an
assisted-living facility that is literally steps away from the
apartment building where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   The event, however, seemed a little out of kilter. Schumer
arrived 35 minutes late and was greeted with a one-man rendition of
``Happy Days Are Here Again,'' played by an entertainer named Banjo
Bob, a regular at the residence who had gamely tried to keep the
drowsy seniors occupied during the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Although the facility is private, does not accept Medicaid and
rents out its air-conditioned apartments for $2,100 to $4,500 a
month, Schumer spoke of his efforts in Congress to prevent cuts in
such programs as Meals on Wheels for the elderly poor.

DODGERS REDUCED TO SPOILER ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One team will be playing for a wild-card berth
this weekend and, unfortunately for the Dodgers, it will be the
guys in the black hats.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants enter tonight's series opener at Dodger
Stadium trailing the Chicago Cubs by two games and the New York
Mets by one for the final National League playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Spoiler? It's a label the Dodgers don't want, especially during
the first week of September. But whenever these two teams get
together, there always seems to be something on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time it happens on the final weekend of the series,
but this year, the Dodgers close out the season with four bitterly
contested games against the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to think about us as a spoiler,'' center fielder
Raul Mondesi said. ``There is a month left. We can't think about
that. This is a big series coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, who have won 9 of 12, maybe. And the Dodgers
don't have a month left. They are eight games back with just 21 to
play. The last time these two teams played, July 13-15, the Giants
took two of three, including an emotional 5-3 victory by former
Dodger Orel Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Giants and Dodgers will play a far more critical
series in two weeks in San Francisco, every game is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants are playing with a lot of intensity,'' said former
Dodger Mike Piazza, whose Mets took two of three from San Francisco
last week. ``They don't beat themselves. This should be great until
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so great for the Dodgers, but at least they have their
memories.
</P>
<P>
   In the final game of Piazza's rookie year (1993), he hit two
home runs to eliminate the Giants, who won 103 games that year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giants left fielder Barry Bonds is on a tear with 11
homers and 23 RBI in his last 20 games, second baseman Jeff Kent
has been just as important.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from a knee injury 38 games ago, Kent has 52
RBI. He has a 13-game hitting streak with seven homers and 18 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' (105) and Kent's (104) RBI totals mark the first time
since 1961-62 that the Giants have had back-to-back 100 RBI seasons
(Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda).
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Kent and tonight's starter Shawn Estes, who
returns after missing a month with shoulder problems, has been the
Giants' biggest curse this season.
</P>
<P>
   This game will mark the first time Kent and Estes have been
active together since June 9. The Giants were just a game behind
San Diego in the National League West. Now, it's 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: The Dodgers are at .500 (70-70) for the 29th time
this season. After sweeping the Phillies, they also are hoping to
win four straight for the first time this season.

LABOR HISTORIAN'S LIFE'S WORK: HONORING THOSE WHO LABORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day last summer, Dr. Debra Bernhardt rode to the
17th story of 200 Park Avenue South, at 17th Street, and made her
way to the roof. Stepping past the air-conditioning equipment and
water pipes, she stood at the edge of the building and gazed down
at what had become of Union Square, for so long the switchyard of
labor organizing and radical agitation in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The union halls and socialist publishers were mostly gone,
replaced by upscale stores and restaurants like Barnes &AMP; Noble and
the Heartland Brewery. The old Communist Party headquarters on
Union Square East was now a Toys ``R'' Us. The Zeckendorf Tower
condominiums had replaced the S. Klein department store, which in
its day had replaced Joe's, the workingman's saloon that was the
setting for that old wisp of streetcorner doggerel, ``The Face on
the Barroom Floor.''
</P>
<P>
   And just below, on the paved plaza at the north end of Union
Square Park, the city's foodies prowled for goat cheese and
jalapeno jelly and 15 kinds of sprouts in the greenmarket on the
exact site of the Sept. 5, 1882, parade that was later recognized
as the nation's first Labor Day celebration. Back then, the people
marching through the square were seeking something else _ an
eight-hour workday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernhardt shook her head and lifted her camera, as if
recalling the past to life. She had positioned herself so that her
photographs would align with the lithographs of that first parade,
matching the geography if not the passionate exuberance of the
original park. And when she was finished, the pictures would become
yet another piece of her meticulously gathered evidence of the
specific and significant past struggling to be heard above the ring
of electronic cash registers and fevered construction around this
patch of green.
</P>
<P>
   Her three years of work will pay off Sept. 12, when the National
Park Service officially declares Union Square Park a national
historic landmark, largely on the strength of her research. The
local labor movement will rouse itself to re-enact that first
parade, with volunteers dressed like such historical firebrands as
Samuel Gompers and Frances Perkins, and marchers carrying signs
with ancient slogans like ``Eight Hours a Legal Day's Work'' and
``Party Hacks to the Rear.'' (The latter could become a bit awkward
once the real Labor Day parade begins, a few hours later, with its
usual phalanx of election-year office seekers.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernhardt, the director of the Robert F. Wagner Labor
Archives at New York University, is more accustomed to the cocoon
of library shelves than the cacophony of a parade, but she will be
there as co-chairman of the event with Brian McLaughlin, president
of the city's Central Labor Council, which sponsored her research
along with the Amalgamated Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, submitted to the U.S. Interior Department, came
after she and local labor officials realized how little of the
park's history had been preserved, and how few of the nation's
2,250 historic landmarks were related to the labor movement (25, to
be precise).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost so much of our history,'' she said earlier this
week in a shady corner of the park. ``No one realizes that the
eight-hour day was won by working people on these streets, in this
park. We wanted to celebrate the fact that ordinary people were
able to express their rights to free speech and assembly on this
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernhardt, 45, wears her politics on her sleeve, as a
soft-spoken but ardent child of labor who puts a union label on her
business card, sings in the New York City Labor Chorus, and is
known to friends by the nickname of Debs, after the socialist
presidential candidate and labor leader.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the archives _ a collection of hundreds of
thousands of personal papers, books, journals, badges and
photographs _ are a center for scholarly research on anarchism,
communism, and labor socialism, she describes herself as a ``Hubert
Humphrey Democrat,'' who was a Mo Udall delegate to the 1976
Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democratic diaper baby from the Rust Belt,'' she said,
having been infused with pro-labor sentiment from an early age.
Many of her Danish-American male relatives were iron miners in the
upper-peninsula town of Iron River, Mich., where she grew up, and
her parents had only slightly less strenuous careers as high school
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   She now lives with her husband and two children in Boerum Hill,
Brooklyn, and still wears, as a necklace, a piece of burnished iron
slag from the foundry where her grandfather worked.
</P>
<P>
   The old plant is closed now, as are most of the mines, and she
says she carries them around in her head along with her father's
exhortation not to forget where she came from. That has led to an
energetic career as an archivist helping to remember where everyone
else came from, snapping up personal papers of aging labor leaders
and locals and assisting researchers in the stacks.
</P>
<P>
   For the landmark project she dug up old newspaper accounts of
the first parade, and reminded the park service of the soapbox
speeches and workers' rallies in Union Square that will now be
remembered with a plaque and several historical signs somewhere
within the fresh vegetable stands of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it wouldn't hurt if all this also reminds labor itself of
its noble traditions,'' she added, smiling subversively.

JOHN MORTIMER, FORMER N.Y. TIMES EXECUTIVE, AND WIFE ARE CRASH
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Mortimer, 75, a former senior vice president of The New
York Times for personnel and industrial relations, and his wife of
22 years, Hilda, 69, died in the Swissair plane crash Wednesday.
They lived in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   They were on their way to a vacation in France, their family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Bishow, a retired senior vice president for operations at
The New York Times, said Thursday that Mortimer played the dominant
role on behalf of the newspaper in negotiations before and during
every strike while he was with The Times during the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer was born in Bronxville, N.Y. He served in the Army Air
Force in the South Pacific during World War II and graduated from
Williams College in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   After working in industrial relations at The New York Daily
News, he joined The New York Times in 1962 as industrial relations
manager and held a succession of industrial relations and personnel
positions. From 1973 to 1981, he was senior vice president for
personnel and industrial relations. He later held other positions,
including senior vice president and assistant to the general
manager of the newspaper and, finally, assistant to the president
of The New York Times Co., before retiring in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer's first wife, the former Harriet Watson, died in 1974
after more than 20 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer's survivors include two daughters, Claire Mortimer of
Berkeley, Calif., and Katherine Mortimer of Albany, Calif.; a son,
Stewart of Tucson, Ariz.; a brother, Donald, of Riverside, Conn.;
and a sister, Mary Hillegas, also of Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mortimer, the former Hilda Barnes Belcher, retired after
being on the paid staff of a succession of nonprofit organizations
engaged in arranging international student exchanges and in similar
activities. One was the Institute of International Education. A
previous marriage, to Robert S. Huffman, ended in divorce in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mortimer's survivors include a daughter, Susan Parker Boal
of Salisbury, Conn.; a son, Philip B. Huffman of Williston, Vt.;
four sisters, Marjorie S. Belcher of Washington, Elizabeth B.
Rogers of Champaign, Ill., and Helen C. Belcher and Ruth S.
Belcher, both of Plymouth, Mass.; and a brother, Edward L. Belcher
of Rochester, N.Y.

IMMIGRANT FIGHTS OFF THREATENED DEPORTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A week after he was told that the U.S. government
would no longer try to deport him to his native country, Jesus
Collado, a Dominican immigrant who has lived in New York for 24
years, is facing new challenges: learning to live again without
fear and paying the bills that have accumulated during his 16-month
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived with the fear of being separated from my family
for such a long time that I don't even know what I feel anymore,''
said Collado, 45, a restaurant owner and father of three who still
cries when he remembers the months he spent detained by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in York, Pa. ``It will be a
long time before that feeling in my heart leaves me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Judge Douglas Schoppert of Immigration Court in New
York dismissed the deportation case against Collado, a legal
resident of the United States who, upon returning from a trip to
the Dominican Republic last April, was stopped by immigration
officials at Kennedy International Airport and sent to jail to
await deportation for a crime he committed 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Collado's case attracted immediate national attention because
his ordeal highlighted the effects that tougher immigration laws,
passed in 1996, could have on the lives of ordinary citizens who
committed crimes long ago. In 1974, Collado was convicted of
statutory rape, a misdemeanor, for having sex with his girlfriend,
who was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials used his case to illustrate how the law
had tied their hands by taking away the agency's discretionary
powers in certain deportation cases. Members of Congress used the
case to contend that the immigration agency was interpreting the
law too harshly and wasting resources in the process. Collado
became the subject of speeches on the Senate floor and special
bills were introduced to stop his deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for immigrants used the case to show that
anti-immigrant feelings sweeping the country were destroying the
lives of hard-working women and men like Collado.
</P>
<P>
   Schoppert did not explain his ruling. But Collado's lawyer,
Kerry Bretz, said the case was dismissed because he had been able
to show that the agency had erred in holding his client for almost
seven months and in trying to deport him for a misdemeanor that did
not warrant such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said they would not appeal the judge's
ruling. They have given Collado back his passport and his green
card. He is free to travel abroad and to re-enter the United
States, his home since he was 19.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Collado said he was relieved by the judge's decision. But, he
added, he still cannot rest easy. While he was detained, he almost
lost his restaurant in upper Manhattan. He said he owes $13,000 to
vendors, $36,000 in back rent to his landlord and about $30,000 in
medical bills; both his wife and 19-year-old daughter had serious
health problems last year. He sleeps fitfully and visits a
psychologist once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Collado was released from jail last October, but he remained
under the threat of deportation until last month when lawyers for
the INS suddenly filed a motion to dismiss his case because, they
argued, he had demonstrated he was eligible to become a U.S.
citizen _ a test of good moral character that allows immigration
officials to drop deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But Bretz, Collado's lawyer, filed his own motion arguing that
the case should be dismissed for other reasons. Bretz argued that
the immigration agency should never have tried to deport him to
begin with. Lawyers for the agency did not oppose that motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS made a mistake and the result is that Jesus' life was
turned around for a long time,'' Bretz said. ``They should have
never locked him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bretz said he planned to file a civil suit against the agency on
Collado's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an exception, overlooked until now, to the same law
that allowed the agency to detain Collado and try to deport him.
Among other things, the law, intended to rid the country of
criminal immigrants, states that any immigrant convicted of a crime
of ``moral turpitude,'' like rape, is inadmissible and therefore
deportable. But the law offers a respite for people who have
committed only one crime and have not been sentenced to more than
six months' imprisonment. Collado had been sentenced to one year of
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials maintain that they did not err in seeking
the deportation of Collado. Russell Bergeron Jr., an agency
spokesman in Washington, said that immigration inspectors at the
airport had no choice but to detain Collado once he revealed that
he had been convicted of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said that lawyers for the agency had become aware that
the exception to the law might apply to Collado only after
carefully reviewing his criminal record last month. He said the
full records of Collado's conviction had not reached the agency
until then.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said the judge's decision does not set a precedent or
change the way the immigration agency interprets the laws that have
broadened the definition of what constitutes a deportable crime and
who is subject to deportation or deemed inadmissible to the United
States. Had it not been for that exception, Bergeron insisted, the
agency would have had no recourse but to deport Collado, because
the laws have stripped immigration judges of the power to make
those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, they must apply the law equally and
retroactively, regardless of the nature of the crime or the
behavior of the immigrant since the crime was committed. Bergeron
said the agency had asked Congress to amend the language of the law
to return to the immigration courts a measure of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation of the law is a point of contention between
the agency and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to impress upon INS what the intent of the
legislation was and it clearly was not to deport people like Mr.
Collado,'' said Joseph McMonigle, communications director for Sen.
Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican who supports tougher laws
against immigrants who are criminals. ``They have prosecutorial
discretion and they should use it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bergeron said, the agency has no procedures in place to
determine when to pursue a deportation case, because, historically,
that has been the role of immigration courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a continual theme in the Collado case,'' said
Lucas Guttentag, director of the Immigrants' Rights Project of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``Immigration washes its hands and
says: `It's not my fault. It's you!' and Congress points to INS and
says, `No, it's you!' ''

NETWORKS HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, much of
America truly is ready for some football. Baseball may still be the
national pastime, but there's no doubting that the NFL is the
national passion. Or, at least the best reason to make a wager.
</P>
<P>
   The environment for the NFL in 1998 may not change much on the
field the Cowboys will lead the league in arrests, the 49ers will
win the NFC West, the Chiefs will beat the Raiders but it has
undergone a renovation in the broadcast booth.
</P>
<P>
   All four networks involved have raised the bar with their
approach after having the financial bar for TV rights set at a
mind-numbing $17.8 billion. To justify the expense, the networks
are doing whatever they can to get the viewer's to watch their ads,
umm, games.
</P>
<P>
   To wit, if one can use that word when talking about TV:
</P>
<P>
   ABC: The network of Monday Night Football has made three
fundamental changes: 1, it moved kickoff up to 5 p.m.; 2, moved
Frank Gifford out of the booth to make room for former quarterback
Boomer Esiason; and 3, anchored the studio shot for pregame and
halftime segments to ESPN's new theme restaurant in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff change was designed for East Coast viewers and
affiliates. ABC found that the Nielsens usually declined in the
last hour of a broadcast simply because some people couldn't stay
up until midnight. Affiliates also had to push their local news
back to midnight or later, costing them revenue dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This subtext indicates once again how little the networks think
about West Coast viewers, many of whom will now be stuck in freeway
gridlock between 5 and 6 p.m. Then again, it could be a good reason
to start happy hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Gifford move was long overdue. His last pertinent comment as
an analyst was about Y.A. Tittle. Esiason was a great quote as a
player, but it may take him some time to learn to talk in short
bursts. Here's hoping he's a quick study. In ABC's preseason games,
Dierdorf tried to dominate the broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford will co-host the studio show with the terminally boorish
Chris Berman, and one can start taking book on how long he lasts.
He learned he was being bumped from the booth by a reporter. He had
just come to terms with moving to the studio when he learned, again
from a reporter, that the show would originate from Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   There's no truth to reports that ABC put the studio in Baltimore
so Kathie Lee Gifford would always know where Frank was on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   CBS: Network officials are all misty-eyed about Sunday's opener,
seeing as it's CBS' return to the NFL fold after a four-year
layoff. Viewers could care less. All they want is a clean broadcast
that isn't annoying.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' decision-making regarding talent was schizophrenic. It made
some safe choices in terms of game announcers (Verne Lundquist, Don
Criqui, Randy Cross, Phil Simms) but then hired three rookie
broadcasters for the pregame show Marcus Allen, George Seifert and
Brent Jones. All three men are bright and glib, but that's no
guarantee for instant success.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nantz may have to carry them awhile, and there are those who
believe he has a hard time carrying himself. The pregame show will
be an hour long. To its credit, CBS invested heavily in game
reporters, an often neglected area. Bonnie Bernstine, Armen
Keteyian and Michele Tafoya are the big three.
</P>
<P>
   Fox: The network considered expanding its pregame show to 90
minutes but chose to stick with an hour format for now. It made
probably the best offseason move by picking up Cris Collinsworth on
waivers from NBC. Collinsworth has a sharp tongue, and he and Howie
Long should provide hours of entertainment by cutting the Homer
Simpson of the NFL, Terry Bradshaw, into shreds.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN: The cable operative has expanded its ``Sunday NFL
Countdown'' pregame show to a ridiculous two hours. Does anyone in
America need two hours of prep before a regular season games? Chris
Berman and Tom Jackson host with a cast presumably larger than that
of the film ``Ben Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN responded late to the new contract shakeout, deciding at
the last minute to add Paul Maguire to the game telecast alongside
the overrated Mike Patrick and diarrhea-mouthed Joe Theismann. Not
only will Maguire have difficultly getting a word in, but his sense
of humor may be lost on his partners.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has seven, count' em, seven NFL-themed shows during the
course of a week. If that isn't corporate boot-licking, what is?
</P>
<P>
   KCBS: With the return of football, CBS' affiliates can now jump
back into the NFL with their own Sunday pregame and postgame shows.
KCBS gets points for moving ultra aggressively. It will air a
one-hour show at 8 a.m., leading into CBS' 9 a.m. pregame show, and
an 90-minute postgame show (4-to-5:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hill, who set the tone for local NFL shows years ago, will
co-host this one for KCBS with the underrated Bret Lewis. XTRA's
Steve Hartman, Lisa Guerrero and former Charger quarterback Stan
Humphries will serve as analysts and contributors. The postgame
show will be highlight intensive.

 &HT;    Virginia has no trouble with punchless Auburn
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ If Thursday night's opener with Virginia was a
true indicator, it may be a long, long season for the Auburn
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's new conserative, run-oriented offense was ineffective
at best and overwhelemed at worst by Virginia's highly-regarded
defense. When it was over, a Jordan-Hare Stadium crowd of 78,315
fans left in disbelief after watching the No. 22 Tigers stumble and
lose to the No. 16 Cavaliers 19-0.
</P>
<P>
   Down 12-0 in the fourth quarter, a series of plays summed up
Auburn's night. The Tigers got the ball at the Virginia 42-yard
line after a fumble by Thomas Jones. After struggling all night,
the Auburn offense had a chance to redeem itself. But Auburn came
up less than a yard short on fourth down and had to give the ball
back to Virginia with 9:06 left in the game. It would prove to be
Auburn's last gasp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a less than auspicious start for Auburn quarterback Ben
Leard, the sophomore from Hartwell. Leard had a pair of fumbles and
an interception and was generally harrassed all night by the
Virginia defense, which returned nine starters from the nation's
No. 24 unit of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   With Top 10 teams LSU, Tennessee, and Florida all coming up in
the next five weeks, it was clear that the Tigers have a lot of
work to do.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia put the game away early in the fourth quarter with its
best sustained drive of the night, moving from its own 11 to the
Auburn 14-yard line. At that point Todd Braverman kicked his third
field goal of the night to make it 12-0 with 12:54 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Jones added the final points on a 3-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Up 6-0 at halftime, Virginia threatened in its first possession
of the third quarter when it drove to the Auburn 34-yard line
thanks to a 24-yard pass from Aaron Brooks to Casey Crawford. But
on second down Brooks was penalized 14 yards for intentional
grounding, which killed the drive.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia got the ball back at the Auburn 37-yard line after
a 27-yard punt by Jeremy Zills. The Cavaliers moved the ball to the
Auburn 7 where they settled for a 24-yard field goal by Braverman
with 7:55 left in the period to make it 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn dodged a huge bullet on its next possession when Leard
fumbled and Virginia recovered at the Tiger 25-yard line. But the
Tigers stiffened and Braverman missed a 39-yard field goal.

`MR. CLUTCH' STILL ALONG FOR THE RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCURDIE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's not disappearing after all.
</P>
<P>
   After some contemplative summer moments spent in the West
Virginia countryside, where he says people still call him Jerry
instead of Mr. West, the most valuable Laker for many of the past
37 years came to one inescapable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the retiring type.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jerry West determined he wasn't ready to walk away from his
job as the Lakers' executive vice president, all he needed was a
sign that the club's owner wanted him to stay. That finally came
Thursday, when West signed a four-year contract extension that is
reportedly worth $3.5 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   The contract ensures that West, largely responsible for the
Lakers' quick return to prominence in the NBA after the curtain
came down on the Showtime era, will enter the fifth decade of his
association with the team he broke in with as a player shortly
after the franchise moved to Los Angeles from Minneapolis in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference Thursday to announce his signing of
the new contract, West said the extra time afforded him this summer
by the NBA lockout helped him get away from the day-to-day grind of
his job and reflect on whether he really wanted to leave the team
that has been such an important part of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had so much advice this summer,'' he said, ``so many
people pulling and tugging on me. Sometimes, you just need to get
away and listen to your instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   West acknowledged that he had at least one other lucrative
alternative. He declined to reveal what it was beyond saying it was
``incredibly attractive to me.'' But at age 60, retirement was not
an option.
</P>
<P>
   West told ofsaid
</P>
<P>
   a long-time friend of his who retired financially secure, but
died within months of his retirement. ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``I
wonder if the same thing wouldn't happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   An admitted bundle of tension, West said he was a ``physical
wreck'' at the end of last season, and acknowledged that doctors
have warned him that he was putting his health at risk with
job-related stress. But sources close to West have indicated that
at least part of his frustrations stemmed from lingering financial
issues between he and Laker owner Jerry Buss, including some
outstanding deferred payments from his previous contract.
</P>
<P>
   Buss did not attend Thursday's press conference at the Forum but
issued a statement filled with glowing praise of West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has meant more to the Los Angeles Lakers' franchise
than Jerry West,'' he said. ``Since 1960 he has brought talent,
intelligence, class, dignity and success to this team, this city
and this organization. Keeping him here will ensure that the Lakers
will be one of the best-run franchises in sports well into the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   West expressed relief that the speculation regarding his status
with the team is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to be an issue with this team,'' he said. ``I've
never wanted to be an issue in any way, shape or form. I want to
fit in with the scenery here.''
</P>
<P>
   Laker coach Del Harris, who is about to enter the final year of
his contract, said he was not surprised by West's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always believed he would stay,'' Harris said. ``The
Lakers without Jerry would be like a hamburger without a bun.''

MINNESOTA GOVERNOR URGES CLINTON TO END PILOTS' STRIKE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs for new 2nd graf to update)  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abandoning his neutral stance in the pilots' strike against
Northwest Airlines, Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson on Thursday called
on President Clinton to order the pilots back to work, but the
White House stood firm against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest took a tougher stand, too, sending a provocative
signal toits unions by naming the head of its strike-preparation
efforts, Mickey Foret, as its new chief financial officer. Foret
was president of Continental Airlines under Frank Lorenzo, whose
battles with unions at Eastern Airlines and Continental drove both
into bankruptcy. Foret replaces James Lawrence, who Northwest said
would pursue other interests.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came on the sixth day of the pilots' strike and a day
after Northwest laid off more than half its 51,000 workers, many of
whom live in Minnesota, saying that it could not afford to keep
paying them if it was not operating.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Midwest governors have already called on the White
House to intervene. But Carlson, a Republican in the state where
Northwest has its headquarters and where there is wide sympathy for
the pilots, had been reluctant to urge such action, a course that
the pilots oppose and Northwest quietly favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was everyone's hope that the strike could be resolved
without the president taking this action,'' the governor said.
``But now as we enter the sixth full day of this strike with no end
in sight, I believe it is time for the president to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that the president appreciated the views of
Carlson and other officials but that Clinton felt that the best way
for the strike to be resolved was for the two sides to return to
the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Talks broke down on Friday, hours before the strike deadline set
by the pilots, and have not resumed since. The pilots want a 14
percent wage increase over three years to make up for pay cuts they
took to help save the airline from bankruptcy in 1993. They also
say they want increased job security. Northwest has offered 9
percent over four years, saying it could not afford more.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have agreed to meet on Saturday in Chicago with a
federal mediator to determine whether full-fledged contract
negotiations would be productive.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also said Thursday that it was suspending its
advertising campaign critical of the pilots during the Labor Day
weekend because of the meeting Saturday. The two sides have been
warring with each other in print and television advertising in
Detroit, Minneapolis and other cities. The pilots previously said
that they had stopped their advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater ordered Mesaba
Airlines and Express Airlines I, two Northwest-affiliated commuter
carriers that have stopped flying as a result of the strike, to
come up with a plan to resume service to 17 cities in 11 states by
the end of Friday. Under a federal program, Washington subsidizes
flights to the cities because airlines say it would impossible to
make money serving them.
</P>
<P>
   But both of the carriers said Thursday that complying with the
secretary's order would threaten their viability and therefore
their long-term service to the 17 cities.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what step the Transportation Department would
take next.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Railway Labor Act, the president has the power to
force the pilots back to work for 60 days while a special emergency
board tries to come up with a solution acceptable to both sides if
he believes that the strike is disrupting the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who has been leading the forces
against White House intervention, said in an interview Thursday
that the economic impact of the strike had been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a national economic impact here,'' Oberstar said.
``The two parties really have to overcome their mutual animosities
and reason together.''

CELEBRITY BIRD  
 HULLABALOO HIRSCHFELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLES STRUM and JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among celebrity watchers this week, Dr. Frank Gill and his
colleagues at the National Audubon Society rank pretty high. A
visitor unknown in these parts, the broad-billed sandpiper, has
just blown into town.
</P>
<P>
   Gill is the senior vice president and director of science for
the Audubon Society, in New York, and he is also a very happy man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there's an old adage among birders: `If you stand in
one place in the world, sooner or later every species will fly
by,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This particular sandpiper, a kind of migratory Wrong Way
Corrigan from the Arctic, appeared at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife
Refuge and quickly became the talk of the town among
ornithologists.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was probably on its way to Australia, or perhaps India,
to spend the winter but got blown off course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the hardest in the world to see,'' he said.
``It's a scarce bird with a limited distribution. Everyone who
builds a world list is eager to bump into it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has never been observed in the lower 48 states, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said the piper, a juvenile, is distinguished by its black
and white stripes. It has a wingspan of about a foot and dines on
little invertebrates, aquatic flies and small crustaceans, which it
finds in abundance in Jamaica Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting,'' Gill said, ``is that it's staying put.''
</P>
<P>
   Most birders who want to see one usually have to go to the
Aleutian Islands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what does this mean for Gill?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my next to last sandpiper,'' he said. ``I've seen all but
the spoon-billed sandpiper.'' But that's in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   A Lesson: Careful Who You Praise
</P>
<P>
   Some stockbrokers were hollering in disbelief this week when the
market plummeted, but Judy Chen of Prudential Securities was
distressed for different reasons. A complimentary letter she had
written to a client, Abe Hirschfeld, the real estate developer who
is running for New York state comptroller, had been released to
news organizations as campaign fodder. No one had told Ms. Chen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooohhhhh, nooohhhhh,'' Ms. Chen said. ``He released it? It
was my personal compliment. It does not represent Prudential's
opinions. When will this be published? Oh, no.''

   Ms. Chen's letter, released in full by Hirschfeld's press team,
complimented the candidate on his financial acuity in liquidating
his ``entire equity portfolio'' early this August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed by your judgment,'' Ms. Chen wrote. It was
accompanied by a press release from Hirschfeld's headquarters:
``Abe Predicted Market Fall: Pru Says He Sold Stock Portfolio
Before Downtown'' and a challenge from Hirschfeld to the incumbent,
H. Carl McCall: ``So Carl, what's with you _ did you sell?'' ``I
called the controller's office and a man told me they didn't know
of any stocks they sold,'' Hirschfeld said. ``I know the pension
account has about $125 billion and without any question, it's lost
20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state comptroller's office, Steven
Greenberg, angrily denied that there had been a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of March 31, the pension fund was $105 billion,'' Greenberg
said. ``Today, it's approximately $100 billion. In the five years
Carl McCall has been in office, the fund grew from $56 billion to
more than $105 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would the voters choose, to handle state funds, a fellow who
has been indicted with 123 counts of tax evasion, which is to say,
Hirschfeld, Hirschfeld was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld responded with a complex statement that seemed to
suggest a plot between the district attorney and an estranged
business partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A district attorney can indict even a ham sandwich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I was indicted last year when I ran for Manhattan
borough president. I received 28 percent of the votes.''

BIGGEST HOMER ON FOX MAY NOT BE A SIMPSON
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Baseball's broadcast history is so thick that it has its own
archives. But it's safe to say the game has never received the kind
of unprecedented coverage it will get the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and ESPN have adopted a 24/7 mentality toward the home-run
record chase being waged by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, with Fox
prepared to blow out four nights of prime-time programming and
change its NFL schedule Sunday to be present for a record.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' McGwire sits at 59 home runs in 1998, three shy
of breaking Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 set in 1961,
while the Cubs' Sammy Sosa is at 57. Virtually every game over the
next 10 days will be televised.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will cover tonight's Cardinals game against Cincinnati (5
p.m.), while cable superstation WGN will cover the Cubs-Pirates
game (4 p.m.). Saturday, Fox will air the Cardinals-Reds game at 10
a.m. if
</P>
<P>
   McGwire goes into the game with 60 home runs or more. If he's
still at 59, Los Angeles will see the Dodgers-Giants game at 1 p.m.
as originally scheduled. WGN the Cubs-Pirates at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty is the magic number,'' said Fox Sports Executive
Producer Ed Goren.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Fox will show the finale of the Cards-Reds series at 1
p.m., following its NFL coverage here of the Packers-Lions. Fox
switched its Sunday NFL schedule in some markets so it could clear
the 1 p.m. slot for McGwire's game. WGN has the Cubs-Pirates at 10
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a point now where it's no use worrying about sleep
until it's over,'' said Fox Sports Executive Producer Ed Goren.
``We put a plan in place Wednesday morning. I got on a plane and by
the time I hit the ground, we had to change the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're taking it day by day, at-bat by at-bat. This
is unprecedented. We're not an all-sports cable operation. It takes
a tremendous commitment from a network to do what we're doing. We
could not have done it, either, without the work of Major League
Baseball to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If the chase goes into next week, Fox is prepared to pre-empt
its prime-time lineup on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the major events in baseball's recent past George
Brett's flirtation with .400, Pete Rose breaking Ty Cobb's record
for career hits or even Cal Ripken breaking Lou Gehrig's
consecutive games were momentous enough to make a network give up
prime-time hours.
</P>
<P>
   There is an ancillary storyline here which orbits the perpetual
Fox-Disney scuffle. ESPN, owned by Disney, would have been in
position to pick up a bigger share of the McGwire-Sosa programming
if it hadn't angered Major League Baseball over three Sunday night
telecasts in September.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN tried to shift three national Sunday night broadcasts, on
Sept. 6, 13 and 20, to ESPN2 after it landed the entire NFL Sunday
night package. The network said it could do so under a provision of
its contract which said events of ``national significance'' take
precedence.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball felt NFL regular season games did not meet that
qualifier, so it took back those three Sunday games and released
them to the teams involved. One of those three games would have
been Sunday's Cards-Reds game, which truly may be of ``national
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   The rift went even deeper Wednesday when ESPN chose not to cut
into their baseball coverage for live updates of McGwire's 58th and
59th home runs. ESPN issued only a statement about that decision:
``We are being as aggressive as we can within baseball's
parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Goren was amused. ``They didn't show his home runs Wednesday,
but they sure were calling baseball to get Friday's game,'' he
said. ``If they're tired of the home-run race, we'll be glad to
take the games off their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Disney (Angels) and Fox (Dodgers) also own major
league teams just adds to the untidy little melodrama.
