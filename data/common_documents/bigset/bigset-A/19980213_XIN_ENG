<HEADLINE> HK Official on Arrangement of Legislature Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Secretary for
Constitutional Affairs Robin Ip Thursday revealed the specific
arrangement of the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) for the May Legislative Council
elections.
</P>
<P>
The 60 members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong SAR will be made up of 20 to be returned from the
geographical constituencies through direct election, 30 by
functional constituencies and 10 by an 800-strong Election
Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to IP, Hong Kong will be divided into five
geographical constituencies -- Hong Kong Island, Kowloon East,
Kowloon West, "New Territories" East and "New Territories" West
each with 3 to 5 seats in proportion to the number of residents.
</P>
<P>
The list voting system will be adopted during the geographical
constituencies election, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ip explained that the list voting system is a form of
proportional representation voting system, which is open, widely
accepted as fair and is used in many countries and will more
accurately reflect voter preference in the election results.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 28 functional constituencies, he said,
with 27 functional constituencies producing one seat each and the
labor functional constituency producing three seats.
</P>
<P>
The 800 members of the Election Committee will come equally
from four sectors: industry, commerce and finance; the
professionals; labor, social services and religious; and members
of the Provisional legislative Council, Hong Kong deputies to the
National People's Congress, representatives of Hong Kong members
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and representatives of district-based
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The election of the Election Committee members will be held on
April 2, and then they will elect 10 to the Legislative Council on
 May 24.
</P>
<P>
Ip said that the objective of the above arrangement is "to
produce a credible and representative legislature".
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the candidates for Election Committee
subsector elections will be nominated from March 13 to 20 while
the candidates for the Legislative Council election will be
nominated from April 9 to 24.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Partners Decide to Defeat Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ruling partners of Nepali
Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa Thursday decided to defeat the
no-confidence motion tabled against him, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary party of the Nepali Congress (NC) unanimously
passed a resolution from the party's Central Working Committee
calling for unitedly defeating the censure motion moved on
February 6 by the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and a breakaway faction of the ruling
National Democratic Party (RPP).
</P>
<P>
The RPP led by Prime Minister Thapa and the Nepal Sadbhavana
Party (NSP) both have issued whips demanding their MPs to vote
against the motion.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML earlier issued a whip directing all its 89 MPs to
vote for the censure motion.
</P>
<P>
As set by Speaker Ram Chandra Poudyal, the Lower House will
discuss the motion next Tuesday and vote on it Friday.
</P>
<P>
A simple majority of 103 votes is required to pass the motion
in the 205-seat Lower House.
</P>
<P>
It is still hard to predict the outcome. But as days go by,
horse trading is gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government comprising the NC, the RPP and
the NSP came to power last October. There have been three
coalition governments in Nepal since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says Unable to Confirm Report on Russian-Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Thursday that he could not confirm whether
Russia had negotiated to sell Iraq highly-sensitive dual-use
technology that could be used to produce biological weapons, but
he said it would be up to the United Nations to investigate the
allegation made by the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post published a report on Thursday that a U.N.
inspection team had seized a confidential document back in the
fall that signaled a contract between Russia and Iraq in 1995 for
Russia to sell that weapons equipment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with NBS, Cohen said: "I don't have any basis
to either confirm or contradict that particular story."
</P>
<P>
But he also told ABC in another interview that the United
Nations should make an investigation to find whether there is any
evidence for that allegation.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any means of verifying that. That's something
that the U.N. will have to determine, and hopefully the Russian
authorities will be very forthcoming on this issue," he told ABC.
</P>
<P>
Russia dismissed on Thursday the Washington Post's report as
crude inventions.
</P>
<P>
"We decisively deny these crude inventions," Russia's Foreign
Ministry said. "Russia has never made any deals with Iraq that
would violate international sanctions, moreover deals involving
supplies of banned technologies."

The increase, to a seasonally adjusted 214.8 billion U.S.
dollars, followed a moderate 0.3 percent gain in December and a
tiny 0.1 percent advance in November.

In January, discounts drew shoppers back to department stores,
where sales rose 1.6 percent, the biggest gain in last 13 months.
Clothing shops posted a 0.7 percent increase, the best in five
months. But auto sales dropped 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile auto category, sales rose 0.5 percent in
January after declining 0.1 percent in both December and November.

and hardware stores, up 1 percent; furniture stores, up 0.3
percent; restaurants and bars, up 0.9 percent; and drug stores, up

<HEADLINE> Senior ECA Official Calls for Promotion of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
U.N.Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) said today that ECA has
been fully aware of the importance of the informal sector in
providing the majority of the population with employment and
income, as well as goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with the theme of ''Promotion of
the Informal Sector for Development in Africa'' held at Africa
Hall here, Lalla Ben Barka, Deputy Executive Secretary of the
ECA, noted that in the last few years quite a number of African
governments have made serious efforts to review policies and to
reformulate strategies in favour of the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
Barka said: ''Promotion of the informal sector for development
in Africa'' is one of two pilot projects ECA has embarked upon as
practical demonstrations of the human-centered approaches to
development.
</P>
<P>
She said that promotion of the informal sector for development
in Africa has been implemented in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire in the
project's first phase in 1992 to 1993, and in Ethiopia and Zambia
in its second phase from 1996 to April 1998.
</P>
<P>
She said that ECA, together with the International Labour
Organization, has been the lead agencies for the United Nations
Inter-agency Task Force on Poverty Reduction in Africa through
the promotion of the informal sector and employment generating
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her belief that the present gathering between
the diverse expertise coming from different countries and
institutions will result in high-level decisions regarding
follow-up action plans and cooperation agreements in favour of
the micro and small enterprise sector on Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy ECA official, the informal sector
consists mainly of micro and small scale enterprises -- most of
them are self-employed individuals who operate from a
semi-permanent location or site, usually with small
capitalization and without legislated standards of quality.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey of the informal sector operators conducted by
the Central Statistics Authority of Ethiopia in 48 towns in May
1997 shows that there are 584,913 informal sector operators
engaging about 731,000 labour force, eight times larger than
those engaged in the medium and large scale establishments.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
arrived Thursday afternoon in Luxembourg, the first leg of his
week-long three-nation European tour.
</P>
<P>
Li was on a two-day official good-will visit at the invitation
of Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who gave the
Chinese guest a red-carpet welcome at the airport.
</P>
<P>
In his host's company, the Chinese premier reviewed the guards

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economic Consultative Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government and
the private sector went into consultations on Thursday to find
cures for the ailing economy in the second meeting of the
National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF).
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the executive core group of the NECF, also
attended by President Robert Mugabe, was a follow-up to one last
month which focused on the country's pricing system and how it
could be improved to achieve socio-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists at the end of the three-and-half hour
meeting, Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said
the government would seriously consider the views and comments of
the private sector on improving the macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
"The government feels that the macro-economic environment must
be strengthened and that measures are being taken to strengthen
the Zimbabwean Dollar including strengthening of the export
drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries
felt very strongly about the need to increase export incentives.
"That will help a lot of industries to keep going," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The government had also been sensitized on the need to reduce
the budget deficit currently standing at 10 percent of gross
domestic product and to privatize loss making parastatals.
</P>
<P>
The previous meeting noted the need to look at the "price of
money" and what could be done to curb the high price increases.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which was last month rocked by violent riots against
sharp price hikes of basic commodities, is struggling to tackle
the problem of interest rates pegged at around 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates are not expected to fall in the short term
because of serious inflationary pressure emanating escalating
prices of basic commodities, a fast depreciating currency and an
expected fuel price hike.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM: Sensitive Sites Off-limits to Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said here Thursday that Iraq will not put
its ministries and other sensitive sites under international
inspection.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the Arab League here, the Iraqi
minister tried to clarify the eight presidential sites Baghdad has
promised to open to a new international arms inspection team.
</P>
<P>
"By eight presidential sites, we mean eight compounds, but not
villas and palaces. Because if you count these villas and palaces
in the compounds, their number can be more than 60," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that these would exclude such sensitive sites
as ministries and Republican Guard headquarters which the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction (UNSCOM) wants to see.
</P>
<P>
"They are part of our sovereignty," he said, adding that these
sites were not included in the former agreements between the
UNSCOM and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with AL Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid earlier in the day, al-Sahhaf told reporters that Iraq
has been "very objective and practical" since the very beginning
of the "fabricated crisis."
</P>
<P>
The standoff between Iraq and the United States was triggered
off by Iraqi former refusal of full access to U.N. arms inspectors
the presidential sites suspected of hiding weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said Iraq has supported the Russian initiative that
calls for the formation of a special team to carry out the
inspection mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the team will be a "large one," composed of an equal
number of experts from the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council as well as an equal number of experts from
the UNSCOM's 21 member countries.
</P>
<P>
They will inspect all the sites "without any condition" and
with the technical ways and means of verification to verify the
U.S. accusations that Iraq is hiding some prohibited weapons of
mass destruction on those sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
After 60 days, the team should submit a report to the Security
Council and the U.N secretary general, Sahhaf added.
</P>
<P>
"After they prove we are clean, this file should be closed once
and forever. This is the major step and there is nothing else
behind it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care whether this is enough for the Americans or not,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi top diplomat Wednesday met with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
He is on a regional tour to drum up support for averting an
imminent U.S. military strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's premier tourism
showcase, Travel Expo'98, opened here Thursday with an investment
conference to discuss appropriate policy and institutional
framework for the development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference agreed that tourism was one of
the fastest growing sectors in the world which could be used to
create employment and wealth for local communities.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, the industry's performance in the past 10 years
has been commendable, generating 80 million U.S. Dollars in 1995,
140 million U.S. Dollars in 1996 and 200 million U.S. Dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product grew from
2.6 percent in 1990 to 4.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Opening the one-day conference, Minsiter for Mines,
Environment and Tourism Simon Moyo said in view of this growth,
it was imperative to increase the level of investment into the
industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the government considered the development of tourism
as a priority and integral part of its overall economic
development strategy.
</P>
<P>
"Statistics indicate that this sector is fast becoming a
strategic growth sector in the economy with vast potential for
the creation of wealth so as to improve the quality of life of
our people and provide a solid foundation for peace and
prosperity," Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he added, was studying proposals on investment
incentives for tourism prepared jointly by the country's tourism
promotion bodies, the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority and the Zimbabwe
Council for Tourism with the Zimbabwe Investment Center.
</P>
<P>
He said that plans to establish a revolving tourism fund to
help new entrants with start up capital were at an advanced
stage.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Mandated for Maritime Transport Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
decided to approve two negotiating mandates authorizing its
executive body, the European Commission, to open talks for
agreements on maritime transport between the EU and China and
India respectively.
</P>
<P>
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock Thursday welcomed
the decision taken by the European Council of Ministers, noting
that China is one of the fastest growing markets in the world
while India offers substantial trading potentials.
</P>
<P>
"Effective maritime transport links to and from these countries
are indispensable for developing our trade relations and EU
shipowners have played an essential part in developing them," the
Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said that agreements in this regard should put
the shipping activities of some of the world's biggest companies
in China, India and the EU on a sound footing.
</P>
<P>
It added they should create a regulatory framework which was
clear, unequivocal and balanced, allowing the economies of the
countries concerned to draw full benefit from the shipping
industry's expertise.
</P>
<P>
The mandate will tackle issues such as the freedom to provide
international maritime transport services, free and
non-discriminatory use of ancillary services, consignors' freedom
of choice with regard to conditions of carriage and treatment of
vessels and trans-shipment in ports.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements should furthermore create a level playing field
for all operators on the parties' territories," the Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it also noted that whereas Chinese and Indian shipping
companies enjoyed a maximum of commercial freedom in the EU,
shipping companies from the EU still encountered a number of
problems in China and India.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the EU member states have given the
Commission a mandate to negotiate on their behalf maritime
agreements with third countries.

MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Estonian Foreign Minister
Toomas Ilves on Thursday identified joining the European Union
(EU) as one of the country's foreign policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, said an Interfax news agency report reaching here
from the Estonian capital of Tallinn, Ilves vowed to "pursue a
security policy in the context of rapprochement with NATO."
</P>
<P>
In his statement made to a parliament hearing, the foreign
minister emphasized that the government will make efforts this
year to acquire a full-fledged NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Every practical step to strengthen Estonia's defense force
should be taken to lead the country into the Western military
alliance, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Russia, Ilves said they were undoubtedly
better than the same period of last year, adding that "Estonia
should treat Russia as a normal friendly Western nation."
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed regret that relations between the two
countries still lack a sufficient legal foundation.
</P>
<P>
There is no agreement between the two countries on the
protection of investments, on the prevention of dual taxation and
about most favored nation trade status, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has no political will to sign a treaty on its border
with Estonia, the minister said.

<P>
Women outnumber men in this field in over half the European
countries. Bulgaria, Iceland and Portugal boast the highest ratio.
</P>
<P>
However, in Germany there are still only 77 women to every 100
men, with 89 in the Netherlands and 92 in Austria.
</P>
<P>
Across the EU, 110 women for every 100 men have higher
education qualifications. The female ratio is higher everywhere
except in Germany and Ireland. Portugal is top with 170.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for every 100 boys EU-wide, a total of 124 girls
obtain a general upper secondary education qualification. Data
available show that the ratio is higher in all member states,
rising to around 141 in Finland and Denmark and as much as 185 in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
However, "the increasing opportunities for women to remain in
education and the growing numbers of women taking upper secondary
and higher education qualifications have not completely eroded the
differences between men and women in relation to employment," says
the report.
</P>
<P>
Even among those with higher education, the unemployment rate
is seven percent for EU women compared with five percent for men.
Such differences are particularly marked in Spain, Italy and
Greece.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Vows Not to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone said today it would not surrender to the Nigerian-led west
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG despite intense
military pressure.
</P>
<P>
"AFRC can not surrender our sovereignty to Nigeria... and
we'll take upon fire as long as we continue to live," a junta
spokesman said, quoted by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) was set up by
the junta as the country's the highest governing body immediately
after the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is in Sierra Leone mandated by west African countries
and the United Nations to restore the legitimate government
headed by president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah ousted in the coup.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting broke out last Thursday between ECOMOG and the
AFRC forces, with ECOMOG pushing near the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Planes of ECOMOG were said to flew over Freetown several hours
ago, leaving buildings near the AFRC military headquarters caught
on fire and main hospitals overwhelmed with the dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said the junta would not make any
concession.
</P>
<P>
"We have no concession to make. We'll never negotiate the
sovereignty of our country. We'll never mortgage the loyalty of
the country to anybody," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"So it is really ironic to talk about concession," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the center of the city was now quiet
despite rumors that ECOMOG has been penetrating into it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations has called for cessation of
hostilities, citing the growing number of refugees fleeing the
country into neighboring Guinea and the rising number of civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Guinea has become home to some 250,000 Sierra Leonean
refugees, most of whom fled after the first coup in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees,. some
80,000 of them fled after the coup last May, including more than
1,000 who arrived over the past week.

<HEADLINE> UK Says Iraq Offer "not Good Enough" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Thursday dismissed an offer by Iraq for settling the dispute
over weapon inspection as "just not good enough" and "absolutely
hopeless", but adding Britain will continue its diplomatic
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Blair was quoted by his spokesman as telling a 40-minute
cabinet meeting that the offer by Iraq to allow United Nations
(UN) weapons inspectors one visit to presidential sites was
"absolutely hopeless".
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members were told that in the past the UN had to make
several visits to Iraqi sites as one "presidential site" is
described as the size of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blair said that Britain is "working flat out" to
find a diplomatic solution to the crisis and that Britain
appreciated diplomatic efforts by Russia and France, saying "we
are all working in the same direction".
</P>
<P>
But the possible timing of a military strike was not discussed
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iraq has offered to open eight suspected
weapons sites to inspection for 60 days on condition that the UN
Secretary-General and Security Council took direct control of the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, British Defense Secretary George Robertson
told British television that diplomacy backed with the threat of
force was starting to work with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"He's making moves now. Diplomacy is starting to work but its
only working because there is a credible threat of force as a last
resort option," said Robertson.
</P>
<P>
He added "I want diplomacy to succeed. I want him to comply. I
do not want to see military action".

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US of Attempting to Heighten Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
Speaker Saadoun Hammadi Thursday accused the U.S. Administration
of being reluctant to find a diplomatic solution to the current
crisis over arms inspection and attempting to heighten it.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Iraqi news agency INA, Hammadi said the
United States intends to place Iraq under its hegemony and to
prove to the world that its will alone would prevail.
</P>
<P>
"Should the United States seek the truth, it would have
welcomed Iraq's initiative, which puts forward a solution to the
crisis and addresses the core issue in question, namely,
inspection of presidential sites where Iraq is allegedly suspected
to have hidden proscribed weapons," the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf announced in
Cairo, Egypt, on Wednesday that Iraq has agreed to open eight
presidential sites to international arms inspectors appointed by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi stressed that the American administration has been
fomenting troubles whenever Iraq is one step closer to the
lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The world public opinion has realized that the United States'
rejection of the Iraqi initiative means ill-intention on the part
of the United States which pushes for confrontation and war rather
than peaceful solution, said Hammadi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hammadi dismissed as untrue the U.S. administration
allegations of banned weapons being concealed at presidential
sites, adding that such charges were intended to serve as a
pretext to justify a military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"When Iraq says that there is no prohibited weapons activity
in Iraq, then it is the truth," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Criticizes Israel's Lack of Sincerity in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Thursday criticized
Israel for its lack of sincerity and actions in reviving the
long-stalled peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been in deadlock due to the evasion of
commitment of the Israeli government to the peace agreements,
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali told Etan Ben Tsour,
director-general of Israeli Foreign Ministry, during their meeting.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of offering "only talk about peace," not
actions, and called on the Jewish state to show sincerity in
promoting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has to adopt positive and authentic stands in
negotiations with the Palestinians," Majali told Tsour.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official arrived here Wednesday to review with the
Jordanian side the development of situations in the region,
particularly the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Majali urged Israel to carry out the signed agreements,
particularly those regarding Israel's troop pullback in the West
Bank, in a bid to start the final status talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
last March when Israel started the construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as
the capital of their future independent state.

find a political solution to the current Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
Local evening daily Etelaat reported Thursday that Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made a telephone call to Annan

resolved only through political ways.
</P>
<P>
"Your visit to Baghdad will have important effects" on the

<P>
MAPUTO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano was requested to mediate between the Comoros government
and the Anjouan secessionists when he met Abdou Bakari Boina, a
special envoy of the Comoros president, here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the 50-minute meeting, the Comoros special envoy
briefed President Chissano on the situation in Comoros, from
which the Island of Anjouan declared its independence in August
last year, the Mozambique Information Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Boina said the Comoros government wants President Chissano to
play a role of mediator in the crisis as he is one of the African
leaders who have been paying close attentions to the situation in
Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Frabcisco Madeira, a senior official with the Mozambican
President Office who was present at the meeting, said that
Mozambique is working together with the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to find a political solution to the Comoros conflict.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, Abdallah Ibrahim, leader of the Anjouan
secessionists who are fed up with President Mohamed Taki's
government and poverty, declared independence and set up a new
"government" in Anjouan.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Turkish Proposal to Settle Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece rejected on Thursday a
Turkish proposal to hold a high-level meeting by the end of March
this year in order to resolve the disputes between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that his country could not accept the
proposal by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem because it
included issues which were already being dealt with and reiterated
the standing Turkish stance for dialogue on all issues.
</P>
<P>
Cem reportedly presented a verbal note to the Greek ambassador
in Ankara to made the five-point proposal, which includes a
high-level meeting to define problem areas in the Aegean Sea,
formalize principles of good-neighborly relations and promote
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
As for the Turkish proposal that committees of experts of the
two countries should meet on a bilateral basis to continue the
procedure, Reppas said that this was a European Union (EU)
Initiative and could only continue as such.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU initiative, Greece and Turkey set up committees of
experts last May to review the procedural matters of eventually
resolving their differences including the airspace limits,
territorial waters in the Aegean as well as the thorny Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stressed that Athens still respected the Madrid
Communique signed last July by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, which he described as a
political declaration than a treaty setting out basic principles
governing Greek-Turkish ties.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the statements by Turkey's former naval chief
that former Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Foreign
Minister Deniz Baykal were in favor of a military confrontation
with Greece during the 1996 Imia crisis, the spokesman said that
this confirmed that Ankara did not always follow the "peaceful
path."

<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) - Rolls-Royce and Bilkent Holding
of Turkey have formed a joint venture to build an RB211-powered
36MW cogeneration facility at Bilkent University in Ankara,

LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) - The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) has established a healthy working relationship with
the Government in which disagreement is expressed as openly as
consensus, the President of the CBI Colin Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at CBI London's Annual Lunch Colin said: "The CBI is
encouraged by the development of a real working partnership
between the Government and our business community."
</P>
<P>
"Naturally we do not see eye to eye all the time on every issue
but we have come to a mutual understanding that those who govern
and those who create wealth should work together as constructively
as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Colin said, however, there was an ongoing debate with the
Government focusing primarily on four key areas: the Budget,
Welfare to Work, Minimum Wage and union recognition.
</P>
<P>
Turning to EMU, Colin said that the CBI's view that the UK
should adopt the single currency when the time is right in terms
of convergence criteria was shared by the Government and a wide
body of opinion.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We might not be in EMU come January 1st next year but
the single currency will be in play and our trading and finance
systems need to be able to deal with it."

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Continue Anti-US Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians continued their
anti-U.S. and pro-Iraq demonstrations on Thursday in the West
Bank cities in defiance of orders banning such protests issued by
the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus and Hebron, a large number of Palestinians took to
the streets to protest against the U.S.-led military buildup in
the Gulf and the possible U.S.-led military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also voiced their strong support to the
Iraqi government and people in their struggle against the United
States and burned U.S. and Israeli flags to express their anger
towards the Americans.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, the demonstration was organized by the students of
Al-Hussein Ben Ali high school. When the pro-Iraq march reached
the center of the city, the protesters clashed with the Israeli
soldiers who are there guarding the Israeli Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The protesters threw stones and molotov cocktails at the
soldiers who returned fire with rubber bullets and tear gas. No
casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
In both Nablus and Hebron, the Palestinian security forces and
police tried to prevent the demonstrations from taking place, but
failed.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the Iraqi crisis and U.S. military
buildup in the Gulf, the Palestinians held a series of
demonstrations in different parts of the Palestinian territories
against the U.S. policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Such protests resulted in clashes with the Israeli soldiers and
security forces. In addition, the protesters burned Israeli and
U.S. flags and called on Iraq to fire Scud missiles at Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Israel believe such demonstrations
could affect the U.S. policy and worsen the situation, urging the
Palestinian leaders to stop them.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Tuesday also sharply
criticized such demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out the dangerous consequences these protests could
produce to the security if they were out of control, Mordechai
said it is a serious mistake on the part of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and the Palestinians to adopt such a
supportive stance towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, orders were issued by Palestinian police
commander General Ghazi Jabil on Tuesday banning pro-Iraq
activities.
</P>
<P>
But Thursday's demonstrations in Nablus and Hebron indicated
that such orders can not ban the Palestinian people from
expressing their feelings, which were badly hurt by stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Feelings of anger and frustrations are on a rise among the
Palestinians nowadays due to the impasse of the peace talks with
Israel which have been stalled since last March when Israel began
construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> UN Study Finds Landmine Crisis Can be Overcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The undeclared war to
rid the world of landmines can be won, according to a new study
of United Nations mine action programs in Afghanistan, Angola,
Cambodia and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The study released here today finds the challenge of global
demining can be met within years, not decades as previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
The study says in the most severe situations, adequate
resources can make a difference. "The experience of Afghanistan
shows this clearly: it is anticipated all high-priority minefields
in that country will be cleared within the next two years," said
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which
initiated the study.
</P>
<P>
The Study also reveals that much had been learned since the
United Nations began its first humanitarian mine action program
in Afghanistan where the United Nations has proven that it can
establish truly indigenous programs.
</P>
<P>
The study points out there are some 3, 000 full-time deminers
employed by the United Nations-sponsored Afghan non-governmental
organizations. "With well-coordinated external assistance, such
program can become progressively more sustainable," say the
study.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the need to place the safety and well-being
of people at the center of any mine action program.

LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said on Thursday the ceasefire declared by its Irish Republican
Army (IRA) last July was still held in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"It is my view that the IRA cessation is intact," local reports
quoted Adams as saying at a press conference in Belfast, the
capital of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He also said the peace process would fail if Sinn Fein, the
political wing of IRA, was ordered to leave the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
"There are no grounds for the expulsion of our party," he said.
"Sinn Fein does not represent, we are not accountable for, and we
do not speak for any armed group."
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party, the chief party representing the
province's 60 percent Protestant majority, urged the British and
Irish governments to ban Sinn Fein from talks after recent
loyalist killings.
</P>
<P>
Under the talks rules, any political party linked to guerrillas
who do not eschew violence can be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
Adams denied that Sinn Fein was involved in the recent killings
and said it must not be thrown out of talks that Britain and
Ireland say offer the best prospects for generations of easing
strife between pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' New President to Be Announced Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The runoff results for new
president of Cyprus are expected to be announced Sunday night,
Chief Returning Officer Thanos Michael said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the runoff will commence at
7:00 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and end at 17:00 p.m. local time
(1500 GMT), with 60-minute break at midday.
</P>
<P>
The runoff will take place following last Sunday's first round
of elections during which seven candidates contested for the
eighth president of the Cyprus Republic since its independence in
1960.
</P>
<P>
Two front-runners, George Iacovou, former foreign minister, and
incumbent President Glafcos Clerides, had a marginal difference.
</P>
<P>
Iacovou, backed by left wing Progress Party of the Working
People (AKEL) and the center-right Democratic Party, got 40.61
percent of the vote, while Clerides, supported by the ruling
Democratic Rally, won 40.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that last Sunday's elections ran smoothly,
Michael expressed the hope that there would be no problems in the
second round either.
</P>
<P>
Michael said posters informing voters of the correct way to
vote will be put up at the polling stations to keep the number of
invalid votes to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
The final results are expected to come out at around 23:00
p.m. local time (2100 GMT) and that the new president will be
proclaimed at the indoor stadium "Eleftheria" (Freedom) in
Nicosia around midnight, according to Michael.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of Police Panikos Hadjiloizou also announced
Thursday that 3,380 members of the police force will be on duty
on Sunday throughout the government-controlled southern part of
the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> UK Jobless Total Falls to Lowest Level Since 1980 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) - The number of people out of work
in Britain fell by 12300 in January to 1.399 million, the lowest
level for 18 years, according to the latest figures released by
the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
However, the percentage of the workforce claiming benefits
because of unemployment was unchanged at 5%, with a decline of
416000 in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The claimant count is at its lowest since July 1980, and there
are 1.58 million fewer people claiming benefits than in December
1992, the last peak in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the proximity to the holiday period may have
affected January's claimant count, because of administrative
backlogs over Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The news coincided with the Government's launch of an 8 million
pounds (10.8 million US dollars) advertising campaign to promote
its Welfare to Work program for young people.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which will run for more than three weeks, comes
as the jobless figures show there are only 118000 young people
eligible for the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Government set a target last year of finding work for
250000 young people.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks $415.6 Million for Humanitarian Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
today launched the consolidated inter-agency appeal for the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, requesting 415.6 million
U.S. dollars for urgently required humanitarian assistance to
avert famine and carry out other life-saving measures.
</P>
<P>
While generous and timely contributions from the international
community during 1997 averted famine, the humanitarian situation
in the country still remains precarious, said the Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Drought and typhoons have exacerbated the earlier damage to the
infrastructure of the country, and the food aid requirements of
vulnerable groups have risen to an unprecedented level.
</P>
<P>
A crop and food assessment mission undertaken by the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the fall of 1997 estimated that
the unmet food requirement for 1998 would be over 1 million tons.
Bilateral food shipments are expected to cover slightly over one
third of the needs, leaving the balance to be met by the World
Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
The appeal aims to prevent the current situation form
developing into famine and to assist in creating the conditions
favorable to sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The food aid to be provided is targeted to meet the needs of
7,470,000 people, including 5,520,000 children, and will be
complemented by support in health services to prevent widespread
malnutrition among children.
</P>
<P>
Donors are requested to contribute generously to the appeal in
order to alleviate the suffering of the people of the country.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Renews Warning Against Collapse of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- In a stern warning to
Israel, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat said Thursday that Palestinians are ready to renew the
intifada (uprising) if the peace process collapses.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the ceremony held in Ramallah, West Bank, to
mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat
renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence
in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence
of a final peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said "the Palestinian people do not
remember the painful experience to cry, but to renew our
commitment to our national goal - the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital." He
said that those who oppose the Palestinian move to achieve
independence "can drink from the Gaza Sea or Dead Sea."
</P>
<P>
Afrafat stressed that he was ready to die in order to put East
Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, in the Palestinian
hands.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is hoping to establish an independent state with
East Jerusalem as its capital, a move opposed by Israel which has
declared the whole Jerusalem as its eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing the suffering of the Palestinians in the past,
Arafat paid tributes to the bravery of his people who have
carried on the longest revolution of this century. He added that
the Palestinians will continue to stay on their land and nothing,
even nuclear, biological and other weapons, will force them to
leave.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's warning came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process is deeply deadlocked over Israel's prolonged delay
in carrying out further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed in
January, 1997, Israel should have finished the first two
stages of the three-phased redeployment by September last
year. But Israel has delayed the move due to the dispute over the
scope of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In order to break the stalemate, the United States is
currently hosting Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in
Washington to bridge the gap. But no breakthrough has been
achieved so far, as the Palestinian side has turned down a
U.S. proposal on a 13 percent withdrawal in the second
redeployment, which is to be implemented in two phases according
to the PNA's fulfillment of its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ceremony kicked off a series of events in the
coming year to mark the so-called "Catastrophe" -- the forced
mass exudos of Palestinians in 1948. Over 3 million Palestinians
have been forced to exile since Israel won the 1948
independence war and occupied a large part of the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Among the activities is a proposed international conference of
all countries which have suffered similar disaster to discuss the
Palestinian catastrophe. A committee in charge of the
commemorative activities will also establish a museum to document
modern Palestinian history, the Jerusalem-based Palestinian news
service Jerusalem Media and Communication Center reported.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Try Coup Plotters Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The trial of coup plotters the
Nigerian government brought into light last December will begin
this Saturday, the military announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six persons, including civilians and women, will face a
special military tribunal in Jos, capital of central Nigeria's
Plateau state.
</P>
<P>
Atop the list of the 26 suspects are the country's former
number two figure, Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Oladipo Diya,
former Communications Minister Maj.-Gen. Tajudeen Olanrewaju and
former Works and Housing Minister Maj.-Gen. Abdulkarim Adisa.
</P>
<P>
The coup plotters were screened out by a special investigation
board in nearly one month's probe. At least 60 people were
invited by the panel during the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The trial will last about one month," Rear Admiral Festus
Porbeni, Chief of Administration of the Defense Headquarters,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that all those to face trial would be allowed
access to military lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member tribunal, set up in accordance with a law
promulgated in 1990, is led by Maj.-Gen. Sammuel Victor Malu, the
former commander of the west African peace keeping force known as
ECOMOG operating in Liberia and lately Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The military government announced on December 21 last year the
uncovery of the coup plot and 12 people, including Diya,
Olanrewaju and Adisa, have since been held.
</P>
<P>
Ehe Foreign Ministry has also indicated foreign involvement in
the plot to violently overthrow the government.

<HEADLINE> US Not to Use Nuclear Weapons in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has not plan
to use nuclear weapons against Iraq, whatever U.S. media report,
visiting U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen announced in
Moscow on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
Cohen who arrived here Wednesday said that no U.N. authorization
is needed to use force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he argued if Baghdad uses chemical weapons against
U.S. troops, the response will be fast and resolute.
</P>
<P>
Cohen noted that Both Russia and the U.S. want Iraq to comply
with all U.N. resolutions, though they disagree over approaches to
the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said, for his part, that using nuclear or other
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is unthinkable and would have
a negative impact on military relations between Moscow and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
He expressed doubt that the extremely tough U.S. position
contributes to stability and security in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev meanwhile flatly denied the allegation of Washington
Post that Russia in 1995 had supplied Iraq with dual purpose
equipment which could be used in the manufacture of biological
weapons. The Scud missile that Iraq has could not be used to
deliver weapons of mass destruction because they do not carry
multiple warheads, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the more than two-and-a-half-hours meeting Sergeyev and
Cohen also focused on nuclear disarmament, anti-missile defense,
European security, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
operation of the Russia-NATO council.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Russian Defense Council secretary Andrei
Kokoshin and the visiting American defense secretary held talks on
the development of bilateral relations in defense and security
areas, according to another report.

UNITED NATIONS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General

Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A plane carring several high government officials of Sudan

Supreme Council for Peace Moussa Sayed Ahmed and former
Independent Group rebel leader Arok Thon Arok.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Construction Tenders for Settlement Expected in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem Mayor of Israel
Ehud Olmert Thursday expressed his hope that the government will
publish the tenders for the construction of the controversial Har
Homa settlement in East Jerusalem within days.
</P>
<P>
Olmert told a press conference here that the infrastructure of
the first phase at Har Homa has been completed and that there
should be no delay of publishing the tenders for the construction
of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
"The bills for marketing all the plots for contractors to
start in building houses are ready. I expect the government to
issue these bills within days," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if this could not be done in a reasonable time
framework, he would launch a political campaign against the
government.
</P>
<P>
But Olmert, who has repeatedly accused the government of not
giving enough fund for settlement building, did not set the
deadline for the issue of the tenders.
</P>
<P>
Olmert's comments followed contrary remarks made by Israeli
Interior Minister Eli Suissa.
</P>
<P>
Suissa said Wednesday that if a halt to construction at Har Homa
can help revive the peace process, then building should be delayed
for several months.
</P>
<P>
A senior source closely involved in the Har Homa project has
said a final decision to go ahead with the tenders is expected to
be made at a cabinet meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel broke ground for a Jewish settlement at Har Homa
last March, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been
stalled.

BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- With less than a year to go

the Euro, a majority of Germans still do not want to give up their
mighty German mark for the untested common currency, German press
reports said Thursday.

The German news agency DPA today quoted a public opinion survey

percent who are in favor.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 27 percent of Germans wants a delay
in the planned Euro launch on January 1, 1999. Only 24 percent
believe that the Euro would become a hard and stable currency like
the German mark.

<HEADLINE> WHO Disagrees with EU on Fish Fillets Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) has said that it is improper for the European
Union to impose an embargo on the imports of fish fillets from
African countries in the Lake Victoria region.
</P>
<P>
A WHO statement circulated to reporters in Dar es Salaam
Thursday indicated that the EU may have overstrained its nerves
by imposing the ban.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the spread of cholera, the EU countries last
December imposed an embargo of imports of fresh fish fillets from
Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and other countries close to Lake
Victoria, the world's second largest fresh-water lake.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the ban means that the country will be unable to
export 6,000 tons of fresh fish fillets to European nations,
incurring a loss of nearly seven million U.S. Dollars a year,
Zakia Meghji, Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, said
early this month.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has appealed to the EU to lift the ban, but is
still waiting for a reply.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Geneva-based WHO has expressed a
different stand with the EU and voiced support for the African
countries.
</P>
<P>
WHO said its director-general wishes to draw attention to the
fact, although there is theoretical risk of cholera transmission
associated with some food commodities moving in international
trade, this has rarely proved significant, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The food that causes the greatest concern to importing
countries are seafood, fresh-water fish and vegetables that may
be consumed raw. Cases of cholera have occurred occasionally as
a result of eating food, usually seafood, transported across
international borders by individuals, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the director-general wishes to recall that
the WHO has not documented any outbreak of cholera resulting from
commercially imported food, despite the fact that more than 50
countries in the world have been affected by the epidemic or
endemic cholera each year since 1961.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently the placing of embargoes on the importation of
food such as seafood, fresh-water fish and vegetables, is not an
appropriate course of action to prevent the international spread
of cholera, and can represent an additional burden on the economy
of affected countries," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The WHO says it believes that the best way to deal with food
imports from cholera-affected areas is for importing countries to
agree, with food exporters, on good hygienic practices which need
to be followed during food handling and processing to prevent,
eliminate or minimize the risk of potential contamination, and to
set up arrangements to obtain assurance that these measures are
adequately carried out.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies having Banned Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Thursday denied a Turkish
newspaper report that it has chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official spokesman said the report carried on the
Turkish paper Miliet is not true because Iraq has destroyed all
the banned weapons under the supervision of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he rejected the accusation of the paper that Iraq
poses a threat to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that by fabricating "cheap and unreal stories about
Iraq," the United States has tried hard to deceive Iraq's
neighbors into believing that Iraq still has weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the U.S. hoped to gain support from Iraq's
neighbors for its fresh military aggression against Iraq, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. who is strengthening military build-up in the Gulf,
has threatened to use military means to force Iraq to open all
sites, including presidential palaces, suspected of hiding the
banned weapons if Iraq does not rescind its decision to deny free
access to the U.N. arms inspectors.

OTTAWA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest nickel
producer Inco. Ltd. has unveiled a new series of cuts in the face
of slumping nickel prices.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based company said it was cutting its annual
dividend to 10 cents from 40 cents, laying off more than 700
people, closing its New York office and cutting back spending on
research and development.
</P>
<P>
It would also reduce administrative budgets and eliminate cash
bonuses to be paid under an incentive plan to its senior officers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 223 million U.S. dollars would be saved with these
and other cutbacks announced three months ago.
</P>
<P>
"We want to come out of this stronger, more competitive and
profitable," Inco spokesman Jerry Rogers was quoted as saying by
reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The world price of nickel has plunged to a record low of 2.52
dollars a pound, down from 3.50 dollars in May last year, forcing
the company to take drastic moves to reduce costs.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt to Ensure Security for 1998 Safari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will do
everything possible to ensure peace and security for the 1998
Safari Rally which will begin on February 28, the Kenya News
Agency quoted a government official as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Mberia, Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner, said
Safari Rally this year would not be affected by the Curfew
imposed recently in Nakuru District as a result of the on-going
ethnic clashes.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government would beef up security
during the event and ensure peace and tranquillity before the
Safari Rally kicks off.
</P>
<P>
Mberia was speaking in his office when he received Safari
Rally Chairman Isaiah Kiplagat who paid him a courtesy call
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kiplagat expressed concern on the security of Rally drivers,
hoping that the government would take stringent measures to
promote peace in the clash-affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The Safari Rally chairman disclosed that there are already 72
entrants for the rally which would cover a distance of 2,350
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The annual event retains the new World Rally Championship
format including a three-day three-leg itinerary with overnight
stops all centered on Nairobi, and a ban on service except in
designated service parks.
</P>
<P>
Michael Hughes, General Manager of Safari Rally Ltd., has
predicted that the 1998 Safari Rally in this east African country
is "the strongest entry for a decade, a titanic struggle between
the top teams, and possibly the roughest and wettest conditions
in recent memory."
</P>
<P>
According to him, full team entries are already confirmed from
Ford, Mitsubishi, Subaru and Toyota, all fielding top seeded
drivers and the latest formula (World Rally) WRCars.

<HEADLINE> Asia Crisis to Bring B.C. Near Recession, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Asia economic
crisis will drag the Canadian province of British Columbia (B.C.)
"precariously close to recession," said a new forecast of
provincial economies.
</P>
<P>
The B.C. economy will grow only one percent this year, compared
with the national average of 3.3 percent, Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce said in the forecast.
</P>
<P>
"The most immediate and severe problem for B.C. comes as a
result of the economic upheaval now taking place in Asia," said
economists of the bank.
</P>
<P>
B.C. sends nearly 35 percent of its exports to Asia, compared
with a Canadian average of eight percent. Lumber, coal, pulp and
paper --the province's major exports -- have all suffered from
weaker sales in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Asia's woes also mean Canada's westcoast province
will see fewer Asian tourists this year, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese House Speaker Warns of Dismembering Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri Thursday warned that a possible U.S. attack would
dismember Iraq, Lebanon's official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Any military actions against Iraq by the United States would
lead to the collapse of the country, Berri said during a meeting
with Lebanese parliament member, representative of the independent
National Democratic Coalition (NDC) Najah Wakim.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., strengthening military build-up in the Gulf, says it
will launch air strikes to force Iraq to grant free access to all
suspect sites, including presidential palaces, to United Nations
arms inspectors charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Berri voiced welcome and support to NDC's decision to hold a
sit-in in front of the parliament next Tuesday to show the
Lebanese people's support for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem for the parliament to provide such a
place for the demonstration designated to show their solidarity
with the Iraqi people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wakim said that his party has issued invitations to various
parties, organizations, unions and people of Lebanon to take part
in the protest against U.S. military threat to Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in Ireland,
including politicians, school children, bankers, taxi drivers as
well as radios fell silent for two minutes Thursday morning in a
huge protest for peace in Northern Ireland, local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 600,000 people had pledged to support the two minutes
silence at 1100 GMT, which was organized by Solidarity to Organize
Peace.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a political statement. It comes from the very
heart of the people of Ireland," said Robert Grier, director of
one employers' organization in Dublin, capital of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and
leaders of all political parties in Dublin also backed the
protest.
</P>
<P>
Those people preyed for an end to violence in the British-ruled
province by rival guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Although the main groups concerned still commit to truce, the
peace talks were dealt with heavy blows since Christmas by a
killing spree.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals $70 Million to Meet Humanitarian Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
today appealed for 70 million U.S. dollars to meet humanitarian
needs in Liberia, as the country recovers from the effects of a
seven-year conflict which claimed an estimated 150,000 lives and
displaced more than half the pre-war population of 2.3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs, despite progress in normalizing the political and
security situation in the country, more than 1.4 million people
remain seriously affected by the conflict. They include the
internally displaced, refugees, ex-combatants, child soldiers and
other vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations consolidated inter-agency appeal aims at
providing support for resettlement and reintegration of these
groups. Projects will include vocational training and the
development of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations predicts that the vast majority of Liberian
refugees in neighboring countries, estimated at close to half a
million people, are expected to choose repatriation over the next
18 months.
</P>
<P>
The appeal is designed to promote the consolidation of peace
and assist victims of the conflict in moving from dependency on
relief assistance to increasing levels of self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, the country will receive assistance to
rehabilitate its agricultural sector and capacity for fishing and
fish processing. Attention will also be paid to revitalizing the
health infrastructure, including reproductive health care. On the
educational front, the appeal calls for providing textbooks and
teacher training. Other projects will address safe water and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The appeal also covers efforts to revitalize the agricultural
economy, re-establish basic health and education services, and
restore sustainable rural community life.
</P>
<P>
A community-based strategy will be used to ensure that
humanitarian assistance reaches child soliders and other
war-affected youth, the elderly, the handicapped, female-headed
households and children under five years of age, as well as in
areas that are difficult to access.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
retreated from recent gains and ended sharply lower Thursday,
undermined by a weak Wall Street and market consolidation.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares suffered from bouts
of profit-taking on top of similar activity in New York and closed
down 55.4 points or almost 1 percent at 5,552.5.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Bank of England inflation report also clouded
market sentiment on fears that interest rates could rise again.
The bank also predicted a sharp fall in UK economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dull 1997 results from the Anglo-Dutch oil giant
Shell, at the bottom end of City forecasts, also weighed on the
index.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also ended lower in thin trading, as
the market consolidated recent record gains, with the DAX-30 index
51.60 points lower at 4,536.83.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index suffered the biggest losses, down
61.3 points or 1.89 percent at 3,178.70, by extending losses
during late trade in response to losses on the Dow Jones index.
The market had dropped during the morning session on overnight
declines in Asian markets.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Force Enters Central Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace keeping
force known as ECOMOG has entered the center of Freetown, capital
of Sierra Leone, at about 5:15 Thursday afternoon local time after
one week's intense fighting.
</P>
<P>
Col. Godwin Ugbo, spokesman of Nigeria's defense headquarters,
confirmed the news to Xinhua when reached by telephone Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But details of the move of the Nigerian-led west African
troops are not immediately available, he said, because "when we
contacted the ECOMOG field commander in Freetown this afternoon,
he went out."
</P>
<P>
"We could not know whether ECOMOG has captured the
presidential villa or not," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the fall of Freetown is a logical
result of ECOMOG's campaign as the force had by Wednesday
occupied Fourah Bay College and the surrounding villages, which
are only about one kilometer from the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored
here said the junta troops are running away, although they could
open fire on an ECOMOG plane flying over from certain place in
central Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops are trying to capture the State House or
have already done that, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 civilians were wounded from gunshot and 80 more
others died during the heavy fighting Thursday which was
accompanied by exchange of artillery fire, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, this looks like the end of the
military regime which seized power in a coup on May 25 last year,
ousting the legitimate government led by President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Early on Thursday afternoon, a junta spokesman told BBC that
the military government would not surrender and would keep on
fighting till the last drop of blood.
</P>
<P>
However, it is predicted that it is only a question of time
for ECOMOG troops to mop up the remains of the junta soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in three days, the city could fall," said the BBC
report.

WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Six U.S. F-16 fighter
jets took off from their domestic base on Thursday, beginning a
new round of departure of U.S. bombers and fighters for the Gulf
to join the already mighty U.S. air and naval force there for a
preparation of attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The six F-16 fighters left Shaw Air Force Base, South
Carolina, at dawn and were to arrive in Bahrain early on Friday
Gulf time after a brief stop at Lajes in the Azores.
</P>
<P>
Six eight-engine B-52 bombers, based at Barksdale Air Force
Base, Louisiana, were scheduled to leave later in the day. their
destination is a British base on the Indian Ocean island of
Diego Garcia, where they will join eight other B-52s already
stationed there.
</P>
<P>
A swing-wing B-1 bomber will also depart later in the day and
fly from Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Six F-117A stealth fighters will leave their Holloman Air
Force Base, New Mexico, on Friday to Kuwait, where they will
join six F-117As deployed there late last year for originally
scheduled attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the warplanes along with some 23 refueling
tankers and other support planes will boost the total of U.S.
attack and support aircraft in the region to about 350.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also decided to send about 2,200
Marines and up to 3,000 soldiers to the region.
</P>
<P>
The Marines aboard ships are expected to arrive in the Gulf
the weekend. And the Army troops are expected to be flown to
Kuwait within days.

<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese organization
Thursday condemned Israel's illegal detention of Lebanese and
maltreatment of them, calling for international intervention for
the release of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
At an annual conference, Mohammed Soffen, Secretary General of
Lebanon's National Association for Lebanese Detainees in Israeli
Prisons, said that a total of 210 Lebanese are being held in
Israeli prisons inside or outside its territory, of whom 160 are
in south Lebanon's AJ-Khiam Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 90 of the detainees are still held without
any trial. Some 40 detainees have died under torture and many
suffer from serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Soffen said, Israel had prohibited officials of
the International Red Cross Committee (IRCC) and the detainees'
families from visiting the Al-Khiam Detention Center since last
December.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Foreign Ministry stressed in a letter to the
conference that it will continue its diplomatic contacts and
efforts to seek the release of the Lebanese detainees.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government and IRCC officials, families of the
detainees and representatives of a number of international
agencies were present at the conference.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Find All Peaceful Means in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- British Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett said Thursday that his country will
exhaust all diplomatic means to bring about Iraq's compliance with
the international will.
</P>
<P>
"London is determined to probe all diplomatic avenues to defuse
the crisis in a way ensuring Iraq's full commitment to Security
Council resolutions," he said at a press conference following
90-minute talks with Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid here.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been preparing for a
military strike against Iraq over its denial of unfettered access
of the United Nations arms inspectors to the sensitive sites
suspected of hiding lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said the door is still open for diplomatic efforts to
take their full course, adding there is no time ceiling for these
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, however, rejected the recent proposals fielded by
various parties to solve the U.N.-Iraq standoff, saying none of
them so far met the minimum required to ensure full respect for
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has just agreed to open eight presidential compounds to
international arms experts appointed by the U.N. secretary general
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
On the Mideast peace process, Fatchett said the current Iraqi
crisis should by no means deflect attention from the peace drive
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who arrived here earlier in the day, said his talks
in Cairo will focus on the current Iraq-U.N. crisis and means to
settle it peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who carried a message to President Hosni Mubarak from
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on ways to bolster bilateral
cooperation relations, cited admirable progress in Egypt's
economic reform program as conducive to deepening Anglo-Egyptian
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett's brief visit to Egypt came within the context of a
tour of the area that has so far taken him to Oman and the United
Arab Emirates.

MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia has never made any deals
with Iraq in violation of the sanctions or supplied to the Middle
East country any equipment to manufacture biological materials,
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov stated here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Information
and press department, made the statement in response to The
Washington Post, which reported on Thursday that Russia and Iraq
had made a deal on supplies of equipment for the production of
biological material to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The report quoting unnamed sources also questions the
impartiality of Russian experts in the U.N. Special Commission
supervising the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq," Tarasov said.
</P>
<P>
The report hints broadly that Russian members of the commission
are acting on behalf of Iraqi interests and keep Baghdad informed
on the commission's inspection plans thus sabotaging the
commission's operation, according the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Russia resolutely rejects this misreporting," Tarasov said. He
denied any deals of Russia with Iraq, saying Russia has never
delivered to Iraq any equipment or materials that can be used for
prohibited purposes, either in the biological or in any other
fields.

<HEADLINE> US Officials: El Nino Could Last for Some Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The El Nino weather
phenomena is expected to be lasted through spring, U.S. government
officials predicted here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino is still going strong and will for two more months,"
U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley was quoted by AP as
saying. "The severe weather in California and the Southeast
unfortunately will continue."
</P>
<P>
Ants Leetmaa, director of the department's Climate Prediction
Center, noted that the current conditions are expected to prevail
for as long as three more months. Conditions should ease by
summer, he added, but even as late as fall, some El Nino remnants
could remain.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the character of the rain response in areas like
Florida, southern California or central California is going to be
very much like it has been for the last month or two months,"
Leetmaa said. "What you'll have is episodic events, there'll be
periods where it dries out then again there'll be periods of very
heavy storms like we've seen in the past."
</P>
<P>
Some forecasters are predicting that conditions could then
switch to the opposite phase, called La Nina, "which could be
equally destructive for the United States," Leetmaa said.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, a periodic warming and air pressure change in the
eastern Pacific Ocean, causes weather changes worldwide. This time
it has been particularly serious for California, where storms have
undermined roads and buildings and driven people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
Daley said damage estimates so far range from 250 million
dollars to 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino of 1982-83 caused an estimated 2.5 billion dollars
in damage in the United States, Daley said, noting that property
values have risen sharply since then.
</P>
<P>
Leetmaa's forecast for February through April calls for wetter
than normal conditions to continue in California, Arizona, New
Mexico, Texas and Florida. Meanwhile, the Puget Sound region,
Montana and the Great Lakes, Middle Atlantic and Ohio Valley seem
likely to be drier than usual.
</P>
<P>
The temperature forecast calls for warmer than normal for the
Pacific Coast and northern tier of states east to the Great Lakes
and colder than usual in Texas, the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast
states north to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
However, experts stressed that in El Nino years there tend to
be fewer than normal hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and it can
produce milder than normal winters in much of the country. This
winter, for example, has been the third warmest on record,
potentially saving as much as 10 percent on heating bills for many
Americans, Leetmaa said.

LUANDA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- After seven days' heated
debate, Angola's National Assembly Thursday passed the national
budget for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was passed with 112 votes for, 12 votes
against and 73 abstentions, is the first balanced one made by the
government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Defense and domestic expenditures take up the highest
percentages in the budget, accounting for 5.76 percent and 4.56
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, parliament adopted the 1998-2000 economic
rehabilitation program, which is aimed to restore the country's
economy after the civil war and improve people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Franca van-Dunem expressed satisfaction over
the adoption of the budget and the rehabilitation program
Thursday, saying that the budget is practical, although the
capital prescribed in it is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government will govern Angola this year
under the circumstances of real peace in the country, which is
the first time for 22 years since its independence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Rules Line-Item Veto Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. district judge
Thursday declared the president's line-item veto authority
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas Hogan ruled that the law -- which gives the
president the power to strike items from tax and spending measures
without vetoing the entire bill -- violates the traditional
balance of powers between the various branches of government
</P>
<P>
"The Line-Item Veto Act is unconstitutional because it
impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three
branches of government," said Thomas Hogan.
</P>
<P>
However, Hogan's ruling will likely not be the final word in
the case. The issue is likely to be decided ultimately by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The line item veto, strongly supported by President Bill
Clinton and a number of his predecessors, was passed in 1996 under
the Republican Party's "Contract with America" policy document.
</P>
<P>
Clinton became the first president to use the power by vetoing
a series of small items last August, exercising the veto power 82
times last year, striking 1.9 billion dollars in spending
projected over five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was disappointed in the court decision but, "It
is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled
constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court."
</P>
<P>
The case was initiated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
challenging the president's unprecedented authority to reject
specific sections of spending bills without vetoing the entire
measure.
</P>
<P>
Hogan ruled that Congress may not "delegate its inherent
lawmaking authority."
</P>
<P>
New York City maintains it was unfairly targeted by Clinton
when he canceled a section of the federal budget bill that would
have let the city and state raise taxes on hospitals and pass
those charges along to the federal government in the form of
Medicaid billings.

<P>
KHARTOUM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese First Vice President
El-Zubeir Mohammed Salih was killed Thursday in a plane crash in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Salih was killed when his plane was making an emergency landing
at al-Nasir Airport due to fierce wind, Sudanese Minister of State
Mohammed Othman Yassin said. He died at the age of 57.
</P>
<P>
The plane slid into the Sobat River because the runway of the
airport, about 800 kilometers south of the capital Khartoum, is
not long enough, Yassin added.
</P>
<P>
The official said that also on board the plane was an entourage
of 52 people accompanying Salih, nine of whom, including Minister
of Culture and Information Tabib Ibrahim Mohammed Khair and
Minister of Animal Resources Musa al-Mak Kur, survived the crash.
</P>
<P>
Salih was on his way back to Khartoum from a two-day trip to
Malakal, capital of Upper Nile State, in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and Speaker of
the National Assembly Hassan Abdulla al-Turabi addressed the
people who gathered in front of the presidential palace Thursday
afternoon and paid tribute to Salih.
</P>
<P>
Salih, a key member of the Muslim government and a close friend
of al-Turabi, played an important role in the 1989 coup in which
al-Bashir took the power. He had been the first vice president
since then.

<P>
UNICEF warned that the war on global poverty was faltering so
badly that the flow of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to
developing countries was in danger of drying up completely if
current trends continued.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy cited a recent report
of the 21-nation Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as the
latest evidence that the developed world was lagging far behind in
their commitment to help developing countries eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Bellamy noted children already bore a disproportionate
burden of poverty as 12 million young children died every year
from causes that could be prevented at a relatively modest cost in
a 28 trillion dollar world economy.
</P>
<P>
"If the world can run at a full gallop to the economic rescue
of East Asia, there is no reason why we cannot do the same for the
1.3 billion people -- half of them children -- who are struggling
to survive on the equivalent of less than a dollar a day," she
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the OECD report, development assistance from DAC
member countries totaled 55 billion dollars in 1996, a 6 percent
decline over the year before.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said that as a share of the combined donor's Gross
National Product, ODA had fallen to 0.25 percent in 1996, the
lowest level since the United Nations set a target of 0.7 percent
in 1970.
</P>
<P>
If all donor countries had met that target, Ms. Bellamy said,
ODA would exceed its current levels by 100 billion dollars a year.
Over 10 years, she added, that amount would be more than enough to
ensure universal access to basic social services including health
and nutrition, education, low-cost water supply and sanitation.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Reaffirms Italy's Bid to Become Founding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Romano Prodi of
Italy Thursday reaffirmed his country's demand to become a
founding member of the single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
"Italy has made all efforts to meet the fiscal criteria
required for joining the the European Monetary Union," said Prodi
in a speech at the opening ceremony of the new fairground of the
southern Germany city of Munich.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the sustainability of the fiscal discipline imposed
by his government, which has been doubted occasionally by some
other European Union countries, including Germany, Prodi said that
"a culture of fiscal stability" had been introduced in Italy,
which would have an irreversible effect on the state budget.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is due to launch the Euro on January 1,
1999. Final decisions on which countries would be allowed to join
the club will be made early May.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Parliament Denounces Using Force in Solving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni House of Representatives
(parliament) Thursday called on the international community to
denounce the use of force in solving the Iraq-U.S. standoff.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after its session Thursday, the Yemeni
parliament stressed the importance of diplomatic means in dealing
with the current crisis caused by Iraq's denial of free access to
U.N. inspectors its presidential sites suspected of hiding
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed the parliament's grave concern over the
latest developments of the situation in "brotherly Iraq" and the
the possibility of a U.S. military strike against the Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
It called on the parties concerned to respect the
international laws and conventions and discard the double-standard
approach in dealing with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement cited as an example of the U.S. double-standard
policy in handling Israel's disrespect for the U.N. resolutions on
the Arab-Israeli conflict and the peace accords it signed with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni House of Representatives rejects the use of force
against Iraq and calls for peaceful means in dealing with the
Iraq crisis, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It also highlighted the necessity of full respect and
implementation of all the U.N. Security Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Growth Slows Down in Last Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy has failed to
sustain an impressive upturn in the Summer of 1997 and started to
slow down towards the end of the year, the German Economics
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a clear expansion during the summertime, there was only a
slight increase in gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth
quarter, said the ministry in its lastest economic report.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the overall deceleration mainly to slower
output growth in the manufacturing industry, with domestic orders
remaining flat and foreign demand down 3.0 percent compared with
the fourth quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite a post-war-record unemployment of 4.8 million in
January 1998, the ministry said it had seen some "first positive
signals" on the job market, with a stabilization of the job
situation apparently underway in western Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern half of the country, however, a stop in job
losses was not in sight yet, the ministry said.

HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Director of Education
Department the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Helen C. P. Lai Yu Friday welcomed a planned increase in
allocation to educational undertakings in the 1998-99 financial
year.
</P>
<P>
"This is almost 16 percent over the 1997-98 revised estimates.
It compares with the increase of just over five percent last
year," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
"With this proposed increase, the budget for school education
will be 26.22 billion Hong Kong dollars (3.36 billion U.S.
dollars)," she said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government published the draft estimates of expenditure
for the new financial year earlier Friday, which total 233 billion
Hong Kong dollars (29.87 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Announcing this bill, Secretary for the Treasure K. C. Kwong
said Friday morning: "The detailed draft estimates provide the
funds needed to implement all the improvements to services and
investments in our infrastructure announced by Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa in his Policy Address last October."
</P>
<P>
Yu said: "We are firmly committed to achieving quality school
education. We will improve existing services and implement the
initiatives envisaged in the government's strategic policy
objective of providing excellence in education."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Pick Up in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. business
inventories picked up in December, making it the 18th month
without a decline, the Commerce Department reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The inventories rose 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 1.05
trillion U.S. dollars following a 0.3 percent increase in
November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. business sales jumped 0.9 percent in
December after falling 0.3 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the inventory growth has remained aligned with
sales. In December, there were enough goods on shelves and
backlots to meet demand for 1.37 months at the current sales pace.
That's a slight decline from 1.38 months a month earlier and also
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
At retailers, inventories jumped 0.8 percent in December while
sales rose only 0.3 percent. Wholesale inventories jumped 0.9
percent, in line with a 0.8 percent sales increase. At factories,
inventories edged 0.1 percent lower while sales surged 1.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is well-balanced as it enters 1998 and that it
will continue to expand at a more moderate rate than in 1997, due
to depressed export sales to Asia.

<HEADLINE> HK Keen in Getting Unemployed Back to Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The first priority of the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
in the area of employment in the coming year is to step up efforts
to help the unemployed re-enter the labor market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Friday, Secretary for
Education and Manpower Joseph W.P. Wong briefed on the
government's major initiative on employment and labor in 1998-99
which include measures to improve labor relations, safety and
health at work.
</P>
<P>
The Education and Manpower Bureau called a high-level meeting
last month to work out ways to tackle the problem of unemployment
increase in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Those who attended the meeting studied the latest labor market
situation and discussed ways to help the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials also had meetings with employers' groups to
explore further scope for cooperation between the government, the
training bodies and employers on tailor-made retraining programs
which will provide new and transferable skills for the unemployed
and enable them to secure and hold down a job.
</P>
<P>
And a comprehensive guide to employment and training will be
published shortly which sets out all the employment, training and
social welfare services available to the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department will further improve its unemployment
services by setting up a second employment and guidance center for
the new arrivals in September and completing the computerization
of the entire local employment services in 11 centers by April,
Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts would be made to strengthen the health and
safety of workers at work, which include implementation of the
Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance which came into force in
May last year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Spring Feels Like Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures in Shanghai
climbed to unseasonably warm 27 degrees Celsius today, a change
which perhaps falsely heralded the early arrival of Spring.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists noted that today was the warmest February
13 on record since 1873, with records for the past 120 years
showing that temperatures have surpassed 20 degrees Celsius on
only 13 occassions.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures over the past week climbed by over 10 Celsius
degrees, with cold drizzle replaced by warm sunshine, according to
the experts.
</P>
<P>
With bright sun shining overhead, Shanghailanders stayed
indoors or attempted to find shady areas so as to escape the
heatwave. Children donned shortsleeve shirts, and shops witnessed
brisk sales of cold drinks and sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
A relatively weak cold front from the north has enabled areas
in the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze to enjoy a warm
air mass, according to local meterologists. They also pointed to
the sharp contrast in the sustained periods of rain characteristic
of earlier periods.
</P>
<P>
While temperatures are not expected to drop significantly in
coming days, local residents should be fully prepared for
the sudden return of a cold front from the north, said experts.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu. Zhejiang, Anhui and various other neighboring
provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley also
experienced higher than normal temperatures today.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Prvince, recorded a
a high Friday temperature of 27 degress Celsius, the highest
spring-like temperature over the past two decades.

WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of babies being
born to Hispanic women in the United States has reached a record
high to 18 percent of the nation's total although Hispanic
residents make 10.3 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Health Statistics said in a report
released Thursday that 679,768 babies were born to Hispanic women
in 1995, the latest year for which complete data are available.
The figure is up from 532,249 in 1989, when 14 percent of all
babies born in the United States had Hispanic mothers.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that much of the increase in Hispanic
births is the result of high fertility rates among
Mexican-Americans. About 70 percent of the babies born to Hispanic
women in 1995 were born to women of Mexican heritage, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times newspaper said Friday that the study's
findings strongly imply that, as a result of high levels of
immigration and a high birth rate, people of Mexican heritage are
poised to become a major economic, political and cultural force in
the coming decades.

<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A program designed to expand
education television and improve teaching conditions in China's
impoverished areas was officially launched today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the program, sponsored by the Hong Kong-based China
Development Service Fund, the China Charity Federation and the China
Education Television, is to enhance interest in the nation's
educational development.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference today, Wilfred Lam, president of the
China Development Services Fund, said that his organization will
establish the nation's first television education center in
mountainous areas in Yangshan County, Guangdong Province, in July.
</P>
<P>
China plans to open as many as 60 similar education centers
over the next two years. The centers will be equipped with
satellite receivers, video recorders, television sets and related
texts, according to Lam.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception, the program has won widespread support
from large enterprises and celebrities in Hong Kong, with the
China Development Services Fund raising 1.4 million Hong Kong
dollars for related efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong fund, a charitable organization, was established

<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader today
called for a deeper understanding of the importance of personnel
issues from a strategic point of view under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Politburo and a member of
the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks
during discussions on Deng's theory on gifted people and
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The party leader reminded members of the panel, sponsored by
the CPC Central Committee Publicity Department and the Ministry of
Personnel, of the first anniversary of Deng's death on February 19.
</P>
<P>
Hu referred to the uncommonness of the past year and noted that
the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core has united
and led the Party, the army and the people in the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics by firmly
inheriting Deng's admonitions and adhering to the Party
principles, theory and line.
</P>
<P>
China's great cause will undoubtedly continue to score
victories if the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory is firmly
upheld and his road for building socialism with Chinese
characteristics is firmly followed at all times and under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Hu cited able people as the most important resources for the
progress of science and technology, and economic and social
developments. He noted that those who have exhibited superiority
in recruiting gifted people will win a dominant position in
development.
</P>
<P>
He noted the significance of fostering tens of millions of
high-quality working people and professionals for the socialist
modernization drive.

emancipation and seeking truth from facts, studying new
developments and resolving new problems in the personnel affairs
work.

WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Moscow denied reports that Russian officials or companies
negotiated with Iraq to sell equipment that could be used to make
biological weapons. American officials said they could not confirm
such a sale. Rusia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev criticized the
United States for threatening to attack Iraq, warning that a
strike could undercut efforts to improve military ties between
Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
-- Sudan's influential and populist Vice President, Lieut.
General al-Zubeir Mohammed Saleh, was among those killed when a
plane carrying several military officers and politicians crashed
as it tried to land in a southern town near the Ethiopian border,
the Government said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A federal judge declared on Thursday that President
Clinton's line-item veto authority unconstitutional. The decision
opens the way for a definitive Supreme Court ruling on Congress's
historic move in 1996 to give the president more control over
spending. The line-item veto allow's a president to strike
individual items in spending and tax legislation, rather than
force him to choose between signing or rejecting an entire bill
that contains objectionable provisions.
</P>
<P>
-- The spectacle of a distaught mother forced to testify about
her daughter's sex life presents a vivid example of the aggressive
approach that independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr has taken in
the four weeks since he launched his investigation of former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Negerian-led troops in Sierra Leone said they had captured
the presidential residence in Freetown and were mopping up

<HEADLINE> Strategic Plan for Tourism Development Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
formulating a strategic plan to sustain a long term vision for
the development of tourism in the country, President Robert
Mugabe said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the Zimbabwe International Travel Expo in
Harare, Mugabe said a tourism revolving fund would be established
soon to enable further investment by indigenous entrepreneurs in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, also intended to launch a massive
rehabilitation exercise of the national parks as the pillars of
Zimbabwean tourism.
</P>
<P>
"Since transport and tourism are inextricable partners,"
Mugabe said, "the government is preparing a number of programs
directed at obviating the bottlenecks existing within the
domestic and international air transport networks."
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the tourism industry reveal that more
than 3.4 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (200 million U.S. Dollars)
was realized from the sector in 1997 compared to 2.4 billion
Zimbabwean Dollars (140 million U.S. Dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"There is, therefore, no doubt that tourism is the fastest
growing sector of Zimbabwe's economy," Mugabe said, adding that
"given the appropriate environmental conditions, the industry
could play a leading role in employment creation and foreign
exchange earnings."
</P>
<P>
On the economy, he said the government was committed to a
process of economic reform to improve the well being of the
people.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe remains committed to the sustainable growth of the
economy and the maintenance of peace and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year's travel expo attracted more than 150 buyers
compared to last year's 75. It was being attended by 160
exhibitors compared with 106 last year.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets United Front Conference Participants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Front has always
been an important magic weapon the Communist Party of China (CPC)
has called on to use to unite the masses in the development of
revolutionary causes and overcoming difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and state president, made the remarks in meeting with
participants attending today's session of a national conference of
the CPC Central Committee United Front Department.
</P>
<P>

Committee Politburo and chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, attended
today's session along with Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the CPC Central Committee Politburo and member of the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China's situation is generally good and the
development of the country's national economy and social sectors
offer many favorable conditions and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
However, he called for full awareness of the growing fierce
competition in the international economy, the financial crisis in
various Southeast Asian and East Asian nations, and the problems
and difficulties the country is encountering in ongoing
development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the Party members, especially leading Party
officials, to gain a comprehensive clear understanding of the
situation. He also called for maintaining confidence and
redoubling efforts to strengthen the united front to intelligently
promote the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in
accordance with the dictates of the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Members of the nation's United Front have witnessed numerous
monumental achievements in both State and Party affairs over the
past year, including the smooth transfer of Hong Kong to the
motherland, studying and implementing the guidelines of the 15th
CPC National Congress, and helping non-communist parties to elect
new leadership, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and director of
the United Front Department of the CPC Central Committee, and

<HEADLINE> China Values Danish Ties, Says Chinese Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, February 13 (Xinhua) - China attaches importance to
its ties with Denmark and treasures the friendly, cooperative
relationship established between peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said this on Friday while
talking with Mrs Marianne Jelved, Denmark's acting prime minister
and minister of economy and Nordic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Denmark was among the first western countries to establish
diplomatic relations with China, and there is no existing cardinal
dispute between the two counties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China and Denmark have many mutual interests in
their efforts to uphold world peace and promote mutual development
of human beings, the vice-premier added.
</P>
<P>
As the bilateral relationship developed rapidly in recent years
and the cooperation fields expanded, the economies of China and
Denmark have huge potentiality for cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Marianne Jelved agreed with the vice-premier's comments on
political and economic relations. She said Denmark would exert its
efforts to push forward to a new stage the economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Police Open Fire on Strikers, Kill Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A woman was killed and
scores of poeple injured after Lesotho police opened fire on
striking factory workers early Friday, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Six people were admitted to hospital with serious injuries and
43 others were treated as out-patients following the shooting,
the SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Workers and management at the CGM factory at Ha-Thetsane,
southeast of the capital Maseru, have been involved in a wage
dispute since last week, and the workers held management hostage
on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The police were called in and rescued the factory managers,
but the workers refused to go home and stayed on the company's
premises overnight, the SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The company was given an eviction order on Friday morning and
the police were called in to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
"While leaving the premises, striking workers started throwing
stones at the factory, some hitting the police. Nearby factories
were also damaged," the SAPA quoted Lesotho Police Commissioner
Bodutu Makoaba as saying.
</P>
<P>
Workers of nearby factories also joined the strike and pelted
the police with stones. During the process, the police responded
by opening fire, injuring dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Marematlou Freedom Party leader Vincent Malebo
condemned the "wanton" shooting, stressing that it happened to
mostly silent and untempestuous women who were only waiting for a
reply to a list of demands to the CGM management.
</P>
<P>
He said it was unfortunate that the shooting happened at a
time when there was need to concentrate on preparations for
Lesotho's general elections late April or early May.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Junta Officers Flee to Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG ) has taken control of almost the whole Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone, with many senior officers of the junta
having fled to neighboring Liberia, the Nigerian military said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Godwin Ugbo, spokesman of the Nigerian Defence Headquarters,
told Xinhua that the whereabouts of the junta leader, Johnny Paul
Koroma, is not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
"Koroma has run away and is likely in Monrovia now, but it is
not officially announced that he is there," said Ugbo, who is the
Acting Director of the Department of Defense Information.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a helicopter carrying most of the senior
officers of the Koroma government has landed in Monrovia, capital
of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
They have been held by the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia for
questioning and interrogation.
</P>
<P>
"So actually, most of the senior officers of the Sierra
Leonean army are no more there. They have either deserted or run
away. Some of them are seen in hiding."
</P>
<P>
As for the fate of Koroma and his senior officers, Ugbo said:
"You wait until we hear from the ECOWAS headquarters."
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) sent
ECOMOG to Freetown to seek for the restoration of the legitimate
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah ousted in a coup last
May.
</P>
<P>
Under intense international pressure, the junta agreed last
October to return power to Kabbah's government by April 22 this
year but later refuse to implement the peace accord to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting between ECOMOG and the junta forces
erupted last Thursday when the former claimed one of its soldiers
on surveillance duty had his leg ripped off by a landmine laid by
junta men.
</P>
<P>
After one week's fighting, ECOMOG forces entered the center of
Freetown, meeting with minimal resistence because the majority of
the junta have defected.
</P>
<P>
"More than 70 percent of the junta soldiers have surrendered
to ECOMOG. So we have been taking refuge of so many of them,"
said Ugbo.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers have taken over the State House, which is the
military headquarters of the junta, the parliament building,
presidential villa and other strategic postions.
</P>
<P>
According to him, ECOMOG is mopping up some areas of Freetown
where the remaining members of the RUF and other junta soldiers
who have not surrendered, are entrenched.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which has been fighting
successive governments of the tiny west African country since
early 1990s, became allied to the junta after the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group formerly built strongholds in some parts of
Freetown and that is where ECOMOG is going to drive them away.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman said ECOWAS only recognizes the armed
forces of Sierra Leone and the RUF rebels should surrender.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say how long ECOMOG will need to wipe out the
RUF fighters, whose existence is said to have caused the trouble
in Sierra Leone for a long time.
</P>
<P>
As for whether President Kabbah could be reinstated earlier
than the April 22 deadline, Ugbo said it is a matter up to the
ECOWAS headquarters to decide.

Researchers from two U.S. universities have found that the
cells can express a "suicide gene", which renders sensitivity to a
new drug, resulting in the killing of tumor cells.

So far the experimental treatment has reduced ovarian cancer in
laboratory mice and has not shown any harmful effects in women.

<HEADLINE> FAO Calls for Agricultural Policy Changes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has called on Sub-Saharan African countries to
change their agricultural policies to halt the process of natural
resource degradation.
</P>
<P>
In a press release reaching here Friday, FAO said that a
regional meeting was scheduled to be held in Addis Ababa on
February 16-20 to seek urgent action to transform agriculture and
rationalize natural resources in Sub-Sahara.
</P>
<P>
In a report to be delivered at the regional meeting, FAO said
that many countries in the region failed to adopt environmentally
sustainable agricultural practices to improve productivity and
counter the process of natural resource degradation.
</P>
<P>
Failure to adopt agricultural technologies and practices which
are not only productivity-improving, but also environmentally
sustainable, has resulted in a dismally poor performance of the
agricultural sector in the region, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Except for rapid population growth, the report said,
policy failure to technologically transform agriculture on a
sustainable basis and to rationalize the exploitation of forest
and other natural resources should be regarded as "the main factor
of the current high rate of resource-degradation in Sub-Saharan
Africa."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feature: Valentine's Day Means "More" for Thais </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Valentine's Day this year is
more demanding for loving Thais, as the cost of romance is soaring
due to the country's economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Young lovers have to pay twice as much as they did a year
earlier for red roses, symbol of the "day of love" as Thais call
it.
</P>
<P>
Florists said that prices for imported roses, especially those
from the Netherlands, will double this Valentine's Day from
100-200 baht (2.2- 4.3 U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Many florists predicted a gloomy festival as high prices stop
lovers from purchasing. And the weekend holiday will also play a
part as Thais used to send flowers to their loved ones' office
instead of their home.
</P>
<P>
However, rays of hope remain for local roses dealers due to the
belt-tightening budget and the "Buy Thai" campaign.
</P>
<P>
Compared with roses imported from overseas, locally grown roses
are much cheaper, although their prices have also skyrocketed to
200 baht (4.3 dollars) from 50-100 baht (1.1-2.2 dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
Facing the price hike of roses, many Thais resorted to pagers
since paging sweet words to their loved ones will cost only three
baht each time.
</P>
<P>
During the Valentine's Day season, major paging companies are
expected to receive 40 to 50 percent more calls than ordinary
days. Some companies have to advise their subscribers to send
their messages in advance.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper reported that a survey showed that each
Bangkok resident plans to spend an average of 400 baht (8.7
dollars) to celebrate the "day of love", down 30 percent from last
year's average of 600 baht (13 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey launched by the Thai Farmers Research Center said
that about 23.5 percent of the people questioned intend to buy
flowers, 21.9 percent want to send cards, another 21.8 percent
prefer chocolate.

GENEVA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- About 20,000 Hungarian
Holocaust survivors are expected to receive a support of 400
U.S. dollars each from a Swiss Fund, a press release in Bern
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Bloch, President of the Swiss Fund for Needy Victims of

</P>
<P>
The payments in Hungary are based on a distribution plan by the
World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO) for Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
This plan foresees the creation of national systems in all the
countries involved, in co-operation with Jewish communities and
local survivors organizations.

KHARTOUM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The First Vice President of
Sudan el-Zubeir Mohammed Salih and other victims of a Thursday
plane crash were buried here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the victims were transported to Khartoum Thursday
evening from the crash site at Nasir town in southern Sudan, some
800 kilometers from the capital Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The funeral was attended by Sudanese President Omar Hassan
Ahmed al-Bashir, the National Assembly Speaker Hassan Abdulla al
Turabi, cabinet ministers, diplomats and thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
The plane had 57 people on board when it crashed, reportedly
because of a storm. So far eight bodies have been found, 31
survived and 18 are still missing.
</P>
<P>
Among those survivors is Minister of Culture and Information
and government spokesman Tabib Ibrahim Mohammed Khair. He has
categorically denied that the plane was shot down by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"It was due to the storm that pushed the plane off the runway
into the Sobat river at the end of the air strip," he said.
</P>
<P>
The John Garang movement, a major rebel faction in southern
Sudan, has issued a statement Thursday claiming it had shot down
the plane over the city of Wau in Bahr Al Ghazal state.

<P>
However, the plane had in fact crashed in the Nasir town
overlooking the Sobat river, some 500 kilometers from Wau.

<HEADLINE> Genetically-Engineered Cells Kill Ovarian Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 12 (Xinhua) -- United States researchers
have found that genetically engineered, chemotherapy-resistant
tumor cells may be an effective weapon against ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from two U.S. universities have found that the
cells can express a "suicide gene", which renders sensitivity to a
new drug, resulting in the killing of tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
So far the experimental treatment has reduced ovarian cancer in
laboratory mice and has not shown any harmful effects in women.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Tulane University said the next step was a
broad study testing its effectiveness against ovarian cancer in
women.
</P>
<P>
For the treatment, scientists created a vaccine using gene
therapy, a method that has already been used successfully on some
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
In a laboratory the researchers attached part of an
ovarian-cancer gene to a gene from the herpes virus.The result, a
so-called "suicide gene", is injected into the patient's abdomen.
</P>
<P>
There, it seems to affect the other ovarian cancer genes so
that when a doctor treats the patient with a standard herpes drug,
the woman's immune system also attacks the cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal female malignancy in the
United States. Last year, the disease occurred in about 26,000
women and was the cause of 14,000 reported deaths.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, when ovarian cancer is first diagnosed, the
disease has already spread, leading to a five-year survival of 30
percent of victims.
</P>
<P>
This week, the researchers presented their study to a
conference of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, the only
U.S.-based medical organization dedicated to the treatment of
female cancers.
</P>
<P>
As part of their study, the researchers tested the injection on
18 women, all in the final stages of ovarian cancer, who had not
responded to other treatment.Cancer levels in four of them
improved and the disease completely disappeared in another.
</P>
<P>
Right now doctors have no reliable test for ovarian
cancer. Some women report symptoms, but they are mild and easily
mistaken for other maladies.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says IRA Involves in Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- British Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland Marjorie Mowlam said Friday the Irish Republican
Army was involved in two murders this week.
</P>
<P>
The region's police chief, Ronnie Flanagan, "has given me a
full briefing on the murders of Brendan Campbell and Robert
Dougan, along with his assessment that the IRA were involved in
these murders," Mowlam said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The two men were gunned down in Belfast on Monday and Tuesday
separately, casting a shadow on the fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This will now have to be considered very carefully with the
Irish government and the other parties in accordance with the
proper procedures," she added.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of talks, which involve both British and Irish
governments and eight Protestant and Catholic parties, any party
which has a guerrilla wing actively engaged in violence can be
expelled.
</P>
<P>
"The integrity of the talks process and the commitment to
exclusively peaceful means are paramount and all parties must be
treated fairly and equally," Mowlam said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA declared a ceasefire last July, thus enabling its
political wing Sinn Fein to gain a seat in the multi-party peace
talks that began last September.
</P>
<P>
It is thought likely that Sinn Fein will be temporarily
expelled from the talks for the involvement in the two killings.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Democratic Party, a pro-British party, has already
been expelled from the peace process recently for links with a
paramilitary group which was responsible for a number of murders.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: Disclosures Might Have Eased Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations
official said here on Wednesday that better financial disclosure
by commercial banks might have given some early warning signals on
the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Ricupero, Secretary-general of the UN Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), was speaking at a meeting of the
UNCTAD Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International
Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR).
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian crisis "is essentially a banking crisis, at
least in some aspects, which started with an ill-performing
banking system, was compounded by excessive overseas borrowing, an
unsustainable property and equity boom and ended with massive
short-term outflow, a free fall in the currency and general loss
of confidence.
</P>
<P>
"The worst might have been avoided, or at least contained, if
there had been some early warning signals."
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to experts in accounting and reporting from
more than 50 countries and about 20 professional associations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Super Corridor Project Continues  Despite Economic Woes (1)  by Wu Dingbao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite the financial and
economic problems facing the country, the Malaysian government has
pledged to carry on its Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project as
scheduled, which according to officials is progressing well.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia had to put off several giant development projects
worth billions of U.S. dollars following the financial crisis
prevailing in the region since last July.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that the
financial and economic problems have not affected the MSC, a 750
square kilometer area stretching from the Kuala Lumpur city center
southward to the new Kuala Lumpur international airport in Sepang,
designated as a hub for the development of multimedia products and
services.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any effect at all, it is to accelerate the
project," Mahathir told reporters at a news conference Thursday
after the first day of the two-day second meeting of the
International Advisory Panel (IAP) on the MSC.
</P>
<P>
The first IAP meeting was held in California on January 16 last
year, and the current second meeting drew 25 information
technology experts and telecommunications chiefs who discussed
various subjects relating to the implementation and policies of
the MSC.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia described the discussions as "very useful" because the
meeting enabled the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC),
which oversees the overall development of the MSC project, and the
government to learn the ideas, shortcomings and recommendations
from the participants needed to make the MSC a success.
</P>
<P>
"The MSC project will go on as scheduled. There is no need to
put it on hold," Mahathir pledged.
</P>
<P>
Some critics have labeled the MSC as an "ambitious, grandiose
mega project." Mahathir said, "I will admit that it is an
ambitious project but it is not for us Malaysians to implement
alone. We will participate actively of course, but the MSC is for
the whole world."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government invests mainly in the infrastructure
for the high-technology hub. Land would be parceled out and sold
to investors wishing to set up their facilities.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the local currency ringgit had eroded some
of the government's capacity, Mahathir said, "But we can still
carry on. So the MSC will go on."
</P>
<P>
Barely a year since Malaysia first launched the MSC, the MSC
project is progressing well ahead of schedule and the response to
it has been beyond the government's expectations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 103 companies have so far been granted the MSC
status, with 80 already operating and the rest 23 setting up their
operations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Super Corridor Project Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since April last year, 178 applications have been received for
MSC status with 39 percent from foreign companies, 35 percent from
Malaysian companies and 26 percent from joint ventures between
Malaysian and foreign companies, according to statistics by the
MDC.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is beginning to see the value created from the
Information Age business.
</P>
<P>
The companies which have applied for MSC status are projected
to have a combined revenue of around 13 billion ringgit (3.4
billion U.S. dollars) by the fifth year of operation, according to
the MDC.
</P>
<P>
The projected profit for the same period would be close to 5
billion ringgit (1.3 billion dollars) on the back of an investment
of around 4 billion ringgit (1.05 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The MDC statistics on the MSC status companies showed increased
investment in high value-added activities with revenue to
investment ratio of approximately 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
Several of the world's top information technology experts and
company chiefs have expressed strong confidence in the MSC, saying
the project will be a great success.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their commitment to the project during the IAP
meeting and even pledged for new and further investments in MSC.
</P>
<P>
Motorola Chairman Gary L. Tooker and Siemens Executive Vice
President Axel Haas said that their companies were committed to
expanding business in MSC.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Graphics Chairman Bob Bishop said, "Despite the money
crisis, the MSC will be a catalyst to pull Malaysia and the entire
region forward. There is major progress from the last meeting.
Facilities are more visible. Planning are more concrete."
</P>
<P>
BCE Chief Executive Officer Lynton Wilson said: "While current
unrest in Asian markets may delay development in the short term,
the fundamental concept (of the MSC) is sound and is firmly backed
by the highest levels of the government."
</P>
<P>
They believed that the MSC's target to operate at full capacity
by 2005 is achievable despite Asia's current economic turmoil as
the project's fundamental concept is sound.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia assures the companies in the MSC that the restrictions
imposed by the government on certain kinds of information would
not apply as far as the MSC is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia pledged to implement intellectual property rights in
the MSC's Cyberlaws, which was seen as an important factor that
could ensure the success of the MSC project.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise we cannot attract a lot of these companies....it is
also in the interest of our own people because unless we protect
the intellectual property, a lot of people in the country will
lose their money," Mahathir said, adding that in addition, it
would help ensure that the interest of foreign companies in the
country is duly protected.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also considering providing safety net for companies
on the edge of bankruptcy. "If any MSC companies fail, we will
provide some form of safety net for them," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also pledged to supply sufficient knowledge workers to
meet the need of the MSC.
</P>
<P>
Some 23,000 knowledge workers would be needed over the next
five years by companies operating in the MSC, with 59 percent of
them in the information technology field, according to a survey by
the MDC.
</P>
<P>
The MDC is offering attractive financial and non-financial
incentives to educational institutions and companies providing
training services.
</P>
<P>
Foreign knowledge workers would also be allowed to work in the
MSC status companies.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
International Committee for Red Cross (ICRC) Friday launched an
appeal for 2.5 million dollars in emergency relief assistance for
the quake-hit northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The appeal called upon the world community to donate emergency
aid needed for the shelterless people of Rostaq, one of the
worst-hit districts of Takhar province, a report by the Associated
Press of Pakistan quoted a spokesperson for the United Nations as
saying here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said that the quake-hit districts have been
hit by harsh weather, and rescue and relief operations have been
seriously hampered due to heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international aid agencies could not
airlift assistance to northern Afghanistan Wednesday because of
inclement weather, said the spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
However, more relief assistance for the quake-affected people
was in the pipeline and would be despatched to northern
Afghanistan as soon as weather conditions improve there, the
spokesperson added.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale hit
Afghanistan's Takhar province last week, which left more than
4,000 people dead and thousands of others homeless.

ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
offering choices to local and foreign investors to invest in
communications projects, Communications Minister Azam Hoti said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hoti was talking to visiting Turkish Maritime Affairs Minister

Pak-Turkish Joint Ministerial Commission, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting the two ministers exchanged views on matters
pertaining to further cooperation in the communications sector.
</P>
<P>
Hoti said that Pakistan welcomes Turkish investors to take
advantage of the conducive climate in the country based on
investment-friendly policies adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Noting Pakistan and Turkey enjoy cordial and special ties based
on common religion, brotherhood and mutual understanding, Hoti
said that Turkish companies have been playing a tremendous role in
the development and prosperity of Pakistan through cooperation in
various socio-economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the government is expanding and modifying
the existing communications system to face challenges of the 21st
century.
</P>

This agenda envisages modification of telecommunications
system, ports shipping, inland navigation system and construction
of a network of motorways, he added.
</P>
<P>
Expressing gratitude to the hospitality of the Pakistani
government, Turkish Maritime Affairs Minister Burhan Kara said
that relations between Turkey and Pakistan are blooming day by
day.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Growth Slowed Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy failed to
sustain an impressive upturn in the summer of 1997 and started to
slow down towards the end of the year, the German Economics
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a clear expansion during the summer, there was only a
slight increase in gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth
quarter, said the ministry in its lastest economic report.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the overall deceleration mainly to slower
output growth in the manufacturing industry, with domestic orders
remaining flat and foreign demand down three percent compared with
the fourth quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite a post-war record unemployment of 4.8 million in
January 1998, the ministry said it had seen some "first positive
signals" on the job market, with stabilization of the job
situation apparently underway in western Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern half of the country, however, an end to job
losses was not in sight yet, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Washington Post Allegation Groundless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Friday dismissed as
groundless a Washington Post newspaper allegation that U.N. arms
inspectors have found documents indicating Russia had provided
Iraq with equipment for producing biological materials.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that by leaking such false news to
the Washington Post, the U.S. administration is intending to harm
the persistent efforts Russia has been exerting to find a
diplomatic way out of Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
"Leaking such false information is an exercise of media and
diplomatic terrorism against Russia," said the spokesman, quoted by
the Iraq News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. ploy was aimed at "playing down Russia's
neutral responsible position vis-a-vis Iraq's legitimate demands
for lifting the embargo and restructuring the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM)" charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the timing of such false accusation also "aims to
cover up espionage and political service offered to U.S.
administration by U.S. officials and inspectors on UNSCOM and its
teams functioning in Iraq".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi Presidential Office Adviser Lt. General Amir
as-Saadi categorically denied the U.S. paper allegation of a 1995
deal between Iraq and Russia for the purchase of 5,000-liter
fermentation tanks, a so-called dual-purpose device that can be
used to produce biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
As-Saadi said that in 1995, Iraqi industrial authority was
planning to build an animal feed plant, and ordered Russian
fermentation tanks with a capacity of 3,000 cubic meters, or 3
million liters, appropriate for the production of fodder, rather
than prohibited germs.
</P>
<P>
"All the said measures were taken with the acknowledgement of
UNSCOM and under its supervision", stressed as-Saadi.

CANBERRA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was

On the foreign exchange market, the currency crisis in

SBC Warburg Australia foreign exchange executive director John
Radinoff said Friday's local data were by-passed as the market
focused on offshore influences.
</P>
<P>
Radinoff said there was market speculation that the weakening
Asian currencies would smack the Australian dollar below 67 U.S.
cents in offshore trading.
</P>
<P>
As for next week, Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig
James said the main domestic hurdle for the Australian dollar
would be the Reserve Bank of Australia's quarterly assessment on
the economy, due on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The markets are looking for a realistic assessment on the
impact of the Asian crisis from the Reserve Bank," James said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 83.97 Japanese yen, from
83.63 locally Thursday, and at 1.2196 German marks, from 1.2352.

SINGAPORE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Finance Minister
Richard Hu said Friday that it is not realistic for the Singapore
dollar to replace the U.S. dollar as the base currency for trade
among the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a senior Singapore government official
ever commented publicly on the proposal since it was aired last
week when Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad toured several
ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after opening an information technology exhibition,
Richard Hu said that Singapore is a small economy and there are
not enough Singapore dollars to go around.
</P>
<P>
On the trade credit plan proposed by Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong, he said there has been good response.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposed multilateral agreement of letters of
credit will supplement bilateral pacts which Indonesia has with
other parties.
</P>
<P>
As for the need for reduced government expenditure in view of
the regional currency crisis, the finance minister said that at
every budget, government departments have been asked to be prudent
with their spending in non-essential areas, and that is especially
relevant this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that all essential spending will carry on as
usual.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai had a robust
property market in 1997 with total transaction volume hitting 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars), doubling the previous
year's figure, according to an official from the Shanghai Real
Estate Trading Center.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hailong, president of the center, said more than 500
property traders were involved in last year's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
The center, established three years ago, has played an
important role in developing Shanghai's property market. The badly
operated Shanghai Lihua Automobile Leasing Co., for instance, was
sold through the center at 18.1 million yuan, some 10 million
yuan higher than the offering price.
</P>
<P>
The center has registered 870 Shanghai enterprises and 242
companies in such inland provinces as Qinghai, Sichuan and
Hunan. They cover businesses from plantation, forestry, textiles
and chemicals to transportation, food processing, machinery and
catering. Total registered capital in 1997 was 5.7 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The center also serves as a consultant to aid enterprises in
market competition, property transfers, mortgages, leasing and
intermediate transaction services.

KAMPALA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda National Environment
Management Authority (NEMA) has instructed an Asian businessman
to suspend his construction of an amusement park in the south of
the capital Kampala, The New Vision reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Henry Aryamanya-Mugisha, NEMA's deputy executive director,
said they had told Sudhir Ruparelia to suspend his work in
Munyonyo, about 8 kilometers south of Kampala, until an
environmental impact assessment is carried out and his project
approved.

<P>
The official added that Ruparelia did not get the permission
for developing the place on the lakeside.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Lwanga, an official in the Ministry of Natural
Resources, said the construction of Ruparelia's amusement
facilities could destroy spawning grounds for fish and silt the
lake.
</P>
<P>
The project will enter Lake Victoria, Lwanga noted. She also
expressed worries over the disposal of wastes to be generated.
</P>
<P>
The project includes an amusement park, six tennis and six
squash courts, a club house, a restaurant and a show jumping ring
for houses. Ruparelia has imported 32 horses from South Africa
and Kenya for his project.

NAGANO, Japan, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Pre-race favourite Hermann
Maier of Austria crashed in the long-delayed men's downhill race on
the day when the men's ice hockey "Dream Tournament" began at the 18th
Olympic Winter Games on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's downhill event which had been postponed for six days,
Jean-Luc Cretier of France surprised all as well as himself to win the
showpiece title, clocking at one minute and 50.11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Lasse Kjus of Norway was second with 4.54 seconds behind and Hames
Trinkle of Austria third at 1:50.63.
</P>
<P>
After finishing his run, Cretuer, third starter, watched the crash
of Maier, who started at the fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Maier, former bricklayer, crashed 18 seconds after the starting
gate and bounced into the air, somersaulting twice before landing on
his back in the deep snow after breaking the safety nets. Fortunately,
he only suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian, the most successful skiier in the sport with 10 World
Cup victories last season, managed to stand up and walked without
assistance.

<P>
The race was delayed by about nine minutes to repair the nets.
</P>
<P>

injured. He was airlifted by a helicopter to a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
Some other skiiers also lost their balance at the same spot but did
not crash.
</P>
<P>
The downhill race witnessed 15 skiiers out of competitions.
</P>
<P>
The ice hockey tournament at winter Olympics entered into a new era
when Sweden opened the championship round game with a stunning 4-2
victory over much fancied team the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that ice professionals could play in winter
Olympics. The United States, Sweden, Russia, Czech Republic, Canada
and Finland, all gold contenders, feature NHL players in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In the men's combined event, Austrian Mario Reitter, who in the
leading place after the slalom, chalked up the title despite a sixth

third at 3:10.11.
</P>
<P>

doubles event. Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt collected the second
gold medal for Germany in the sport with a clocking of one minute and
41.105 seconds from two runs.
</P>

The United States broke European's domination in the sport when two
pairs from the country won the silver and bronze in the men's doubles
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 500m speed skating first race today, Canada's
Catriona LeMay-Doan set a new Olympic record 38.39 seconds, beating
the previous mark of 39.10, which Bonnie Blair of the United States
has held for 10 years since her gold-winning time in the Calgary Games
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
LeMay-Doan's record-smashing win also puts her in the lead at the
end of the first day of the two-day event.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Susan Auch, silver medalist in Lillehammer, Norway
four years ago, took the second place, crossing the finish line in a
time of 38.42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Japanese skater Tomomi Okazaki was third for the second race at
38.55.
</P>

After seven-day competitions, Germany jumped to the leading place
in the medal table, with five golds, four silvers and four bronzes.

<HEADLINE> China to Fund Publishing of Academic Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China will appropriate three
million yuan (360,000 U.S. dollars) to publish 62 kinds of
academic works on science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The committee of the National Science and Technology Academic
Works Fund announced here today the first group of publishing
programs to receive annual financial support.
</P>
<P>
Publishing houses are expected to receive 20,000-to-100,000
yuan (2,400-to-12,000 U.S. dollars) for publishing each of the
books on the list.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Science and Technology Commission
(SSTC) said that the fund was established last May with 30 million
yuan (3.6 million U.S. dollars) from the Ministry of Finance and
the SSTC to aid in publishing outstanding academic works.
</P>
<P>
In China, many scientists and researchers have been unable to
publish their works for lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Wei, deputy head of the fund committee, noted that the 62
types of works cover mathematics, chemistry, life sciences, earth
sciences, materials and engineering science, and the information
field. More than 40 percent of the works to be funded deal with
life-science research.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the eldest author is 85 years old whereas the
youngest is 33; and 14 are academicians from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhu welcomes donations from both domestic and
overseas ventures, organizations and individuals for publishing
academic works.

LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Petroleum Resources
Minister Chief Dan Etete has called for foreign companies to

will be safe.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Australian Ambassador to Nigeria Matthew

Nigeria is a leading oil producing and exporting country in
the world, with oil accounting for about two-thirds of the
government foreign exchange income and revenue.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Price Cut to Make Home-Made Cars More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The price for Jetta standard
model cars manufactured by a major Chinese automaker was recently
reduced to under 120,000 yuan, which conforms with the
international market.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, this is the result of
cost-reduction efforts made by the First Automotive
Works-Volkswagen. And the price cut is considered a major step
toward China's acceptance into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The price of the Jetta was slashed by 12.8 percent. This is a
follow-up to the price reduction on Santana cars produced by
Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.
</P>
<P>
Santana is now as low as 114,000 yuan after its price was
lowered by 20,000 yuan early this year.
</P>
<P>
During the week before the Chinese lunar new year (Jan. 28),
more than 600 Santana cars were sold in the largest Santana outlet
in Beijing, according to Hu Jiabin, general manager of the
company.
</P>
<P>
Hu, Santana's general agent in North China, said the company
sold only 100 Santanas during the same period in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the price cuts for the Santana and Jetta, some Citroen
1.3 model cars had already been lowered to 118,000 yuan, and
further reductions are expected.
</P>
<P>
The slashes are expected to trigger price changes in other
brands such as Xiali.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that with expanding production and lower costs,
Chinese-made cars are not likely to be severely affected by the
country's tariff reduction.
</P>
<P>
The current tariff levied on mid-level to luxury cars has been
reduced from 120 percent to 100 percent. For mid-level to
inexpensive cars, it has been lowered from 100 percent to 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 481,600 cars were produced in China, of which 474,200
were sold. The production and sales volumes of Santana cars ranked
first, with 230,000 rolling off the assembly lines last
year.

<HEADLINE> 40 Percent World Bank Projects Fail to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- About 40 percent of the World
Bank projects failed to meet their objects, a bank official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Randolph Harris, World Bank resident representative to Uganda,
told a journalism workshop Thursday that one reason of the
failure is that the projects did not involve the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
He gave examples in agricultural sector, saying "some of the
farmers who were supposed to produce for export did not get the
money, so they ended up not producing the crops."
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the failure is the suspension of the
institutions concerned to carry out their schemes.
</P>
<P>
"In the past a separate implementation unit was established
with the support from World Bank or other institutions, so when
donor funding was stopped, the unit disappeared," Randolph noted.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank currently emphasizes capacity building in its
projects, he said, adding "Today through capacity building for
people and institutions, the beneficiaries are able to make
projects sustainable."
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organised by the Norwegian government and
Economic Development Institute of the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Pudong Plans New Measures for Trade Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area of
Shanghai this year will take new measures to promote its economic
and trade ties with other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
A major measure is to launch another Sino-overseas foreign
trade company and strive to win approval from the central
authorities to allow more trade companies from other parts of
China to set up subsidiaries in Pudong, a rising financial and
trade district separated from downtown Shanghai by the
Huangpujiang River.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Hongli, deputy director of Shanghai Municipal
Economic and Trade Commission, China last year allowed the
establishment of joint-venture foreign trade firms in Pudong on a
trial basis. Currently there are three Sino-overseas joint-venture
trade firms in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Starting the first quarter of this year Shanghai will implement
new customs practices in Pudong to support a new round of
infrastructure construction in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone of Pudong will be the apple of the
eye in Pudong's new effort for economic and trade growth.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, there were 261 processing enterprises in
the bonded zone, where many multinational corporations and
enterprise groups have established regional or national
distribution centers for manufactured products and components.
</P>
<P>
Pudong's foreign trade volume grew 22.6 percent to 9.9 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, with exports standing at 4.6 billion U.S.
dollars, according to figures from the Shanghai Customs Office.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Officers Enthusiastic about Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Major Wang Jing hasn't had a
weekend off for six months. Each weekend, the Chinese Air Force
officer goes to the Air Force Command Institute to study in a
graduate program.
</P>
<P>
On weekdays, Wang works in the General Hospital of the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
"It has been hard work, but I'm determined to complete the
three-year program," she said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, more Chinese army officers are receiving higher
education while keeping their jobs.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 officers participated in graduate and
undergraduate programs last year, according to the General
Political Department of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and
nearly 150,000 have received higher education diplomas since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Young officers account for a large part of those in
undergraduate and graduate programs, said Gen. Wang Zhenkai, dean
of studies at the Air Force Command Institute.
</P>
<P>
The rising enthusiasm for higher education is closely related
to the development of the Chinese army, said military experts.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many officers have become acutely aware of
their deficiencies in knowledge and competence when weaponry has
been much improved, they explain, and the fact that officers who
have received higher education tend to get promoted more than
others.
</P>
<P>
China's education authorities and the military have encouraged
officers to continue their education while keeping their jobs.
</P>
<P>
More education for military officers will contribute to the
improvement of the officers' corps. Some 62.5 percent of Chinese
army officers have had college education, up from 22.2 percent in
1988.

<HEADLINE> China's Transport Business Gaining Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- High speed is becoming a sign
of the times on China's highways, railways and navigable waterways.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Communications show that China
now has 4,735 kilometers (km) of expressways, compared with only
500 km in the early 1990s. In 1998, the country plans to add 800
km of expressways and 540 km of fast roads for the use of
automobiles only.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the country's first expressway, from
Shenyang to Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province, started
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility research into an express railway from Beijing to
Shanghai, the two largest cities in China, is being speeded
up. The designed speed for the road is expected to reach 250 km
per hour, 50 km more than the international express standard,
making the entire journey 6.5 hours long, according to sources
from the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
A quasi-express railway linking Guangzhou with Shenzhen in
south China's Guangdong Province, has already gone into operation,
with a speed of 160 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the train speed was raised on a general basis on
last April 1. On the three trunk lines of Beijing-Guangzhou,
Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Harbin, trains now run at a speed of
140 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The China State Shipbuilding Corp. says that more than 200
high-performance vehicles are operating on more than 70 water
routes on the Zhujiang (Pearl River), Yangtze, Huanghe (Yellow),
and Heilongjiang rivers as well as Bohai Bay and the Yellow, East
china and South China seas. These ships cruise at 60 to 70 km per
hour.
</P>
<P>
Air transport, with high speed as its advantage, is
continuously increasing. Latest statistics from the Civil Aviation
Administration of China show that airplanes carried 56.3 million
passengers last year, still up from 1995, when the figure
surpassed 50 million for the first time.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.25 million tons of cargo was mailed via air last
year, up 8.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sticks to Deadline for Mergers of Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
will stick to its original deadline of March 31 for local
financial institutions to announce their merger plans, Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to the planned date for mergers among financial
institutions," Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said at a
press conference after the inauguration of a mobile phone factory
in Shah Alam near here.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has decided to encourage local
financial institutions to merge into bigger entities to
efficiently face the onslaught of greater competition when the
local financial services sector is opened up to foreign
institutions in the future.
</P>
<P>
There are 35 local financial institutions in the country and
the government has planned to get them merged into 5 to 7 bigger
entities by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
It is of paramount importance to do so, Anwar said, adding "I
think the macroeconomic policy consideration is determined partly
by strong financial institutions."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysia had adjusted its fiscal policies and even
took unpopular measures to ensure that the macro-economic
stabilization process was uninterrupted and that there was viable
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue effective monitoring and surveillance to
ensure that our plans, including the moderation of credit growth
will be observed, whatever difficulties that we may encounter," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister also said Malaysia would not consider to
establish a currency board system "because the ringgit has been
strengthening in last three weeks."

SINGAPORE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined
sharply on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) plunged by 47.6 points to end at 1,552.69
points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices went down after a bout of
profit-taking, spurred by Indonesia-linked concerns. As a result,
the STII shed almost three percent.
</P>
<P>
This was the second straight day of losses for the local
bourse, they said, noting that the initial reaction was in
response to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concerns over
Indonesia implementing a currency board.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume stood at 859.98 million units, valued
at 798.62 million Singapore dollars (about 481.1 million US
dollars). Declines led advances by 206 to 171, while 234 other

</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 126.01 million units. It was followed by
Rekapac which had 75.63 million shares traded. M. Resources was
next with 50.99 million shares traded.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Traditional Rulers Ask Abacha to Run for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's traditional rulers
have joined the call for the head of the military government,
General Sani Abacha to run for the civilian presidency in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Abacha Thursday in the national capital
Abuja, the traditional rulers said, "We have carefully looked
round and with all humility hasten to say that you are the person
fully qualified to occupy the seat."
</P>
<P>
"The entire membership of the traditional rulers forum has,
therefore, decided to humbly but strongly appeal to you to
consider contesting the post of civilian president in the 1998
elections so that you can continue with the good work you have
been doing," said a statement read by Alhaji Mohammadu Maccido,
the sultan of Sokoto.
</P>
<P>
The traditional rulers said they are making this appeal "with
every sense of responsibility and patriotism, firmly believing
that it will be in the overall interest of peace, unity,
stability and prosperity of the nation".
</P>
<P>
Abacha, in reaction, was quoted by local media as saying that
the call by traditional rulers is a recognition of his
administration's efforts to improve the lot of Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the increasing call on him to run as "a
challenge" and said he needs divine guidance to make the right
choice, reports said.
</P>
<P>
As Nigeria's transition to civil rule program draws to the
end, there have been increasing calls on Abacha to shed his
uniform and contest for the civilian presidency in August.
</P>
<P>
The join-in of traditional rulers, who are very influential in
decision-making in Nigeria, is believed to be a strong
reinforcement to the already powerful persuasion campaign.
</P>
<P>
Just on Tuesday, leaders of Nigeria's five political parties
also met with Abacha in Abuja to discuss key issues concerning
the transition program.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the parties discussed the issue of their
adopting Abacha as their consensus candidate, but that has been
denied by the party leaders.
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain now, that is, less than six months to the
presidential election, only one aspirant has appeared and he has
not been adopted by any of the parties.

JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has increased its spending estimate by 2.73 billion
Rand (550 million U.S. Dollars) and accordingly revised its
budget deficit to 4.3 percent, South African Press Association

</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Finance Minister Trevor Manuel as saying that the

</P>
<P>
Unveiling his budget adjustments in the National Assembly in

down into two components.
</P>
<P>
About 1.5 billion Rand (about 305 million Dollars) of it would
go toward the financially troubled provinces, while the remaining
1.2 billion (245 million Dollars) pertained to roll-overs or

the United States from launching a military action against Iraq.
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who met with American
Defense Secretary William Cohen in Moscow, said that an attack
upon Iraq harms vital interests of Russia.
</P>
<P>
-- While the American task force has not completed its
reinforcement in the Gulf, Washington is continuing its
diplomatic activities aimed at winning as many supporters as
possible for a military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia Thursday raised its tone in warning the United States
against attacking Iraq. In Washington, the Congress always remains
divided over the objective of an American intervention in Iraq and
has been delaying the vote on it day by day. French President
Jacques Chirac said that an intervention in Iraq should not be the
one which bombs women and children.
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Thursday ruled out any
negotiation with the nationalist movement on the Corsica island.
``There is nothing to negotiate,'' he said in a television
interview.

<HEADLINE> S. African Troops Urged to Speed up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise has expressed his concern at the low pace of
transformation in national armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Modise said the
equal opportunity and affirmative action programs would be
accelerated to enhance the legitimacy of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The minister was concerned about the low progress in the
defense force towards reflecting the country's diversity. Only
22.5 percent of defense force officers were black and only 11 out
of more than 50 generals were black, he said.
</P>
<P>
There had to be progress in transforming the force because
unless it became fully representative people would not accept it,
Modise noted.
</P>
<P>
On troops change, Modise said the number of general officers
would be cut as the force downsized. Downsizing would be
achieved through natural attribution, intergovernmental
transfers, non-renewal of short-term contracts, voluntary
severance packages and retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
Draft plans for downsizing of the defense force from current
94,000 members to 70,000 over three years and the merging of
units were reportedly to be presented to the Defense Ministry
next month.
</P>
<P>
Rationalization was set to begin at the end of the year, but
the process would be spread over several years, the ministry's
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Modise said the mergers could allow the defense force to
concentrate resources to help the police and to acquire capital
equipment. Only 13 percent of the present budget went to capital
cost, and restructuring would allow this to rise to 30 percent
over the three years.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Leading Other Autonomous Regions In GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region produced a GDP of slightly over 200 billion yuan
in 1997, ranking first among China's five autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has 46 million people, more than the total of the other
four -- Tibet, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia -- combined.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, Guangxi has achieved one of the fastest
economic growth rates, with a policy supporting economic growth
and keeping population growth below the state level.
</P>
<P>
It continued to stay on to develop such major products as
sugar, fruits, vegetables, livestocks, aquatic products, tea, and
herbal medicines, and applied more agronomics and technologies in
this effort.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Guangxi also encouraged township enterprises to
promote reforms, and improve or try new management systems in an
effort to revitalize the sector and contribute more to local
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the region produced 16.6 million tons of grain
last year, 30 million tons of sugarcane, three million tons of
fruit, 3.13 million tons of meat, and 1.9 million tons of aquatic
products, increases as high as 25 percent in some cases.
</P>
<P>
The modern enterprise system it put into force on a larger
trial basis has considerably enhanced enterprises' market
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The region has also made some headway in reforming state
enterprises, and has begun to shift industrial development to
foodstuff, nonferrous metals, new technology, and other pillar
industries for new economic growth areas.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, this effort has helped revert the downhill trend
of the state industrial sector. Last year, Guangxi had 67.5
billion yuan in industrial added value, a year-on-year rise of 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
It spent 52.4 billion yuan on fixed assets, a 10 percent
increase, considerably improving its infrastructure in the
process. The completion of major projects like the Nanning-Kunming
Railway improved its investment environment also.

<HEADLINE> Ice Hockey Federation Seeks Co-operation with NHL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
International Ice Hockey Federaton (IIHF) Rene Fasel said on Friday
that it would be beneficial if there was some co-operation between the
National Hockey League (NHL) and the world governing body of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment in response to concern the fact that Belarus
defenseman Ruslan Salie and American team's Gary Suter both played in
Nagano games despite NHL suspensions.
</P>
<P>
Team Canada star Paul Kariya will not be able to compete in Nagano
due to injuries sustained from the body-check that led to Suter's
NHL's suspension.
</P>
<P>
"I think that will be a matter of discussion in the next
negotiation," Fasel told a press conference at the Big Hat ice arena.
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of discussion and problems to find together here. I
think maybe we didn't spead enough about that," Fasel added.
</P>
<P>
The president said that opposite cases have happened as well, when
players from Europe, who are members of the IIHF, are suspended on the
international level and go to play at the NHL where the suspensions do
not apply.
</P>
<P>
He also said that during the ice hockey tournament a team may be
disqualified if member players test positive, but he left the door
open for discussion.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow the rules of the IOC (International Olympic
Committee) and also of the rules of the International Ice Hockey
Federation."
</P>
<P>
But Fasel added that before any action is taken, there will be
discussion and possibly flexibility.
</P>
<P>
"If we have a positive test, we will sit together with the IOC, the
medical commission, and the juridical commission and handle this
case," he said.

<HEADLINE> High Growth Rate Causes Environment Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- High population growth rate
has caused enviroment degradation in Uganda, the National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) said in its biannual
report.
</P>
<P>
An increasing demand for food and charcoal as energy source in
the country without sufficient investment into agriculture forces
farmers to expand their cultivation land, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Without means to invest in intensive agriculture, households
are increasingly encroaching on marginal lands which cannot
support agriculture sustainably," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of agricultural land often leads to depletion of
wetland and encroachment of forest reserves and wildlife areas,
the New Vision quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indiscriminate felling of trees is blamed for reduction in
water catchment areas, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has rich water energy. But high electricity cost forces
its residents to rely on charcoal. The price of charcoal is half
of its equivelent of electricity, an earlier report said. For a
family of four or five, a monthly charcoal fee for cooking is
some 15,000 Uganda Shillings (some 14 U.S. dollars), while a
salary of an average skilled worker in Kampala is some 70,000
Uganda Shillings (some 65 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Asian Economies to Recover in 3 Years: Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer predicted Friday that Asian economies would
recover within three years if the world avoided making serious
blunders that hindered their comeback.
</P>
<P>
In his address to business students at the University of South
Australia in the Australian coastal city of Adelaide, Downer said
that "If the world avoids making any serious mistakes in the next
year, then the Asian economic crisis will work through over two to
three years."
</P>
<P>
Downer also urged Australian firms to take up opportunities
presented by the economic crisis, such as cheaper assets, warning
that if they did not stick with Asia while it worked through its
problems, they would find it harder to get back into re-emerging
Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
"Australian firms should take the opportunities that are
presented because ... my judgment is that within the next two to
three years, Asian economies will be back on the path to growth,"
he was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I think businesses that walk away from Asia now will find it a
lot more difficult to get back in."
</P>
<P>
Downer said the International Monetary Fund packages to bail
out Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea must be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the resurgence of neo-protectionism should also be
avoided, particularly by the United States, which should continue
to allow Asian access to its markets.
</P>
<P>
Downer also revealed the Australian government was holding
talks with Thai officials about whether Australia should provide
more aid money to help address the social problems that will
result from the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Invests 7.87 Billion Dollars in Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh invested a total of
362.34 billion taka (about 7.87 billion U.S. dollars) in the
industrial sector during the last seven fiscal years, the national
news agency BSS reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael
Ahmed in the Parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken up necessary measures for increasing
the volume of investment in the country, including exemption of
income tax for the local investors, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has also taken some measures for
encouraging foreign investors, such as ensuring equal behavior to
local and foreign investment, protecting foreign investment from
nationalization, ensuring proper repatriation of the sale of
shares and profit of investment, ensuring 100 percent foreign
investment and setting up export processing zones in the private
section, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has signed bilateral agreements with 19 countries
for the protection and development of capital investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the large amount of investments, Bangladesh's industrial
sector has grown steadily in the past seven fiscal years though
the growth rate is not as high as expected.

<HEADLINE> World Fish Output Nearly Doubles Since 1970: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) Friday said that some 30 million
fishers around the world produced 116 million tons of fish in
1997, up sharply from 65 million tons in 1970.
</P>
<P>
"The growth is mainly related to the increase in the size of
fishing fleets and the expansion of aquaculture," according to a
new survey by the FAO available here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of fishers in 1997 also increased by 130 percent
compared with 1970 and 95 percent of the fishers are from
developing countries, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
The organization also said that in 1997, about 85 percent of
the fishers in the world are in Asia, mainly in China, India,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, compared with
77 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
The number of fishers in north and central America also
increased, reaching some 840,000 in 1990, but in Europe the figure
dropped markedly to 390,000 in 1990, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
"Fishery labor productivity and capital intensity vary widely
among countries. Highly industrialized fisheries generally employ
few fishers per unit of output," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based UN body also warned that many fishery resources
are overexploited and declining, indicating about 35 percent of
the 200 major marine fish resources are showing declining yields.
</P>
<P>
It notes that a drastic reduction of at least 30 percent of
world fishing capacity is needed to rebuild overfished resources.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Leads U.S. Cities in Housing Market Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 12 (Xinhua) -- San Francisco has the most
expensive housing market in the United States, according to data
released earlier this week by a real estate association.
</P>
<P>
The average price for a home in San Francisco for the fourth
quarter of 1997 was 304,600 U.S. dollars, edging out Honolulu's
300,000 dollars, reported the California Association of Realtors
(CAR).
</P>
<P>
The last time when San Francisco was at the peak of the housing
market was the second quarter of 1989. That year the median price
for a home was 266,500 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The recovery in the San Francisco housing market last year was
isolated. In fact, CAR said the prices in cities throughout the
region jumped as the economic boom, fueled by Silicon Valley,
rolled on.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, home sales increased 3.1 percent and the median
home price rose five percent to 128,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In California, an existing, single-family detached home in 1997
was 186,490 dollars, up 5.2 percent from 177,270 dollars a year
ago -- the sharpest increase since 1989. The state sold 555,380
homes last year, up 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The median price of 316,250 dollars of Santa Clara County,
where Silicon Valley is located, was the highest among 16 regions.
</P>
<P>
An earlier CAR report said that in California, 39 percent of
households can afford to buy the median-priced homes. But this
masks regional differences of housing affordability. In some areas,
new home building was not necessarily taking place where it was
most needed.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of housing should trigger more house construction
since it often signals housing shortages, but this was not always
the case, CAR said. This perhaps constitutes part of the reason
for housing price hikes in, for instance, San Francisco Bay Area,
where affordability is significantly below the statewide norm.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Beats United States in First Round of Men's Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Sweden
got off to a storming start to the championship round of the men's ice
hockey tournament with a 4-2 victory over highly-fancied team the
United States on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The match witnessed three goals within several seconds during the
first period. Chris Chelios put the Americans one up after 11 minutes
and 10 seconds, but NHL 1996 Rookie of the Year Daniel Alfredson
levelled the scores on a powerplay at 12:26.
</P>
<P>
Modano put one past Swedish goalie Tommy Salo to give the United
States the lead at 12:50, and the Americans went off the ice at the
end of the first 2-1 up and having outshot the Swedes 12-5.
</P>
<P>
It was downhill for the United States from that time. Patric
Kjellberg beat American goalie Mike Richter to tie the game at 21:50,
while Alfredson scored again to give Sweden the lead at 31:33. Both
Alfredson goals were assisted by Peter Frosberg, NHL Rookie of the
Year for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mats Sundin scored the fourth goal for Sweden with three minutes to
go in the third period.
</P>
<P>
After the match, Sundin said:"I think we came out in the first
period and we didn't play as good as we wanted to. We were changing
chances back and forth with them and if you do that,it is going to be
very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"So we came out in the second period and controlled the game a
little bit more. And we played the way we wanted to play," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in another match Friday afternoon, Czech Republic
defeated Finland 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Canada will play Belarus and Russia will take on Kazakstan in the
evening.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Currency Crisis to End in 9 Months: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency crisis
could end in nine months' time owing to the strong economic
fundamentals of the country, an economist predicted Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jesus P. Estanislao, dean of the Asian Development Bank
Institute in Tokyo, told reporters here that the road to recovery
is likely to be attained by the Philippines soon.
</P>
<P>
Based on the positive developments that are taking place in the
market, the Philippine economy is moving towards relative
stability among the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries in the short term, he said.
</P>
<P>
Estanislao urged the ASEAN economies affected by the turmoil to
put up a monitoring mechanism to ensure greater coordination on
exchange rates and other macro-economic financial variables.
</P>
<P>
"They will have to draw the line firmly against competitive
devaluation in the region. Then they will have to wake up to the
fact that as their trade and investment regimes continue to open
up more freely towards each other, there is no escaping from the
need for more open consultation and closer coordination on
macro-economic fundamentals," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Estanislao also urged the affected economies to modernize their
financial systems, saying this should not be limited to the
development of the capital markets.
</P>
<P>
"Even more basic is the attention that must be focused on the
banking systems, which need to adopt best practices of supervision
and regulation, disclosure and competition, administration and the
setting of standards in line with more open market systems," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Lemay-Doan Leads Women's 500m Speed Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 13 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Catriona
Lemay-Doan set up her title position for Saturday's Olympic women's
500-meter speed skating as she won the first of two-run race in Nagano
"M-Wave" rink Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian, who set the world record of 37.55 seconds in Calgary
on December 28 in 1997, finished first in 38.39 seconds to improve the
Games record by 0.71 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The old Games mark was set by former American superstar Bonie
Kathleen Blair on February 22 in Calgary in 1988.
</P>
<P>
All other five of first six-finishing skaters surpassed the Blair's
Games record before Saturday's second and final run race.
</P>
<P>
Lemay-Doan's teammate Susan Auch, silver medalist in Lillehammer
four years ago, ranked second with a time of 38.42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Auch was followed by two Japanese Tomomi Okazaki in 38.55 and Kyoko
Shimazaki in 38.75.
</P>
<P>
Franziska Schenk of Germany, who took the bronze at the Lillehammer
Games, finished fifth in 38.88 seconds. American Christine Witty came
in sixth by clocking 39.09.
</P>
<P>
China's best Xu Ruihong, who took fourth with a time of 39.54 in
Lillehammer, skated 39.49 seconds, placing 13th of 37 skaters.
</P>
<P>
It was disappointed for Xu's teammate Wang Manli, who was hindered
at the crossing straight by Austrian Emese Hunyady. Wang skated well
in the first 390 meters and finally managed to finish in 40.01 seconds
for 22nd place.
</P>
<P>
Hunyady was disqualified because of hindering Wang, officials said
after the race.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Spain to Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said the
Philippines and Spain should further strengthen their relations,
especially in the field of investment and trade, a presidential
press release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said Ramos made the remarks Thursday night at
a dinner hosted for him and First Lady Amelita Ramos by King Juan
Carlos and Queen Sofia who were visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
"Let us therefore use our centuries-old ties and our
newly-found business opportunities to further reinvigorate our
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the area of development assistance, Ramos acknowledged
Spain's commitment of 30 million U.S. dollars for projects and
programs on poverty alleviation, human resources development,
technology transfer and the peace process in Mindanao, the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He added that Spain will assist in the restoration and
preservation of buildings, churches, forts, bridges, ancestral
homes and other historical landmarks in different parts of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines declared independence from Spain's
three-century colonial rule on June 12, 1898.

<HEADLINE> China's Fashion Capital Gets New Fashion Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Fashion magazines are in
vogue in China these days, and the latest entry to the publishing
world is one that appeared recently in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The magazine 'How' is a reincarnation of the earlier 'Culture
and Life' which was published for nearly 20 years. It gives its
Chinese readers a taste of the latest fashions around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fashionable and popular clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, and
perfumes can all be found on the magazine's pages, according to
its publisher.
</P>
<P>
'Culture and Life' started in January, 1979 and had a press run
of three million at its height. But, it was decided that the name
should be changed and that it should have a greater market share,
according to its former editor-in-chief Hao Mingjian.
</P>
<P>
However, the new bimonthly will face some stiff competition
from seven other fashion magazines available like
Beijing's 'Look', Guangzhou's 'New Age Illustrated', and 'Elle',
China's first fashion magazine, which appeared a decade
ago.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Sales Drop Sharply in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- New vehicle sales hit their
lowest ebb in Kenya since the currency and inflation crisis of
1994, the East African Standard newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Motor Industry Association (KMI) recorded 838 sales
-- a drop of more than 35 percent on last year's monthly
averages, and the worst single month since October 1994 when only
522 units were sold.
</P>
<P>
The sector is geared to selling 1,000 units per month or more.
</P>
<P>
"January was an across-the-board downturn," said the KMI
Bureau, acknowledging that January's figures reflected a
generally unhappy and uncertain business picture.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage the industry is treating it as just a very
rough month, resulting from a combination of negative influences
-- not only a grim economic outlook but also other seasonal
factors such as the weather, unresolved political issues and cash
flow pressures on buyers facing a lot of start-of-year bills," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"No doom or boom conclusions can ever be drawn from a single
month. Cash flow positions should ease during February and there
will be a major promotional push in March and working hard for a
recovery," said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of March we will know to what extent today's
figures are just a bad patch, or a prognosis," it concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's sole university, the
University of Malawi, may be forced to close because of financial
crisis, The Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian newspaper quoted Africa Information Afrique as
reporting that the government has not yet provided 3.5 million
U.S. Dollars for the university to run up to March.
</P>
<P>
"The government has just kept quiet on the money requested.
From the look of things there is no sign that the government is
going to give us money," Africa Information Afrique quoted the
university's acting Finance Officer Yafat Malunga as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 1997/98 budget allocated 17 million dollars but the
government has only released 10 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are unable to pay monthly house rents, retirement
benefits, maintenance bills, administrating first-year entrance
exams as well as passage of expatriate staff," he said.
</P>
<P>
The academic year which was supposed to start in January has
been pushed to April. Last year the university opened seven
months late following a strike by lecturers who were demanding a
salary hike.
</P>
<P>
Malunga said the university owes the lecturers 446,000 dollars
in salary arrears following the 50 percent salary increase last
January.

<HEADLINE> Killer Disease Looms in Kenyan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) and Kenya's Health Ministry have sounded alert to medical
personnel and Nairobi residents over possible outbreak of the
Rift Valley Fever in the capital city of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The fast killing fever first emerged in the North Eastern
Province two months ago and has been making a steady spread
westwards and has lately been reported in Kajiado and Kiambu
districts neighboring Nairobi, Kenya Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The threat of an outbreak is looming as a result of Nairobi's
central position at a network of major roads, especially from the
east and south where the deadly disease has been reported among
the Somali, Borana and Maasai pastoral communities.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi's meat supply originates largely from the Maasai
districts of Narok and Kajiado and also from North Eastern
Province.
</P>
<P>
Meat and other animal products are major conduits for the
deadly virus causing the disease to the human species, which also
attacks and kills animals in 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
Medical personnel have been directed to be on the watchout for
the symptoms of the disease among incoming patients and to submit
fluid specimen from victims to the Africa Medical and Research
Foundation if and when they come across any.
</P>
<P>
However, so far no incident of the disease has been diagnosed
in the city, said Dr Mary Wangai, the Nairobi Provincial Medical
Officer of Health.
</P>
<P>
The medical staff are being briefed on preventive and
management measures including the wearing of gloves, masks and
other protective clothing to prevent against bodily contact with
body fluids of infected victims.
</P>
<P>
All workers at slaughterhouses are to adopt similar measures
and Ministry of Health is to improve surveillance on all meat,
milk and animal products.
</P>
<P>
The city dwellers have been advised to avoid the consumption
of improperly cooked meat and meat products.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
said Friday that he was impressed by the rapid infrastructural
development in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qiao and his wife Yu Wen visited infrastructure projects here
Friday morning in the company of Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and his wife Betty
Tung.
</P>
<P>
They made a tour of a container terminal in Kwai Chung, the
2.2-km Tsing Ma Bridge, the world's longest railway-highway
suspension bridge, and the new airport at Chek Lap Kok which is
scheduled to go into operation in July.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that Hong Kong is an international financial, trade,
shipping, tourist and information center and its great economic
achievements attracts worldwide attention. Infrastructural
construction has grown rapidly in recent years, laying a solid
foundation for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and development.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the SAR government under the leadership of Tung
Chee Hwa will surely bring Hong Kong's various advantages into
full play to further enhance its economic competitiveness and
maintain and promote Hong Kong's economic prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao came to Hong Kong Tuesday for a five-day visit. He has met
with Hong Kong deputies to the Eighth and Ninth NPC, principal

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Proposes Framework on E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia proposed Friday
the setting up of an ASEAN framework on Electronic Commerce
(E-Commerce) to provide the platform for a collective vision of
the emerging digital market place.
</P>
<P>
Such a regional initiative may be necessary to address the
prevalent issues brought about by the rapidly advancing "digital
economy" and E-Commerce, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said at the opening of the Roundtable on Electronic Communities in
Asia here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The framework would also provide the basis for discussions to
facilitate the development of an ASEAN position to catalyze the
growth of E-Commerce, Mahathir said, who reiterated his
government's commitment to support the growth of E-Commerce.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said although the growth of E-Commerce was essentially
private-sector driven, there was a need to monitor and regulate
its development to create the right environment for E-Commerce to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
Citing Malaysia's experience, he said Malaysia has developed an
Information Technology Agenda to support the country's vision to
become a fully-developed nation by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to invite our ASEAN neighbors as well as everyone
interested in ironing out possible wrinkles in the progress
towards the electronic world to join us in this endeavor," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said countries with established infrastructure to support
E-Commerce in terms of human resource and quantity of service
suppliers, as well as a bigger market share and better access to
the market, would have an edge over the others.
</P>
<P>
"However, the opportunity to develop E-Commerce also presents
itself to other countries in the ASEAN region which are in a good
position to leapfrog into the information age," he said.
</P>
<P>
Developments in E-Commerce spawn many related issues which
challenge common and established practices, laws and systems, he
said, adding that with this new digital economy, business
activities would be possible with minimal physical movement of
people, money and in many cases, products.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said many of the existing rules in today's economy
could no longer be applied in the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the fundamental requirement for the successful
take-off of E-Commerce was trust and the guarantee that
transactions can take place safely and securely.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore imperative to develop a proper system of
governance to manage this movement of information - and
knowledge-based resources with the growth of electronic commerce
globally," Mahathir said.

<HEADLINE> American Coach Stuns Chinese with Blunt Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- His smile is genial, but his
words are blunt.
</P>
<P>
"You are playing basketball, but you are no professional
basketballers," LeRoy M. Porter, the first-ever American invited
to coach a Chinese national basketball team, told his new charges
after watching their training session.
</P>
<P>
Porter, a former NCAA coach who holds a doctor degree in
philosophy, arrived last month at a training camp for the Chinese
under-20 women's team based in southern Chinese city Liuzhou. He
was also invited as adviser to the Chinese women's senior team
bound for the the world championship in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The American coach was unhappy with skills of his students.
</P>
<P>
"They worked hard even to do something very simple," he told
reporters here after he stayed with the team for a month.
</P>
<P>
In Liuzhou, Porter had to start his drilling session from
basketball basics.
</P>
<P>
"I taught them as though I was teaching children," said Porter,
who have four-year coaching experience in NCAA Championships in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I spent first two weeks on fundamentals to bring in backups so
that we were all speaking the same basketball language," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Porter did not blame the players. "The players have passed
the coaching. The Chinese coaching is behind the players," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese basketball official Kuang Lubin said that "Porter
didn't train the players only, he trained coaches as well."
</P>
<P>
China is desperate to improve its coaching level after its
national teams played poorly in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's national team, 10-time Asian champion, was
dethroned by South Korea in the Asian Championships in Riyadh and
thus lost the World Championship berth in Athens in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Their women counterparts, Asian champions for four straight
times, barely made the world championships after finishing behind
South Korea and Japan in the Asian championships.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese under-20 team are good at offence, but they have
no concept of team defence," Porter said. "I don't think any team
can win without knowing the importance of team defence."
</P>
<P>
Porter, who called himself a defence coach, said the Chinese
national senior teams had the same problem.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese under-20 team will compete in the Asian Youth
Championships in September.
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased to see big improvement when I left," Porter said
early this week. He headed home in Los Angles on Wednesday after
completing one-month coaching in Liuzhou.
</P>
<P>
"They changed and became players. They just move to another
level. They are not super yet, they're on the way," Porter added.
</P>
<P>
Porter's worry remains.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he was afraid these players might forget
what he taught them. "They are smart. They learn fast, but forget
fast," he said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Meets Brother of Indonesian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo met here today with Probosutejo, brother of Indonesian
President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
Probosutejo is a well-known banker and entrepreneur in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the
central government, Wu said that China has always paid attention
to the economic crisis in Southeast Asia and the economic
situation of Indonesia. He said that China is sympathetic to
Indonesia's fiscal difficulties.
</P>
<P>
However, China believes that the difficulties are temporary
ones, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that, after the pending general
election, Indonesia would restore and develop its economy at a
faster rate and would quickly overcome its financial difficulties
through its own efforts and help from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Wu said the Chinese government has offered assistance within
its capacity to Indonesia under the IMF framework. He said that
China's commitment on non-depreciation of its currency supports
other Southeast Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Probosutejo said that China's economic growth and the stability
it showed in the face of the Southeast Asia economic crisis was
impressive.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China would continue to assist
Indonesia's efforts to rehabilitate its economy and further
promote mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Indonesian government would stick to the
"one China" policy and would not have any official links with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Probosutejo is here at the invitation of the Chinese People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs.

<P>
HANGZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Since east China's Zhejiang
Province started the Spark Plan, a technological program, in 1986,
it has witnessed a rapid growth in agriculture and farmers'
training.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the 5,500 programs, which have the
purpose of industrializing agriculture and improving
township-level enterprises, have produced 80 billion yuan (9.6
billion U.S. dollars) in output value, 15 billion yuan in pre-tax
profits, and 1.8 billion U.S. dollars worth of export earnings for
the province.
</P>
<P>
The greater use of science and technology in the province's 150
villages in recent years has provided training for 1.3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Now each of the 150 pilot township enterprises has an annual
output value exceeding 100 million yuan and profits of more than a
million yuan. The province's 400 export-oriented companies each
have annual sales of at least 500,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Border Village Benefiting From Peaceful Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 relatives of a
farmer, Huang Ruiqi, came over from Vietnam for the wedding of his
daughter in the small city of Pingxiang in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, on the eve of the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the dramatic changes that have taken place in
the border village since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese
relations in 1992. One village official who was present at the
wedding, Yu Shengchun, said, "We are very happy to have a better
life thanks to the peaceful atmosphere along the border."
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the village of 2,167 people, which was plagued by
border conflicts and mines before 1992, lived fairly poor lives in
the past. But, by last year, they were making 2,310 yuan per
capita, a higher income than the regional or national average.
</P>
<P>
Pingxiang was given approval by the state in 1992 to open to
the outside world, and border trade took off. Now, 80 percent of
the households have something to do with the business, and more
than two-thirds of the labor force are involved in it.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, China began to remove the mines that were left in the
mountains near the village, so, local farmers could plant grain
and fruits there, and the results have been good. One farmer,
Huang Jian'an, earned more than 10,000 yuan in this way in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Villagers on both sides of the border are getting along quite
well, and it is not uncommon for them to intermarry. In recent
years, more than 100 Vietnamese women have married people from the
village, and half the village people have relatives in Vietnam, Yu
said.

The result fell four votes short of an absolute majority of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he accepted the
result as a clear view in favor of a particular republican model.
</P>
<P>
"The only common sense interpretation of this convention is,
firstly, that a majority of people have voted generically in favor
of a republic," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, that amongst the republican models the one that has
just got 73 votes is clearly preferred.
</P>
<P>
"Now, when you bind those two together it would be a travesty
in common sense terms of Australian democracy for that proposition
not to be put to the Australian people."
</P>
<P>
Howard has yet to decide exactly when the referendum will be
held.
</P>
<P>
The convention earlier Friday voted 89 to 52 in favor of
Australia becoming a republic, with 11 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who had promised that he would take any clearly
preferred view to a referendum, repeated his support for the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
"I honestly do not think Australia will be a better country if
we abandon the present constitutional system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he did not support the present system out of
nostalgia for a British past or for the singing of God Save the
Queen, but because an accident of history had given a coherent and
stable system of government.
</P>
<P>
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello, the third highest ranking
cabinet member, abstained, but Attorney-General Daryl Williams
said he would vote for change.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has offered to set up

</P>
<P>
This offer was made during a four-day conference here on South
Asian peacekeeping experience, which was organized by the

Thursday, that over the past decade, Bangladesh had gained
considerable experience in peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is an ideal place for such a regional center, he
said, referring to Dhaka's commitment to upholding the U.N.
charter and protect world peace.
</P>
<P>
Peacekeeping had to be seen in the global context as part of
the quest for enduring peace, security and development, the
foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
The conference were attended by military delegates from Canada,
China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines,
Russia, Laos, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Britain the United States and

Youth Daily."
</P>
<P>
The survey, "Reform situation and Social State of Mind," shows
that 79 percent of urban Chinese are confident the Chinese
government will maintain political stability in 1998. The survey
results also indicate that urban Chinese have bright expectations
for the country's development in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the level of confidence decreases in
the following order: 78 percent in social development; 74.4

<HEADLINE> Kenya Coffee to Hit New-Low due to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee production is
to fall to its lowest level in more than a decade due to heavy
rains since October and subsequent drought blamed on the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Coffee field would fall below 60,000 tons against an earlier
forecast of 65,000 tons, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Coffee traders said they expected no more than 42,000 tons
from the main crop and 18,000 tons from the "fly" mid crop for a
total of 60,000 tons. One trader even said it was possible
production would end up slightly above 51,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"You note that the figure of 65,000 tons was from the
ministry, not the (Kenya Coffee) board, which acknowledges a
production decline to 60,000 tons or below," one senior trader
said.
</P>
<P>
"If predicted drought is as intensive as they say it might be,
then we are looking at a drop of 25 percent from last year, which
would put Kenya's production at a figure around or just above
51,000 tons," added the trader with close links to the board.
</P>
<P>
Coffee ranks behind tea and tourism as Kenya's leading foreign
exchange earner. Heavy rains have already reduced production of
tea, sugar, maize, flowers, vegetables and sisal.

<HEADLINE> Railway Transport Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's trains averaged 2.49
million passengers per day in January, a rise of 7.6 percent over
1997.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, 663,000 were long-distance travelers (1,000
kilometers or farther), up 22.9 percent over 1997, according to
the latest statistics from the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
More people turned to highway or air travel for faster or more
comfortable service in recent years. The Ministry of Railways had
to adopt such measures as raising the speed limits on trains,
improving service and promoting sales to stop the decline of
railway transport.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the transport peak around Spring Festival when
large numbers of college students and non-local employees return
home for family reunions, the ministry added nearly 2,000
long-distance and 630 short-distance trains.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from Jan. 8 to 31, railways transported
61.37 million passengers, up 4 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 69,200 carloads of cargo were also transported by
rail last month, including 31,000 carloads of coal. Transportation
of other key materials such as oil, metallurgical materials,
timber, grain, fertilizer and fresh food also exceeded targets.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Drive In China's Poorest Region Paying Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 300,000 poor people
in China's Shanxi Province got away from poverty in 1997, a local
government official said here recently.
</P>
<P>
They live in 451 villages in the Luliang Mountain area, one of
18 very poor regions in China.
</P>
<P>
The number of people living below the poverty line (an annual
income of less than 500 yuan) in Shanxi has dropped to fewer than
500,000, and the provincial government is determined to help
improve the lives of all of these remaining impoverished people by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Officials at all levels played an important role in the poverty
drive. Zhang Luxu, the deputy Party secretary of Luliang
Prefecture, assisted Xinyi Township in building 10 ha of
greenhouses and in importing modern agronomic techniques. As a
result, each farm household in the township earned 10,000 yuan
last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Executive Committee Chairman
of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Abdul Rahman
said in Harare that Palestine was not satisfied by the current
stalemate over the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian special envoy made the statement after
meeting with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Thursday to
deliver a message from Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat on the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rahman, who is also in charge of refugees and displaced
Palestinians, said he was in Zimbabwe to solicit support from
Mugabe on the peace process and to appraise him, just as many of
his colleagues were appraising other world leaders, on the
deadlock in negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe is also current chairman of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Rahman said, "we want to draw the attention of the world to
how dangerous and grave the situation currently is in Palestine."
</P>
<P>
"All that we, as Palestinians, are calling for is for Israel
to implement the peace agreements signed by the previous
governments and recognize international treaties on the peace
process," said Rahman.
</P>
<P>
He said the political climate in Palestine was volatile and
could explode any time if sparked by even small incidents.
</P>
<P>
He also consulted Mugabe on what African governments could do
to lobby for a resumption of peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that as nobody in the world could guarantee peace in
the Middle East, the Palestinians would continue to struggle for
a negotiated settlement.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Currency Likely to Devaluate Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The high demand for foreign
exchange since the end of 1997 might cause a further depreciation
of Zambia's currency, Kwacha, the Citibank has predicated.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted the Citibank treasury letter as
projecting a Kwacha depreciation between four and six percent and
a rate of between 1575 Kwacha and 1595 Kwacha per U.S. Dollars by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"Indications are that tightness in the supply will continue
into February and we therefore project further depreciation of
the Kwacha," the publication said.
</P>
<P>
During last month, the Kwacha went down by about six percent
closing at 1500 Kwacha to a dollar and had it not been for Bank
of Zambia (BOZ) intervention through an injection of 23.6 million
dollars, the currency would have been weaker than it is.
</P>
<P>
According to BOZ, the central bank of the country, about 300
million dollars came in as foreign exchange inflows in 1997 from
various sources.
</P>
<P>
Against this, outlows amounted to 278 million dollars, leaving
a surplus of 22 million dollars which added to the reserves.
</P>
<P>
Of the total inflows, 54 percent went into debt servicing
highlighting the serious impact of the debt burden on the
country's foreign currency resources.

CHENGDU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Yanting County in
southwest China's Sichuan Province have found a convenient way to
get more detailed information about specific rural households.
</P>
<P>
The tool they're using is the computer at the county
Information Center, which holds background information on more
than 50,000 rural families and helps the county government make
decisions about how best to help farmers.
</P>
<P>
County and township officials have a responsibility to help
poor families get away from poverty, and their contacts and
successes are logged into computers as one way to assess their
work.
</P>
<P>
A year of this specific method has proven helpful. The village
of Shiqiao is one example. Out of 388 households, 312 have reached
the standard of a comfortably well-off life, and they say they
think the computers have a role in this.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistan Prime
Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif met this morning with Chinese
dignitaries from diplomatic, press and cultural communities here
just before departing for Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
Among the 90 people invited were He Luli, vice chairwoman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, and Pakistani visitors accompanying
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and He both spoke at the breakfast.
</P>
<P>
Sharif spoke highly of the Pakistan-China friendship and
briefed the dignitaries on Pakistan's domestic and foreign
policies.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Pakistan and China are old
friends, and "our time-tested friendship has remained strong,
vibrant and durable and mutual cooperation in various fields is
flourishing despite new developments in the regional and global
scenario and in the face of multiple pressures."
</P>
<P>
Sharif pointed out that his country "firmly supports China in
all its just causes including the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and
human rights."
</P>
<P>
China will continue to play an important role in promoting
peace and stability in the region, said Sharif, adding that "a
strong and prosperous China is a guarantee for peace, security and
stability not only in our region but also in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"We will constantly strive to usher in a partnership of
cooperation between our two countries into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister also answered questions raised by
Chinese scholars and experts.
</P>
<P>
He Luli said that China and Pakistan are close neighbors, and
bilateral beneficial cooperation based on mutual trust has had a
sound and smooth growth since the two countries established
diplomatic relations 47 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also cooperated fruitfully and effectively
in politics, the economy and trade, science and technology and
culture, she said. The Sino-Pakistani good-neighbor friendship
sets an example for state-to-state relations with different social
systems, she added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China will always be a trustworthy and reliable
friend of Pakistan no matter what changes may take place in the
international situation, she said: "We hope and believe that
through joint efforts from the two governments and their people,
bilateral cooperation in various fields will be further deepened
and bilateral relations will continue to be consolidated and
strengthened."

<HEADLINE> HK to Boost Spending on Education, Welfare, Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government is set to enlarge its
expenditure by a big margin on education, health, social welfare
and housing in the financial year of 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
K. C. Kwong, Secretary for the Treasury Thursday announced the
government's draft estimates of expenditure for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
"The detailed draft estimates provide the funds needed to
implement all the improvements to services and investments in our
infrastructure announced by the Chief Executive in his Policy
Address last October," the official told a press conference here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government expenditure for the new financial year will
total at 233 billion HK dollars (30 billion US dollars), including
171.7 billion HK dollars (22 billion US dollars) on the recurrent
account and 61.3 billion HK dollars (8 billion US dollars) for
capital projects.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said that education, health, social welfare and housing
as a whole would account for 55.3 percent of the total public
expenditure in the 1998-99 financial year.
</P>
<P>
Education is expected to consume 43 billion HK dollars (5.5
billion US dollars), up 6.3 percent in real term from the previous
financial year. The SAR government plans to use the extra
resources to improve Hong Kong's basic education programs, such as
promoting the use of information technology in schools and
training teachers.
</P>
<P>
Health will cut a slice of 29 billion HK dollars (3.7 billion
US dollars), an increase of 5.4 percent in real term, while
recurrent expenditure on social welfare will jump by 13.6 percent
to 24.9 billion HK dollars (3.2 billion US dollars) in the next
financial year.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the improvements in health and social welfare will be
focused on meeting the needs of the elderly," said the SAR
government official.
</P>
<P>
There is also a substantial increase in the capital expenditure
in housing, a policy area to which the SAR's Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa has given priority since he took the post. Kwong said:
"Spending by the Housing Authority alone on construction projects
will increase by 40 percent in real term to 22.3 billion HK
dollars (2.8 billion US dollars). The total public expenditure in
housing will nearly double in 1998-99."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary for Treasury added that in the new financial
year, the government would also inject 14.5 billion HK dollars
(1.8 billion US dollars) into the West Rail project, a major
infrastructure program to be completed in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Kwong stressed that the expenditure draft was made in line with
the established prudent financial management principle of ensuring
that government expenditure, over time, grows no faster than the
forecast trend growth rate of the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Forensic experts have so far
identified only 10 victims who perished in the crash of Cebu
Pacific Air Flight 387 in the southern Philippines 12 days ago.
</P>
<P>
This was released Friday by Jesus Dureza, head of the
Presidential Action Center which coordinates the search and
retrieval operations of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said the bodies of the victims were already claimed one
after the other by their relatives as of Thursday. The process of
identification is still undergoing.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that identifying the victims' body
parts retrieved from the crash site might take up to six months.
Victims relatives complained that the job is being done at a very
slow speed.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said the Presidential Action Center has set up a desk to
accept complaints filed by the relatives in relation to the
retrieval and identification of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated aircraft was carrying 99 passengers and five crew
members when it crashed in a mountain area in Misamis Oriental en
route from Manila to Cagayan de Oro city in the south. All people
aboard were believed dead.

<P>
WELLINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley indicated on Friday that her country favors a
peaceful solution to the issue concerning United Nations weapon
inspectors in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone discussion with U.S. President Bill Clinton

through the UN, to achieve a peaceful outcome, according to a
press statement from the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>

and complete the mandate given them by the UN Security Council in
1991.

At the same time, Clinton underlined his commitment to, and
support for efforts underway to resolve the matter by diplomatic

<P>
WELLINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley said Friday that New Zealand would like to see its
relations with China deepen in all areas, including the field of
defense.
</P>
<P>
She made the remark when meeting visiting Chinese Defense
Minister General Chi Haotian.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said New Zealand cherishes very much its friendly
relations with China. Although New Zealand is a small country and
China is a big one, they enjoy very good relations, she noted.
</P>
<P>
General Chi said he feels pleased and honored to be the first
Chinese Defense Minister ever to visit New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between the two countries have developed
rapidly since they established diplomatic relations in 1972. Last
year, the two countries marked the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of their diplomatic ties and leaders of the two
countries exchanged visits to enhance the relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Chi met with his New Zealand counterpart Max
Bradford, Foreign Minister Don Mckinnon and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, the two sides agreed that China and New Zealand
share identical or similar views on many major international
issues.
</P>
<P>
Each side pledged to make its own efforts towards maintaining
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Equipment For Beijing's New Subway Being Given Duty-Free Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's General Administration
of Customs and the Beijing Customs Office recently decided to
waive more than 200 million yuan (24 million US dollars) in import
duties on equipment to be used for Beijing's new subway.
</P>
<P>
The equipment includes subway cars, escalators, and signal
equipment being used on the new line under Chang'an Avenue.
</P>
<P>
Work on the 13.5-km line, which runs from Fuxingmen on the west
to Bawangfen on the east, began in 1989. It was originally planned
for completion in 1996, but because of capital shortfalls, only
half of work has been completed.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the project was designated as a part of 50th
anniversary celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic
of China, in 1999. Builders have said they will finish the
project in September of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Bank, China Construction Bank, and the
Beijing municipal government have raised more than seven billion
yuan (843 million US dollars) to cover the money shortage.
</P>
<P>
Because the line runs under Beijing's political, cultural, and
business centers, it is expected to become the busiest line in
Beijing, carrying an estimated 420 million persons a year by
2000.

<HEADLINE> Experts Concern over Frequent River Flow Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Experts met recently in
Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province, to find out
ways to resolve the increasingly frequent stoppage of the Yellow
River, the second longest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Frequent droughts and excessive use of water by industries and
farming have greatly reduced the water volume of the giant river.
</P>
<P>
Since the first flow stoppage happened in 1972, the frequency
of stoppage has been on the rise. Last year, the river in the
lower reaches dried up 13 times with a total break of 266 days.
</P>
<P>
The rampant sabotages have brought in heavy economic losses to
the provinces in the lower reaches. In 1997, the stoppage caused
long-lasting droughts for 1.3 million ha. of farmlands in Henan
and Shandong provinces. Shandong alone suffered losses worth about
13.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee have submitted to
higher authorities proposals on the management of the Yellow River
water volume and the timely control on the water volume of the
Yellow River for official approval.

SHIJIAZHUANG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hebei Branch of
China's Construction Bank made 560 million yuan in profits for
1997, more than double of the 1996 figure, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The branch loaned 6.3 billion yuan to 99 key enterprises and
projects in power, transportation, telecommunications, civil
aviation, and railways, accounting for 86 percent of loans
approved for 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also has loan deals with five large enterprises like the
Tangshan Rolling Stock Plant and Liantong Company.
</P>
<P>
To cut financial risks to a minimum, local banks evaluated 5.7
billion yuan in loans for 186 projects, 51 of which, involving 630
million yuan, were vetoed after further study.
</P>
<P>
The branch increased its market competition by a more judicious
use of loans and raising the discount rate.
</P>
<P>
With its new provincial computer network, the bank has issued
219,000 Dragon Cards, which have done 15 billion yuan in

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Attracts More Direct Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>

<P>
KIEV, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is expected to absorb
direct foreign investment worth one billion U.S. dollars, a 0.24-
billion-dollar increase over last year, a senior official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pomah Lunek, director of the Department of National
Reconstruction and Development, told a press conference that in
1998, foreign loans coming to Ukraine under the sponsorship of the
Ukrainian government will be 0.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lunek attributed the achievement partly to the increased
transparency in privatization of large enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1992, under the sponsorship of the government,
Ukraine has set up 13 channels for attracting foreign investment
and has already received a total of 2.7 billion dollars in loan.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is now negotiating with Japan, Turkey, Poland, Britain,
Denmark, Norway and Finland for special credit to boost its
exports.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Gas Dealers Protest Against VAT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Cars, motorbikes and other
vehicles lined up on Friday for fuels as an indefinite strike
involving gas dealers has been called in Nepal to protest against
the value added tax (VAT), which is to become fully operational
the same day in the country.
</P>
<P>
Long queues were seen in the morning before the gas stations in
the capital as the Nepal Petroleum Dealers Association (NPDA) has
made the call for an indefinite strike from Friday. Some gas
stations are just shut up.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the gas dealers have protested against
the VAT. On November 17, 1997, one day after the VAT was
introduced formally in the country, they refused to buy petroleum
products from the state-run oil corporation, causing an upsurge of
demand and ensuing long queues.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the NPDA has demanded waiver of the VAT on
the petroleum products excluding lubricant, but the government
refused.
</P>
<P>
NPDA officials said they were ready to withdraw the strike call
if the government exempts petroleum dealers from billing their
sales.
</P>
<P>
As negotiations between the business community and the
government came to a deadlock, the Federation of Nepalese Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) has called for a closing of
business in the country from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although the VAT was introduced last year, it was not enforced
at all places and for all sectors for a grace period of three
months.
</P>
<P>
However, the row between the government and the business
community has intensified during this period, which has severely
affected the VAT registration.
</P>
<P>
In a public notification, the FNCCI said it would not negotiate
with the government over the VAT unless octroi is abolished.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sharma has promised to abolish octroi once the
VAT is fully operational.

<HEADLINE> American Ice Hockey Player Sent Home Due to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Ice hockey player Shawn
McEachern of the United States has been sent home due to lower back
strain, Team USA general manager Lou Lamoriello announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Langenbrunner will fill the vacant place in the team which
will play Sweden in its opening game at the ice hockey Dream
Tournament at the Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
However, Langenbrunner will not arrive in Nagano in time for the
opening match on Friday or for Saturday's game against Belarus.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the injury to Shawn's lower back has not progressed
to the point that our medical personnel felt he could be cleared to
play," Lamoriello said. "We are fortunate, however, to have a player
with the skill and ability that Jamie Langenbrunner brings to our
team. Jamie has had an outstanding season thus far for the Dallas
Stars, and we are proud to welcome him to the U.S. team."
</P>
<P>
In only his second full season with the Stars and fourth overall in
professional ice hockey, Langenbrunner ranks fourth on the team in
scoring with 42 points in 56 games. He is third on the team in
power-play goals with six and fourth in game-winning goals with four.
</P>
<P>
Langenbrunner was honoured as the Star' Rookie of the Year last
season after registering 39 points in 76 regular-season games. He
finished the season ranked fourth in assists, sixth in scoring and
tied for ninth in goals among all rookies in the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
Langenbruner began his professional playing career in 1994-95,
appearing in two regular-season games for the Stars and 11 playoff
contests for the International Hockey League's Kalamazoo K-Wings. He
split time between Dallas and the IHL's Michigan K-Wings in 1995-96
before playing his first full season with the stars in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Langenbrunner's previous international playing experience includes
competing for two United States National Junior Teams (1994 and 1995)
at the World Junior Championships.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Urged to Ratify Nuclear Test-ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
Thursday urged the Senate to approve a global nuclear test ban
treaty in 1998, saying it would put a brake on the arms race and
deter other nations from developing such weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington,
U.S. Secretary Federico Pena said the treaty would improve his
country's ability to "detect and deter nuclear explosive testing"
by other nations.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to ensure that other countries do not test," he
said, "is for us to lead by example and ratify the accord, thereby
encouraging other countries to do so."
</P>
<P>
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was concluded in late
1996, has been signed by 148 countries so far, but only eight
countries have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
Pena said a special conference of the nations that have
ratified the treaty would be held late next year to encourage more
nations to sign, and the U.S. risked being excluded if the Senate
does not ratify the accord.
</P>
<P>
The treaty needs to be approved by a two-thirds majority of the
Republican-controlled Senate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Appeal for Support for IMF Package Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
Thursday joined hands to appeal for backing of an 18 billion U.S.
dollar funding package for the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The two men told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
approval of the funds would send a badly needed signal to the
world that the United States was prepared to do its part to ensure
the stability of the global financial system.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan pointed out that it was critical in the current Asian
crisis to support efforts of the IMF to "restore trust in the
system."
</P>
<P>
The IMF has already committed 100 billion dollars in emergency
loans for South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand for stabilizing
their economies that have been hit hard since last summer by
plunging currencies and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
The 18 billion dollars being sought from Congress approval
would not be used for those rescues but would replenish IMF
reserves so that the IMF could handle future crises.
</P>
<P>
"If the crisis was to spread more broadly to emerging markets
throughout the globe, which we are all working hard to avoid, then
American workers and businesses could be far more severely
affected," Rubin stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rubin and Greenspan also expressed similar view that poor
economic policies were the cause of the currency and market
meltdowns in Asia. The only way to restore investor confidence was
for the countries to follow the IMF reform programs, they argued.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Senate committee endorsed the view that the
IMF should be supported to take the lead in the Asian crisis,
based on the success of a 50 billion dollar bailout for Mexico's
economy in earlier 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the committee chairman, Senator Jesse Helms expressed that
he wanted reforms to ensure greater openness in the 182-nation
institution, including allowing the General Accounting Office,
Congress' investigating arm, to review IMF books.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the biggest obstacle to
congressional approval of the new IMF package appeared to be not
in the Senate, but the House, where anti-abortion forces are
vowing to defeat the proposal unless the administration
compromises on an unrelated abortion issue.

<HEADLINE> Most Applicants in S.Lankan Pass Written Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Out of about 104,000 people
applying for driving licenses and who underwent written tests in
Sri Lanka last year, some 100,000 have obtained required marks,
Commissioner of Motor Traffic D.S. Edirisinghe said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The written test was introduced by the Department of Motor
Traffic on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Those who undergo the test must obtain a minimum of 75 marks to
be eligible to have their driving tests.
</P>
<P>
Edirisinghe said after the introduction of the written test,
many applicants came with a good knowledge of the highway code of
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
To get fully prepared for the test, many applicants spent a
certain amount of time reading the Highway Code Book, issued by
the department. A total of 50,000 copies were sold last year.
</P>
<P>
The test is a major step the department has taken to improve
highway safety. It is also used to ensure every driving license is
issued to the right person who is qualified.
</P>
<P>
Each applicant must submit his birth certificate and national
identity card before he or she is allowed to participate in the
written test and those who fail will not be allowed to proceed for
driving test on road.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The grand exhibition featuring
Sri Lanka's progress and achievements since its independence 50
years ago has attracted a record number of visitors since it

<HEADLINE> South Korean Trade Unions Cancel Plan of General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Confederation of
Trade Unions (KCTU), the second largest labor union of the
country, has decided to cancel a general strike scheduled for
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by KCTU Emergency Committee late Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
"We made the decision in consideration of public opinions
expressing concerns over the repeat of the national economic
crisis," Dan Byung-ho of the committee said earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the cancellation doesn't mean an approval for
large-scale dismissals, Dan said, adding that KCTU will spare no
time to prevent the National Assembly from passing a bill of
legalizing mass layoffs at the ongoing special session and ask for
the step-down of conglomerate heads and donation of their private
assests to the laid-off.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from labor, capital and government last week
signed an accord to legalize mass layoffs. Analysts predicted that
at least one million South Koreans will lose their job this year.
</P>
<P>
But, KCTU, which formed a new leadership after ousting leaders
responsible for signing the agreement, Monday threatened to stage
a general strike to boycott the accord, under which, capital could
dismiss workers when businesses face "emergency situation" such as
financial troubles, merger and acquisition.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government announced on Wednesday that it
would deal hard with "illegal" labor acts.
</P>
<P>
Amid a possible strike since Monday, the Seoul stock market has
showed a downward trend and plunged more than 20 points to below
500 points Thursday morning while the won depreciated to 1,620 won
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which agreed last
December to grant 57 billion U.S. dollars in loans to South Korea
to help bail out the country from the financial crisis, has warned
of a possible reoccurrence of the foreign currency crisis if the
nation's labor unions walk out.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed with the IMF for the bailout loans,
South Korea has to open its markets, shut down its ailing
financial institutions and legalize mass layoffs in the course of
economic restructuring.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Produce Cleaner Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Stated will
produce cars that will reduce 70 percent of smog-causing emission,
under a program formally launched by Clinton administration on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of emission "will be the equivalent of taking
10.5 million cars off the road by 2001, protecting the health of
millions of Americans," Vice President Al Gore told officials from
the Big Three domestic automakers, Ford, Chrysler and General
Motors, and 10 foreign automakers at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The cars will be sold this fall in eight eastern states and the
District of Columbia as 1999 models and will be sold nationwide
beginning with 2001 models.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the new models of
cars will produce 70 percent less smog-causing hydrocarbons and 50
percent less nitrogen oxides.
</P>
<P>
Car emissions are a large portion of smog in the country. In
some states, vehicles cause about 30 to 43 percent of the ozone
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The 10 foreign automakers who have agreed to the plan are
Honda, Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Volvo
and Rolls Royce.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Denies Possibility of Pegging Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A Thai central bank official
has firmly denied market speculation that the bank would establish
a currency board and fix exchange rates for the baht.
</P>
<P>
Duangmanee Vongpradhip, director of the bank governor's office,
said Thursday that policy makers had never considered changing the
float system of the baht which was introduced on July 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
She also denied reports that the central bank had discussed the
currency board issue with officials of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IMF director for Asia-Pacific, Hubert Neiss,
also denied any discussion about a currency board with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
As for Indonesia's plan to establish a currency board, the
central bank official said it "did not affect Thailand at all."
</P>
<P>
Speculation that Thailand was considering a currency board
contributed to the sharp rise of baht in the offshore market
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The baht jumped to as high as 41.5 to the dollar, closing at
43.1. However, it lost ground Thursday, closing at 45.35 after
opening at 43.8.

SOFIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Four researchers trapped on a
floe near the island of Livingston in Antarctica have been rescued
by a Uruguayan helicopter, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>

The four polar researchers were reportedly on an expedition to
Mount Murev, which is located 20 kilometers from their base, to
study a dead volcano and residue rocks.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a team of glaciologists had descended into a
30-meter crack in the Perounika Glacier to study the effect of
global warming.
</P>

All members of the Bulgarian expedition were reportedly in good
health and anxious to continue their research, which is scheduled

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Surround 600 LTTE Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Government troops involved in
Operation Jayasikuru (Certain of Victory) had surrounded about 600
Tamil rebels in Mankulam town in Northern Sri Lanka, the official
newspaper Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a spokesman for the Northern Brigade Command
as saying that the siege followed days of fierce fighting between
the two sides along the Mullaitivu jungle and Mankulam, both of
strategic importance for military operations.
</P>
<P>
The "strong contingent of terrorists" who continued their
mortar fire since Tuesday on Jayasikuru troops, had stopped their
fire from dawn Thursday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that was a clear indication that the troops had
effectively prevented any rebel reinforcement from reaching the
trapped rebels. The rebels were also badly in need of food and
ammunitions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ground troops halted their operation on Thursday afternoon
while the Air Force continued bombardment at rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
There has been heavy fighting in the north since the beginning
of the month.
</P>
<P>
On February 1, the troops said they killed more than 300 rebels
in Kilinochchi, Northern Province when the Tigers launched a
sudden attack.
</P>
<P>
Fighting along the Kilinochchi defense line continued the
following days as government troops tried to regain a section of
the one kilometer defense line lost to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Security forces on Thursday also attacked a truck carrying 11
Tamil rebels north of Mankulam, killing all of them and destroying
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have
been fighting for a separate state of their own in the north and
east of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Most of the major battles in recent months were reported in the
north, where troops of Jayasikuru Operation have been moving inch
by inch in the northern jungle area since last May, trying to open
a land route to the Jaffna peninsula.

BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai hopes that Norway would increase its aid to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell
Mange Bondevik on Thursday, Chuan first asked Norway to increase
bilateral trade and investment to help alleviate Thailand's
economic woes.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also hoped that the European country would resume its
technical assistance to Thailand, which was suspended in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic issues, Chuan urged Norway to send experts to
help Thailand formulate legislation on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also concluded an agreement on the exchange of
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also asked Norway to back Thailand's bid to host a
regional training center for anti-personnel mine clearance.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Friday said that Bondevik hoped that Thailand
could play a significant role in easing the political situation in
Cambodia which is due to hold a general election in July.
</P>
<P>
Norway Thursday offered about 3 million kroner (160,000 U.S.
dollars) to help Thailand deal with Myanmar refugees residing

<HEADLINE> HIV Discoverer: "Triple-drug" Therapy Efficiency Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- French researcher Luc
Montagnier who discovered in 1983 the human immune-deficiency
virus (HIV) said here Thursday that the efficiency of the
so-called "Triple-drug" therapy is not verified yet.
</P>
<P>
The efficiency of the Triple-drug, which it's said halts HIV
from replicating in an infected person, is long debated.
</P>
<P>
Montagnier said that the virus keeps itself latent in some
places and a way to restore human immunological system has not
been found.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the AIDS outlook in the world here, the scientist
said that some 16,000 persons are infected with the HIV every day
and the number of the infected has reached 35 million.
</P>
<P>
However, Montagnier said, with no cure for AIDS found yet,
investigation, prevention and treatment are the only way to combat
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The French scientist also proposed establishing a regional
center in Uruguay for AIDS investigation, which needs an initial
outlay of half a million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Invited by the Spanish Association of Uruguay, the scientist
has met with Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti.

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees to Relax Aid Condition for Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) agreed to relax a key condition of Thailand's economic
bailout which requires the country to post a budget surplus in
fiscal 1998, IMF Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will be now allowed to have a budget deficit of 1-2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the fiscal year ending
on September 30, Neiss said.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF's previous criterion, Thailand must
achieve a budget surplus equivalent to 1 percent of GDP, or about
69 billion baht (1.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The IMF will also allow Thailand to ease its high domestic
interest rates in a bid to guard against speculative attacks on
the beleaguered baht "sometime after the currency market
stabilizes," Neiss said.
</P>
<P>
Neiss explained that an improvement in Thailand's economic
outlook had prompted the IMF to allow an easing of the conditions
of its 17.2 billion dollar bailout package.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Thai economy had slowed down to such an
extent since the IMF program began that a continued stringent
austerity regime may trigger a new economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said he was "satisfied" with the revised conditions which
will restore confidence to the country's battered financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
He also gave a thumbs up to the new government's efforts to
avert economic meltdown, saying the economy "would not return to
the same state as it was, as the government has control of the
financial system and is creating stability."
</P>
<P>
The IMF's move came amid the publication of the world monetary
body's second quarterly review of Thailand's progress in applying
its rescue package.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is expected to allow the unblocking of the third
segment of the 17.2 billion dollar package extended to Thailand.

KIEV, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The decision to close down the
Russian military bases on the Georgian territory is made on
evidence that they have been used in the assassination attempts on
the Georgian president.
</P>
<P>
This was said Thursday by visiting Speaker of the National
Assembly of Georgia Zurab Zhvaniya who is here on a two-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
Zhvaniya cited evidence on how the Russian bases have been used
in the assassination attempts on President Eduard Shevardnadze,
who survived a second time in three years on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest incident, lawmakers at the Georgian
parliament alleged that "the act of terrorism has been planned by
outside forces" and demanded an inquiry at Russian bases and
airports in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
However, this has provoked dissatisfaction from the Russian
side.

<P>
CHENGDU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A new system of employment for
police in Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province, has
broken the "iron rice bowl" so that police who are unqualified can
lose their jobs at any time.
</P>
<P>
Since the new system was implemented two years ago, some 963
policemen have been appointed to positions at various levels in
the city's public security bureau, and 117 who were found to be
unqualified have been dismissed from office.
</P>
<P>
The average age of the police officials has dropped three years
and all the new police officials have at least two year's of
college education.
</P>
<P>
Local policemen are also becoming more dedicated in their work,
and the number of cases solved by the city's public security
offices in 1997 increased 37 percent from the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Equity Investments Surge in Philippines in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite the debilitating
effects of the currency crisis, corporate investments by
newly-established firms rose by 41 percent to 59.7 billion pesos
(1.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the Philippines last year, local
press reports said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said data from the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) showed that new investments in foreign and local
companies did not dwindle during the third quarter right after the
onset of the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fresh equity infusion from established companies also increased
for most part of the year. During the second half, investments in
existing companies grew by an average 14 percent, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
The figures led the SEC to conclude that the Asian currency
crisis failed to dampen foreign direct investors' interest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good indication that confidence of the international
community in the Philippine fundamentals still remains," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists did not agree, arguing that foreign
direct investments in the country dropped by some 40 percent last
year due to the currency crisis.

Reigning European champions Olympiakos of Greece 60-53 in a group
E men's EuroLeague basketball match in Split, Croatia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Greek side are still likely to win the group but Split's

Split led from the beginning, building a nine-point lead by
halftime (40-31).
</P>
<P>
Olympiakos, playing without their top scorer Arturas
Karnishovas, were unable to break Split's pace in the second half
and found themselves trailing by 17 points three minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
The Split side, spearheaded by veteran Croatian international
Vladan Alanovic who topped the scoreboard with 14 points, kept the
game under control, and a 10-0 run by Olympiakos in the final
minutes only managed to reduce the deficit to seven points.

Trade Organization at an early date, and it also observes the "one
China policy." In addition, the Danish government has been
encouraging more enterprises to invest in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the two-way trade between the two nations has been
steadily increasing and that economic and technological
cooperation has been improved. China has also adopted new
preferential policies to attract foreign investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said he is confident that future economic relations between
China and Denmark will be bright.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on the south-east Asian financial
crisis. Peterson said he believed the Asian economy will continue
to be energetic and competitive in the world.

BUENOS AIRES, February 12 (Xinhua) -- About 11,500 HIV virus
carriers contracted AIDS in Argentina by the end of 1997, the

BUDAPEST, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister
Kovacs Laszlo said on Thursday that his country is willing to join
the possible international military actions against Iraq if a
political solution can not be found to the crisis arising out of
the United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Kovacs said the Hungarian
government will submit a draft resolution regarding its decision
to parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Hungary's participation in the military
action means that it will allow the use of its air space and
military airports, and in the event of casualties, it will send
medical teams to concerned regions.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister clarified that Hungary's willingness to
take part in potential military action against Iraq has nothing to
do with its entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A recent study of 5,138 urban
residents in China found that more people are satisfied with the
country's opening-up.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was done by the Horizon Market Survey and
Analysis Company, showed that 34.6 percent of those questioned say
the opening-up is good and should continue, an increase of 14
percentage points from 1995, and that 24.9 percent believe the
opening-up hasn't gone far enough, and 11 percent think it's gone
too far, while 21.1 percent think it's not balanced.
</P>
<P>
The increasing satisfaction with the opening-up is a result of
the further opening in the central and western parts of the
country, and to the better use of foreign funds, the researchers
conclude.
</P>
<P>
The greatest worries, they say, are unhealthy tendencies like
drug addiction and Aids coming from foreign countries, the
infiltration of foreign culture, and the brain drain.

been removed from a spring in the town of Dali in south China's
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
They were thrown by tourists into the spring in Butterfly
Spring Park, a popular tourist resort. The coins were removed by
park employees while cleaning the spring.
</P>
<P>
Most are five-fen, two-fen, and one-fen coins, and there are
various commemorative and old coins.
</P>
<P>
There is a block of stone in the middle of the spring with a
cleft and many tourists try to throw coins into it with the idea
that it will bring them good luck, according to park keepers.
</P>
<P>
Other tourists just toss coins into the spring and enjoy
watching them drift slowly down.
</P>
<P>
In April and May, thousands of butterflies can be seen in the
trees around the spring and skimming its surface.

<HEADLINE> Overseas-Backed Businesses Becoming Shanghai's Key Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-financed businesses
have become Shanghai's major exporters as more and more overseas
investors are putting their investment into production projects.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Shanghai Municipal Committee of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation disclosed that Shanghai earned
14.724 billion U.S. dollars from exports last year, a rise of
11.22 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
And 5.2 billion U.S. dollars were made by overseas-financed
enterprises. Specialized foreign trade companies made 4.3 billion
U.S. dollars in earnings from exports in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-financed businesses contributed 80 percent to the
city's export increase in 1997. Their exports stood at only one
billion U.S. dollars five years ago, accounting for 15 percent of
the city's total exports of the time.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign trade officials attributed the export increase by
overseas-financed ventures to the rapid growth of such businesses,
and to a fair product mix and an advantageous marketing network
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai approved the establishment of 1,802 overseas-financed
projects last year, of which 994 are industrial projects involving
a contractual use of 3.043 billion U.S. dollars of overseas funds,
accounting for 57.19 percent of the city's total investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the municipality had altogether
approved the establishment of 17,500 overseas-financed businesses
which had employed 948,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to further improve services for overseas-backed
enterprises in operation, and continue to offer export-oriented
overseas-backed businesses preferential treatment in taxation in a
bid to encourage them to export more.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city plans to attract more overseas-backed
enterprises to the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone in Pudong and boost
the zone's storage and trading functions by way of developing the
processing trade.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reiterates Opposition to Military Action Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev Thursday reiterated his country's opposition to military
strikes against Iraq, and categorically denied that Russia had
negotiated the sale of equipment to Iraq to make proscribed
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference with U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen, Sergeyev stressed that Iraq must comply with
U.N. resolutions, but compliance should be achieved only through
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said if the U.S. turned to force to settle the Iraqi
crisis, it would hurt and set back bilateral ties between Russia
and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to relate to you our deep concern over the
possible prospects of Russian-U.S. relations in the military
field, especially if military actions are taken," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also denied a report in The Washington Post on
Thursday that U.N. weapons inspectors had found documents prepared
by Iraqi officials on Russian-Iraqi negotiations. The negotiations
reportedly would have led to a multimillion dollar deal for Russia
to sell equipment to Iraq to make biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cohen acknowledged that Russia and the U.S. are divergent over
how to settle the Iraqi problem, but added, "the strength of the
underlying relationship is paramount. Where we have differences,
we will work out our differences."
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirm U.S. resolve to use force against Iraq, but
ruled out the possibility of using nuclear weapons against the
Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here Wednesday on a two-day visit. It is his
first visit to Russia as Pentagon chief.

<HEADLINE> EU Promises to Help Deal With Thai Social Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has pledged
to help solve Thailand's social problems through collaboration
with non-governmental organizations, according to Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
The EU is trying to play a more active role in helping Thailand
solve its economic problems including social side-effects, Surin
was quoted as saying by the local press Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU was considering such financial facilities as the
European Investment Bank and the Bank for Development and
Reconstruction to help support Thailand's social programs with
collaboration between European and Thai NGOs, but the amount and
modalities had not yet been worked out, Surin said after meeting
with EU representatives Thursday led by British Ambassador James
Hodge, whose country currently holds the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Surin also asked the EU to revise the
dumping allegations of Thai agricultural and industrial products.
The EU has imposed anti-dumping duties on 13 items of Thai
exports.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed how to move forward cooperation in
the Asia-Europe meeting, to be held for the second time in April
in London.

<HEADLINE> Decision to Send Troops to Gulf Questioned in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of Democratic Left
Alliance deputies in the Polish Parliament are challenging the
government's legal right to send troops to the Persian Gulf to
participate in a possible U.S.-led military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement issued on Wednesday, the Polish
government said it is prepared to send appropriate supportive
troops to the gulf if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement, the deputies said that what is in
question is not the pretext used by the government to make the
decision, but the way to make it, the Forum daily reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Poland is neither a signatory to any international treaty or
law that could justify the deployment of its forces outside its
territory under the country's constitution, nor is it an official
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), they said.
</P>
<P>
Even if Poland were an official NATO member, the decision to
send troops to the gulf could remain questionable because the
U.S.-proposed military strike against Iraq is not a joint action
of the treaty organization, they added.
</P>
<P>
As to Poland's participation in the 1991 gulf war, the deputies
said the decision was legitimate because Poland did so in
compliance with resolutions adopted by the United Nations at that
time.
</P>
<P>
In the current case, however, with three of its permanent
members, namely Russia, China and France, categorically opposing
the use of force, the U.N. Security Council did not authorize any
member to launch a military strike against Iraq, they said.
</P>
<P>
The deputies also accused the government of making the decision
to send troops without consulting the president and other state
offices.

around February 26 when a new moon just arrives.

They said the next new moon, on Feb. 26, creates a potential
window of opportunity for a possible U.S. air strike on Iraq as a
concealing dark sky, with little or no visible crescent, is the
best time to launch an attack.

<P>
"There are three or four nights of darkness on either side of
the new moon," said Geoff Chester, a spokesman for the U.S. Naval
Observatory. "It certainly helps to have no moon. When it's full,
it illuminates the sky." (US-Iraq-Showdown)

<HEADLINE> East China's Shandong to Improve Real Estate Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
will intensify the housing reform as part of its efforts to uplift
its real estate market, sources from the Provincial Construction
Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
The province has recently put forward a plan of establishing an
open-market housing market catering to the demands of ordinary
families and a economic housing market which will provide flats to
families with low incomes.
</P>
<P>
It has also decided to provide all urban families in towns and
cities with flats with good facilities by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal, the province has started to practice new
housing reform measures including the establishment of a public
accumulative fund for housing, abolition of welfare housing
distribution, and adding housing subsidies in workers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the reality that many open-market flats
remain idle and unsold, the province urged real estate developers
to sell some of the open-market flats at lower prices to families
with low and medium incomes.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province has also adjusted taxes to bring
down prices of open-market flats and has vigorously expanded
financial business on housing such as offering mortgage loans to
individuals in a bid to support housing consumption.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Ban Protects Whitebait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Taihu Lake, one the country's
five largest inland lakes, will continue tightening its management
during the half-year moratorium on fishing this year to protect
whitebait.
</P>
<P>
From February 1 to August 31, fishing will be suspended in this
lake in east China's Jiangsu province, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Artificially fertilized roe will be put into the lake to help
restore the whitebait resource, a profitable species with great
value which have deteriorated in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Taihu Lake has introduced the fishing ban every year since
1984. But lured by high profits, over-fishing became more and more
serious, which made production plunge in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Pollution and drought were also reasons for the reduction in
whitebait.
</P>
<P>
Annual production of whitebait decreased to 540 tons in 1995
and to 500 tons in 1996, compared with 1,500 to 2,000 tons during
the 1985-94 period.
</P>
<P>
The production rebounded to more than 900 tons last year,
nearly double that of the previous year, thanks to the
strengthened efforts.
</P>
<P>
Other large inland lakes such as Chaohu Lake in Anhui province
also have such protective measures.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will put more
emphasis on the information, biochemical, and new materials
industries, Mayor Xu Kuangdi told the first session of the 11th
Municipal People's Congress yesterday.
</P>
<P>
These three industries will be economic pillars at the start of
the next century. Shanghai has started its information industry by
becoming an information hub and it will continue to focus on
software and computer services, and develop a new generation of
network computers and artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's growing biochemical and pharmaceutical industries
will become more dependent on biotechnology, the mayor said. There
will be more investment in new pharmaceutical products,
agricultural chemicals, organic foods, and
environmentally-friendly drugs.
</P>
<P>
Xu stressed that hi-tech industries are the key to Shanghai's
economic growth. Research institutes are expected to work more
closely with businesses, and by the year 2000, the majority of
Shanghai's large enterprises should have their own product
research facilities.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Island Development Zone Establishes Chemical Center (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A chemical production center is
under construction in the Yangpu Economic Development Zone in
China's southern island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The zone is on the northwest part of the island, about 140 km
from the provincial capital of Haikou. Offshore areas near the
zone are rich in natural gas. Some basins south of the island have
natural gas reserves estimated at 251 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
China's Central Government has given its support to the
center. In March of 1996, Premier Li Peng visited Yangpu and
encouraged Hainan's economic development through similar
industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) announced last
March that it would put 15.5 billion yuan (1.87 billion US
dollars) into the country's largest modern chemical fertilizer
project at the Yangpu Zone.
</P>
<P>
The entire project will mean building six offshore oil
platforms, drilling 32 wells, and laying a 243-km gas pipeline to
Yangpu. It will also mean building two of China's largest
fertilizer plants, each with an annual production capacity of
450,000 tons of ammonia and 1.6 million tons of urea.

<HEADLINE> Economists: China's Grain Output to Reach Last Year's Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Leading economists here
forecast that China's grain output in 1998 will reach the level of
last year.
</P>
<P>
They drew the conclusion at a high-profile meeting held
recently by the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
attended by experts from both State Council departments and
research institutes, including the State Planning Commission and
the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China's grain output in 1997 reached 490 billion kilograms, the
second biggest harvest in history.
</P>
<P>
Experts are optimistic about the overall grain production in
spite of the fact that summer grain has been affected by bad
weather early this year.
</P>
<P>
They held that China's grain production capability has
been remarkably improved, and a balanced market demand and supply
has been basically achieved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, sharp fluctuations of grain prices has become an
past tense term, thanks to the tightened macro-control imposed by
the government.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned the government and the related departments
to be aware of the possible decrease of grain output this year as
the existing production capability is not strong enough and the
supply and demand relationship is still weak.
</P>
<P>
They held that importance should be attached to the reform of
state-owned grain enterprises and the circulation system,
introducing market competition, developing grain warehouse and
better coordinate the country's internal and foreign trade.

The China Everbright Group by last year had purchased 20
percent of Kumagai-Gumi (HK) Ltd., a major land developer in
Yangpu, showing the support of Hong Kong businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission approved construction of the
second phase at Yangpu Port and a glass project, which had an
investment of 777 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest administrative body, has
also approved a Singapore-financed pulp mill in the zone, which
will have an annual production capacity of 600,000 tons, and cost
10.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A number of other projects like a high-speed wire rod plant
costing 450 million yuan, and a rice processing factory costing
170 million yuan are being undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure in the development zone is also being
completed. An expressway linking Yangpu and Haikou is open, and
one from Yangpu to Sanya on the southern tip of the island is
being built.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of Yangpu Port will add three berths for ships
of 35,000 DWT and will allow it to handle 2.2 million tons of
cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
On December 8, 1997, representatives of the Provincial
Government, CNOOC, Kumagai-Gumi (HK), and the Special Economic
Zone Office of the State Council met in Beijing and agreed to give
preferential treatment to land, water, power, and gas to people
who invest in major industrial projects like chemical fertilizers
and pulp in the Yangpu Economic Development Zone.

<HEADLINE> China Trying to Make Better Use of Water in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Noted scientist Chen Mengxiong
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has concluded that more
efficient use of water resources can improve agricultural
production greatly in China, after comparing the use of water
resources in Beijing and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Chen explains that Beijing's amount of arable land is similar
to that of Israel, which has serious water-deficiency problems,
and it is one of the most efficient users of water resource in the
world. Beijing's use of fresh water for agriculture is 2.4 times
that of Israel, and its agricultural output is less than
Israel's. Total output value could be increased almost three
times, from the current 3.43 billion yuan (413 million US dollars)
to 9.57 billion yuan if Beijing's use of water resources for
agriculture were similar to Israel's.
</P>
<P>
Improved irrigation techniques and water use methods are better
means of increasing China's agricultural output than diverting
water from distant places, Chen says.
</P>
<P>
China's total amount of water resources is 2.6 trillion to 2.7
trillion cu.m., or seven percent of the world's total. Per capita
water resources is about 2,200 cu.m., or 30 percent of the world's
average.
</P>
<P>
In a country like this, which has to meet the food demand of 22
percent of the world's population, with 7 percent of the world's
water resources and arable land, increasing agricultural output by
improving water use is a way to kill two birds with one stone,
Chen concludes.

SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Manufactured goods and farm
produce were cheaper but service items were more expensive in
Shanghai in 1997, resulting in a decrease in the city's retail
price index and marginal growth in its consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index was 988 and the consumer price index
102.8 last year, the slowest growth since 1985, when the city
stopped controlling market prices, according to the city's
statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Food, cigarettes, soft drinks, alcohol, and clothing were
cheaper last year, but the price of water, electricity, fuel,
telephone calls, tuition, and rents was up.

The report estimates that market prices will slightly rebound
this year, with the consumer price index and retail price index
growing six and three percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Review Domestic Borrowing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' fiscal
managers will review the government's borrowing program in a bid
to come up with a "more effective and responsible" debt management
method to help bring down interest rates, local press reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted newly installed Finance Secretary Salvador
Enriquez as saying that the review will determine if the current
process of borrowing every week through issuing Treasury bills
will have to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Every Monday, the government auctions off five billion pesos
worth of Treasury bills that mature in 91 days, 182 days and 364
days, and sometimes in 42 days and 63 days.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said the government may have to adopt a policy to
borrow "only at the most advantageous time and not in the time of
need".
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that a more effective debt management would
be to borrow in bulk during times of lower interest rates as
opposed to the weekly flotation since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the current Treasury bill flotation system
will only continue resulting in high Treasury bill rates, and
therefore high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The high Treasury bill rates prevailing since last year,
particularly that of the benchmark 91-day maturity, have been
keeping interest rates of commercial banks at unreasonable levels
which are allegedly killing the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
However, Enriquez's plan drew a lukewarm reaction from traders
who said the scheme will only remove the effectivity of the T-bill
as a benchmark instrument and also will not necessarily translate
into lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I know for a fact that the auction is not controlled
by the banks because even if the banks quote off-market from the
Bureau of Treasury projections, the bureau will not accept," one
trader said.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Stresses Ukraine's Role in Abkhazian Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Georgia expects
Ukraine to play a more active role in the mediation of the
Abkhazian conflict, visiting Georgian National Assembly Speaker
Zurab Zhvaniya said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks with the Ukrainian president, prime minister
and chairman of the Supreme Soviet (parliament), Zhvaniya told a
press conference that Ukraine could play a key role in solving the
Abkhazian problem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Alexander Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of
Ukraine, said the Ukranian parliament would discuss the
participation of Ukraine in the mediation of the Abkhazian dispute.
</P>
<P>
A military conflict in the western Georgian region broke out in
August 1992 when the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia declared
itself a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and
the Abkhazian leadership, Russian peacekeeping troops entered
Abkhazia in mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
Zhvaniya however told reporters that so far he was not
satisfied with the Russian mediation.
</P>
<P>
Zhvaniya arrived in Kiev on Thursday morning for a two-day
official visit. Upon his arrival, he said that Georgia regards
Ukraine as one of the most friendly and brotherly countries.
</P>
<P>
The close ties between Georgia and Ukraine could become a model
for cooperation among the members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Renews Call for Peaceful Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac, on a visit to Austria Thursday, once again called for a
peaceful solution to the crisis over weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after talks with Austrian President
Thomas Klestil and Chancellor Viktor Klima, Chirac said that
France will do all it can to seek a diplomatic solution to the
iraqi crisis and to stop the U.S. from using force again Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed France's desire to avoid military action in the
crisis, saying women and children should not be needlessly killed.
</P>
<P>
"I do not question the need to oblige Saddam Hussein to respect
all the decisions of the (U.N.) Security Council," Chirac said, "I
simply mean that, if we can do so without sending bombs and
killing women and children, it would be better."
</P>
<P>
France, Russia and China have been opposed to the use of
military force in settling the Iraqi crisis while the United
States and Britain have repeatedly threatened to take military
action to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Suburbs Gain Economic Importance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The suburban areas of
Shanghai, China's largest manufacturing center, contributed a
quarter of the city's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, according to
the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The GDP (the value of goods and services produced) of suburban
Shanghai surged 18.8 percent to 95.84 billion yuan last year,
about 28.5 percent of the city's total. The ratio was 1.2
percentage points higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Economists note that the manufacturing industry of Shanghai,
China's largest economic center, is moving to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,875 enterprises have moved to the nine industrial
zones in the suburban districts and counties, while
overseas-funded enterprises have begun investing heavily in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's suburbs had 8,633 overseas-funded enterprises at the
end of last year. The 5,780 operational ones registered a total
turnover of 42.8 billion yuan and earned 5.35 billion US dollars
from exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Feng Guoqin said that township-run enterprises in
Shanghai, which used to be widely scattered, are pursuing an
economy of scale to increase efficiency. Currently 159 enterprise
groups have been formed, with their combined industrial output
value and profit accounting for 15 and 27.7 percent, respectively,
of the total of the suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
Suburban industries have become the largest single driving
force behind Shanghai's industrial growth, Feng said, adding that
the city's suburbs had an industrial output value of 54.7 billion
yuan last year, about 43 percent of the city's total, three
percentage points higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, such as tourism, real estate and
commerce, has recorded considerable growth in the suburban
areas in recent years, according to Feng.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year the service sector's
added value soared 22.6 percent to 33.5 billion yuan, about
28.5 percent of Shanghai's total.
</P>
<P>
The non-state sector has also shifted its focus to the suburbs
because of economic potential. Currently there are 81,000
individually-run industrial and commercial businesses and 61,600
private enterprises in suburban Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Last year the suburban areas scored a total output value of
7.58 billion yuan, up 4.2 percent year-on-year.

<P>
HANGZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-backed businesses of
east China's Zhejiang Province have recorded good economic returns.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, 6,500 overseas-backed enterprises
in operation chalked up 101.78 billion yuan in sales volume,
netted 3.623 billion yuan of profits and earned 2.83 billion
U.S. dollars from exports in 1997, all showing marked increases
over the comparable figures of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the province's overseas-backed enterprises are
included in a recently released list of China's top 500
overseas-financed enterprises for the period 1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the province had altogether approved the
establishment of 14,619 overseas-financed enterprises by the end
of last year, with contracts involving the use of 17.97 billion
U.S. dollars of overseas investment. The actual paid-in overseas
funds was 7.04 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
While simplifying procedures for approving overseas-backed
enterprises and improving services, the province has also been
tightening supervision over the implementation of contracts for
overseas-financed enterprises over the past years.

<HEADLINE> Quality Controls Get Acceptance Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- chinese quality system
certificates are now accepted worldwide following the signing of a
multilateral recognition agreement, according to today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Multilateral Recognition Agreement on Quality System
Certificates, a creation of the five-year-old International
Accreditation Forum, was signed in Guangzhou last month by 16
accreditation bodies representing 17 countries, including the
United States, Germany, France, Japan and Australia, said Zhu
Mingxian, deputy director of the State Bureau of Technical
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
"The China National Accreditation Council for Registrars
(CNACR) was among the first signatories as the only national
accreditation body from a developing country," said Zhu.

Quality system registration has been growing rapidly since the
issue of the first edition of ISO9000 international standards in
1987.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the International Accreditation Forum show that
about 100 countries and regions have adopted the ISO9000
standards, and quality system certificates issued by accredited
quality system registrars are playing an important role in
promoting international trade.
</P>
<P>
Quality system registration has grown since it was introduced
to China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
by the end of last year, 4,042 certificates bearing the
national accreditation marks had been issued.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Iraq Has No Choice But to Comply With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday warned that there is no choice for
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein but to abide by U.N. resolutions on
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam does not have a menu of choices," she told a hearing of
the House International Relations Committee. "He has one: Iraq
must comply with the (Security) Council resolutions and provide
U.N. inspectors with the unfettered access they need to do their
job."
</P>
<P>
The United States dismissed a Russian plan made public by Iraq
Wednesday for limited access to eight presidential sites to be
carried out not by regular U.N. inspectors but by a special
mission under the authority of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"There is still time for a diplomatic solution, but if Iraq's
behavior does not change very soon, we will have no choice but to
take strong measures -- not pinpricks, but substantial strikes,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright also told the House committee that the United States
would check a report, published in the Washington Post Thursday,
that alleged Russia had negotiated to sell Iraq highly-sensitive,
dual-use technology that could be used to produce biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We'll certainly follow it, as we see it as a very serious
issue," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has been working to strengthen its export controls and
we have been encouraging the Russians to investigate incidents as
we have become aware of them."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen urged the United Nations to
make an investigation to find whether there is any evidence for
that contract.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any means of verifying that. That's something
that the U.N. will have to determine, and hopefully the Russian
authorities will be very forthcoming on this issue," he told ABC
in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Russia dismissed the report as "crude inventions."
</P>
<P>
"We decisively deny these crude inventions," Russia's Foreign
Ministry said Thursday. "Russia has never made any deals with Iraq
that would violate international sanctions, moreover deals
involving supplies of banned technologies."
</P>
<P>
More U.S. fighters and bombers took off from their domestic
bases for the Gulf Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Six F-16 fighter jets have left there Shaw Air Force Base,
South Carolina. And six B-52 bombers and one B-1 bomber are
scheduled to leave later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Six F-117A stealth fighters are expected to depart Friday.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the warplanes along with some 23 refueling
tankers and other support planes will boost the total of U.S.
attack and support aircraft in the region to about 350.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Thursday the financing for two projects in Mauritius and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
A loan of 12.4 million U.S. dollars equivalent is provided for
Mauritius' environmental sewerage and sanitation project.
</P>
<P>
The project will address severe wastewater pollution from
heavily urbanized areas of Port Louis, targeting the city's
southern districts, industrial zones and affected coastal zones.
</P>
<P>
This project is also designed to reverse the current trend of
environmental pollution on the island and in its coastal zones.
Furthermore, it will support the government's efforts to implement
priority institutional and technical measures identified in the
sewerage master plan.
</P>
<P>
Another credit of 36 million dollars equivalent will be used to
finance Mozambique's national water development project.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve water supply and sanitation in rural
and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
This credit was approved ahead of schedule in order to mobilize
funds for chlorine treatment of urban water supplies in Maputo and
Beira, where cases of Cholera have reached over 10,000, including
more than 400 dead.
</P>
<P>
This project will lay the groundwork for an increase in the
quality, coverage, and sustainability of the country's water
supply and sanitation services.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessionary lending
wing for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department to Appeal Line-Item Veto Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Department is
planning to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after a federal judge
struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said he was "disappointed" by the ruling,
but expressed confidence the line-item law eventually will be
upheld by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, which took effect in January 1997, the president
has five days after signing a bill to cancel some of its
appropriations, or cancel special tax breaks seen as applying to
small numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
Congress could overturn all or some of the line-item vetoes on
a majority vote in a "disapproval bill," but if the president then
vetoes that bill, it would require a two-thirds vote in both the
House of Representatives and Senate to override.
</P>
<P>
In his Thursday ruling, U.S. Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the
law as unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers
among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
New York, among others, had brought this latest challenge to
the law when a line-item veto by Clinton last year deprived the
state of extra federal funds for Medicaid -- the federal health
insurance program covering poor, elderly and disabled Americans.
The White House later worked out an agreement giving New York much
of the money.
</P>
<P>
The state was joined in its challenge by Idaho potato farmers,
who also lost out on funding because of a line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
Clinton joined congressional Republicans in campaigning for the
line-item veto authority, but he used it relatively sparingly in
its first full year.
</P>
<P>
In a brief written statement Thursday, Clinton said, "The
line-item veto provides an important tool for the president to
strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation."

<HEADLINE> Solana Sees Big Troop Withdrawal from Bosnia This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) can begin a significant military withdrawal
from Bosnia with the political situation there improving, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"My recommendation would be to start now with a force a little
bit lower than the 35,000 we have now, so that by the end of the
year we could start a drawdown of a significant nature," Solana
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR), currently deployed in
Bosnia, is expected to conclude its mission by the end of June.
The U.S. and its NATO allies are planning for a replacement force.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration decided at the end of last year to
continue to deploy ground troops in Bosnia because of the fear
that a total withdrawal would lead to a resumption of warfare in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Giving an optimistic assessment of the situation in Bosnia,
Solana said that the improving political picture and the prospect
of presidential elections in September open the way to easing the
demand for peacekeeping forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Recent arrests by SFOR of indicted war criminals, unifying
steps such as the establishment of a Bosnian currency and auto
license plates, and successful regional elections point to an
improving picture, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
However, Solana said that problems persist in Bosnia.
Geographic pockets remain hotly disputed between Serbian, Muslim
and Croatian ethnic groups and the return of refugees is occurring
in only a handful of communities.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who is in Washington to brief lawmakers on expansion of
the alliance, said that the share of the U.S. troops in the
multi-national force in Bosnia could be reduced to 22 percent from
25 percent beginning this year with the gradual drawdown.

<HEADLINE> Albright:: US to Check Russia's Contract With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Thursday that the United States would
check a report, published in the Washington Post, which alleged
Russia had negotiated to sell Iraq highly-sensitive dual-use
technology that could be used to produce biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We'll certainly follow it, as we see it as a very serious
issue," Albright told the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said a U.N. inspection team had seized a
confidential document back in the fall that signaled a contract
between Russia and Iraq in 1995 for Russia to sell that weapons
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Albright said, "Russia has been working to strengthen its
export controls and we have been encouraging the Russians to
investigate incidents as we have become aware of them."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen Thursday urged the United
Nations to make an investigation to find whether there is any
evidence for that contract.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any means of verifying that. That's something
that the U.N. will have to determine, and hopefully the Russian
authorities will be very forthcoming on this issue," he told ABC
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Russia dismissed Thursday the Washington Post's report as crude
inventions.
</P>
<P>
"We decisively deny these crude inventions," Russia's Foreign
Ministry said. "Russia has never made any deals with Iraq that
would violate international sanctions, moreover deals involving
supplies of banned technologies."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Sticks to Russian-French Initiative, FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf here Thursday night said that Iraq still stuck to
the Russian-French initiative which suggests opening eight
presidential sites to international arms inspectors appointed by
the U.N. Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
Iraq thought that the joint initiative was the best way to end
the current Iraqi-U.N. standoff and it now had no other plans,
said Sahhaf, who arrived here from Cairo on a three-day official
visit as part of his regional tour to rally support to fend off a
possible military attack by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We support the Russian-French initiative," he said while
arriving at the Amman Queen Ali International Airport.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only Russia's and France's position. It reflects
the positions of all," added Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the United States' immediate rejection of his
proposal, the foreign minister said that Iraq would insist on
such a proposal and expected the U.N. Security Council to act in
accordance with the U.N. charters to help find a peaceful solution
to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If they do like this, we will cooperate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the U.S. threat to carry out military action
against Iraq, Sahhaf said that Iraq knew that any war would
inflict damage on it, but the country was "not ready to put itself
under U.S. occupation yet."
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf added that Iraq would not submit to the U.S. military
threats as well as any pressure from it, as his country had to
safeguard its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insisted that Iraq open all the suspected sites with
no preconditions, otherwise it would use military force to compel
it to do so.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf called it as "allegations" when referring to the U.S.
accusation that Iraq had mass-destruction weapons on its
presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. was using the U.N. to make trouble with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"When we say anything about the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM), it is not about the UNSCOM, it is about the
United States' allegations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Upon Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the U.N. Security
Council imposed economic sanctions on this country. Only when the
U.N. weapon inspectors certifies that all the mass-destruction
weapons are dismantled in Iraq, can the sanctions be
lifted.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Invites Iraq to Discuss Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan Thursday formally invited Iraq to send a delegation to the
U.N. headquarters in New York to hold discussions on the
Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Annan's invitation has been sent to Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said in his invitation that he has noticed the
Iraqi complaint about his proposal after he submitted it to the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan proposed earlier this month to increase the amount of
oil Iraq can sell under the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal to 5.2
billion U.S. dollars over six months from original 2 billion
dollars to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq complained that Annan's proposal would weaken
Iraq's call for the lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq and
insisted that Iraq should have the right to decide on how to
distribute food and medicine purchased with its own fund.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said if the Security Council approved his
proposal, he would suggest that Iraq and the U.N. hold new
negotiations in New York to reach necessary agreement so that
Iraq could prepare and submit its food and medicine distribution
plan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under the U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. Under the oil-for-food deal, it is allowed to export 2
billion dollars of oil over a six month period to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can not be lifted unless U.N. weapons inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction.

<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Saeed el-Sahhaf will visit Lebanon Saturday to explain Iraq's
stance on the crisis over arms inspection, the local radio Voice
of the People reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
El-Sahhaf will hold talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
and deliver him a message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri,
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will be the last leg of el-Sahhaf's current tour of
Arab states, which has taken him to Syria, Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He is rallying support from Arab countries for Iraq's stand on
the arms inspections by the United Nations and the efforts to
thwart a possible attack on Iraq by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has agreed to open eight presidential compounds to arms
inspectors appointed by U.N. Secretary General. But the United
States and Britain have rejected the offer, saying that Iraq has
no right to set conditions for the arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, strengthening military force in the Gulf,
maintain that they will carry out substantial air strikes against
Iraq if it does not back down.

<HEADLINE> Air Strike on Iraq Might Be Around Feb. 26: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Military experts Thursday
predicted a U.S.-British air strike on Iraq, once decided, might
take place around February 26 when a new moon just arrives.
</P>
<P>
They said the next new moon, on Feb. 26, creates a potential
window of opportunity for a possible U.S. air strike on Iraq as a
concealing dark sky, with little or no visible crescent, is the
best time to launch an attack.
</P>
<P>
"There are three or four nights of darkness on either side of
the new moon," said Geoff Chester, a spokesman for the U.S. Naval
Observatory. "It certainly helps to have no moon. When it's full,
it illuminates the sky."
</P>
<P>
A full moon could make Iraq's anti-aircraft artillery and
surface-to-air missiles easier find invading U.S. warplanes, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is: we are going to plan our mission in a way
that reduces our exposure to threats," an Air Force official said.
"The moon and the weather are just some of the considerations."
</P>
<P>
Weather can also play a significant role in attack planning,
especially in the Gulf region plagued by killing heat, high and
unpredictable winds and blinding sandstorms that can reduce
visibility to zero.
</P>
<P>
"Dust, sand and heat are deadly enemies to electronic equipment
like radios, computers, and the `black boxes' on aircraft and
other combat vehicles," said an Army history of the Gulf War.
"Weather plays an uncertain hand in aerial combat."
