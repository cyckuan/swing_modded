<HEADLINE> Afghan Militia Claims Capture of PM's Stronghold </HEADLINE>

<P>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban
Islamic militia today claimed the capture of a military stronghold
of Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the Spina Shahga
village in southern Afghanistan bordering Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Taliban spokesman based in Peshawar in
northwestern Pakistan, Ahmed Jan, Hekmatyar's military
headquarters fell to the hand of the Taliban after 12 hours of
fighting which started on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The number of casualties was not clear on either side but
dozens of bodies were littered in the last base of Hekmatyar, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Spina Shahga, the main military headquarters of Hekmatyar, is a
border village on a hill top adjacent to the Kurram Agency of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar's forces, after retreating from their stronghold in
Charisyab near the capital city of Kabul last year, got refuge in
the village and shifted the military arsenal in the area.
</P>
<P>
Jan said the Taliban also seized a large sum of arms and
ammunition during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
This was the Taliban's first major attack on a stronghold of
Hekmatyar's since the new coalition government was formed in June.
 Hekmatyar is prime minister in the government of his old rival
President Burhnuddin Rabbani.

PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The first convoy of paperless
African immigrants to be expelled from France arrived this
afternoon at a military air base in Ereux, Upper Normandy, from
where they are to board a DC-10 military aircraft bound for Mali.
</P>
<P>
The convoy consisted of about 15 police vehicles escorted by
armed motorcyclists and three windowless container trucks holding
about 50 Africans, according to a report by Agence France Presse.

<P>
AMMAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko
Ikeda arrived here today for a 24-hour visit to the kingdom to
bolster the stalled Middle East peace process and improve
bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda, who is on his five-leg Middle East tour which has taken
him to Egypt, Syria, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel,
is expected to hold talks with King Hussein, Crown Prince Hassan
and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
He will also present his country's views on the peace process
and seek to gain first-hand information on the status quo of the
negotiations with a view to determine what Tokyo could do to
reinvigorate the quest for peace in the region, said Japanese
Ambassador to Jordan Takayuki Kimura.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Tokyo attached great importance to the
results of Ikeda's talks here.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan fully supports King Hussein's positions vis-a-vis
the peace process, particularly the king's "refraining from
overreacting to the recent developments," a reference to the
ascension to power of the right-wing Likud party in Israel, which
is widely viewed as posing serious questions over the future of
Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He added the Japanese government wholly supported Jordan's
economic restructuring program and paid tribute to Amman's strict
adherence to the program.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for Ikeda's talks here includes Japanese assistance
to several projects such as building schools and water supply and
distribution stations.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, the Japanese foreign minister will sign with
Kabariti grant and loan agreements.
</P>
<P>
A grant of seven million dollars is aimed at reconstructing
the Sheikh Hussein Bridge and build access roads and terminals,
according to a statement released by the Japanese embassy here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The (bridge) project is a concrete step as well as a
symbol of peace in the region and another example of Japanese
contribution to the (Middle East) peace process," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has requested 60 million dollars in assistance from
Japan for human resources development. It is not known whether
Japan will fully meet the request.
</P>
<P>
Japan's assistance to Jordan -- grants, aid and loans -- in
the past 12 months amounted to 340 million dollars, including 215
million dollars to help the kingdom's balance of payments and 100
million dollars to finance the expansion of the Aqaba thermal
power plant.

PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A major international theatrical
festival in the French city Audrillac was disrupted today by a
protest against the government plan to expel hundreds of paperless
African immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,000 people demonstrated in silence this morning before
the office building of the Prefecture of Cantal in Audrillac,
south-central France, in solidarity with the 300 African nationals
who were expelled from the Saint-Bernarch Church Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the paperless immigrants are facing expulsion from
France.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was called by a group of street theater
artists, who were joining the Audrillac Festival drawing numerous
French and foreign troupes, reported Agence France Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 30 people protesting the expulsion today
gathered outside a military air base in Evreux, Upper Normandy,
from where the first group of the paperless immigrants is due to
be expelled aboard a military aircraft to Mali, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Some attorneys of the paperless immigrants accused the

</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation was headed by Mohammed Akef, director of

Export.
</P>
<P>
Akef was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that the

<HEADLINE> Lebed in Grozny to Shape Future of Chechnya With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian national security chief
Alexander Lebed shuttled back to Chechnya today to carry out his
president-entrusted mission of hammering out a permanent
settlement of the 20-month conflict in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
Lebed immediately held talks with Russian officials upon his
arrival at Grozny this afternoon, Interfax news agency reported.
He was then to travel to Novy Atagi, 25 kilometers south of the
regional capital, for talks with separatist leaders.
</P>
<P>
He told Interfax earlier in the day that President Boris
Yeltsin trusted him fully and that he was confident the thorny
issue of Chechnya would be resolved in the interests of Russia and
the Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
Lebed did not rule out that if the talks were complicated they
would continue Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As Yeltsin's point man on Chechnya, Lebed made two visits to
Chechnya in three days.
</P>
<P>
The first one began on Thursday, shortly after Russian generals
in Chechnya issued an ultimatum to bombard Grozny if the rebels
refused to surrender.
</P>
<P>
He reached a peace agreement with Chechen rebel commander Aslan
Maskhadov on Thursday and his peacemaking efforts were highly
praised by both President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Under the new peace accord, Russian troops and Chechen rebels
would establish joint control over some areas in Grozny. Lebed
would inspect the joint headquarters during his current visit.

ALMA ATA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Central Asian countries are
expecting their cooperation with China to produce positive
results, a senior official in charge of cooperation among three
Central Asian countries said today.
</P>
<P>
Serik Primbetov, chairman of the Executive Committee of the
Interstate Council of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, said
that the visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the three

Primbetov made the remarks during an interview with Xinhua on

</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit showed that there is a broad prospect for the
cooperation between China and the three Central Asian countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the August 23 summit of the three countries as
"fruitful," Primbetov said that leaders of the three countries
have reached a consensus on all issues on their agenda.

<HEADLINE> Israel Discovers Biochemical "Switch" on Leaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
discovered a biochemical "switch" that appears to control leaf
opening and closing, according to a report published recently by
Weizman Institute of Science in the latest issue of "Science Tips."
</P>
<P>
The report said that some plants may have an easier
"waking-up" movement than many people do, thanks to a built-in
biological clock that causes them to open their leaves in the
morning and fold them at night.
</P>
<P>
Leaf movements are produced by changes in the volume of motor
cells on opposite sides of the pulvinus, a thickened area at the
base of each leaf stalk that acts as the leaf-moving organ. At
dawn, cells in the lower half of the pulvinus swell and those in
the upper half shrink, opening the leaves, while at dusk the
reverse process occurs.
</P>
<P>
The swelling and shrinking are made possible by the flow of
charged particles called ions through special channels in the
motor cell membrane.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nava Moran of the Neurobiology Department has shown that
certain ion channels open up if they, or other nearby proteins,
acquire phosphate.
</P>
<P>
In a study reported in the August issue of "Plant Physiology,"
Moran was able to use this biological "switch" to control the
opening and closing of the channels.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing a technique from neurobiological research, she
immersed a tiny strip of membrane in a solution where phosphate
could be added or removed, and observed the opening and closing
of the channels.
</P>
<P>
Since ion channels probably underlie not only leaf movements,
including those produced in response to light or touch, but also
other vital processes in plants, the improved understanding of
the movement-control mechanism may one day have such diverse
application as preventing the wilting of crops during drought, or
altering the time of flowering and fruition, according to the
report.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Armed Irish naval patrols and
tracker aircraft were last night poised to intercept Japanese
vessels encroaching on EU Atlantic waters after two large ships
were detained for illegal tuna fishing, media reports from Dublin
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Irish are maintaining a strong presence at the edge of
their 200-mile fishing limit, believing the estimated 40-strong
Japanese fleet may attempt to retrieve miles of valuable lines
and high-tech radio buoys, along with a substantial haul of
bluefin tuna.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a Japanese ship has been seized inside
Ireland's area of the European Union's 200-mile limit. It is the
first time in more than two years that a non-EU ship has been
apprehended anywhere in EU waters.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the Irish navy has boarded 803 vessels, 29 of
which have been brought to court. Until this week, all vessels
boarded were of EU origin.
</P>
<P>
The latest incidents highlight the strains on Ireland's
policing effort, covering 132000 square miles, equivalent to a
fifth of the EU's fishing waters - with just seven vessels.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese captain of the Minato Maru was yesterday charged
at a local court with illegal fishing, while a second ship, the
Soshin Maru, was taken under escort to Castletownbere, accused of
logbook offenses.

<P>
This came after foreign media Thursday carried reports on the
alleged execution of 11 army officers by a firing squad Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The SUNA quoted Mohammed el Senoussi, official spokesman for
the Sudanese Armed Forces, as saying today that all of the 25
defendants, including 17 military personnel, are still under
investigation and interrogation, and that they have received the
"best treatment."
</P>
<P>
He added that investigations into the case of the defendants
are still underway and that many of those summoned up for
investigation have been released.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the initial investigations have
showed that there was a foreign support for the
defendants. Details of the support will be released later, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Sudan's security authorities arrested a
number of people accused of being involved in a plot to blow vital
installations in the city of Port Sudan, with the aim of
paralyzing the operations of country's exports and imports.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
raising fund to set up "Drop-in Centers" for street children and
orphans in an effort to provide education to them.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Miynda, Minister of Sports, Youth and Child Development
said at a fund-raising ceremony held here today that the training
is aimed at enabling the disadvantaged youth to "stand on their
own feet."
</P>
<P>
A fund administered by the National Savings and Credit Bank
would be set up.
</P>
<P>
Street children and orphans are a social problem in Zambia.
Young people constitute the majority in the Zambian society but
their status is very vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
With 45 percent of the youth population of about nine millions
in the urban areas, street children and jobless youths may be
found wandering here and there to look for a living in cities and
towns in the country.

<HEADLINE> France Expels 57 Africans on Board Airbus 310 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- France today expelled 57 African
paperless immigrants from Mali, Senegal and Zaire on a military
Airbus 310, which took off at 19:00 local time from a military air
base in Ereux, Upper Normandy.
</P>
<P>
However, only four paperless immigrants of the 300 expelled
Friday from the Saint-Bernard Church were among this group,
according to a communique of the French Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The paperless immigrants were trucked into the 105 Air Base in
windowless container trucks at 17:30 through a back-gate of the
base to avoid the demonstrators protesting the expulsion outside
the air base.
</P>
<P>
Many soldiers were deployed around the Airbus 310 to block the
view of journalists and demonstrators when the immigrants were
loaded into the plane, according to a report by Agence France
Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The undisclosed destination of the plane is believed to be
Mali, which said that it is expecting the home-coming of 14
Malians today.
</P>
<P>
A clash took place between demonstrators and anti-riot police
outside the base, in which Jacques Davoust, an assistant to the
mayor of the nearby city of Eure, was slightly injured by police,
said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The 105 Air Base has seen the coming and going of some special
figures, including Jean-Bedel Bokassa, former emperor of the
Central-African Republic, and Bani Sadr, former prime minister of
Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran bought 12 aircraft from
France and the fleet has arrived here today, the state-run
television reported.
</P>
<P>
The IRIB English service said that the purchase of the 12
aircraft was made shortly after the signing of the D'Amato bill by
U.S. President Bill Clinton in early August.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the bill to punish foreign companies investing
annually 40 million U.S. dollars or more in the oil and gas sector
in Iran or Libya.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no details about the amount of money
spent for the deal and whether the aircraft are for military or
civilian purposes.
</P>
<P>
The IRIB only said that the newly-bought aircraft, model TV 21
and TV 200, are for "advanced training purposes."
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's official news agency IRNA did not report the
deal, saying it knew nothing about it.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Punishes Muslim Army for Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- IFOR has banned all flights of
Muslim army helicopters and limited troop movements in the Bihac
region in western Bosnia due to violations of the Dayton
agreement.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Lt.-Col. Max Marriner said today that the ban
follows the discovery by IFOR of a convoy of buses transporting
several hundred troops to Bihac Friday night, according to Tanjug
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Marriner said that the troop movement had not been authorized
by IFOR and that several unauthorized helicopter flights had also
been observed.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations have been underway in the Bihac region for some
time now between troops of the regular Muslim army and followers
of Muslim opposition leader Fikret Abdic who is also running for a
seat in the three-member Bosnian presidency in the first post-war
national elections set for September 14.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international community's High Representative for
Bosnia Carl Bildt has sharply criticized Bosnian Muslim Democratic
Action Party (SDA) headed by the Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic for violence against election rivals.
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Bihac area in western-most Bosnia on Friday
to pressure local Muslim leaders and police to prevent the attacks
on election rivals, Bildt said, "We think they and their bosses in
Sarajevo will get the message from our visit today, that selective
state terrorism cannot be tolerated if we are to build democracy
in (post-war) Bosnia,"
</P>
<P>
More than two scores of bomb and physical attacks on SDA rivals
have been recorded in the bihac area in the past two weeks, Tanjug
said.

<HEADLINE> Yilmaz Re-Elected Turkey's ANAP Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz was re-elected chairman of the center-right
opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) by beating his challenger Isin
Celebi at 1,032 votes to 170 at the ANAP convention which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a convention speech before the election, Yilmaz promised
that irrespective of the conditions from now on all candidates in
parliamentary elections would be nominated through provincial
primaries.
</P>
<P>
Celebi made such a demand in his own speech to the ANAP
convention which was held near the Ankara Esenboga Airport.
</P>
<P>
He charged the party had been dragged into what he called an
undemocratic environment where the wishes of the grassroots were
not respected.
</P>
<P>
Celebi said that the party had failed to make an impact in the
past five years and had lost its vitality.
</P>
<P>
"In the past we were complaining that our adversaries were
hitting us under the belly...but now we have to compete against
corrupt and crooked rivals," Yilmaz told a cheering crowd,
apparently attacking his former coalition partner Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, now concurrently deputy prime minister and foreign
minister, has faced a series of corruption charges in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
On June 6, Yilmaz resigned his post of prime minister after
only three months in government as the Constitutional Court
announced that the vote of confidence for the coalition
government formed between the ANAP and True Path Party (DYP) was
unconstitutional.

BELGRADE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO published on Saturday a
list of 12 municipalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina where violent
incidents might occur on election day scheduled for September 14.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the election day "hotspots" are in the Muslim-Croat
federation, and four are in Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska,
according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
In making the list, NATO took into accounts places where
tensions have been mounting and where there have been incidents
before, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
NATO believes that violence might be connected with the arrival
of refugees to vote in their pre-war places of residence.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman in Sarajevo Max Marriner said he hoped the
election day would be peaceful, stressing that all NATO and U.N.
personnel and local police forces would be on full alert.
</P>
<P>
Marriner said that the biggest responsibility for orderly
elections rested with the forces of law and order of the Bosnian
parties.
</P>

In a related development, IFOR banned on Saturday all flights
of Muslim army helicopters and limited troop movements in the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The study of challenges and
opportunities that libraries will face on their way to the 21st
century and of their important role in the economic development
and social progress of all the countries worldwide will have a
significant impact on the development of libraries in China and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came from a People's Daily editorial tomorrow,
titled "Greeting the New Age of the Library Sector", saluting
the opening of the 62nd General Conference of the International
Federation of Libraries and Institutes.
</P>
<P>
China was one of the founders of the federation when it was
established in 1927, according to the paper, but after the new
China was founded in 1949, its affiliation was suspended, until
1981, because of historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
The international meeting in Beijing shows that China has had
some great achievements and that China attaches great importance
to construction and development of libraries.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, China now has 2,615 public libraries,
1,080 college-affiliated libraries, and 8,000 other libraries,
which provide various services as part of the information network.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that this system will make an even greater
contribution to economic development and social progress with the
efforts of library workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Talks on a political settlement
of the conflict in Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya, which
is scheduled to be held in the village of Novye Atagi on Sunday
morning, have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
Russian security chief Alexander Lebed left for Moscow on
Sunday for further consultations on an accord to solve the
20-month old crisis.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason for the delay of the talks, Lebed told
reporters before leaving for Moscow from Khankala, where the
command of the Russian troops is based, that suggestions put
forward by the rebels during talks on Saturday need to be studied
by experts in international law, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are some problems to be discussed with
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
Itar-Tass quoted Lebed as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two sides had reached some consensus on
some military and political issues during the talks on Saturday
and they had reached a memorandum on some specific measures about
the ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lebed will report the situation in Chechnya to Yeltsin and
discuss the next step with him.
</P>
<P>
He also plans to meet the prime minister, foreign minister and
the minister on charge of the national affairs in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Lebed will return to Chechnya to continue the negotiations
after his consultations in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency quoted sources in the federal command as
saying that Lebed delayed his talks with Chechen rebel
chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov because the rebels had violated an
earlier ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
A group of rebels had disarmed an Interior Ministry armored
column in the Chechen capital Grozny on Saturday, seizing
weapons, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Lebed today called on the Chechen people to clear up hostility
and suspicion and to set up peace together.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who arrived in Chechnya on Saturday, was due to finalize
a political deal to settle the 20-month-old conflict with the
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov said after the talks on
Saturday that the two sides were close to a deal.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Wins Belgian Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Ferrari's battered pride was
somewhat restored when Michael Schumacher of Germany won the
sensational Belgian Grand Prix motor race at Spa-Francorchamps on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Villenueve in his Williams Renault finished second with
Mika Hakkinen third in a McLaren Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Damon Hill, current leader in the race for the
drivers' world championship, finished a distant fifth in the other
Williams Renault.
</P>
<P>
Before the race, Hill was 17 points clear of Villeneuve, the
only man in contest with him for the title.
</P>
<P>
But by the end his lead had been reduced to only 13 points with
three races left.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher staged a stunning performance in the Belgian grand
prix and he admitted afterwards that he nearly pulled out of the
race half-way through after he damaged his steering.
</P>
<P>
But after being told by the pits that the steering would hold,
the German continued flat out to collect his second Grand Prix of
the season.
</P>
<P>
Villenueve, fearing the engine would act up, backed off in the
closing laps when he had closed to within less than a second of
Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian later said, he heard some noises in the engine
and decided to lay back.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who started on the front row alongside pole sitter
Villeneuve, got a terrible start and quickly found himself in
fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Things got worse when Jos Verstappen in the Arrows crashed
heavily and the pace car came onto the track.
</P>
<P>
By the time the debris was removed and the race restarted Hill
was back in 14th and looking out of the points altogether.
</P>
<P>
But the Englishman clawed his way back up to sixth.
</P>
<P>
When David Coultard spun off and crashed his McLaren Mercedes
into the tyre barrier Hill, driving his spare car, gratefully took
the vacant spot and with it a much needed extra point.
</P>
<P>
The next race is in Monza, then the circus moves to Portugal
before finishing in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Pre-Stamped Envelope To Mark IFLA Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications issued a pre-stamped envelope today to
commemorate the current general conference of the International
Federation of Library Associations and Institutes (IFLA), the
first ever held in China.
</P>
<P>
The lower left corner of the envelope has a red book, a laser
disk, "IFLA", and a section of the Great Wall, and the upper right
corner, the Chinese character for "book".
</P>
<P>
Pan Keming, the envelope's designer, said that the book and
laser disk symbolize the changes and challenges faced by libraries.
</P>
<P>
Pan, who has been designing stamps for 30 years, says that,
"The feeling of reading a book on a sofa to the accompaniment of
music cannot be achieved from reading a laser disk."
</P>
<P>
She does think however that disks should be credited for their
huge memory and convenient storage, and that many records would
have been saved if the laser disk had come along a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the ancient Chinese character "book"
signifies China's long literary history.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongde, minister of culture and executive chairman of the
organizing committee for the conference, and IFLA President Robert
Wedgeworth were present at today's issuing ceremony.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government today
confirmed the fall of a strategic base controlled by Premier
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami faction to the rival Taliban
Islamic militia in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claimed Saturday that its forces had captured
Hekmatyar's stronghold of Spina Shahga in Paktia province which
borders Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted Hekmatyar's spokesman as saying,
"Spina Shahga fell late Friday afternoon without much resistance."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the base fell because it was only defended
by units of local forces loyal to Hekmatyar instead of the
premier's main fighting force.
</P>
<P>
Top military and political leaders of the Afghan government
held an "extraordinary" meeting in Kabul today to discuss the
capture of the base by the Taliban, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani and his military strongman Ahmad Shah Masood, Hekmatyar
and his Defense Minister Wahidullah Sabawoon, and ally Rasool
Sayyaf, leader of Ittihad-i-Islami faction.

DHAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Shiekh
Hasina today expressed her interest in China's experience in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In her meeting with Lieutenant General Kui Fulin, deputy chief
of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of
China, here this morning, the Bangladeshi prime minister said that
China's economic construction is going on step by step according
to plans, from which Bangladesh can learn a lot.
</P>
<P>
She recalled her visit to China in 1993, saying that the rapid
development in Pudong and Shenzhen gave her a lasting impression
because economic "miracles" have been created there in a very
short period.
</P>
<P>
Although Bangladesh is a tiny country facing many economic
problems, "we are determined to do our utmost to develop our
economy to alleviate poverty," said Hasina, asking for more
assistance from China in Bangladesh's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
General Kui, who was leading a 7-member high level military
delegation here for 5-day visit, appraised the friendly relations
between the two countries and the two armed forces and expressed
his thanks to the Bangladeshi government and people for their
support to China in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
As an old friend, China will continue to assist Bangladesh in
its economic construction, said General Kui, wishing Bangladesh a
success in economic development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese military delegation arrived here on August 21 and
concluded its visit this afternoon. Before leaving for Bangkok,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Folk Music to Be Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese folk musicians from
across the country are helping to scour China for folk music for a
collection of 7,000 hours of folk music on video disc to preserve
its artistic and cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The preservation work is part of the program "Memory of the
World" launched by UNESCO in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Abdelaziz Abid, an official with UNESCO's Information and
Informatics Division who is here to attend the 62nd General
Conference of the International Federation of Library Associations
and Institutes (IFLA), said that in this way UNESCO hopes to
preserve the "irreplaceable 'Memory of the World'".
</P>
<P>
The program currently has seven pilot projects that
include: dealing with manuscripts and early printed books of the
Prague National Library; the Radzivill Chronicle with 600 color
plates written in old Russian revealing the history of Russia and
its neighbors from the 5th to the early 13th century; parchment
and paper fragments with Koran extracts on them, which were
discovered in the Great Mosque of Sana'a in Yemen; a collection of
15th and 16th century Slavic manuscripts held by the Russian State
Library and archives of many major Russian authors such as
Dostoevsky and Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO is also considering some 30 other projects on heritage
protection, such as the Tamil palm-leaf manuscripts in India,
Vietnam film heritage, and a Jewish musical collection in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Some 15 countries, including China, Russia, Finland and
Hungary, have set up "Memory of the World" National Committees to
fulfill this work to preserve historical records for future
generations.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO on Library Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- UNESCO, in a new edition of the
Public Library Manifesto, says that library services should be
provided free of charge and that public libraries should not make
money directly from readers.
</P>
<P>
It states that the library is defined as a public institution,
and that funding should be the responsibility of local and
national authorities.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto was submitted for study to the 62nd General
Conference of the International Federation of Library Associations
and Institutes (IFLA), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The document says: "While charges are not excluded, they play
an auxiliary and not a strategic role. The public library should
thus depend for its existence not on income coming directly from
users, but on a share of society's resources."
</P>
<P>
Budget cutbacks now remain one of the biggest problems faced by
libraries worldwide. The sharp rise in book prices and other
factors have forced many libraries in developing countries to cut
back on the number of books and magazines they buy.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto stresses that the library is open to
everyone. That means that all people including minority ethnic
groups, people with disabilities, people in hospitals, as well as
people in prison should be included, it says.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto also describes the role of the librarian as that
of "an active intermediary between users and resources." And even
greater emphasis is put on information and education as part of
the library's function. The concept of "leisure activities" as
such is no longer mentioned in the new manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Abdelaziz Abid, an official with the Information and
Informatics Division of UNESCO, says that the earlier manifesto
was updated for two reasons. First, it was in danger of appearing
archaic or outmoded. Second, the accelerated pace of change in
information has to be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
This is the third UNESCO Public Library Manifesto, with
previous ones having been issued in 1947 and in 1972
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reiterates Denunciation of Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denounced again
Iran's involvement in the current fighting between two Kurdish
rival groups, saying it was a flagrant aggression and an
indication of Iran's endless expansion dreams.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in a statement to
Iraqi News Agency that the Iranian acts indicate Iran's "dangerous
expansionist opportunism tendency."
</P>
<P>
He also strongly denounced the U.S. position, which imposes
"illegitimate" military presence and aerial embargo in the
Kurdistan autonomous region under a false and ridiculous pretext
of providing protection for the Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called upon the Iraqi people to strengthen national unity
and raise their voices in the Kurdish region against the
U.S. "criminal game," which has impeded the progress and prosperity
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Iraq's call for dialogue to solve the Kurdish
problem in northern Iraq. Iraq is the only country in the Middle
East region to grant Kurds their political and cultural rights, he
said.
</P>
<P>
An article carried in today's Al-Thawra daily, organ of the
ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party, said that Iraq's Kurdish people
have expressed their sharp rejection of the Iranian intervention
and American existence in northern Iraq. They condemned these
immoral interference and aggressive acts by Iran and the United
States against Iraqi people in the north, the ariticle said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between two Kurdish rivals of the Kurdish Democratic
Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan has lasted for one
week.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people have been killed and hundreds of others
wounded. A total of 2,300 people have died in the armed
conflicts since the two warring factions signed a cease-fire
agreement in 1995.

<HEADLINE> American Teenager Strikes Double Gold on Final Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Obea Moore of the United States
pulled off a double gold feat on the final day of the Junior World
Athletics Championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Californian teenager collected gold as a member of the
American 4x100 meters and 4x400 meters relay teams to add to the
gold he won in the 400 meters last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His haul of three golds was the most ever by an athlete at the
junior championships and enabled the United States to finish at
the head of the medals table with six golds, one more than the
previous record set by the United States at the 1994 championships
in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Moore's record-breaking feat was aided largely by the
withdrawal of Nigeria from the 4x100 meters relay whose anchorman
Francis Obikwelu was also gunning for a third gold after winning
the 100-200m sprint double earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
The Africans had been considered a virtual certainty for the
title but were forced to pull out when they were unable to find
four fit runners.
</P>
<P>
Moore, 17, ran the third leg in the winning 4x100 meters team
which took gold in the smart time of 39.36 seconds before
returning an hour later to anchor the 4x400 meters team to glory.
</P>
<P>
The final day of the championships also witnessed the first
junior world record of the meet, set by Tereza Marinova in the
women's triple jump.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian shattered the previous record of 14.36 meters
with a winning leap of 14.62 meters to win gold by a massive 98
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia also finished the meet in style, winning three more
golds to finish in equal second place on the medals table
alongside Germany which collected a further two golds Sunday. Both
countries finished with four golds apiece.
</P>
<P>
Assefa Mezgebu of Ethiopia followed in the footsteps of
countryman Haile Gebrselassie to add the 5,000-meter title to his
10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Mezgebu won in a championship record of 13 minutes 35.30
seconds, relegating highly-rated Kenyan David Chelule to his
second silver. Aaron Gabonewe of South Africa finished third in
13:46.19.
</P>
<P>
Mezgebu matched the performance of Gebrselassie, who won the
5,000 and 10,000 at the 1992 junior championships in
Seoul. Gebrselassie is the world record holder over 5,000 and the
Olympic champion over 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Russia, China, Cuba and Kenya also added to their gold medal
tallys on Sunday while Uzbekistan and Fiji won their first ever
medals after entering one-member teams.
</P>
<P>
The host-nation brought a frustrating run of minor medal wins
to an end when Paul Burgess won the pole vault with a clearance of
5.35 meters to give the Australians their first gold after two
silvers and seven bronzes.

<HEADLINE> Libraries Providing Services for Farmers and Herdsmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Avid readers in remote pastoral
and mountainous parts of China can now borrow books from many
libraries via the mail.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the rural economy, by the end of 1994
China had set up 2,596 libraries in counties across the nation,
and libraries or reading rooms even in small towns and villages
are thriving.
</P>
<P>
To help people in the countryside have the opportunity to read
more, Chinese libraries started to provide diversified services in
1985, taking mobile libraries to mountainous areas, sending books
by post to rural people, establishing libraries on boats for
fishermen, and even sending boxes of books on horseback to
herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a number of cities and counties issued
library cards that were valid in every library to provide
convenient reading for local readers.
</P>
<P>
Readers can also order books in libraries over the phone,
through the mails, and via the computer system.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Keep Books Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Libraries should make more
efforts to keep books clean and dry, and at appropriate
temperatures, an international conference on library science was
told today.
</P>
<P>
Some 900 types of mould can grow on poorly-preserved books,
according to a study of 110 mouldy books and five mouldy book
shelves, conducted by a drug inspection institute in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that paper, varnished cloth, wood and ink, which
are used for books can all become the medium for mould at certain
temperature and moisture levels.
</P>
<P>
They say that the mould will not only damage books but also
harm humans by producing aflatoxin, a kind of mould closely
related to cancer.
</P>
<P>
At the 62nd General Conference of the International Federation
of Library Associations and Institutes (IFLA), Professor Xin
Ximeng, a scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggested
that all libraries improve their cleanliness to keep chances for
mould to grow at a minimum.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Have Second Biggest Library in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is scheduled to open a
new library, second only to Beijing's national library, by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The library has been a major cultural project for the country's
economic center, and will be the first in the country to use a
modern information system with a computer and multi-media network,
said Wu Jianzhong, one of the heads of the library.
</P>
<P>
The library has a total floor space of 83,000 sq m and 23 big
reading rooms. It will house 10 million books, a tenth of which
are available for loan, said Wu, who is taking part in the 62nd
general conference of the International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutes (IFLA), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the library will have a catalogue retrieval
and management network, which is linked to the Chinanet and
Internet. Computer reading, audio-video publications and other
services will also be provided through a multi-media system.
</P>
<P>
The library is located in the city's cultural and educational
center, with its European-style buildings, greenery, and
sculpture-dotted square, and will become one of the city's
symbolic buildings, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the architects have gotten some advice from
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who was the mayor of Shanghai when the
library was designed.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the country's biggest city, with a population of 13
million, and has 557 libraries of various kinds. The 40-year-old
Shanghai Library, however, is fast becoming out of date because it
is too small and old, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Library is sponsoring the conference and is a major
destination for conference goers. It covers an area of 170,000 sq
m and has more than 30 reading rooms and a collection of 19
million books.

<HEADLINE> Yemen: Road to Peace Remains Open if Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Yemen said today that the road to
peace between Yemen and Eritrea will remain open if Eritrea
withdraws its troops from the Red Sea island of Lesser Hanish.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's First Foreign Undersecretary Ghaleb Ali Jamil told the
Cairo-based Sawt Al-Arab (Voice of Arabs) Radio that Yemen has
always sought to spare the region and maritime navigation in the
Red Sea any kind of tension and instability.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yemen will continue to safeguard its sovereignty
over its water and land through all political and diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Both Yemen and Eritrea have claimed sovereignty over three Red
Sea islands - Greater and Lesser Hanish islands and Zugar island.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last December when the two sides fought a
fierce battle and Eritrean troops took over Greater Hanish, the
largest of the disputed islands, before a cease-fire took effect.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has come to the fore again after Yemen accused
Eritrean troops of having taken over Lesser Hanish on August 10.
</P>
<P>
Jamil said in the interview with the radio that Eritrea made a
military presence in the island because it had realized the
weakness of its stand in any international arbitration over the
disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
On May 21, Yemen and Eritrea signed a French-brokered
agreement, under which the two countries would settle their
dispute over the islands peacefully through international
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which covers the principles of that arbitration,
was reached following efforts by France, Egypt and Ethiopia to
mediate a solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration agreement has so far failed to bring about a
peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands sit astride major shipping lanes 160
kilometers north of the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb at the mouth of
the Red Sea. Yemen and Eritrea face each other across the strait.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A collection of patriotic essays
recently published has climbed to the No.1 spot in book sales in
China, it was learned today.
</P>
<P>
"China Can Say No" has been a best seller over the past month,
according to the China Publication Distribution Trade Association,
which surveyed 30 major bookstores in big and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The book's articles, written by young scholars and reporters,
for more than 400 pages criticize some of the Chinese's blind
faith in things foreign and the unhealthy feelings they provoke,
and their relation to colonial culture.
</P>
<P>
The book advances the idea that China should follow its own
path and say "no" in answer to irrational demands of western
powers.
</P>
<P>
The book, which was published by the China Industrial and
Commercial Joint Publishing House, has had some response among
Chinese intellectuals and college students.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the second and third place in book
sales went to "Stories on the Return of Hong Kong", and "Situation
and Predictions of the Chinese Economy", published by the Jilin
Photography Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
"The Struggle and Thoughts of Seventy Years", published by the
Publishing House of the Party History of CPC, in which Bo Yibo, an
old revolutionary of the CPC recalls his experiences since the
foundation of the party, was fourth on the list.
</P>
<P>
Other titles in the top ten list are concerned with politics,
party discipline, and social life.

<HEADLINE> Internet Improvements in Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the spread of Internet
services to libraries, people can now enjoy reader services from
various libraries worldwide in the quiet of their homes.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of Library Associations and
Institutes (IFLA) is engaged in a global project to promote
reading and the use of library reference services through the
Internet, which will connect the general office of IFLA with its
regional offices and member libraries.
</P>
<P>
There are now 4,500 customers in 89 countries and regions who
receive some 10,000 documents every week through the library
Internet system, and libraries worldwide are establishing more
data bases in order to change the printed word into electronic
information.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from Beijing University and University of Hong Kong
are conducting research on the Basic Law for the Hong Kong Special
Administration Region through the Internet, according to sources
at the 62nd General Conference of IFLA which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
T.D. Webb, a Ph.D. from the University of Hawaii, said that the
development of electronic information services has made the
library change its function to provide more convenience for
readers.
</P>
<P>
The Internet will help libraries become a public media system
for a greater number of people in the world instead of a reference
warehouse for researchers and scholars.
</P>
<P>
Robert Wedgeworth, president of IFLA, said that competitive
libraries in the future will be those that use the Internet to
provide readers with more services.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Faction Leader Want Peace Keepers to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's faction leader George
Boley has called for the transformation of the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG into a peace enforcement
outfit.
</P>
<P>
The change in role, he believes, would put an end to the
various breaches of the Liberian peace accord, according to the
newspaper the Guardian.
</P>
<P>
Describing ECOMOG as ''to lenient'' in dealing with violations
of the various accords, Boley, the leader of the Liberia Peace
Council and a member of the ruling Council of State in the
country, said ''ECOMOG must be decisive in dealing with
violators.''
</P>
<P>
''So also is the UN Observer Mission in Liberia. Violations
must be documented and they should be prepared to prosecute
violators, only then shall we fall in line,'' he said, quoted by
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He decried the recent attack by forces loyal to Charles
Taylor, Leader of another faction, at positions held by his
troops, saying that ''the world can now see who has been keeping
his words and who has been violating.''
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism under the leadership of Ruth Perry,
the new Chairperson of the Liberian Council of State appointed
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
''She is a very strong person. I believe she would do better.
I am very optimistic that she will try very hard to avoid being
manipulated,'' Boley said, adding that ''with her leadership,
there is hope.''  enditem

<HEADLINE> Two Former South Korean Presidents to Be Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court will
sentence two former South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh
Tae-woo, who are charged with mutiny, treason and bribery, here
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen former South Korean officers who helped the two
ex-presidents in their quest for power will also be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, the prosecution demanded the death penalty for
Chun and life imprisonment for Roh. Both are charged with leading
or playing a key role in the 1979 military revolt and the 1980
suppression of uprising.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the court to fine Chun 278 million U.S. dollars
and Roh 355 million dollars, representing the bribes they
allegedly accumulated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison were
also demanded by the prosecution to the 14 co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes will be set aside for news photographers to take
photos of the defendants during the sentencing session tomorrow, a
court official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Cameramen will be allowed to photograph faces of the defendants
from the front after entering the courtroom, the first time this
has been allowed in the trial of the former presidents.
</P>
<P>
The 16 were indicted early this year for mutiny or treason, or
both. The mutiny and treason charges stem from their roles in the
military revolt on December 12, 1979, and the brutal suppression
of the uprising on May 18, 1980, in Kwangju, capital of South
Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
In December 1979, Chun arrested the then martial law commander
and accused him of complicity in the assassination of President
Park Chung-hee. That made Chun the de facto head of the martial
law command.
</P>
<P>
Chun, then a major general, had been in charge of investigating
Park's death at the hands of his intelligence chief. After
consolidating power, Chun was elected president in 1980 and was
succeeded by his friend, Roh, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for bribery since they received huge illegal
funds from businessmen while in office.

<HEADLINE> Africans Expelled by France Arrive at Home: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three Malians expelled by
France on Saturday arrived at home at 05:17 a.m. today on the
Airbus A310 of the French army, said Agence France Presse (AFP)
reports from Bamako, capital of Mali.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus made a stop earlier today in Dakar, Senegal, to drop
13 Senegalese who were also expelled by France for having no visa
or residential papers.
</P>
<P>
An overall of 57 Africans were loaded into the Airbus plane at
a military air base in Ereux, Upper Normandy, Saturday. Besides
the Malians and Senegalese, 18 Zaireans and two Gabonese are also
due to be dropped in Kinshasa, Zaire, the last leg of the flight.
</P>
<P>
The ground stuff of both Air Africa and Air France in Bamako
airport, and the ground stuff in Dakar airport, refused to work
for the military aircraft to protest the expulsion.
</P>
<P>
A French military "Transall" aircraft based in Dakar had to set
up a boarding bridge for the Airbus plane to let the Africans
disembark. The "Transall" then flew to the Bamako airport to make
similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Some Malian officials receiving the expelled angrily rapped
France for forcing out the immigrants, saying that France is no
longer "a land of tolerance."
</P>
<P>
Only four of the 300 Africans expelled from the Saint-Bernard
Church in Paris on Friday were among the group of immigrants
expelled Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some of the expelled told AFP that they did not eat during the
whole trip and their baggages were missing. Some said that they
were arrested by police in their working places in France.
</P>
<P>
Some political parties and trade unions of Mali will organize a
mass rally today to protest the expulsion.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Praises Egypt's Efforts to Attract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has made great strides in
creating an appropriate atmosphere to attract foreign investments,
according to an official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Al Iriani, Deputy Director of the IMF's Middle East
Department, said that Egypt is making efforts to offer
considerable incentives to foreign investors through its economic
reform program, the Cairo state-run press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Arabs have between 300 to 600 million U.S. dollars outside the
region," he said, adding that the money will return to the region
only if its investment climate improves.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will soon start a new economic reform program to be
officially endorsed by the IMF later this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization, trade liberalization and financial reforms are
considered the basis of the new economic reform program," Iriani
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Egypt began its economic reform in 1991 with the support of the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
Iriani said that Egypt's foreign reserves, which have reached
18 billion U.S. dollars, are more than appropriate and playing an
important role in stabilizing the country's financial market.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in the inflation rate and budget deficit proves
that Egypt's economic reform program is proceeding very well, he
said.

<HEADLINE> New Dead Sea Mineral Cosmetic Product Smooths Out Wrinkles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A liquid gel enriched with a
natural Dead Sea mineral complex has been found superior to other
leading cosmetic products in smoothing the skin's surfaces, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was shown in tests carried out by the Dead Sea
Laboratories at Mitzpe Shalem, along with the Dead Sea Medical
Research Center at Neve Zohar and the Hebrew University's Casali
Institute of Applied Chemistry, The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report published in the July supplement of
the Israel Journal of Medical Sciences as saying that tests by a
laser system found out that the gel's effect is far better than
other 45 leading cosmetic products in the market.
</P>
<P>
Applied daily for a month to the faces of 20 female volunteers
aged 20 to 65, the gel was found to have reduced the wrinkle depth
by 27 percent, while others only by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The researchers concluded that advanced technical and
scientific support for marketing claims of cosmetics will ensure
the reliability and safety of these products, the report said.
</P>
<P>
By conducting performance tests and exploring the physiological
factors behind the "undeniable" skin-improving capabilities of Dead
Sea cosmetics, researchers will be able to use a relatively
higher concentration of minerals in their products.
</P>
<P>
Additional studies, they said, are needed to determine the
optimal concentration of each specific ion in skin cells, what
concentrations may be irritating or toxic to the skin, and what
are the optimal delivery systems for the various ions, the paper
added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Tries to Solve Unemployment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is confronting social
pressures with the rate of unemployment growing fast in both urban
and rural sectors in recent years, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At present, a government official said, the unemployed account
for more than six percent of the urban population while in rural
areas, where most people subsist on agriculture, about 30-40
percent of their working hours are not used and many are left
jobless.
</P>
<P>
The official said the National Fund for Employment Generation
and its network of employment-generating centers nationwide will
assume a crucial role in achieving the target of unemployment
settlement set by the Eighth National Party Congress in 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
The goal set by the congress is to provide jobs for about 7
million people, bring the current rate of unemployment down to
five percent and increase the working time of rural laborers and
farmers to 75-80 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1992-1995, more than 1.1 million people found jobs and one
quarter of them were fund beneficiaries.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Army Pulls out of Karak, Curfew Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government Saturday
withdrew the army from Karak and lifted a curfew imposed on the
southern town following two days of riots in protest against the
increase in the prices of bread and fodder.
</P>
<P>
Army soldiers moved away from the town along with their
armored personnel carriers and equipment, the local daily Jordan
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police maintained a high presence in the key roads leading to
Karak but were not present in strength within the town.
</P>
<P>
"The curfew has been completely lifted because total calm now
prevails in the town," Karak Governor Badereddin Al Wadyan told
the state-run Jordan News Agency, Petra.
</P>
<P>
The governor also said that the army had been withdrawn from
the town and that 30 out of those detained following the riots
were released.
</P>
<P>
Other detainees who did not take part in the riots although
they participated in demonstrations after Friday prayers on August
16 are expected to be released gradually, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Those found to have taken direct part in the violence and
sabotage against public and private property will be sent to
court," said a security source, quoted by the daily.
</P>
<P>
With the reports of releases and arrests highlighted in the
local press, it was not possible to immediately determine how
many remained in detention.
</P>
<P>
Officials said early last week that 150 people were arrested,
but then raised the number to 190.
</P>
<P>
Among those who were still held Saturday were at least 10
members and supporters of the pro-Iraq Jordan Arab Socialist
Baath Party, nine supporters and members of the Jordanian
Communist Party, 14 members of the Jordan People's Democratic
Party, 13 members of the Jordan People's Unity Party and the
leader of the Ansar Party, the daily said in another report.
</P>
<P>
The curfew was imposed on Karak on August 17, after town
residents staged violent demonstrations, clashed with police and
attacked government buildings and private property for two days
running. On Sunday, the army was deployed.
</P>
<P>
No incidents were reported since Saturday in Karak or any of
the other trouble-hit southern towns, including Tafileh, Ma'an,
Muta, Moab and Al Mazar.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates put the damage caused in Karak in the
"bread riots" at 4 million dinars (about 6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The curfew was completely lifted and the army withdrawn from
Karak after Friday (August 23) passed without incident except a
peaceful demonstration demanding a reversal of the government's
decision to increase the prices of bread and rechannel subsidies
through a direct cash compensation system.
</P>
<P>
However, King Hussein and Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti
have firmly rejected any reversal of the decision, which is part
of the economic reform program that Jordan is undertaking in
coordination with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The King hinted that other measures such as a wage increase to
help the people was under consideration, but that any discussion
on such issues could come only after complete normalcy has been
restored throughout the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in seven years that riots broke out in
the south. In early 1989, residents of Karak and other southern
towns, which are widely seen as the power base of King Hussein
and his Hashimite family, rioted against an increase in price of
fuel, also under the economic restructuring program.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand's Elephant Population Dwindles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Habitat destruction and
exploitation have caused Thailand's elephant population to plummet
further closer to extinction.
</P>
<P>
Elephants, which were in the past regarded as good friends of
the Thais, are now less indispensable for the changed society and
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
They are no longer needed to carry soldiers in battles and
demand for them has decreased because of clampdowns on logging
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Rapid depletion of their natural habitat, dwindling logging
industry and low birthrate (less than 15 calves are born a year)
have all contributed to the drop of the elephant population in
Thailand, now estimated at between 3,000-4,000.
</P>
<P>
Their once lush habitat has turned into village settlements or
mining areas: their migratory routes transformed into road
networks and their forests turned into barren land through heavy
deforestation or cleared for development projects.
</P>
<P>
While owners and mahouts go to cities to look for better jobs,
and insufficient jobs are available for their elephants to earn
money for their owners, the creatures, which consume about 200-250
kg of vegetation costing more than 500 baht (20 U.S. dollars) per
head per day, have become a burden.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,000 elephants have been abandoned to fend for
themselves in north Thailand, and a good number of them are
roaming Bangkok streets or kept at amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
The animals' tendency to rampage through farmland causes
conflicts with villagers, who often arm themselves to fight off or
even kill intruding elephants.
</P>
<P>
In some northern provinces, villagers are beginning to hunt the
animals for their meat, which sells for 60 baht (2.4 dollars) per
kilogram and is considered a local delicacy, pushing the animals
further closer to the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians have not yet succeeded in breeding elephants
through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife conservationists have called for urgent measures to
save, before too late, the largest land mammals, which on average
are about three meters tall at the shoulder and weigh about 5,000
kilograms.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Willing to Meet with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
has said that he will meet with Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat in the near future if Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu does not, Israel Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
Officials close to the president told the radio that Weizman
made this decision because he felt that the Middle East peace
process is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
The same sources said that Weizman had also consulted with
senior Israeli politicians and security officials before making
the decision.
</P>
<P>
Ariel Shumer, director-general at the President's House, is
reported to have rejected all efforts to dissuade the president
from initiating the meeting with the PA leader.
</P>
<P>
Since he took office in June, Netanyahu has repeatedly asserted
that there will be a variety of channels in dealing with the
Palestinians. But the new premier refused to say if or under what
conditions he would meet with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Officials believed that a meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu was essential before any serious talks could begin
on the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for high-level talks, and that means between
Arafat and Netanyahu," said Arafat's aide Nabil Abu Rudeineh.
</P>
<P>
When it happens, "I am sure the first meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu will be difficult, but I am certain it will be less
difficult than the first one between Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin,"
the assassinated Israeli premier, said Ahmed Tibi, a close
adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting between Arafat and the late Israeli prime
minister took place in early October 1993 when the two leaders
held talks on implementing the historic PLO-Israeli peace
agreement signed in Washington, the United States, on September 13
the same year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources also expected that such a meeting
will be necessary before any Israeli army redeployment in the
disputed West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Arafat has reportedly confirmed that
the joint Palestinian-Israeli steering committee will resume the
negotiations on implementing the Oslo accords this week.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official said that Israel wants the
meeting of the committee to take place before the assembly of the
donor countries on September 4, and that this would demonstrate
Israel's commitment to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to the Palestinian official, Israel's move came in
response to an Egyptian threat to cancel a Middle East economic
summit scheduled for November in Cairo, if Israel fails to keep
its promises to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak threatened to
cancel the planned regional economic summit, unless Israel honors
its commitments to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a gathering of university students in the Egyptian
port city of Alexandria, Mubarak said that he had told the
Israelis that stagnation in the peace process would affect the
economic summit, because many countries would boycott it.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu made a phone call the same day to the
Egyptian president and promised him that Israel would shortly
resume the peace negotiations with the PA, including the meeting
of the steering committee.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told his cabinet Friday that the Israeli and
Palestinian teams would be meeting "in the coming week."

NEW DELHI -- The death toll of pilgrims to the Amarnath shrine

<P>
Pilgrims from plains were caught in severe cold following snow
and torrential rains which brought down the temperature sharply.

This is the second time in the Indian history that a terrible
tragedy has stuck the Amarnath pilgrims. About 40 devotees had
died because of cloudburst and landslides in 1969.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expels Iraqi Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan asked Saturday a senior
Iraqi diplomat to leave the country in three days and to shorten
the term of a press attache at the Iraqi embassy for their alleged
involvement in intelligence activities, an informed source was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion notice was the firmest diplomatic action that
Jordan has taken against Iraq following "clear indications" that
the Iraqi government had instigated August 16-17 riots in
southern Jordan, the English-language newspaper Jordan Times
quoted the source as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the chief of protocol at the Jordanian
Foreign Ministry, Ahmad Al Hassan, summoned the Iraqi Charge
d'Affaires, Hikmat Abeul Razak Al Hajou, and conveyed the demand
to him.
</P>
<P>
"The government asked that Khaled Rashid Musleh, a first
secretary at the Iraqi embassy who arrived here recently, to leave
the kingdom because the Foreign Ministry has rejected his
nomination for accreditation," said the unidentified source.
</P>
<P>
"Musleh has been given three days to leave the kingdom," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the Jordanian authorities have
information that Musleh "is an Iraqi intelligence officer."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Musleh was banned from entering Jordan
from Iraq when he arrived to take office.
</P>
<P>
The source corrected that report and said Musleh was at the
Iraqi mission and the embassy had filed a nomination for his
accreditation as a diplomat in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Hassan also informed the Iraqi charge
d'Affaires that the government would like to see that Adel
Ibrahim, press attache at the embassy, leave Jordan "as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said Ibrahim's term of office was about to
end.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government would not mind if he stayed for "one
or two weeks" but "not a few months," Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, sources had indicated that Ibrahim, who took office
here in December 1992, had already been served notice to leave on
grounds of "activities incompatible with his diplomatic status" -
a euphemism for intelligence gathering or spying activity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Higher Education announced recently
that it was refusing scholarships for Jordanian students to study
in Iraq, which is aimed at reducing the number of Jordanian
students in Iraq at between 4,000 and 4,500.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the manager of the Iraqi Rafidain Bank,
Abdul Wahab Al Dalaeen, a Jordanian national, was arrested on
charges that he had financed sabotage attempts in last week's
riots in the south.
</P>
<P>
According to another report in the daily, King Hussein,
speaking to reporters after chairing a cabinet session on
Saturday night that reviewed the situation in the country after
the riots, was asked whether Iraq was involved in the riots.
</P>
<P>
"Your imagination is not far from the truth," replied the
king. "We have evidence derived from investigations."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher told the press that
"there is proof of the involvement of some official Iraqi
parties" in the so-called "bread riots."
</P>
<P>
Asked on whether the government intends to outlaw any
political party, the pro-Iraq Arab Socialist Baath Party in
particular, Muasher said "appropriate measures" would be taken
after the court issues its ruling in all cases.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Beer Maker to Boost Production in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A leading Japanese beer brewer
will increase its output in China seven times by 2000 to take full
advantage of China's burgeoning beer market, the Kyodo News
Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Suntory Ltd., Japan's fourth largest beer producer, will
enlarge its annual production to some 40 million cases, or 500,000
kiloliters, by 2000, nearly the same as its domestic output last
year of 37.5 million cases, Kyodo quoted the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
as saying.
</P>
<P>
While planning to step up production in two existing factories
in China, the company will also open two new factories in joint
ventures in the eastern China province of Jiangsu, which are
expected to produce 20 million cases of beer a year.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 5 billion yen (47 million U.S. dollars) will be
invested in the new factories to be built in several years.
</P>
<P>
In a contrast to Japan's declining beer consumption, China's
beer consumption surges at an annual rate of 10 percent. China
now ranks second in the world's big beer consumers, with an annual
consumption of about 15 million kiloliters.

<HEADLINE> Disagreement Puts Off Commonwealth Group's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The proposed visit of the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to Nigeria sheducled
for August 29 and 30 has been postponed following disagreement
between the group and the Nigerian government over the assignment
of CMAG, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi said last week
that contrary to expectations, CMAG was not coming to Nigeria on
a fact-finding mission. It was invited by head of state general
Sani Abacha to continue dialogue on how to re-admit the country
into the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Punch newspaper, the group led by
Foreign Minister of Zimbabwe Stan Nudenge disagreed with this
position.
</P>
<P>
CMAG's mandate includes the assessment of the political and
human rights situations in Nigeria and ascertaining whether they
tally with the 1991 Harare Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The mission's findings are expected to influence the review of
the suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ikimi said it would not be possible for the group to
visit political and human rights prisoners in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
CMAG would only parley with government officials to discuss
the transition program and other relevant matters, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had a meeting in London last June. After that,
CMAG suspended recommended multilateral sanctions against
Nigeria, pending the outcome of the planned august 29-30 meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the commonwealth heads of government who
should ratify CMAG decision are due to meet in September when
Nigeria's political and human rights situations are expected to
be reviewed.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM to Visit Egypt Soon: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy has received an invitation to visit Egypt in the near
future, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"Currently no date has yet been fixed, but it is probably in
next week. We are discussing certain matters related to the
visit," Yigal Palmor told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Egypt extended the invitation to Levy as soon as he took
office in June, but Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny
reiterated the invitation recently, Palmor said.
</P>
<P>
This will be Levy's first working visit to Egypt, although
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already visited
Cairo in July on his first trip to an Arab country after assuming
office.
</P>
<P>
Noting the leading role that Egypt has been playing in the
Middle East peace process, Israel placed great importance on
Levy's first visit to Cairo, Palmor added.
</P>
<P>
Levy's visit will come at a crucial time in view of Israel's
concerns that Egypt, disappointed with Israel's lack of
initiatives in restarting the peace process, might cancel an
important economic summit due in November.
</P>
<P>
However, Palmor denied reports that Egypt ever threatened to
cancel the Cairo summit on regional economic cooperation in order
to pressure Israel to advance the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said it will be
difficult to go ahead with the planned Middle East economic
conference in Cairo unless Israel moves forward in peace talks
with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The statement was Mubarak's first hint about canceling the
November conference over Israel's stalling on peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu immediately telephoned Mubarak on the same day to
assure him that peace talks with the Palestinians would resume "in
the very near future."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel had informed PNA President
Yasser Arafat that the negotiations would begin next week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said that Israel was anxious to resume
the formal peace talks before a meeting of international donors on
September 5, who have pledged support for the Israeli-Arab peace
process.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Israeli government intended to ease the
pressure on it over freezing the peace talks and to show the
donors that it is committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had
responded to a letter sent to him a week ago by Arafat, who
complained of Israel's hardline polices. Clinton promised that
the U.S. is still committed to the peace process and is ready to
facilitate an agreement.

DHAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Fresh clashes between the rival
student organizations left one student bullet hit on Saturday
morning on the Dhaka university, the leading university of
Bangladesh, said campus sources.

The injured student was identified as Bashir Ahmed, who is a

the largest opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The JCD activists later held a rally in front of the national

protesting what it called terrorism by the activists of Bangladesh
Chhatra League (BCL), backed by the ruling Awami (people's)
League.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the JCD had also called a day-long strike in all
educational institutions across the country for Sunday, following
clashes with police on the Dhaka university campus on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice Chancellor of the Dhaka university Prof.
Emajuddin Ahmed resigned on Saturday for what he said "the
government's failure to improve" the law and order on the campus.
</P>
<P>
Two more provosts of halls also resigned on the same day,
raising the number to six. The proctor of the university had also
resigned earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka university authorities had announced to extend the
closure of classes and examinations till August 29 against the
backdrop of prevailing volatile campus situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The opposition members of

<HEADLINE> Local Governments in Tibet Pay Attention to People's Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Governments in the Tibet
Autonomous Region have earnestly responded to proposals made by
deputies to the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress, the
regional legislature.
</P>
<P>
At last year's 3rd Session of the 6th Regional People's
Congress, deputies from all walks of life across Tibet,
representing over two million Tibetans, put forward many proposals
and aired criticism on matters related to the reform, development
and stability in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 214 proposals concerning the work of
government departments had been handled. About 22 percent of the
problems listed by the deputies in their proposals have been
solved.
</P>
<P>
Proposals being handled account for nearly 51 percent of the
total, according to a leading official of the regional government.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the proposal of Yexi Chilai on redoubling
efforts to aid the poor, the regional government sent 39 special
teams to grassroots units to help rural residents draw up
development plans and take feasible steps to achieve prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government and the regional government
have allocated large amounts of money to develop resources in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Low-interest loans extended by the central government for this
purpose reached 30 million yuan (3.6 million US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The regional government decided in October 1995 to essentially
eliminate poverty throughout Tibet by the end of this century, the
official noted.
</P>
<P>
The central and regional governments have spent a total of 30
million yuan on environmental protection around the Yangbajain
Geothermal Power Station after deputies stressed the need to
control pollution at the station.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a proposal by Deputy Cering Zhouga to
continue to assist Tibet's handicraft industry, government
departments at all levels have taken a number of flexible
policies, and allocated large amounts of funds to the industries,
according to the Regional Planning and Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Most deputies are satisfied with the government's response to
the proposals they made last year, the official of the regional
government said.
</P>
<P>
"They are even more enthusiastic this year in participating in
managing government affairs," he said, adding that they have made
more proposals.
</P>
<P>
So far the regional government has received 243 proposals from
the deputies, 35 percent of which are considered constructive on
the speeding up of infrastructure construction, and expanding
agricultural production and livestock breeding.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels will respond to the deputies within a
prescribed time, and will improve the efficiency of handling their
proposals, said Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Regional government.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Provide Loans for Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) may provide stabilizing loans within the year to support the
Ukraine's issue of its new currency, the grevna, a Ukrainian
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Ukrainian Agency of Recovery and Development,
Roman Shpek, told Respublika (independent press agency) that the
loans would amount to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They might be given in the next six months as short-term loans
on condition that they were repaid within a year.
</P>
<P>
An inspecting mission from the IMF was satisfied with the
Ukraine's commitment to the Fund's "stand-by" program after a
visit to the country from August 10-23.
</P>
<P>
This entitled the Ukraine to get the fifth and sixth "stand-by"
loans from IMF without the permission of its council, Shpek said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine has postponed the issue of its new currency,
originally planned for October 1995, because of the absence of the
fourth "stand-by" loan from the IMF.

<HEADLINE> India's Private Bread Makers to Halt Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The All India Bread
Manufacturers' Association (AIBMA), a private organization of
bread makers, has decided to stop production to protest against
the "discriminatory" policy of the government which has only
allotted wheat at subsidized price to the public sector Modern
Food Industries, it is learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of small scale units have already closed down and
thousands are on the verge of closure, said AIBMA President D.K.
Juneja.
</P>
<P>
The total requirement of bread in New Delhi is reportedly about
one million loaves per day and Modern Bread controls almost 35
percent of this market.
</P>
<P>
There are 35 bread manufacturing units in the city on small
scale basis covering about 65 percent share of the bread market.
They have found it hard to sell their products because of the high
prices, Juneja said.
</P>
<P>
"The main demand of the bread industries is that either the
same subsidy should be extended to the private sector or the
facility to Modern Bread be discontinued to save the industry from
perishing under the pressure of unfair competition," Juneja
further said.

BRASILIA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian domestic gross
product will grow nearly 3 percent this year, Brazilian
Finance Minister Pedro Malan said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Malan also forecast a 4.5 percent to 5 percent economic
growth for 1997 which would continue in 1998. He was speaking at a

</P>
<P>
These figures meant that the growth from 1993 to 1998 would be
more than 30 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malan gave an assurance that Brazil was at the start of a new
era of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The government would create conditions to sustain the growth,
"and without doubt we will achieve that objective," he said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, the Brazilian government had to deal with the
modernization of the state, the reduction of the consolidated
budget deficit, administrative reform and the continuation of the
privatization program, Malan said.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)
announced today that the domestic gross product of the South

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States
ambassador to Colombia, Myles Frechette, today asked Colombia to
reinstate extradition in order to fight organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Frechette, who saw extradition as a supremely efficacious
weapon in foiling international crime, said: "We have asked
Colombia to reintroduce extradition but it would have to be made
through a change in the Constitution, and that would take time."
</P>
<P>
He told the press that the request won support from the G-7
countries, comprising Britain, France, Russia, Japan, Italy,
Germany, Canada as well as the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Ernesto Samper government agreed to hold a national
referendum on the matter.
</P>
<P>
On June 18, 1991, the Colombian Congress passed a
constitutional amendment prompted by a 1990 proposal of the then
president, Cesar Gaviria, refusing to extradite Colombian-born
criminals to foreign authorities if they surrendered to the
Colombian authorities.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Business People Praise Hainan's Public Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hainan became a special economic zone in 1988, it had a
few economic cooperation projects with Taiwan, but Taiwanese have
by now set up more than 1,000 enterprises in Hainan, with a total
investment of 1.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The policy of opening to the outside world has attracted a
large number of people from other parts of China to Hainan, where
flexible policies are encouraging investors.
</P>
<P>
Since a crack-down on crimes started last April, a large number
of criminals have been arrested, according to a senior police
officer of the Hainan Provincial Department of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese head of the Zhongbao Timber Industry Company in
the capital of Haikou said that since last April, drug addicts who
used to loiter near the company are all gone and he and his
employees feel very secure now.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Cheng, who runs a gift and souvenir store in Haikou, said
that public order in Hainan is much better than that in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The number of crimes in Qionghai City plunged 20.3 percent in
1995 and the crime rate dropped to an all-time low of 1.16 per
10,000 persons.
</P>
<P>
Li Chengcheng, a Taiwanese businessman who has set up a large
aquatic products farm in Qionghai City, said that there have been
no thefts or robberies on his farm and noted, "I think good human
relations and a secure social environment are the biggest capital
that Qionghai has given us. It is precisely because of this that I
have come to Qionghai to open my farm."

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Around Volcano Ready for Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Following the increasing
activity of Mountain Merapi in central Java, the local authorities
have issued a warning to thousands of people living around the
volcano to prepare for evacuation at any time, Antara news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A volcanologist in Yogjakarta, some 500 kilometers southeast of
Jakarta, said the volcano spewed thick fumes 23 times in five
hours last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Smoldering lava from Mt. Merapi rolled down as far as 3.5
kilometers from its crater heading towards Boyong, Krasak and
Kuning rivers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The volcano's monitoring office has upgraded the volcano's
status from "alert" to "ready", a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 30 percent of the 250,000 cubic meters of lava
that have accumulated on top of Mt. Merapi has caved in on Friday,
triggering hot air waves that moved down the slopes of the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
According to the Volcanology Office in Yogjakarta on Saturday,
only 20,000 cubic meters of the mass of lava were left intact.
</P>
<P>
The 2,962-meter-high Mt. Merapi, one of the most active
volcanoes in the world, is located at the center of one of
Indonesia' most populous regions and less than 30 kilometers from
Yogjakarta, home to one million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Its last eruption in 1993 killed more than 60 people and forced
some 60,000 people to evacuate.

<HEADLINE> Robbers Target Bangkok Petrol Stations, Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Operators of 24-hour petrol
stations and convenience stores in Bangkok have expressed concern
about their safety and sales following a sharp rise in the number
of hold-ups in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, 15 robbery cases have been
reported in Bangkok, of which six are reported in August alone.
</P>
<P>
Most of the robberies took place late at night.
</P>
<P>
Operators fear that they may face a drop in sales if petrol
stations and convenience stores under brand name companies are
frequently robbed, as customers may turn away from them, thinking
that the outlets' safety measures are inefficient.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, police arrested two suspects, Veena Sangkhao, 21,
and Kavi Pinyosphon 22.
</P>
<P>
Veena has allegedly confessed to robbing 14 petrol stations in
north and west Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan police commissioner Sophon Waratchanon said
manpower shortages make it difficult for the police to concentrate
at petrol stations, because thefts, bank hold-ups and other crimes
could also occur anywhere and anytime.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of Pilgrims in Kashmir Rises to 120 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of pilgrims to
the Amarnath shrine (one of the noted Hindu temples) in the
India-held south Kashmir has risen to 120 so far due to
unseasonable snowfall and torrential rains in the past few days,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 94 pilgrims lost their lives during the past 48
hours while more than 80,000 devotees were stranded at various
places. The toll could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims from plains were caught in severe cold following snow
and torrential rains which brought down the temperature sharply.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in the Indian history that a terrible
tragedy has stuck the Amarnath pilgrims. About 40 devotees had
died because of cloudburst and landslides in 1969.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces have launched massive relief and rescue
operations for the pilgrims and the evacuation of stranded
pilgrims has begun.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Over 460 solely foreign-owned
and Sino-overseas joint ventures have been set up in Pujiang
Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
The success is due to efforts by the local government to
improve the investment environment in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The zone, which is located in Pujiang County in East China's
Zhejiang Province, was opened in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The zone, covering five square kilometers, has favorable
geographical conditions, with neighboring Yiwu city having the
country's largest commodity market. It is only 10 km away from
Yiwu Airport, while Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and Hangzhou-Jinhua
highway pass through the zone.
</P>
<P>
The local government has made huge investments improving the
zone's infrastructure, including transportation facilities, water
and power supplies, and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the zone generated a gross industrial output value of
800 million yuan, with crystal handicraft manufacturing playing a
major role. The output of the zone's crystal-made decorative
electric lights make up 90 percent of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Most MNLF Fighters Remain Threat to Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Renato de Villa has said that most fighters of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) would remain a threat to security after
the integration of 7,500 MNLF members into the military and police
services.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press quoted the defense secretary as saying that
unless a separate socio-economic program is carried out for them,
the remaining MNLF members might join other rebel groups and
emerge as the new security problem for Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said that although it is already certain that 7,500 MNLF
rebels will be absorbed in the military and police services, there
will be some 17,000 rebels left out in the cold, carrying around
11,000 firearms and whose future remain uncertain.
</P>
<P>
This group of rebels should be provided with its own
socio-economic package to prevent its recruitment by other rebel
groups such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the Abu
Sayyaf and the National Islamic Command Council, the defense
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that some MNLF members who were unhappy
with the ongoing peace negotiations between their leader Nur
Misuari and the government have defected to the MILF, helping the
MILF become a more potent threat to the peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and Abu Sayyaf have reportedly vowed to continue
seeking the Muslim independence in the southern Philippines and
oppose the peace deal between the government and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
According to the military chief, the Abu Sayyaf is plotting to
derail the ongoing talks by assassinating some top critics of the
proposed Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development
(SPCPD) and then blaming it on the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, Misuari assailed the Abu Sayyaf, saying
government soldiers and MNLF fighters might have to join forces
and wage a war against Abu Sayyaf terrorists in order to win peace
in Mindanao.

<P>
LHASA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of the renovation
of the Qinghai-Tibet road, a state key project to support the
economic development of the Tibet Autonomous Region, is expected
to be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
The road, one of the two major roads to the Tibet, is the
highest road in the world, with an average elevation of 4,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
The renovation work started five years ago with investment of
800 million yuan from the central government.

government built a sand-rock road in the 1950s and carried out
large scale transformation in the late 1970s and 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Reforms on State-Owned Enterprises Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to carry out reforms
in the state-owned industrial sector, which has become the
Achilles heel of the national economy due to the accumulating
losses, according to a report in today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the State Statistics Bureau said that during the
Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000), the government will choose 1,000
backbone enterprises in the sector to establish large-scale
industrial groups through merger.
</P>
<P>
They noted that bankruptcy can be a way to halt the operational
losses of some crumbling enterprises, but may also lead to the
tie-up of assets in those state businesses.
</P>
<P>
Loss-making performance at some factories is currently
attributed to five factors: irrational products mix, lack of
working capital, small production scale, poor management and heavy
social welfare burden.
</P>
<P>
But, by taking each other's advantages in manufacturing
technology and managerial knowledge, it is hopeful that state
firms can not only set up competitive industrial groups but also
reorganize their employment structure.
</P>
<P>
With progressing reform, problems in the state industrial
sector have become visible than ever, the bureau said, adding that
last year 43 percent of the the state-owned firms suffered
operational losses, valued at 88.3 billion yuan (10.6 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
At a national conference with participants from the bureau, the
State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance and
the People's Bank of China last week, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
Highlighted the effectiveness of technical progress in rescuing
state firms.
</P>
<P>
The state firms could be much more competitive after they cut
down or eliminate their self-defeating characteristics, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In 58 cities chosen for the reform, at least 215 state
companies with 9.35 billion yuan (1.13 billion US dollars) worth
of property and 172,000 employees were merged with other companies
during the first six months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Three Injured in Bomb Blast at Ohio Golf Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Three people were injured
when a small homemade bomb exploded in a garbage can behind the
first tee of the World Series of Golf in Akron, Ohio, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The blast at the Firestone Country Club scattered debris, which
hit spectator Vicky Miller in the chest and cut Jan Schneller's
leg, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Also injured was elderly volunteer worker Jerome Horning, who
said he had ringing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
Police said it was a homemade device and definitely not a pipe
bomb, revealing it was placed in one of the waste receptacle and
detonated immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported that they saw two young men toss cans into
the receptacle just before the blast.
</P>
<P>
The blast came at about 3 p.m. of local time, about 10 minutes
after the final group of the day had teed off from the area with
hundreds of spectators surrounding the area.
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be the first such incident at a golf
tournament. The Akron competition is a 2.1 million U.S. dollar
elite event restricted to 43 tournament winners from around the
world.

NEW YORK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- French Open champion Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia has announced to pull out of the upcoming
U.S. Open due to a rib injury, reports said Saturday.

MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The secretary of Russia's
Security Council, Alexander Lebed, held negotiations today on
Chechnya's future status with the chief of staff of the rebel
Chechnya forces, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, in the village of Novye Atagi, 20 kilometers
south of the Chechen capital Grozny, were aimed at drafting a
broader political agreement following Friday's new military deal
to end the war.

according to Movladi Udugov, information minister of the
rebels. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Udugov said that Lebed and Maskhadov would continue their talks
Sunday morning to finalize the political agreement.

Lebed returned to Chechnya this morning after briefing Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on the military agreement he signed with
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Following the deal, a cease-fire started at noon (0800 GMT)
Friday across the rebel republic of the Russian Federation. The
situation was reported to be generally calm.
</P>
<P>
Lebed and Maskhadov have agreed that Russian troops besieged in
Grozny since August 6, as well as the rebels who seized the city,
would return to their bases outside the city.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the city would be patrolled by joint
groups.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Russia will start pulling out troops on
Saturday from the southern parts of Chechnya where rebel positions
are especially strong.

<HEADLINE> Families Ensure Stable Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A campaign launched in 1992 to
encourage self-governing bodies among farmers in Muping led to a
48 percent drop in criminal cases last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, crimes were reduced in nearly 90 percent of
the villages in Yantai, in the Muping District of east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
"Family interests and reputation are major concerns of most
farmers," said Cong Fengzi, deputy director of the Women's
Federation of Muping District. "The self-governing organizations
put emphasis on these aspects and are welcomed by the farmers."
</P>
<P>
Such organizations are aimed at improving the peasants' sense
of morality and law, raising their educational level and promoting
local economy.
</P>
<P>
Gambling and prostitution have appeared in the rural areas
where the economy is developing, Cong Fengzi said, and marital
disputes, lack of support for the elderly and poor relationships
between neighbors have increased in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Half of the homicides and personal injuries in Muping in the
past few years were caused by family disputes, which were related
directly to the ignorance of law, according to Cong.
</P>
<P>
The district authorities began to regard the construction of
farmers' self-governing organizations as the foundation of
government work in the countryside in 1992. These organizations
set up files for families, provided legal services and improved
family relationships by sponsoring family entertainments.
</P>
<P>
The groups have promoted the understanding between family
members and neighborhoods and created a stable social environment
in Muping District, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Silversmith in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- White-haired Mima sits in his
small workroom, carefully shining several silver-coated wooden
bowls.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 77 years old, but I will feel uncomfortable if I don't
work on my silverware several hours a day," he says with pride.
</P>
<P>
The old man works in a silver handicrafts plant in Xigaze, the
second largest city in the Tibet Autonomous Region, where he makes
silver items in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
Three times during his long life, Mima has helped craft the
stupas of the Panchen Lamas. Like the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama
is one of the two religious leaders of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery in Xigaze is the residence of the
successive Panchen Lamas. Since the fourth Panchen Lama's reign,
splendid stupas have been built in the lamasery where the lama's
remains are stored.
</P>
<P>
In 1942, 23-year-old Mima was recruited to construct the stupa
for the Ninth Panchen Lama. He started work as a silversmith when
he was eight, and became an independent craftsman at 16.
</P>
<P>
Mima and more than 60 other craftsmen polished and engraved the
stupa's golden roof. The artisans worked year-round, except on the
coldest winter days, and completed the project in five years.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Mima helped construct a stupa to be used for collected
remains of the Fourth to Ninth Panchen Lamas, whose individual
stupas were destroyed during the so-called "Cultural Revolution"
(1966-1976). The central government later decided to build one
stupa for all of the Lamas.
</P>
<P>
Mima was appointed technical director of the reconstruction
project.
</P>
<P>
The 10th Panchen Lama died in Xigaze in 1989, not long after
the inauguration of the combined stupa.
</P>
<P>
According to Mima, the stupas of earlier Lamas were all made of
silver, but the one for the 10th Panchen Lama, which was
state-funded, was coated with gold.
</P>
<P>
Records show that the Chinese government spent 64 million yuan
(7.99 million US dollars) to build the stupa, which was made from
614 kg of gold, 275 kg of silver, and other materials.
</P>
<P>
In past years, Tibetan craftsmen had a low social status and
worked only to provide goods for the ruling class, Mima
said. While building the stupa for the fourth Panchen Lama, Mima
and his fellow craftsmen worked day and night, but were paid very
little.
</P>
<P>
He now lives happily with his children and grandchildren. "It
is the Communist Party and the people's government that have
brought such happy life to us goldsmiths and silversmiths," he
said.
</P>
<P>
After democratic reform was carried out in Tibet in 1959, the
local governments in Xigaze organized mutual-assistance groups
among the craftsmen. In the 1980s, the central and Tibet regional
governments appropriated funds to help them establish processing
plants.
</P>
<P>
Mima said that there are more than 60 craftsmen in his plant,
who are leading a better life thanks to the policy of reform and
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more people have the means to process or buy gold
and silver items, which keeps the craftsmen busy, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Special Stamps on Ancient Emperors' Tombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China has issued a set of
special stamps with the tombs of emperors of Western Xia Dynasty
(1038-1227) as the theme.
</P>
<P>
It is the first set of stamps reflecting the historical culture
of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and the second set of stamps
with emperors' tombs as a theme.
</P>
<P>
The set includes four stamps which feature a tomb platform, two
tomb monuments and bird-shaped porcelain decorations from the
tomb's door.
</P>
<P>
Western Xia Dynasty was a feudal kingdom set up by ancient
Dangxiang ethnic group. Its capital was located in Xingqing
Prefecture, which is the current Yinchuan city, capital of Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region. It existed for 190 years.
</P>
<P>
Nine emperors were buried in the Western Xia Tombs, known as
the "oriental pyramids" because of its architectural style.
</P>
<P>
The tombs were listed as state key cultural relics sites in
1988.

<HEADLINE> Sanchez Vicario To Meet Date at Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of
Spain rallied to beat Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic 1-6, 6-2,
6-3 in Saturday's semifinals of the Toshiba Tennis Classic
tournament in Carlsbad, California.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario, the meet's No. 1 who qualified for the finals
in her fifth straight tournament, will face Japan's Kimiko Date, a
6-2, 7-5 winner over Conchita Martinez.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario and Novotna, who have teamed up to win 15
doubles titles and will play together in the U.S. Open, exchanged
a cursory handshake at the conclusion of the match.
</P>
<P>
Although Sanchez Vicario is usually a slow starter, the first
set was surprising because it was Novotna who had played late
Friday night in a three-set, quarterfinal-round victory over
France's Sandrine Testud.
</P>
<P>
But Novotna's form was on from the beginning. Her booming serve
was on as she made 80 percent of her first serves. By the second
set, however, the third-seeded Novotna clearly was fatigued.
</P>
<P>
Novotna was forced to play only 12 hours after her Friday night
match because television wanted to show her match with Sanchez
Vicaro instead of the Date-Martinez semi.
</P>
<P>
Date needed only 29 minutes to win the first set over Martinez
and that gave her some breathing room when the Spaniard rallied.
</P>
<P>
Date breezed through the first set behind her steady baseline
game. Martinez improved in the second set, but lost her chance to
win when she held a 5-4 lead and couldn't break Date's serve in
the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
"She played very well," Martinez was quoted as saying. "She hit
the ball very flat. I was in the defensive all the time."

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi to Increase Efforts in MRL Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to complete
construction of a comprehensive mountain, river, and lake (MRL)
project in Jiangxi within 50 years, by combining efforts with
Germany and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The "sustainable development project", which was at the top of
the list in China's "Agenda for the 21st Century", consists of 24
experimental environmental and economic development projects,
which were started in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 foreign experts and business people from more
than ten countries and international organizations have visited
the province, and Germany has taken the lead in providing
construction funds and technology, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
"Jiangxi will build a model project that is a combination of
environmental and economic development among the developing
countries in about 50 years," Governor Wu Guanzheng recently told
visiting German officials and specialists.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the German-funded projects began in
February of this year, with an investment of six million
deutschmarks. A ten-year co-operation contract has been signed
between China and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Medvedev, Damm to Vie for Hamlet Cup Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Fifth seed Andrei Medvedev of
Ukraine and unseeded Martin Damm of the Czech Republic will clash
for the title of the Hamlet Cup tennis tournament after winning
their semifinals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev beat unseeded Karol Kucera, Slovakia, 7-6 (7-0), 6-3
while Damm surged to defeat Adrian Voinea of Romania 5-7, 7-5,
7-5.
</P>
<P>
Voinea played most of the match with a taped sprained ankle and
was kept running by Damm.
</P>
<P>
And Voinea, who was expected to meet world number one and
defending champion American Pete Sampras in the upcoming U.S. Open
in the first round under the draw, may be forced to pull out by
the injury.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev swept the tiebreaker, getting three of the points on
three of Kucera's 10 doublefaults. Kucera, who had upset top-seed
American Michael Chang on Friday, led 3-1 in the second set but
Medvedev won the last five games.
</P>
<P>
Voinea extended Damm through five match points, two in the
10th game of the third set and three more in the final game. He
erased the first four with winners but missed the baseline on the
fifth.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Identifies Bosnian Election Trouble Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 24 (Xinhua) - NATO-led Implementation
Force(IFOR) said on Saturday that it has identified 12
municipalities in Bosnia where violence is likely to flare up on
the upcoming election day.
</P>
<P>
According to a map provided by IFOR, there are also 13 places
characterized as "tension possible" when hundreds of thousands of
refugees are expected to cross the boundary to vote in home towns
or villages now controlled by their ethnic foes.
</P>
<P>
Of the trouble spots, 13 are in the Muslim-Croat federation, 9
inside the Republka Srpska with the remaining places being where
the inter-entity boundary just cuts through.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Max Marriner said that the
main responsibility for providing security for the refugees rests
with the local police, but IFOR will stand in if local authorities
are unable or unwilling to do so.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that IFOR will pursue a "containment" policy to
prevent refugees from going back to municipalities of their former
residency if they are to be confronted by "stone-equipped or
stick-equipped crowds" waiting on the other side of the boundary.
