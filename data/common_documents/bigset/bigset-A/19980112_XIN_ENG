<HEADLINE> Earth Faces Exhaustion as World Economies Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) - Unprecedented world economic
growth is beginning to "hit the wall" of what the earth's natural
systems can stand, an authoritative report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by the Worldwatch on Sunday, said the
global economy has grown by 5 trillion US dollars in the past
seven years, more than in the entire 10000 years between the birth
of agriculture and the end of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
It said that global output of goods and services has grown
almost sixfold since 1950. Last year's growth, of 1.1 trillion US
dollars, exceeded the growth in output throughout the world during
the entire 17th century.
</P>
<P>
If it continues to grow at this rate, it will almost double
from 29 trillion US dollars today to 57 trillion US dollars in
2020, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The State of the World Report warned that the world economy
"has begun to outrun the capacity of the earth to supply basic
goods and services".
</P>
<P>
It suggested that instead of trying to halt growth, greater use
should be made of renewable energy, such as wind power, to allow
the economy to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
The report echoes warnings by environmentalists 25 years ago of
limits to so-called renewable resources such as water and soil.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last half century", said the report, "the use of wood
almost doubled, that of paper increased nearly sixfold, fish
consumption increased fivefold, water use tripled, grain
consumption nearly tripled, steel use increased fourfold, and
fossil fuel consumption increased nearly fivefold."
</P>
<P>
Yet, unlike early environmentalists, the report does not
advocate ending growth, merely redirecting it, saying whereas the
threat of global warming places a limit on growth based on fossil
fuels, it can continue for much longer if based on renewable
energy.

<HEADLINE> 18 Airlines Denied Permits in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Only nine out of 27 airlines
were issued with operating permits in Zambia in 1977, compared to
25 in the previous year, Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted a parliamentary report as saying
that the 18 airlines have not met several basic requirements for
establishing an airline.
</P>
<P>
One of the requirements is to have Zambians as majority
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions include arranging for the inspection of the
aircraft to be used and the maintenance base, providing
information on who would carry out aircraft maintenance,
advertising in the government gazette, the intention to register
the company with the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry and
applying to the Ministry of Communications and Transport for an
operating air service permit.
</P>
<P>
Until 1991, Zambia did not have an open sky policy and then
the state-run Zambia Airways enjoyed the monopoly of all routes.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has since filled the vacuum left by the
liquidated Zambia Airways on domestic and international routes.
</P>
<P>
But the parliament committee on social services has noted that
the aviation industry is in turmoil exacerbated by numerous
squabbles among the local airlines.
</P>
<P>
Another negative factor affecting the air transport industry
is that the fledgling airlines are unable to mount long haul
flights, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Concern over Poor Navigation Aids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Domestic air travellers in
Nigeria have expressed concern over the obsolete state of
navigation aids in the country's airports, which led to a
paralysis of air travel last week following the Harmattan haze.
</P>
<P>
Many flights were disrupted last week with the intensification
of the Harmattan, the seasonal hot, dry and dust-laden wind from
the Sahara which causes poor visibility, making it difficult for
flights to take off and land at the airports.
</P>
<P>
Some air travellers have complained that if the navigation
aids were functional, it would have been possible for flights to
take off and land safely despite the poor visibility, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, th International Federation of Aviation Line Pilots
Association classified the navigation aids as "critically
deficient" at the country's major airports in Kano, Lagos and
Port Harcourt.
</P>
<P>
However, the equipment is functioning well at Lagos
International Airport where flights to and from foreign countries
have not been affected by the Harmattan haze so far this year.
</P>
<P>
To improve the poor situation, the federal airports authority
of Nigeria has placed orders for 21 instrument landing system for
19 airports in the country, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> OIC Condemns Israeli Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) today strongly condemned Israel for the
construction of new settlements near Jerusalem and on occupied
Arab lands, reports reaching here from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based OIC demanded in a statement that peace-loving
nations take necessary measures to stop the Israeli settlements
and resume the peace process according to the agreements signed
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced last Thursday a government decision to build
600 new homes in two West Bank settlements.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Israel's Housing Ministry is working on plans
to build 30,200 additional homes for Jews in the West Bank, nearly
doubling the number of settlers in the occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new housing is to be built within 15 kilometers of
Jerusalem, an area which the right-wing government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said will never be ceded to
Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu this week vowed to forge ahead with construction of
Jewish homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in defiance of
Palestinian and U.S. demands for a freeze pending the outcome of
negotiations on a final status agreement for the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
The new settlements constitute an Israeli challenge to the
international community at a time when intensified efforts are
being made to overcome the stalemate in the peace process, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlement policy pursued by the Israeli government
has been hampering the concerned parties from achieving any
progress in the peace process, it said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Pakistan Coordinate on Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Pakistan
were trying to find a peaceful settlement of the civil war in
Afghanistan, sources from the Pakistani Embassy in Saudi Arabia
was reported as revealing today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, Pakistani Foreign
Undersecretary Shamshad Ahmad, during a shuttle visit to Saudi
Arabia Saturday, coordinated with the Saudi government in a bid to
strengthen peace efforts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Pakistani government sought to inform
Riyadh on the outcome of the negotiations it recently held with
leaders of Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Islamabad has recently received
separately deposed President Burhanuddin Rabbani and head of the
Taliban government Mullar Mohammad Ghowth who held talks with
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the possibility of
putting an end to the bloodletting in war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's visit to Islamabad came following a meeting which he
held with Sharif in Tehran, Iran on the sidelines of the eighth
Islamic summit in December, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani undersecretary and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince
Saud Al-Faisal held a meeting Saturday to express support for
efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the Afghan problem, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan believes there are good chances to stop the protracted
war in Afghanistan during the holy month of Ramadan and the Afghan
factions have come to realize that war will not solve the problem,
the undersecretary said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al-Faisal told the Pakistani envoy that Riyadh
fully supports all mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan were the first two countries that
formally recognized the Taliban government in May, 1997 soon after
the militia group took over the capital Kabul and declared to
represent Afghan people as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia co-sponsored Afghan
national conciliation talks in Mecca, Saudi Arabia that led to a
short-lived cease-fire in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> New Political Party Registers in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A new centrist party came
into being today in Israel, with the probable defection of an
influential member from the ruling Likud party.
</P>
<P>
The party, named Atid (future), submitted its founding
documents signed by 140 members to the Registrar of political
Parties in Tel Aviv today to prepare for new elections, according
to Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
Member of the Likud, Ronni Milo, who is also Tel Aviv City
Mayor, was identified with Atid, but he himself did not sign the
founding documents.
</P>
<P>
Atid is said to be the centrist party in the country, which is
regarded as a ready-made political platform for Milo.
</P>
<P>
Milo, who has big differences with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on many issues, is particularly critical of Netanyahu's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Radio quoted several supporters of the Atid as saying that
the new party represents the political will of secular groups of
the country.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose the Likud party because it has made too much
concessions to the religious parties of the coalition in state
budget formulation and its hard-line policy towards the peace
process," they said.
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time we do not like the Labor party because it
had too much internal conflicts and struggle that occurred only
for personal reasons," they added.
</P>
<P>
The Radio commented that Milo's possible departure from the
Likud will definitely cause another political blow to Netanyahu,
who has just lost David levy, former foreign minister, due to
political differences between the them.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Reported Large-scale Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today denied reports that Israel is to build
large number of housing units in settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the denial at a weekly cabinet meeting today to
formulate the obligations the government is to require the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to fulfill before carrying
out the second redeployment in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The leading hardliner of the Israeli government, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon criticized Netanyahu for what
he called as an unnecessary denial.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, considered to
be a dove, commended Natanyahu for clarifying government stance.
</P>
<P>
Israel was reportedly to build 30,000 housing units in
settlements in the West Bank. The news came after Israel's
approval Wednesday for building 600 housing units in the Efrat
settlement, south of the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and the PNA have blasted Israel's plans
to expand settlements in the occupied territories as an obstacle
to revitalizing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after today's Cabinet meeting said Netanyahu
also refuted threats of Intifada (Palestinian uprising) and
renewed violence issued by Palestinian officials recently.
</P>
<P>
He said threats of violence did not serve the readiness for
real peace and Israel is insisting that negotiations be held
peacefully and will not change this position as a result of
threats.
</P>
<P>
Today's cabinet meeting focus on drafting a list of commitments
which the PNA is required to undertake under under the Note for
Record attached to the Hebron Accord signed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
They included four general demands: completing the process of
revising the Palestinian Charter that calls for Israel's
destruction, fighting terror and preventing violence against
Israel, restricting the number of the Palestinian police force and
restricting PNA's activities in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the Cabinet would hold another session
Tuesday to continue discussing the PNA commitments.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure of the United States, Netanyahu announced
Thursday that he would split the second Israeli redeployment in
the West Bank into two decisions.
</P>
<P>
The first on the pullback scope is to be made ahead of his
visit to Washington for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton
later this month, while the second will be made five months later
on whether to carry out the pullback based on the PNA's
fulfillment of its commitments.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as an attempt to further delay the troop
withdrawal in order to prevent hardliners within the stumbling
coalition from toppling the government.
</P>
<P>
The right-wingers have threatened to overthrow the government if
it returns an inch of West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is also to meet PNA President Yasser Arafat in a bid to
move the peace process forward. Palestinians are disappointed with
the stalemate of the process and the "non-results" of U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross's recent visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
They warned that a failure of the Washington talks could lead
to renewed popular Palestinian uprising.

BEIRUT, January 11 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine arrived here tonight on the first leg of his Middle East
tour aimed at reviving the stalled peace process and seeking a
larger role in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his 16-hour visit, Vedrine will hold talks with Lebanese
officials on the deadlocked peace process and the situation in
south Lebanon, especially the recent Israeli offer to
conditionally implement the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution calls for Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon and western Bekaa without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon had rejected the Israeli proposal, denouncing it as a
maneuver to drive a wedge between Syrian and Lebanese tracks in
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
According to his schedule, Vedrine and his accompanying
delegation will meet with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
soon after their arrival.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Vedrine is expected to inaugurate the new French
consulate here.
</P>
<P>
Later, he will hold talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri before
going on to Amman and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that during his Mideast tour,
Vedrine will reiterate France's support for building a

LUSAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and the Democratic
Republic of Congo have signed a defense protocol to enhance
security cooperation, Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Sampa returned here today from his visit to Congo (K), where
he signed the protocol.
</P>
<P>
He said for many years the two countries had problems on the
common border areas including killings and smugglings.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to settle the problems because of the nature
of the former government of Mobutu Sese Seko in former Zaire, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Since Laurent Kabila took power last year in that country, the
border areas have been very quiet for some time, and calm has
returned to border towns, Sampa said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister said that he believed that all defense
issues and many other problems will be tackled quickly with the
establishment of a commission and the signing of the protocol of
understanding.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Appeals for Relief for Southern Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Sudan appealed today to the
international community for relief for defected rebels and
civilians in the southern state of Bahr el-Ghazal.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held here, Sudanese first Vice President
El-Zubeir Mohammed Saleh called on Sudan's brothers, friends and
neighbors to provide food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
He said that protracted fightings and poor agricultural seasons
have left thousands of former rebels and civilians in urgent need
for food and other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
He said 8,000 rebels have defected in the state and that there
are more civilian returnees in the state.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government reached a peace agreement with six
minor rebel factions in 1997. But the Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA), the strongest rebel group, has rejected the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Saleh disclosed that the defected rebels have joined the
government forces to repel aggressions launched by the SPLA led by
John Garang.
</P>
<P>
He said the defection of the rebels is a victory of the peace
process, underlining that all the returnees have expressed full
support for the peace agreement and renounced the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese rebels took up arms to fight the Islamic
government since 1983 for more autonomy in the south, where the
population is mostly Christians and animists.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Celebrities Seek to Ease Iraqi Sufferings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of Egyptian celebrities
today launched a campaign to seek the help of the Arab League (AL)
to ease the sufferings of Iraqi children under the United Nations
sanctions, the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The group asked AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid in a
message to convince the U.N. to dispatch a plane carrying more
medicine to Iraq at the Ramadan Bairam late this month.
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Egypt's acclaimed film director Youssef
Chahine who won a special prize for his life's works at the Cannes
Film Festival in 1997, included actresses Raghda, writer Nawal
El-Saadawi as well as doctors and pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
They sent some 2.5 tonnes of medicine and gifts for Iraqi
children and the signatures of 1 million Egyptians to rally
support for Iraq during a visit to Baghdad a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The group also took an initiative to tour hospitals in Baghdad,
where they recognized the shortage of medicine and medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Arab League spokesman Talaat Hamed said the Arab organization
will ask the U.N. Sanctions Committee to agree to the humanitarian
request.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid will send a message to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan and the Security Council to consider the request aimed to
ease the sufferings of the Iraqis, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling economic sanctions imposed by the
U.N. in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

of the Yangtze River last November, had been a good job.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 95,000 people were resettled as part

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Israeli Withdrawal Offer From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine Monday expressed welcome to Israel's offer to
withdraw from south Lebanon, but urged it to do so unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
According to local Voice of People radio, at a meeting with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Vedrine said Israel's announced
readiness to accept the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 is a
positive step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Israel's mentioning of the resolution, the first time since it
was adopted in 1978 calling for Israeli troop withdrawal from
Lebanon, should not be ignored, the French minister said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai last week proposed
that Israel accept the U.N. resolution and withdraw from the
security zone in south Lebanon, provided its northern security is
guaranteed by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, saying it cannot accept a
conditional withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern areas from attacks
by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine reiterated France's support to Lebanon's just demand
that Israel comply with the Resolution 425 without conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the Israelis add many conditions to the
implementation of the resolution, the offer can not be accepted by
Lebanon, and is unlikely to come true in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Resolution 425, the French minister also discussed
with Hrawi the whole situation in the Middle East, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine arrived here Sunday night on a regional tour which will
also take him to Jordan and Syria to further France's role in the
region and push forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He has held talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,
House Speaker Nabih Berry and Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Fresh Fruits, Vegetables More Effective Against Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- People should make fresh fruits
and vegetables their first choice instead of plant constituents or
supplements such as carotenoids -- beta-carotene in particular --
to prevent cancer, according to a report released here Monday by
the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Scientists of the WHO International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) say that a new evaluation of all the published data
on the health effects of carotenoids has shown that beta-carotene,
in none of the clinical trials, has any significant preventive
effect in reducing the incidence and mortality rate of cancer.
</P>
<P>
"Our group came to the conclusion that, until further
information becomes available on how beta-carotene and other
carotenoids influence the process leading to cancer, none of these
substances should be promoted to the general population as a
tumor-preventive treatment," Dr. Harri Vainio, Chief of the
Chemoprevention Unit at IARC, said on behalf of a working group of
23 scientists from 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
"It appears at present that cancer prevention by fresh fruits
and vegetables remains more effective than taking one or several
of their constituents as dietary supplements," Dr Vainio
concluded.

<HEADLINE> SKorean High-Speed Rail Project Faces Possible Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Construction of South Korea's
Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway may be suspended as the result of
demands by President-elect Kim Dae-jung's takeover team for a
thorough review of the project.
</P>
<P>
The team has rejected a request by the Korean High-Speed Rail
Construction Authority (KHRCA) to approve its plan for the
construction of the Taejon-Taegu route.
</P>
<P>
The rejection was announced Monday by Lee Jong-chan, chairman
of the takeover team, at a meeting of the forthcoming ruling National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP).
</P>
<P>
The team has asked the KHRCA not to place further orders for
the construction of a railway between Taejon and Taegu, the
second-phase of the controversial money-devouring Seoul-Pusan
high-speed railway project. The project has tripled its originally
estimated cost, reaching 17.6 trillion won ( about 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 16 percent of the planned Seoul-Pusan railway
has been built.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the nation's large state-financed projects are
likely to be suspended or delayed in an effort to meet the harsh
loan conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
They say many government projects will face drastic budget
reductions.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has suffered serious financial losses as a result
of conglomerate failures and bad loans by financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the IMF, South Korea has to open
its financial market, and budget and restructure its economy in
order to obtain a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Share Same Views on Economic Reforms: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has assured Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that
Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) share the same
views on how to carry out economic and financial reforms to save
the ailing Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
If any, their difference only lies in the timing of the
implementation of the reforms, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono
said here Monday when briefing reporters on the phone conversation
between Soeharto and Hashimoto at 14:00 local time Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the IMF has assisted Indonesia in drawing up the
economic and financial reforms it will carry out, some of which
were disclosed by President Soeharto when he delivered the
proposed state budget for 1998-99 on January 6.
</P>
<P>
During the 35-minute phone conversation, Soeharto told
Hashimoto that Indonesia will seriously and wholeheartedly
implement the reforms which the IMF has agreed to.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indonesian and the IMF teams will work hard to
finish discussing all matters so that the talks between President
Soeharto and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus will satisfy
both sides on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer is visiting in
Indonesia and had held talks with senior officials here. Camdesus
will arrive here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moerdiono said, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also
spoke to President Soeharto Monday by telephone, expressing his
confidence in Indonesia's capacity to overcome its monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The phone conversations between Soeharto and leaders of foreign
countries as well as IMF officials visit was triggered by the
sudden fall of the Indonesian rupiah, which declined to a historic
low of 11,000 rupiah per dollar last Thursday. The rupiah has lost
more than 200 percent of its value since July last year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, IMF agreed to provide
Indonesia with financial and technical loans of 23 billion U.S.
dollars to help overcome its crisis and Indonesia made a
commitment to conduct economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF was reportedly dissatisfied over the process
of the reforms in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Violating Arms Embargo Against Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- France denied violating an
international arms embargo Monday against Rwanda in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the French daily Le Figaro, the French
government under President Francois Mitterrand authorized the sale
of arms to Rwanda on May 17, 1994, one month after the then
Hutus-controlled army started a genocide against the Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
At least half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed
from April to July in 1994.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux argued that
France stopped selling arms to Rwanda even before the
U.N. Security Council imposed in mid-May 1994 an arms embargo
against Rwanda, a decision which he said was made at the proposal
of France.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro said, however, that France continued to cooperate
with the Hutu government until the end of May 1994 -- if not later
-- 15 days after the United Nations imposed the arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
The daily also quoted a well-informed source as saying that
Mitterrand told one of his entourage in the summer of 1994: "In
these countries, a genocide is not too much."

BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Central Military

the site of the earthquake in Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the tremors occurred, the PLA's Beijing Military

<HEADLINE> Johansson: England Could Cost Europe 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- UEFA President Lennart Johansson
said on Monday that England's decision to compete with Germany for
the right to host the 2006 World Cup could cost Europe the chance
of winning the bid.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Johansson, who is hoping to succeed Joao
Havelange as head of FIFA in June, also told the English daily
newspaper "The Independent" that there was no future for a
European Super League.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, who was responsible for persuading UEFA in allowing
English clubs back into European competition after the 1985 Heysel
stadium tragedy and lobbied successfully for England hosting
Euro '96, said that England and Germany had started their
campaigns too early.
</P>
<P>
"What worries me in particular is the early start that both
countries have made," Johansson said.
</P>
<P>
"They must remember that other parts of the world such as
Africa and Brazil could entertain hopes of hosting the
tournament. Both Germany and England should have waited before
spending the money they already have. It could be a big waste of
money and time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, who says he will retire and go fishing if he does
not claim the FIFA presidency, said that players needed more time
off and a European Super League was not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Johansson also said in the paper that the ticketing
arrangements for this year's World Cup could have been handled
better.
</P>
<P>
"If I were the president I would change the system. Too small a
number of tickets is being given to outsiders," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Norway for example had hopes of 50,000 tickets but received
just 3,000. There is always criticism over this at every World
Cup, but this time it is particularly low, and it is too late to
do anything about it," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Government to Avoid Excluding the Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said Monday that the government should be ``particularly careful''
about the problem of social exclusion, which results from long
time unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The social cohesion of France is now being threatened by
unemployment, exclusion and violence in urban suburbs, the
president said in response to escalating protests by the
unemployed during a meeting with the press.
</P>
<P>
The protesters have vowed to continue their fight despite aid
packages offered by the Socialist government to help jobless
persons in desperate situations.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the law against exclusion, which will be
presented by the government to the National Assembly in March,
will ``attack the roots of the evil in all fields,''
including unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the government turn the money subsidized for
social aid programs into investment for jobs.
</P>
<P>
France is running a near-record 12.4 percent jobless rate with
a jobless population of 3.1 million, one-third of which has been
unemployed for more than a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Finland and the Philippines have
agreed to strengthen their bilateral relations and economic
cooperation, especially in trade and investment areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the 30-minute meeting between
Finnish Minister of European Affairs Ole Norrback and Philippine
President Fidel Ramos on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Norrback reaffirmed his country's continued
confidence in the economic potentials of the Philippines despite
the ongoing financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He told Ramos that Finland wants to expand the areas of
economic cooperation with the Philippines in the midst of economic
difficulty in Southeast Asia "because we want to help and try to
stabilize the situation."
</P>
<P>
Ramos told Norrback that the sustained economic growth now
enjoyed by the Philippines is a result of the "bitter pills we
swallowed six years ago."
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are cured of our illness at a time when our neighbors
are entering the hospital for treatment," he said, referring to
the bailout package other Asian countries sought from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president and the Finnish minister agreed there
is a need to create more markets for Philippine-made products in
Finland to bridge the trade gap which has always been in favor of
Finland.
</P>
<P>
Total trade in 1996 between the two countries amounted to 118.4
million US dollars, with a trade deficit for the Philippines
registered at 64 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the trade deficit for the Philippines increased
further to 69.6 million dollars, with Philippine exports
registered at 16.37 million dollars and imports valued at 85.94
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Britain Needs More Flexibility In Trade: Wu Yi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade Minister
Wu Yi said at the second meeting of the Sino-British Economic and
Trade Cooperation Committee today that Britain should be more
flexible in trade with China, especially in technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
Wu, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, chaired
the meeting together with British Minister of Trade and Industry
Magaret Beckett, who is the first cabinet minister of the new
British government to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that bilateral economic and trade co-operation has been
fairly sound since the committee's first meeting in 1996.
Bilateral trade exceeded five billion US dollars in 1996, making
Britain China's third largest trading partner in the EU, she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Britain became China's second largest trading partner
in the EU, with bilateral trade in the first eleven months of 1997
exceeding five billion US dollars, up 16.2 percent over the same
period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Britain is also EU's largest investor in China. By the end of
September 1997, Britain had invested in 2,018 projects in China,
with more than 13 billion US dollars in funding, 4.48 billion
dollars of which has been put to use.
</P>
<P>
But, despite the progress, the situation still does not fit
Britain's position as a trader and investor in the world economy,
Wu said, and that the two countries' economies complement each
other and that economic and trade co-operation has great potential.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that both sides will use the committee
for closer contacts between government departments and will
increase cooperation through symposiums, business fairs and
personnel exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Beckett said she agreed that the two sides should have a
strategic view of bilateral economic and trade relations and deal
with problems with a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
The British are well aware of the fact that there is great
potential to be tapped and that Britain is willing to establish
long-term economic and trade ties with China and to increase
cooperation with China in transportation, telecommunications, food
processing, and other areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: "Love Rupiah" Campaign Gains Momentum in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The campaign to restore
confidence in the battered Indonesian currency is gaining momentum
with groups of journalists, business people and legislators began
selling their dollars.
</P>
<P>
At a special ceremony here on Monday, which was attended by
Bank Indonesia (central bank) Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono and
the bank's directors, a group of Indonesian editors changed their
U.S. dollars to rupiah (national currency) through the counter of
Bank Bumi Daya.
</P>
<P>
The "Love Rupiah Campaign" was firstly launched by President
Soeharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana who changed
50,000 U.S. dollars to rupiah in a highly publicized event on
January 9.
</P>
<P>
Hardiyanti's drive followed the rupiah's free fall against the
U.S. dollar last Thursday when the local currency crashed to a
historic low of 11,000. this and rumors about impending steep
price hikes, sparked a massive shopping rush for basic daily needs
at markets in many regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 200 percent of its value since
July last year. The drastic fall of rupiah has also slowed down
the country's economic activities and threatened businesses with
closure and mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Several Indonesian conglomerates have begun selling their
dollars since last Saturday. They have sold and will sell a total
of 3.1 million dollars in the campaign to help the ailing rupiah
strengthen, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Sinar Mas Group Chairman Ekaipta Wijaya traded in one million
dollars, Artha Graha Group Executive Tommy Winata sold 500,000
dollars, and Chairman Setya Novanto of the Kosgoro Group,
affiliated to the ruling party, cashed in 200,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Salim Group planned to sell another one million dollars soon
while soem other entrepreneurs are going to sell their dollars,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
They traded their dollars at a rate of 6,700 rupiah to the
greenback, added the reports
</P>
<P>
Members of the Indonesian Editorial Group (KEI) have also
decided to lend a hand in propping up the rupiah by promoting and
joining the campaign, along with the introduction of "Love
Domestic Products" and "Love to Save up and Live Simply"
campaigns, a local newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The moves also supported by key figures, including religious
leaders and professional organizations, artists as well as members
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Indonesian Businesswomen Association (IWAPI)
said in a statement earlier that they had scheduled "A Solidarity
campaign" in which several public figures would sell their dollars
in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"There's already enough expression of concern. Now is the time
for action," said Suryani Motik, chairperson of IWAPI, in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least one hotel in the East Java capital of
Surabaya, the four-star Garden Palace hotel has agreed to set
their room rates in rupiah. In Norse Sumatra, travel bureaus,
hotels and restaurants have also agreed to quote their tourism
packages and room rates in rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso Monday also called on all officials
and people holding U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies to
exchange them into rupiah.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's call on people to sell their dollars
is a wise move which he fully supports.

NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army killed 18
Hutu rebel militiamen in clashes in the northwest over the

<P>
"They attacked Nyamyumba commune Saturday night, trying to
burn its offices," the army spokesman, Major Emmanuel Ndahiro
told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) today.
</P>
<P>
Ndahiro said that the army intervened and extinguished the
fire, killing 18 assailants and seizing four rifles, and four of

The Rwandan army is still pursuing the Hutu armed insurgents
who have been involved in various criminal acts in the area like
ambushing vehicles and killing passengers, as well as
slaughtering local leaders.
</P>

Military sources in Gisenyi have reported that since December
31, 1997 to January 9, 1998, the rebel militiamen ambushed nine

BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, meeting this
afternoon with the president of Britain's Board of Trade, Margaret
Beckett, said that settling the Hong Kong issue has provided new
opportunities for Sino-British cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li told Beckett that Sino-British ties in the economy and other
areas will increase as long as the two countries observe the
principle of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefits, and
remove obstacles arising from different ideologies.
</P>
<P>
Beckett is the first cabinet member of the new British Labor
Party government to visit China. This year is Britain's "China
Year" and the Chinese government values its ties with Britain, Li
said, and is pleased to see the improvements and development of
Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Britain complement each other economically, he said,
pointing to the great potential in economic cooperation because of
Britain's technological advantages in energy, aviation, chemicals,
transportation, and communications.
</P>
<P>
China is successfully implementing in Hong Kong the "one
country, two systems" principle, "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy, he said, and is confident

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Speaker Works to Prevent Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Speaker Dan Tichon today held a meeting with Gesher (bridge)
Party leader David Levy to prevent a possible fall of the
government, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held hours before the Knesset's voting on the
no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is scheduled to vote Monday afternoon on the two
no-confidence motions tabled by the opposition Labor and Meretz
parties over the state budget passed in the Knesset a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties said that some agreements reached by
the prime minister and other coalition parties on certain 1998
budget allocations are against the legal regulations. They tabled
the no-confidence motions shortly after the budget's approval.
</P>
<P>
Levy and his other four Gesher Knesset members voted against
the budget. The coalition now only has 61 seats in the 120-member
Knesset after Levy's resignation as foreign minister on January 4
and the departure of the other four Gesher Knesset members.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, an absolute majority of 61 lawmakers is enough
to topple the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that if the Gesher joins the opposition in
voting for the no-confidence motions, the government will
certainly be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
Tichon was quoted as saying that the Gesher is still a part of
the ruling Likud coalition although Levy resigned, and the
government has already reached an agreement for fund allocations
with the Gesher party in the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
With this agreement still being effective, Tichon said, he has
to work out with Levy to ensure that Gesher will not vote against
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Levy said he will consult his Gesher members on this matter
before making final decisions.

</P>
<P>
He also said he hopes Britain will play a positive role in
increasing friendly and cooperative relations between China and

Beckett told Li that the Labor Party government regards ties

strengthen cooperative ties in every field.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that the British government will adopt

The situation in Hong Kong after it returned to China indicates

<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian speed skater Svetlana
Fedotkina has been suspended for life for refusing an out of
competition dope test in Canada, according to the Russian Speed
Skating Federation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Federation president Vladimir Komarov confirmed that Fedotkina
was banned for life, but he declined to provide more details on
the International Skating Union's ban. Fedotkina had been set to
return to competition on January 6 following a two-year ban for
using anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
The ISU, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, have said Fedotkina
refused a request from their officials to undergo a drugs test
when she was training in Calgary in November.
</P>
<P>
Under ISU rules, refusing a test in such circumstances is
considered a repeat offence punishable by a lifetime ban.
</P>
<P>
Komarov said in December his federation had appealed against
the threatened ban, saying Fedotkina had been in Canada as a
tourist and not a competition skater.
</P>
<P>
Fedotkina won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters at the
Lillehammer Olympics in 1994. She tested positive for anabolic
steroids in the Kazakh city of Almaty during a World Cup event in
January 1996.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Not to Buy New Defense Equipment due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Monday that
there would be no new purchase of defense equipment for its armed
forces because of the country's economic downturn and the
depreciation of its currency -- the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar conveyed the
message to U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen who wanted to know
Malaysia's policy on the matter, according to the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Any expenses would be for the maintenance and servicing of
existing defense equipment, Syed Hamid said after meeting Cohen
who arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit to Malaysia as part
of his tour to several Asian countries, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the two sides also discussed bilateral issues
and the United States in particular wanted to know Malaysia's
stand on several issues especially defense and security under the
presence condition.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from discussing intelligence cooperation and efforts to
enhance ties in defense science, I told him (Cohen) that all
defense planning would continue," Syed Hamid was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Cohen, who wanted to know whether Malaysia
would continue to send military officers for training in the
United States under the International Military Education and
Training (IMET) and Bilateral Training Consultancy Group, was told
that Malaysia would continue sending the office for training in
selected fields since all expenses would be borne by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cohen was also told that Malaysia was satisfied
with earlier discussion resulting in a five-year contract to
maintain and service U.S. Air Force Hercules C-130 aircraft at
Malaysia's Airod.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid also told Cohen of Malaysia's commitment to send its
troops to serve with Stabilization Force together with other
troops from NATO and the United States in Bosnia-Herzegovina after
the mandate expired in June, according to Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said "For the moment, the government's decision is
to continue to deploy its troops pending the outcome of
discussions in March."
</P>
<P>
The discussion is to commit the continued participation for
NATO and U.S. forces in Bosnia and so far Malaysia has agreed to
continue its commitment in that country, he said.

TOKYO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said Monday he will do his best to stabilize Japan's
financial system and stimulate the flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the opening of the 150-day regular
Diet (parliament) session, Hashimoto said, "I will make every
effort to prevent Japan from sparking a financial and economic
panic, to stabilize the financial system, which is the nation's
economic artery, and to regain the confidence of investors in the
future of the economy."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said a stable financial system and an economic
recovery are needed to carry out his pledged reforms.
</P>
<P>
He asked opposition parties to cooperate and pass a
supplementary budget and related bills as soon as possible for
fiscal 1997, and to pave the way for a two trillion yen (about
15.2 billion U.S. dollars) income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto detailed measures to stablize the financial system,
featuring a 30 trillion yen (about 227.3 billion dollars) outlay
of public money to protect depositors and the overall system,
as well as establishing a 25 trillion yen (about 189.4
billion dollars) line of credit in public funds to ease the credit
crunch faced by small and medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he expects the financial system
stabilization measures and other economic stimulus plans will help
realize an economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
The convening of the regular Diet session, originally planned
for January 19, was moved up a week so lawmakers could address the
country's sluggish economy.

Chinese drought of men's swimming medal at the world swimming
championships on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Chen, world record holder, won China's first
swimming title here as she touched the pad in 4:36.66 at the
women's 400m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
Zeng got China's first ever world championship medal in the
men's events, finishing only second to Belgium's Olympic champion
Frederik Deburghgraeve at the 100m butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Chen could hardly conceal her excitement after the race.
</P>
<P>
"We have had hard times since we arrived in Perth, " she
said. "Our training has often been interrupted by media and we
have many other distractions."
</P>
<P>
"The victory is a morale-booster to me, as well as to the
Chinese team. I'm very, very excited right now," she said.

Yana Klochkova of Ukraine picked the silver medal in 4:45.94
and Japanese Yasuko Tajima got the bronze in 4:39.45.

Chinese Wu Yanyan, who led the field until the last turn,
looked worn out in the final stretch, missing the podium by 0.74
seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see Wu Yanyan until with 100 meters to go," Chen
said. "I had thought I was leading all the way."
</P>
<P>
Deburghgraeve, who holds the world record of 1:00.60 in the
men's 100m breastroke, snatched his speciality event in 1:01:34,
just 0.42 adrift of Zeng.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, who stands just 1.72 meters, called himself as a "giant".
</P>
<P>
"I am a giant," he said. "In my eyes, only Deburghgraeve stands
taller than me."
</P>
<P>
Zeng was born into a fisherman's family in South China's
Guangdong province and he started swimming since he learned to
walk.
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up in the Zhujiang river in Guangdong," he said.
</P>

American veteran Jenny Thompson won the women's 100m freestyle
and Australian Michael Klim triumphed in the men's 200m freestyle.

<HEADLINE> 9.5 Percent Growth In Beijing's GDP In 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital's GDP for
1997 was 180 billion yuan, a growth of 9.5 percent, the Municipal
Statistics Bureau announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing New Technological and Industrial Development Zone
had a GDP of 13 billion, up 25 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index and consumer price index both dropped
below the growth rate and the gap in supply and demand went from
nine percent in 1995 to five percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year Beijing had 95 billion yuan in capital investment,
but the real estate market remained sluggish, with market sales
dropping by 15 percent and some 1.2 million square meters of
residential and office buildings remaining unoccupied.
</P>
<P>
The city utilized 2.5 billion US dollars in foreign funds
last year, with capital assests of joint venture projects approved
amounting to twice what they were a year before.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the city's revenues increased 25 percent and the
average wages for workers were 11,000 yuan, up nine percent from
1996.
</P>
<P>
Beijing had some 2.3 million overseas tourists last year,
generating 2.25 billion US dollars in hard currency earnings, but
the hotel occupancy rate remained as low as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zou Chunlan, vice director of the Beijing Statistics Bureau
says that, with 70,000 workers laid off, the city government is
under some pressure.

<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate President
Ernesto Maceda on Monday formally tendered his resignation as
chairman of the country's united opposition the Struggle of
Patriotic Filipino Masses, pushing the party on the brink of a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
But Maceda's resignation letter did not categorically stated
whether he is taking with him the entire Nationalist People's
Coalition (NPC) on his way out of the united opposition, known as
LAMMP in Filipino.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said Maceda, president of the NPC,
maybe is not a real leader of the coalition, and the NPC's
withdrawal from the mainstream opposition need the blessing of NPC
chairman, business tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco.
</P>
<P>
Maceda has threatened to break away from the LAMMP since late
last year, especially after losing to Senator Edgardo Angara in
the race for the LAMMP's vice presidential candidacy last month.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, Angara agreed to abandon his presidential bid
and run as the running mate of Vice President Joseph Estrada, who
has enjoyed high approval ratings in many opinion surveys, in the
May presidential polls to prevent a breakup of the LAMMP.
</P>
<P>
The LAMMP, created in June 1997, consists of the NPC led by
Maceda, the Patriotic Filipino Masses party led by Estrada and the
then biggest opposition the Struggle of Democratic Filipinos led
by Angara.
</P>
<P>
But Maceda, a main broker of the united opposition, has
repeatedly indicated his intention to leave the united opposition
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Maceda has been negotiating with the
ruling Lakas-NUCD party on a merger of the NPC and the Lakas led
by President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Maceda is now reportedly on his way to Australia to meet with
Cojuangco and seek the latter's approval for his move to withdraw
the party from the LAMMP.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Seismologists Go To Study Quake Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGBEI, HEBEI PROVINCE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
seismologists are gathering data and monitoring aftershocks of the
strong earthquake that jolted Shangyi and Zhangbei counties in
Hebei Province at noon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake's epicenter was 220 kilometers northwest of
Beijing. It left 47 people dead and over 9,000 injured, and more
than 70,000 houses in 13 townships destroyed or seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
A group headed by the deputy director of the State Seismology
Bureau, Ge Zhizhou, arrived at the site five hours after the
earthquake, braving sub-zero temperatures to do a field study.
</P>
<P>
Ge said the earthquake hit what had been designated as a
high-risk area by seismologists two years ago in northwest Beijing
and neighboring parts of Shanxi and Hebei provinces, and Inner
Mongolia. The chances are slim that the Zhangbei-Shangyi region
will be hit by powerful earthquakes, he said, but the Hebei
Provincial Seismology Bureau has set up a temporary station in
Zhangjiakou to monitor developments.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that a general lack of knowledge about
earthquake prevention by local people is partly to blame for the
heavy losses, and that the houses damaged were poorly
made.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Coconut Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Total export earnings from
coconut hit 920 million US dollars last year, up by 6.47 percent
over the 830 million dollars recorded in 1996, the Philippine
Coconut Authority said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was achieved even as the coconut industry was
adversely affected by the El Nino calamity and the unwarranted
cutting of coconut trees, the authority said.
</P>
<P>
According to the authority administrator Virgilio David, this
increase in coconut production is the direct result of the World
Bank -funded Small Coconut Farms Development Project.
</P>
<P>
Total volume of coconut exports in 1997 also rose by 25.4
percent to 1,877,363.03 metric tons, in copra terms, from
1,497,468.44 metric tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Coconut oil continued to exhibit impressive sales performance
with total revenue amounting to 663.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by desicated coconut with dollar receipts of
87.7 million. Copra meal was third with earnings reaching 51.6
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Firms Urged to Focus on Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean manufacturers should
put more emphasis on producing quality products if they are to
stand the tough competition on the local and international
markets, the Standards Association of Zimbabwe (SAZ) said today.
</P>
<P>
SAZ Director-General and Secretary Hywell Williams said both
the local and international markets have become sophisticated
with emphasis on quality unlike in the past when more attention
was put at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
''There is no way you can succeed these days on the market
without producing high quality products because there are many
countries which are manufacturing the same type of products,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Williams said his organization was encouraging manufacturers
to approach them and have quality marks endorsed on their
products so that they stand the competition with those produced
by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Paris-based environmental management system
encouraged local companies to aspire to get the ISO 14,001
certification while it was still voluntary, rather than be forced
into action when it becomes difficult to export to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The certification not only serves the interests of the
customer but that of other parties involved in trade as well.
</P>
<P>
Williams said although a number of companies in different
industries in Zimbabwe had asked the government to put tariff
protection, citing fierce competition from other countries, that
was a short-term solution which dragged backwards the emphasis on
quality.
</P>
<P>
The SAZ which sets quality standards for companies in Zimbabwe
has constantly urged local manufacturers to seriously consider
developing quality products and embrace environmental management
standards in line with the ever changing global trends.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Sue US on F-16 Planes Issue: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
confirmed Monday that it is preparing to file a suit against the
U.S. administration on the issue of stuck-up F-16 fighters and a
legal firm has been hired to study the case.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question at the weekly press briefing, a
Foreign Office spokesman said that while the Pakistani government
was in contact with the U.S. administration on the issues, it has
been consistently demanding supply of the planes or return of the
money it has paid for them.
</P>
<P>
"This has been our unchanging position," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan told the local English daily
"The Nation" last Thursday that Pakistan would go to American
courts in the next few weeks to get back 656 million US dollars it
had paid for the stuck-up F-16 fighters.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said all paper and legal work for filing a
suit against the U.S. administration has been prepared by
Pakistan's legal experts.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of 28 F-16s was stopped by the U.S. administration
after the enforcement of Pressler Amendment in the early 90s. The
Pressler Amendment had restrained the U.S. administration from
providing military hardware to Pakistan on the basis of its
alleged nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
However, after the passage of Brown Amendment, the U.S.
administration made an abortive attempt to sell the stuck-up F-16s
to a third country and give the proceeds of the sale to Pakistan.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Gold prices in India
continued to move downwards on the bullion market here Monday on
lack of buying support amidst fresh arrivals and closed with
further losses.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was dampened by the gold prices touching
18-1/2 year low in narrow-range trading in the international
markets. Lower Mumbai (Bombay) notes were an additional factor
which pressed the prices to seek fresh low level.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were quoted sharply low at 277.50 US dollars an
ounce from the previous level of 281 dollars. Standard gold and
ornaments lost 17 rupees each at 4100-3950 rupees (110.81-106.76
US dollars) per ten gram respectively on lack of buying support.
</P>
<P>
Silver prices picked up moderately on buying support by

<HEADLINE> Philippine Industries Draft Measures to Stop Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Local industries have drafted
three-point action program to stop speculation on the peso against
the US dollar and cushion the impact of the emerging economic
crisis, the Philippine News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Raul Concepcion, president of the Federation
of Philippine Industries, as saying that he will discuss the
program with President Fidel Ramos, the Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson and the Bankers Association of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion said the first measure is that exporters will be
temporarily compelled to surrender their export proceeds to banks
in return for a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
The guarantee can be bought back at the same rate, a percentage
of these proceeds to be used to finance their importation.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank will also issue a 90-day bills to
those who surrender their dollars, except the exporters.
</P>
<P>
To encourage dollar owners to shift to pesos, these bills will
carry interest yield of 10 percentage points above the 90-day
treasury bill which is currently at 19 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, to importation of non-essential and semi-essential
consumer goods to a temporary time deposit of 180 days and 120
days, respectively, tariff equivalent to the value of the
importation will be imposed.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion noted that there is lack of urgency in dealing with
the crisis because of concern that any measures, even if
temporary, to curb imports and dampen currency speculations, will
violate the country's commitments under the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he pointed out, the IMF and WTO should
appreciate the above pro-active measures as preventive steps
against balance of payments difficulties and subsequent return to
the IMF for a bailout.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso has depreciated against the dollar for
around 70 percent since the financial crisis hit the country last
July.

<HEADLINE> Resistance Prompts Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berry today said that the recent Israeli withdrawal offer should
be attributed to Lebanese guerrillas resistance against its
occupation, a local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with the visiting French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine who is on a Middle East tour, the
Voice of the People reported.
</P>
<P>
Berry stressed that if Israelis really intend to comply with
the U.N. Security Council resolution 425 and withdraw its troops
from south Lebanon, it is certainly a good thing and is resulted
from the Lebanese people's struggle, especially the residents in
the south.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 when Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer
area in south Lebanon as the buffer zone to protect its residents
in the north, Lebanese guerrillas have been fighting with its
troops.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 39 Israeli soldiers were killed, 95
wounded, in battles with guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Berry pointed out that if the purpose of the Israeli withdrawal
offer aims at the division of Syrian and Lebanese track in the
peace talks with Israel, it is never acceptable. Israel has
suggested to give the Lebanese issue a priority.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
announced that his country is ready to accept the resolution
425 provided arrangements are agreed to protect Israel's
security after the withdrawal of its troops from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the speaker told the French minister that the peace
cannot be limited only to Israel, or any country in the region
and, it should be a comprehensive and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Syrian and Lebanese track which has
been deadlocked since February 1996 should be given equal
attention as the Palestinian track in the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who arrived here Sunday night, had held talks with
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz on the regional situation and Israeli withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
He will leave Lebanon for Jordan and Syria later today on a
regional tour aimed at reviving the stalled peace process and
seeking a larger role in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The People's Assembly in Egypt
today called on the upcoming emergency Arab parliamentary
conference to adopt a strong stance on fighting terrorism, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The emergency session of the Arab Parliamentary Union (APU)
slated for Wednesday in the Upper Egyptian city of Luxor is
expected to come up with an initiative in confrontation of the
phenomenon of terrorism and in solidarity with Egypt's efforts in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
In a report to be submitted to the session, the Egyptian
parliament calls upon Arab states to hold consultations on means
of setting up an effective coordination system in fighting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The People's Assembly underlined that terrorism is an
impediment to democracy and development, a matter that requires an
overall strategy at various levels to deal with.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the phenomenon of terrorism threatens
Egypt's national resources and thwarts its chance in overall
development.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak will give a keynote speech to the
meeting of the parliamentarians from 18 Arab countries who will
gather in Luxor to express their solidarity with Egypt following a
terrorist attack in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Luxor, the venue of the Arab emergency meeting, witnessed a
brutal massacre of 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians by six
Islamic militants on November 17, 1997 in Egypt's worst militant
attack since 1992. Revenues from Egypt's vital tourism sector have
plummeted since then.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Efforts by non-government
organizations (NGOs) to monitor the forthcoming local polls in the
Jaffna peninsula suffered a setback when civic groups there
refused to participate in any monitoring exercise, The Island
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted NGO officials as saying that to monitor an
election is not an interest of the people in the north because
they don't want the election at all.
</P>
<P>
Several Jaffna-based NGOs met with local people as well as
church groups recently. They said all the civic and church
representatives were strongly of the opinion that holding
elections at this point was neither appropriate nor necessary.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that people even don't know who the candidates
are. Besides, the voter's list is totally out of date.
</P>
<P>
A local school principal interviewed by the NGOs said people in
the peninsula would prefer the present administration by the Army.
</P>
<P>
NGO officials pointed out that many of the basic needs of the
people remain to be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The paper said an army officer in the civic affairs office in
Jaffna confirmed that there were no signs of interest among the
people for the local government elections scheduled for January
29.
</P>
<P>
The officer said some people had vowed to deliberately spoil
their ballot papers if they were forced to vote at the polls.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,171 candidates nominated by four Tamil political
parties and two independent groups will contest 234 posts in 17
municipal, urban and village councils in the north.
</P>
<P>
There are 564,021 registered voters in Jaffna district while
7,463 people are eligible to vote in Kilinochchi district.
</P>
<P>
The elections, the first in about ten years in the regions,
will be conducted at 422 polling stations.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Proposals In Beijing Give Policy-makers Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Proposals from members of the
Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have become an important source of
ideas for local policy-makers, according to Zhu Zupu, deputy
secretary-general of the Beijing Municipal Government.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told a press conference here today that, over the past five
years, local CPPCC members, non-communist party members, and
non-governmental organizations made 5,003 proposals, 60 percent of
which were adopted.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Communist Party Committee and Municipal
Government had a proposal for information infrastructure in

</P>
<P>
A 360-sq.m. museum built on top of some old ruins on Wangfujing

protecting cultural relics, Zhu added. Other proposals have helped
local government offices settle traffic, power supply, and living
standard problems.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the Party and government departments to
continue to improve the multi-party cooperation and political
consultation under the leadership of the CPC in this way, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Committed to Asian Economies' Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
reiterated its commitment to help revitalize the Asian economies
badly hit by the currency and stock market crises.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. commitment was conveyed by its Defense Secretary
William Cohen to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad during
their 40-minute meeting here, Malaysian Foreign Ministry
Under-Secretary for Southeast Asia and South Pacific Mohamed
Arshad M. Hussain told reporters at a news briefing after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cohen informed Mahathir that U.S. President Bill
Clinton was constantly getting the views of his advisers to ensure
that Washington played an important and effective role in tackling
the economic turmoil in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Arshad said Cohen also informed Mahathir that the U.S.,
being one of the biggest investors in the region, took a serious
view of the problems faced by the Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Mahathir welcomed U.S. leaders to visit
the region to see for themselves what was happening, and this was
because the western leaders, including those from the United
States, regarded the economic problems and position of all
countries of the region as similar when in fact each economy had
its own strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Arshad said Mahathir also expressed his satisfaction
with the bilateral ties between Kuala Lumpur and Washington.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also touched on the presence of U.S. troops in
the region and Mahathir said the present U.S. strength was
sufficient, Mohamed Arshad told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here on Sunday, is on a three-day visit to
Malaysia, the first leg of his 12-day tour to several Asian
countries, and he attended the two-day Fourth Pacific Dialogue
opened by Mahathir on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Introduce New National Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
will introduce a new National Agriculture Policy (NAP),
emphasising commercial food production by the private sector, its
Deputy Agriculture Minister Tengku Mahmud Mansor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new policy would promote large-scale production of food not
only to cut the country's food imports but also to boost food
exports, he said in Teluk Intan, about 165 kilometers northwest
from here, according to an official media report.
</P>
<P>
The new NAP would be presented to the cabinet in two to three
months time, Tengku Mahmud said.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, he said, oil palm estate owners would be
encouraged to rear cattle on a scale which exceeded domestic
demand so that they could serve the export market.
</P>
<P>
Tengku Mahmud said although the country was already producing
more than enough chickens and eggs for domestic consumption, the
new policy would promote improved production for exports.
</P>
<P>
The new policy would also encourage deep-fish fishing as a
means to boost the fisheries sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia spends about 10 billion ringgit (about 2.2 billion
U.S. dollars) annually on food imports.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Not Experiencing Retrenchment of Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has not
experienced retrenchment of workers in big numbers despite the
current economic problem, instead it is still facing shortage of
workers, its Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's statement was made at a time when there are talks in
the air about the retrenchment of workers by enterprises due to
the slowdown in economic activities following the current currency
and stock market turmoil affecting the country.
</P>
<P>
"There is still full employment," he told reports at a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
There is an immediate need for 60,000 workers in the plantation
sector and 20,000 workers in the manufacturing sector, said Anwar,
who is also Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also chairman of the cabinet committee on foreign
workers, said foreign workers whose permits have not expired but
had their services terminated would be re-deployed into these
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has employed about two million foreign workers mainly
from Indonesia, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said only foreign workers who are needed in priority
areas would be retained.
</P>
<P>
"Those illegal workers will have to go home," he said, hoping
the governments of countries whose citizens have been repatriated
would understand Malaysia's move.

<HEADLINE> Former PM Rao Should not Be Renominated: Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 12 (Xinhua)-- All India Congress Committee
(AICC) General Secretary Madhavrao Scindia Monday said that former
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao should not seek renomination of
the party candidate in the forthcoming general elections in line
with the principle laid down by him before the 1996 elections that
those chargesheeted would not be fielded by the party.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a "meet the press" program at the Press Club of
India here, Scindia said that Rao would go up in his esteem if he
did not apply for a party ticket. Rao was chargsheeted in several
scam cases including buying MPs and some of the cases are being
tried in the court.
</P>
<P>
It would be wrong if an individual who had laid down certain
principles attempts to throw them to winds when he himself gets
affected, Scindia said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed suggestions that the entry of Sonia Gandhi, widow
of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in active politics had
resulted in a leadership struggle in the Congress. He said that
Sonia's decision to campaign for the party has enthused the rank
and file and she herself has ruled out taking over the reins of
the party.

<HEADLINE> Good Scientific Cooperation Between Guangzhou, Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lin Shusen, the mayor of
Guangzhou in southern China, said today that his city and Hong
Kong have gotten along well for the past two decades in
manufacturing and that scientific and technological cooperation
look promising in the future.
</P>
<P>
This was made possible by inexpensive labor and plentiful land
resources in Guangzhou and nearby areas, Lin told reporters at the
first session of the Ninth Guangdong Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Land prices have gotten higher, however, and labor is no longer
as cheap as it was, but Hong Kong manufacturers haven't moved away
because business people want to improve the technological edge of
their enterprises, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has most of the institutions of higher learning and
80 percent of the research institutes in Guangdong Province, and
Hong Kong, for its part, has ties to the international market.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the mayor said, the two have many fine advantages
in scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Lin headed a science delegation in a visit to Hong
Kong and made contacts with people in business and science and
technology for future cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Cancels Trip to Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Ramos
announced Monday the cancellation of his trip to Switzerland
scheduled late this month because of the continuing economic
crisis brought about by the depreciation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, Ramos said he has to stay home to lay the
groundwork and prepare for the country's economic summit scheduled
on February 11.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be attended by economic managers and various
business groups to get their view on how to attack the pestering
financial meltdown that hit the country since last July.
</P>
<P>
The president was scheduled to address the plenary session of
the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on January
29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he made the decision after a series of consultations
with various sectors and already notified WEF organizers that he
was not going to Switzerland because of more important pressing
matters at home which requires his presence.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, however, said this does not mean that he has suddenly
reversed his desire to seize all possible opportunities in
promoting more foreign investments and trade for the country.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has earlier been criticized by some oppositions for his
frequent foreign trips, which, they said, have expended the
country's already dwindling foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has been pushing forward the "economic diplomacy policy"
since he took the office in 1992. He said foreign trips could
bring more investments and trade opportunities for the country.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Province Raises Funds Through Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Liu Xingqiang, director of
the Guangdong Provincial Securities Supervisory Commission, said
today that the stock market in Guangdong Province has become
increasingly important to Guangdong's economy and that recent
growth has provided funds for local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Guangdong had 107 enterprises listed
on China's two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with 134
types of A and B shares being traded. China had a total 745
enterprises listed last year, with Guangdong accounting for 14.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong added 17 new enterprises and raised 10.8 billion yuan
in the process last year. Its enterprises with H shares listed in
Hong Kong have also done well and China Southern Airlines raised
five billion Hong Kong dollars last July.
</P>
<P>
According to recent statistics, some 30 enterprises listed in
Guangdong were changed through mergers, purchases, or share
selling last year, which has helped expand their scale and lower
production costs, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Cellular Phone Firm to Expand Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's cellular
telephone company Mobitel plans to invest 17 million U.S. Dollars
in expanding its services in 1998, according to a report by The
Guardian today.
</P>
<P>
"Mobitel is ready for major expansion this year," the paper
said, citing a statement released by the company.
</P>
<P>
By May, the company will be expanding services in Moshi,
Shinyanga, Tanga, Dodoma and Mbeya regions. And by the end of
this year, the company expects to provide services in Pemba,
Mtwara, Songea and Tabora, which will be convenient for customers
to use their mobile phones in more places.
</P>
<P>
"Mobitel share-holders are fully supportive of the expansion
and believe the recent government policy is creating a more
attractive environment for investors." it said.
</P>
<P>
The Mobitel share-holders are Millicom International Cellular,
The Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited and the Ultimate
Security.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Mobitel invested 15 million U.S. Dollars in expanding
services, including the opening of five radio stations in Dar es
Salaam and Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the first Mobitel service was opened in Arusha and
Mwanza regions, allowing customers to roam between Dar es Salaam,
Arusha, Zanzibar and Mwanza with their hand-sets.

<HEADLINE> Iran Faces Serious Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran is facing a serious budget
deficit of 4.57 billion U.S. dollars in the current Iranian fiscal
year (ending on March 20) due to the oil price fall in the
international market, a senior Iranian official has announced.
</P>
<P>
Vice President and Head of the Plan and Budget Organization
Mohammad Ali Najafi Sunday urged the country's Majlis (parliament)
to take immediate measures to deal with the budget deficit of
8 trillion rials (about 4.57 billion dollars), local daily
Tehran Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the revenues stipulated in the budget have not
materialized, leading to the deficit in the current fiscal year,
Najafi said at the open session of the Majlis. He called for an
amendment to the budget.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis Sunday approved a bill amending the balanced budget
with a projection of state income at 75.1 trillion rials (about
42.86 billion dollars), but no details of the amendment were
revealed, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani
expected 17.7 billion dollars from oil revenue during the current
Iranian year based on an average price of 17.5 dollars per barrel
for Iranian crude oil.
</P>
<P>
However, prices for Iranian crude oil dropped to 15-16 dollars
and the country only fetched 10 billion dollars in the first
eight months of the current Iranian year. Experts said that the
annual revenue from oil exports for the country would be around
15 billion dollars with the current oil price, some 15.5 percent
below the projection figure.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil production was 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in
1997 with some 2.5 million bpd for export. The country's oil
production ceiling was raised to 3.94 million bpd according to a
decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) last November.
</P>
<P>
Many parliament members have urged for a realistic projection
for the country's oil revenue in the new year budget. Debates on
details of the new budget began today after the parliament
approved its outlines Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Mohammad Khatami anticipated an
earning of 14.9 billion dollars from oil exports based on an
average price of 17.5 dollars in its first balanced budget, but
most of the parliament members believed it was impossible for the
government to achieve the target.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Majlis would cut down the
country's expenditures for the new year since it was pessimistic
on the country's oil revenue in the new year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China's world record holder Chen
Yan touched home first to lift the women's 400m individual medley
title at the world swimming championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Chen clocked four minutes and 36.66 seconds,
nearly two seconds outside of her world mark of 4:34.79 set in the
Chinese National Games last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen said after the race that she could hardly describe her
excitement.
</P>
<P>
"We have had hard times since we arrived in Perth, " she
said. "Our training has often been interrupted by media and we
have many other distractions."
</P>
<P>
"The victory is a morale-booster to me, as well as to the
Chinese team. I'm very, very excited right now," she said, her
voice trembling.
</P>
<P>
Yana Klochkova of Ukraine, who clocked 4:45.94, picked the
silver medal and Japanese Joanne Malar got the bronze in 4:39.45.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Wu Yanyan, who led the field until the last turn,
looked worn out in the final stretch, finishing only fourth in
4:40.16.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see Wu Yanyan until with 100 meters to go," Chen
said. "I had thought I was leading all the way."
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan began swimming at the age of 6 and joined the Liaoning
club in Northeast China at 12.
</P>
<P>
Chen jumped into fame in October 1995 when she swept the 400m
individual medley, 200m and 400m freestyle events in the Chinese
City Games in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
She reached the peak of her career in the Chinese National
Games last year, setting the world record of 4:34.79 in the 400m
individual medley.
</P>
<P>
"Chen Yan has talents for swimming," said Chen's coach Han
Bingyan. "She has long arm span, supurb techniques and very good
rhythm in water."

<HEADLINE> New Ambassador Pledges Work to Improve Sudan-Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Ambassador-designate to
Egypt Ahmed Abdel Halim said today he would work for improving
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Halim, Sudan's former ambassador to Austria, made the
remarks during a few hours' stop-over at Cairo International
Airport early this morning before heading home at the end of his
duty in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said he will return to Cairo in a few days to take
up his new post as Sudan's ambassador to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I will help restore Egyptian-Sudanese relations back to
normal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed full confidence that these ties will improve
quickly as the two countries' leaders have expressed keenness on
turning a new leaf in relations between them.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of a new Sudanese ambassador to Egypt, which
reportedly will be followed by a similar move of Cairo, came amid
signs of a warm-up in Cairo-Khartoum relations.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has in the past accused Sudan of supporting Muslim
militants seeking to oust Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
install a purist Islamic state in Egypt. It has also charged
Khartoum with sheltering gunmen who tried to assassinate Mubarak
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied the charges and criticized Egypt for letting
Sudan's opposition in exile operate from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries are also at odds over a border
disput, but there have been signs of a tentative thaw in
relations.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tayeb Youssef Kordofani, the former Sudanese ambassador,

<HEADLINE> Barclays Sells Its Asian Equity Business to CSFB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Credit Suisse First Boston
(CSFB) will acquire Barclays PLC's selected investment banking and
equity businesses in Asia, the two companies announced here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement, BZW, the investment banking arm of the
London-based Barclays, will see parts of its Asian businesses
being sold to CSFB, a leading global corporate and investment
banking firm wholly owned by the Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group.
</P>
<P>
CSFB will acquire BZW's Taiwan equity business, its 70 percent
interest in an equity joint venture in Singapore, and stock
exchange seats in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. The
businesses being sold had net assets of 14 million pound sterling
as at November 30, 1997, said a new release from BZW Asia Ltd.
</P>
<P>
A total of 200 staff will be transferred from BZW's offices in
Asia to CSFB, sources from CSFB, Hong Kong said.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Stonefield, chairman of CSFB in Asia Pacific, said:
"CSFB has been actively expanding in Asia since 1996 and this
acquisition complements our growth plans in the region."
</P>
<P>
The purchase of BZW's Asian businesses will enable CSFB to
expand its capability to all major stock exchanges in the region,
including Hong Kong, Tokyo, Osaka, Mumbai, Seoul, Taipei, Shanghai
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of 1997, BZW was the fifth largest
equity issuer in the Asia Pacific market (excluding Japan), and
was ranked third in mergers and acquisition league tables.
</P>
<P>
CSFB acquired BZW's European equity and investment banking
businesses in November, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Barclays said in its news release that it will continue to
maintain a significant presence in the region through its capital,
private banking and asset management businesses.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 12 (Xinhua)-- Nordic stocks are seen falling
in the days ahead, as the deepening financial crisis in Asia is
set to continue hurting exporters such as engineering companies
Kvaerner and Asea Brown Boveri.
</P>
<P>
"What's happening in the Far East is definitely going to have
an effect on companies in the Nordic region," said Flemming
Barlett, chief equity trader at Den Danske Bank. "More defensive
stocks will do better, such as banks, food companies and
utilities."
</P>
<P>
Companies with a large part of their sales in Asia dropped the
most. Ericsson of Sweden fell 4.5 percent on Friday to 290
Swedish kronor, while its Finnish competitor Nokia dropped 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Swedish-Swiss engineering company Asea Brown Boveri's shares
fell 2.8 percent to 87.5 Swedish kronor, while Kvaerner, an

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Urges Punishment of Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has called for punishment of the masterminds of 1994
genocide in Rwanda, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Rwanda National University in Butare Sunday, the
president advised the Rwandan government and people to give
priority to reconciliation. But he said Rwanda can achieve
reconciliation only by justice.
</P>
<P>
"Reconciliation can only be achieved through justice where the
perpetuators are punished," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The authors should be hanged, the executors and those who
abetted the process can get different punishment ranging from
life imprisonment or imprisonment with labor," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also advised the Rwandan government and people to
encourage private investment and support both local and foreign
investors to reconstruct the country.
</P>
<P>
It is important to set up the prerequisites of investment such
as good infrastructure, a road network and communication
facilities.
</P>
<P>
He listed unemployment, low tax base, poor earnings, poor
services, shortage of market goods and lack of markets as the
main problems for Africans.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the Ugandan president to the university's
students, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said Museveni is an
African intellectual who has devoted time to analyzing Africa's
problems and as a brother who has studied the problems of Rwanda
closely.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of both countries have discussed a wide range
of issues earlier during the day.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Keeps Above 64 US Cents level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
above the crucial 64 US cents level for the first time in a week,
but could not sustain larger gains made at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 64.08 US cents Monday, marginally
higher than 63.98 cents late Friday but down from 64.16 US cents
at the start of the session.
</P>
<P>
The currency was largely confined to a range of 64.05 US cents
to 64.25 US cents on Monday - relatively tight trading after last
week's large swings.
</P>
<P>
Traders said market participants were wary of testing the
Australian dollar's downside for fear of further Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) intervention.
</P>
<P>
Reported selling of US dollars and buying of Australian dollars
by the central bank on Friday sent the local currency soaring one
US cent during that session.
</P>
<P>
Sideways trading in the US dollar/Japanese yen also gave the
Australian dollar a breather after recent surges in the greenback
proved disastrous for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The market was awaiting the outcome of meetings between
political leaders in the Asia region. Of particular concern is
Indonesia where the rupiah halved its value in four days last
week.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesian President Suharto Monday vowed to
accelerate reforms under an IMF rescue program as a high-level US
mission prepared to visit Jakarta to underscore concern and
support for the region.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended Monday at 84.69 yen, from 84.27
Friday, and at 1.1683 marks, from 1.1608.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks in Biggest Fall Since October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
Monday dived 2.3 percent in its biggest one day fall since the
October plunge last year on further fears of the Asian meltdown's
impact on the local economy and company performances.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index fell 60.7 points to 2542.4 - its
lowest level in three weeks - as Hong Kong shares plummeted more
than ten percent in morning trade on worry about regional
collapse, exchange rates and escalating interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Australian shares held up reasonably strongly in the face of
Hong Kong, with most of the all ordinaries fall coming in early
trade in reaction to Friday's sharp falls on Wall Street, which
lost 222 points, and futures-led selling.
</P>
<P>
"I think our market performed quite well today considering all
the things that happened with Wall Street and Hong Kong," Steve
Negrine from Reynolds and Co. said.
</P>
<P>
"There was a bit of weakness in the majors but it held up
reasonably well. I think the bonds rally has really helped us and
has provided some momentum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index dropped 100.7 points to 4399.5, with
bigger stocks particularly being sold down.
</P>
<P>
Telstra installment receipts were one of the hardest hit, down
11 cents, and more than 20 million of the receipts were traded.
</P>
<P>
The major banks also fell sharply, with the most Asian exposed,
ANZ, falling 35 cents, Westpac lost 24.4 cents, National Australia
Bank fell 43.9 cents and Commonwealth Bank lost 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
Mining and resource stocks lost even more ground in the selling
market while gold stocks took a tumble on the weakening bullion
price.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 29.4 points to 1054.9 with the
gold index closing 48.1 points lower at 951.6.
</P>
<P>
The gold bullion price fell 4.00 US dollars per ounce to
278.00.
</P>
<P>
National turnover for the day was 253.3 million shares at a
value of 741 million Australian dollars (474.24 million US
dollars) with falls outnumbering rises 859 to 323.

<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China's shipbuilding output hit
an all-time high with a combined 2.29 million tons last year, up
20.5 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 5 percent share of the world
shipbuilding market and puts China in third place following Japan
and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released at a national shipbuilding industry
meeting held here today. Vice-premiers Li Lanqing and Wu Bangguo
wrote congratulatory letters for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The country sold a record 22 billion yuan worth-of vessels in
1997. Exported were 1.96 million tons of ships earning 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign currency, a year-on-year rise of
13.6 percent, according to Xu Penghang, general manager of the
China State Shipbuilding Corp. (CSSC).
</P>
<P>
The CSSC accepted 2.07 million tons of shipbuilding orders,
including 1.62 million tons of export-oriented vessels. The amount
of high-tech and high-added-value vessels -- such as liquefied
petroleum gas carriers, container vessels, and multi-purpose
vessels -- reached 850,000 tons, a rise of 16.3 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
A group of state key research projects -- including 150,000-ton
oil tankers, 52,000-ton multi-purpose ships, high-speed container
ships, and high-performance vehicles -- have been completed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shanghai's Waigaoqiao shipbuilding base has been
approved by the State Council. Work is nearly completed on a
100,000-ton building berth of the Bohai Shipbuilding Plant and a
150,000-ton dry dock of Shanhaiguan Ship Plant.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that China's shipbuilding output is expected to remain
at 2.3 million tons in 1998.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A five-member bench of the
Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Ajmal Mian on Monday
dismissed two identical petitions against the amended Contempt Act
and withdrew the order issued earlier to suspend the amendment.
</P>
<P>
The bench heard arguments from both sides and decided the
matter.
</P>
<P>
The two petitions were filed last November soon after the
Parliament passed an amendment to the Contempt Act giving the
right of appeal.
</P>
<P>
A five-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice
Sajjad Ali Shah issued an order to the president not to sign the
amended bill and if he had done so the said act would be
suspended.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Ajmal Mian observed that the petitions were filed
before the bill becoming a law, as the president had not signed
the bill at the time of filling the petitions.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Shortage Hits Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide petrol shortage has
hit Ghana in the last three weeks, causing great confusions at
the few stations still with supply, a report reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
The situation is the same in major towns throughout the west
African country, with commercial vehicle drivers taking advantage
by charging high fares, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Mines and Energy has reportedly blamed the
Tema oil refinery for the shortage, saying that it did not act
promptly when one of its contracted suppliers failed to deliver
25,000 tons of petrol as expected.
</P>
<P>
The refinery's scanty two-day reserve instead of the supposed
two week's reserve is also to blame, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The refinery has now started importing from Togo, Cote
d'Ivoire and Cameroun, but there is no immediate improvement in
fuel supply, the report added.

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After the forcible removal by police of unemployed people
who occupied some government job and social welfare offices, the
anti-employment militants are trying to continue the fight by
calling for further nationwide protests. Meanwhile, Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin has justified the action by police to force the
protesters out of government agencies.
</P>
<P>
-- Four years after the genocide took place in Rwanda, France
still dares not face up to the ambiguous role it has played in
Rwanda. France supported the Hutus before the massacre and
continued to support them during and after the massacres. Le
Figaro is making an inquiry into the policy of former President
Francois Mitterrand toward Rwanda which was inherited by the
rightwing government of Edouard Balladur, which was said to be
aimed to stopping the expansion of the United States in Africa.

<HEADLINE> 21 More Kenyans Killed by Rift Valley Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The killer disease diagnosed
as Rift Valley fever claimed at least 21 more Kenyans in Garissa
and Wajir districts, Northeastern Province, in the last two days,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This brings to more than 350 the number of who have died since
the outbreak was first made public by Northeastern Provincial
Commissioner Maurice Makhanu in late December, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, Red Cross Health Coordinator Saade Abdala, who
confirmed the deaths, said in Garissa town that the disease was
under control as those affected were being offered medical
attention and were not dying as quickly as before.
</P>
<P>
Most victims got the disease from handling ailing livestock,
she noted, suggesting local residents burn all carcasses.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic, which also affected livestock, was communicable
from livestock to human beings, said Abdala, who is in charge of
Red Cross activities in Garissa District and runs a treatment
camp for victims of the disease there.
</P>
<P>
Fresh rains have continued to pound the region in the past two
weeks and have flooded the area again, making the disease, which
had actually subsided, recur.
</P>
<P>
The disease, whose victims vomit, diarrhoea and bleed from
body orifices was diagnosed as the deadly rift valley fever by
medical experts following tests carried out in South Africa and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The collection of blood samples from victims of the disease
for further specialized tests abroad is still on.
</P>
<P>
Rift Valley Fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes
and is predominantly found in domestic animals. It can also
affect human beings exposed to heavy infection by direct contact
with infected animals.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the disease erupted in Egypt with 200,000 people
infected, out of whom 600 died.

PHNOM PENH, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said Monday that he will not welcome any further
lessons from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on
human rights and democracy in Cambodia
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said this Monday at a seminar on good governance sponsored
by the Australian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen gave such remarks after hearing that former ASEAN
delegates from Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand plan to
make another trip to Cambodia to help the deposed First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranaiddh to take part in the 1998
elections.
</P>
<P>
The delegates of the three nations made their first trip to
Cambodia in early July 1997 just after Prince Ranaiddh was ousted
from power on charges of negotiating with the Khmer Rouge hard
liners.
</P>
<P>
"I would recommand that the ASEAN nations do not worry
so much about situation in Cambodia," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"I would welcome them if they are going to give us advice on
economy matters," he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Universities to Recruit More Fee-Paying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian universities would
be forced to recruit an additional 45,000 local and overseas
fee-paying students over the next three years in the wake of the
federal government's decision to freeze all future spending on
higher education, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report that was prepared for Education Minister David Kemp
also confirmed the number of publicly funded student places would
drop nationally by at least 1,700 within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
National Union of Students President, Rose Tracey said "Kemp's
plans are designed to fundamentally change the face of the
education sector in a bid to knock down the public sector wherever
it exists," Tracey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Quite simply, more fees means less access," she said, "If this
trend continues there can be no doubt that no one but the very
rich or the very lucky will be able to get into university."
</P>
<P>
Opposition Education spokesman Mark Latham said the
government's decision to establish two tiers of access and
opportunity was unfair.
</P>
<P>
"It is plainly unfair for access to university now to be
determined by whether or not families have a spare 100,000
Australian dollars (65000 US dollars) with which they can buy a
student place," Latham said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Hard working students who have studied well and achieved solid
school leaving results are being punished solely because they come
from a lower to middle income background," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the Asian economic crisis would place more
pressure on our universities to make up for lost revenue by fees
paid by Australian students.

<HEADLINE> California Firm to Start First Major Trial of AIDS Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A biotechnology unit based
in south San Francisco will put the first AIDS vaccine it has
engineered into human trial sometime this year, a local newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the San Jose Mercury News, the VaxGen Inc. study,
which will cost 20 million U.S. dollars and three years to
complete, is expected to involve 7,500 healthy volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Half the volunteers, of which, 5,000 would be in the United
States and 2,500 in Thailand, will get the vaccine while the other
half get placebos.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the vaccine, the key ingredient of which is a
protein that helps hold the AIDS virus together, would be
available to the public in the early part of the next century, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, dubbed as AIDSVAX, uses the same gp120, which was
also the key ingredients of an earlier version. But the new
vaccine appears to be much more robust than the previous one which
was not considered encouraging by mixed results of studies.
</P>
<P>
Most of the volunteers to be involved in the test are
considered at high risk of contracting HIV. They would be tracked
for three years.

<HEADLINE> Australian Net Worth Rises to 1.2 Trillion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Australia's net worth
increased to 1.9 trillion Australian dollars (about 1.21 trillion
U.S. dollars) by the end of June 1996, or the end of the fiscal
year of 1995-1996, official figures released Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 2.1 percent increase over the previous
fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, a survey of the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed.
</P>
<P>
Households with assets such as bank deposits, superannuation,
land and housing contributed about three-quarters of the total
national net worth, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Net worth was defined by the bureau as the difference between
total assets and liabilities including company shares.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's net worth was estimated at 1,909.5 billion
Australian dollars (about 1.21 trillion U.S. dollars) at the end
of June 1996," the ABS said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990-1991 recession, Australia's net worth grew
continuously and consistently representing at least four times the
level of annual gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The strongest growth in Australia's net worth was exhibited
during the fiscal years from 1992-1993 to 1994-1995, when annual
rates of at least 4 percent were achieved, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Households and unincorporated enterprises recorded a 3 percent
increase in their net worth in fiscal 1995-1996, which rose to 1.4
trillion Australian dollars (896 billion U.S. dollars), accounting
for about three quarters of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Their major assets comprised land, housing, superannuation and
savings, with loans representing the major liability.
</P>
<P>
The value of Australia's total produced assets rose by 3.4
percent from a year earlier to 1,372.1 billion Australian dollars
(878 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of fiscal 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
Australia's natural resources accounted for 822 billion
Australian dollars (526 billion U.S. dollars) of the net worth,
including total land value estimated at 408 billion U.S. dollars,
2.1 percent up from the level of 12 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
The value of minerals still below ground rose 3 percent to
114.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The general government sector accounted for roughly one-fifth
of Australia's net worth.
</P>
<P>
Securities, such as treasury bonds, was the principle liability
of the general government sector, although the ABS survey found
Australia's debt ratio was substantially lower than most
industrialized countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Former U.S. Military Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China is satisfied with recent
efforts made by the armed forces of China and the United States to
implement the spirit of last year's summit between the leaders of
the two countries, Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the remarks while meeting with William Perry, former
U.S. Secretary of Defense, and the delegation led by him.
</P>
<P>
Chi told the U.S. visitors that in the past year the armed
forces of the two countries exchanged a series of visits of
high-ranking officers and conducted active contacts in
professional fields.
</P>
<P>
He said the activities helped maintain smooth channels of
dialogue between the two sides, improve mutual understanding and
trust, and advance relations between the two armed forces and the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit
to the United States in October created new opportunities for the
development of military-to-military relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's U.S. visit achieved the goals of promoting
understanding, expanding common ground, increasing cooperation and
joining efforts to create the future, he said. The visit advanced
bilateral relations to a new stage of development, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for the efforts made by Perry and
other visitors to promote military-to-military exchanges and
cooperation between the two countries. He said he hopes that they
will continue to contribute to the healthy, stable development of
relations between the two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the current strategic partnership between the United
States and China is not directed at any third country. Instead, it
is for the purpose of improving regional security and stability,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Military-to-military relations are an important factor in the
strategic partnership, he said, adding that since he and the
delegation are in non-government functions, they will explore new
concepts and ways of properly dealing with bilateral relations
during the visit, in order to contribute to the expansion of
Sino-U.S. relations, especially between the armed forces and
defense departments of the two countries.

Net worth was defined by the bureau as the difference between
total assets and liabilities including company shares.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's net worth was estimated at 1,909.5 billion
Australian dollars (about 1.21 trillion U.S. dollars) at the end
of June 1996," the ABS said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990-1991 recession, Australia's net worth grew
continuously and consistently representing at least four times the
level of annual gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The strongest growth in Australia's net worth was exhibited
during the fiscal years from 1992-1993 to 1994-1995, when annual
rates of at least 4 percent were achieved, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Households and unincorporated enterprises recorded a 3 percent
increase in their net worth in fiscal 1995-1996, which rose to 1.4
trillion Australian dollars (896 billion U.S. dollars), accounting
for about three quarters of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Their major assets comprised land, housing, superannuation and
savings, with loans representing the major liability.
</P>
<P>
The value of Australia's total produced assets rose by 3.4
percent from a year earlier to 1,372.1 billion Australian dollars
(878 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of fiscal 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
Australia's natural resources accounted for 822 billion
Australian dollars (526 billion U.S. dollars) of the net worth,
including total land value estimated at 408 billion U.S. dollars,
2.1 percent up from the level of 12 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
The value of minerals still below ground rose 3 percent to
114.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The general government sector accounted for roughly one-fifth
of Australia's net worth.
</P>
<P>
Securities, such as treasury bonds, was the principle liability
of the general government sector, although the ABS survey found
Australia's debt ratio was substantially lower than most
industrialized countries.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Send Home 4,000 Filipino Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 4,000 Filipino workers
who are currently working in Malaysia will be repatriated this
year, the official Philippine News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Ambassador to Malaysia Gregorio Brilliantes told the
news agency Monday that most Filipino workers to be affected by
Malaysia's gradual repatriation plan are those in the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
According to him, these workers will include some 1,000
construction workers, 2,000 from the hotel and leisure industries,
and 1,000 more from the domestic services such as housemaids.
</P>
<P>
Those to be repatriated are just a fraction of the more than
30,000 Filipino workers now working in different places of
Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brilliantes said that the Malaysian government was forced to
repatriate foreign workers to protect its sagging economy as a
result of the falling Malaysian currency, the ringgit, which used
to be very strong.
</P>
<P>
Brilliantes said more overseas workers are expected to be sent
home by Malaysia this year because of its worsening economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
The report also said Indonesia, whose rupiah has devalued by
more than 177 percent since the crisis struck the country in July
1997, is likely to follow the lead of Malaysia and send some
Filipino workers home.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, one of the hardest-hit countries by the currency
crisis, is expected to send about 3,000 Filipino workers home
early this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is preparing all the necessary
measures to respond to the needs of the repatriated workers when
they get back, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has about 4.2 million workers working abroad,
mainly in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and North America, as
domestic helpers, construction workers, nurses and seamen.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, overseas Filipino workers sent home more than 5.7
billion U.S. dollars in remittances through banks, accounting for
5 percent of the country's gross national product last year.
</P>
<P>
Remittances from overseas workers have been a major source of
the Philippines' foreign reserves in recent years while the
country has been incurring a trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of more and more Filipino workers is expected
to reduce the dollar inflow to the country and increase the number
of unemployed people, economists said.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang's Oil Industry Developing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The three oil fields in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region pumped 15.8
million tons of crude oil in 1997, an increase of 10 percent over
the 1996 figure. The output amounted to 11.5 percent of the
country's total onshore oil output.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, a total of 350 million tons of oil
reserves had been confirmed in the three oil fields in the
region's Tarim, Junggar and Turpan-Hami basins, today's People's
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates that the oil industry in Xinjiang has entered
a period of rapid development, with last year's proven reserves
and the growth rate of crude oil output ranking first in the
country, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Following the discovery of an oil field with reserves exceeding
100 million tons in the Junggar Basin, another large oil field in
Lukqun was found in the Turpan Basin near the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
China's oil industry, which now produces more than 140 million
tons of crude oil a year, has been stymied by inadequate
reserves. In the east, which provides 80 percent of the country's
oil, reserves have been declining by 20 million tons annually and
production costs have increased rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In response, China in the early 1990s turned to its western
areas for new resources, and oil exploration in the three Xinjiang
basins has entered a prosperous period.

<HEADLINE> Worst Snow Storm in Decade Hits Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The severe snow storm that hit
Lebanon since Saturday night has claimed at least one person's
life and the closing of many roads, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star said that according to the latest police
reports, one woman was killed and her husband and sister
were wounded in the country's worst storm in ten years when
their car skidded and overturned on a road in the country's
eastern province of Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
Driving on roads in mountains with heights above 500 meters
should be handled with extreme care and only cars equipped with
chains should venture out at this altitude until the bad weather
abates, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit area is the Bekaa, with some places covered by
snow as deep as one meter. Many villages were isolated and
motorists stranded and schools closed, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological department said that the storm, which came
from the East coast of the Mediterranean Sea, affected Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan and Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The same source forecast the stormy weather will continue
until this evening.

<HEADLINE> China's Output Value of Building Materials Increases 9.75 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China's building materials
industry topped 310 billion yuan in output value for 1997, up 9.75
percent over 1996, according to Zhang Renwei, director of the
State Administration of Building Materials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today at a national conference on building materials,
Zhang said China produced 510 million tons of cement last year, up
3.63 percent over 1996, and 146 million cases of flat glass, an
increase of 5.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in 1997 China's production of building
materials made the following gains:
</P>
<P>
-- The quality of the products improved, with the qualification
ratio arriving at nearly 90 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- The relationship between production and marketing improved;
</P>
<P>
-- Earnings from exports exceeded the 1996 figures. In 1997,
the earnings from exports of the country's building materials
stood at 2.48 billion U.S. dollars, up 14.77 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that this year China will support the development of
large building materials enterprises, improve industrial structure
and give priority to the development of quality cement and glass
urgently needed by the national economy, and for the construction
of key projects.
</P>
<P>
The country will also work diligently to develop new building
materials needed for residential buildings and interior
decoration, the official added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Bailout Terms Need Review: Thai Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda stressed Sunday that the conditions of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package for Thailand
need to be reviewed to fit changed circumstances.
</P>
<P>
He said that when Thailand accepted IMF assistance in August
last year, no one expected the current regional currency turmoil.
Since then, however, circumstances have changed and the conditions
need to be reviewed, the Nation newspaper quoted Tarrin as saying
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin, who is scheduled to visit the United States next Monday
to Wednesday, said he will discuss with IMF officials changes in
the country's monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin is to visit the United States at a time when the Thai
currency, the baht, has sunk to 53-54 baht to the U.S. dollar,
from 25.79 baht before its float last July and the IMF's
prescriptions for some Asian countries, including Thailand, are
under attack by top world economists.
</P>
<P>
These economists argue that the IMF is prescribing too much
austerity and will end up pushing recipient countries into severe
recession.
</P>
<P>
Critics believe that higher interest rates, less government
spending and increased taxes, as required by the IMF, will only
make the patients even sicker.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Plans to Buy 40 U.S.-made F-15 Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is planning to buy 40
F-15 fighters from the United States to enhance the strength of
its air force, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has conveyed such an intention to the Pentagon and
other U.S. defense policy-making organs, senior sources from the
Turkish General Staff were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
the deal aims to further strengthen the combat effectiveness of
Turkey's fighter fleet.
</P>
<P>
The jet, named "F-15 Eagle", is a kind of double-engine
fighter equipped with advanced electronic guiding and more
powerful fire systems.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Turkey's decision to buy these
fighters was in response to an earlier Greek move to purchase 40
more advanced F-16 fighters from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly agreed to deliver these fighter jets to
the Greek government, annoying Ankara, who said that this sale
will possibly break the military balance over the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that we will face any difficulty from the
U.S. administration with regard to obtaining permission from the
sale (of the F-15 jets)," Turkish senior defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that they believe Washington will not adopt double
standards concerning the arms sales to Greece and Turkey, both
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
The United States had imposed a ban on the sale of three
frigates to Turkey citing Ankara's allegedly poor human rights
record, but the ban was lifted late last year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over some issues,
including the airspace limits over the Aegean Sea, the sea-bed
mineral rights as well as the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Their warplanes and naval vessels are often involved in minor
conflicts in the air and the Aegean Sea. The two countries were
nearly on the brink of war in early 1996 due to disputes over an
islet in the Aegean Sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
has confirmed plans for building its first nuclear power plant by
signing a design contract.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the No.1 Nuclear Power Plant of the Hunan
Province will start in 2005 with an investment of three to four
billion U.S. dollars. When completed, it will have an installed
capacity of two million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials began preparations for the plant in
1992. In May the Hunan provincial government designated the Wuling
Company to be in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
Wuling Company, with a capital of more than 10 billion yuan, is
also in charge of the Lingjintan and Wuqiangxi hydropower
stations. Wuling is also responsible for exploiting
hydroelectricity in the Yuanjiang River area in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Two institutes -- Northwest Electric Design and Hunan
provincial Electric Prospecting and Design -- have undertaken the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Chief Meets with Former U.S. Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China wishes to maintain its
regular military-to-military dialogues and exchanges of visits of
high-ranking officials with the United States, the Chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Fu
Quanyou said here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a delegation from the United States led
by former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry this morning, Fu
said the Chinese armed forces wish to conduct exchanges with the
U.S. military in broader fields.
</P>
<P>
Fu said China places importance on developing
military-to-military relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation to the members of the U.S. delegation
for the efforts that they have made to improve and expand
relations between the two countries and their armed forces. He
also reviewed his visit to the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
Fu briefed his U.S. guests about the latest developments in
China's army building. He noted that at the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) last September, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin announced that China would downsize its
armed forces by another 500,000 in the next three years on the
basis of a 1-million-man cut in the 1980s. He said this move is a
major step that the Chinese army adopted to promote its striving
for quality, as well as a reflection of the Chinese people's
determination and earnest desire to maintain peace.
</P>
<P>
Perry said he will continue to contribute to the strengthening
of relations between the two countries and their armed forces. He
said he hoped that the United States would be able to assist the
modernization drive by China's army.
</P>
<P>
This is Perry's 10th visit to China in 17 years. He is here as
guest of the China Foundation of International Strategic Study.

TOKYO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stock prices fell sharply
Monday with the key Nikkei index slipping to a two and half-year

fresh economic steps in Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Diet
(Parliament) speech earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section

Turnover on the First Section came to an estimated 310 million
shares, down from Friday's 399.79 million shares.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Offer to Send Troops to S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine has denied that his country suggested sending troops to
south Lebanon in order to provide security in case of Israel's
pull-out from there, the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
On the first leg of his three-country regional tour, Vedrine
held talks with his Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Boueiz, Vedrine confirmed that
France has never made such a suggestion, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that his country is striving to produce a
fair solution for the Arab-Israeli conflict and achieve the
implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolution
425.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said he considers as "encouraging" Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai's offer last week to withdraw from
the security zone in south Lebanon provided Israel's northern
security is guaranteed by Lebanon,
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim of protecting its northern
areas from cross-border attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
However, Vedrine noted that "this statement is the first of its
kind and we should not forget that resolution 425 does not include
conditions."
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted in 1978 after Israel's invasion, calls
for an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon without conditions,
and restoration of peace and security and the extension of
Lebanese authority over the region.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also denied that he discussed the Israeli suggestion
with Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam during Khaddam's
visit to France last week.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon, is the main
power broker in this country. Lebanon and Syria have been keeping
special relations and vowed to carry out negotiations
simultaneously with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the regional situation, the French minister said
that "I have previously expressed my sadness about the peace
process and the stalemate it is passing through but this does not
mean that I am pessimistic in the long run."
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who is on a brief visit to Lebanon, arrived in Beirut
Sunday night. During his visit, he will also meet with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berry and Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Lebanon, he will leave for Syria and Jordan on
a peacemaking mission which has taken him to Israel, Palestinian
self-rule areas and Egypt.

CHENGDU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Xichang, known as China's
"space city" and capital city of the Liangshan Yi Nationality
Autonomous Prefecture in southwestern Sichuan Province, is making
a new effort to open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the prefecture signed 117 cooperation
contracts, introducing an investment of one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Construction of China's satellite launching base in the city
during the past three decades has greatly improved the local
infrastructure and made the city known as "Asia's Houston."
</P>
<P>
Now, the prefecture -- with potential hydropower capacity of 71
million kilowatts, 59 varieties of mineral resources and 80
percent of the province's nonferrous metal reserves -- is making
full use of the city's reputation to attract investors.
</P>
<P>
As a result, an American company committed 1.2 billion yuan to
build a hydropower station with a capacity of 200,000 kilowatts.
Other foreign multinational corporations and domestic investors
are expected to follow suit.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Exploitation of Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to double its gas
production capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by 2005 as one of
the state's important strategies for developing energy resources.
</P>
<P>
According to experts with the China National Petroleum
Corp. (CNPC), China is expected to verify additional onshore gas
reserves of 1 trillion cubic meters by the end of the century,
with the accumulative total approaching 2 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's gas-production capacity should be
increased by 10 billion cubic meters, with the cumulative total
topping 25 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
CNPC president Zhou Yongkang estimated major breakthroughs in
the expansion of proven gas reserves and production capacity in
the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, the Tarim Basin and Sichuan
Province. The annual gas output should reach 30 billion cubic
meters by 2005. he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the country's gas production potential is
huge. Through years of vigorous development, three large-scale gas
production areas have taken shape in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region total
gas reserves of 230 billion cu m have been verified. Total gas
reserves of 200 billion cubic meters have been confirmed in the
eastern part of Sichuan. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
total gas reserves of 160 billion cubic meters have been verified,
in addition to the discovery of a group of new gas-bearing
structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, a large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion
cubic meters has been identified.
</P>
<P>
Alongside domestic gas exploration, active efforts are under
way to utilize the gas resources of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In central Asia, China has joined an international gas
exploration project which envisages the construction of a
long-distance gas pipeline running through China and the Korean
Peninsula to Japan. The project could provide China with a gas
supply of 25 billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia should deliver 25 billion cubic meters of gas
annually to China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: E. African Projects Get World Bank's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- More and more private sector
projects in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, all the three members of
the East Africa Cooperation (EAC), have been getting funding from
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) over recent years.
</P>
<P>
More than 66 million Dollars have been committed by IFC, the
private sector lending arm of the World Bank, to projects in
Kenya since 1970, the East African weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
Major projects in Kenya financed by the IFC include
Pan-African Paper Mills (EA) Ltd, whose cumulative loan since
1970 has reached 30 million Dollars, Magadi Soda Company Ltd with
nine million Dollars and Rift Valley Textiles Ltd with 2.1
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Between 1984 and 1997, the IFC provided 25 million Dollars in
loans to more than 16 projects in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The biggest loan of 7.5 million Dollars issued to Uganda went
to sugar Corporation of Uganda Ltd in 1984, followed by 6.5
million Dollars to East African Glass Works Ltd in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, four Ugandan projects under Metro Hotel Ltd, Conrad
Plaza, Kiwa II Industries Ltd and Afritours &AMP; Travel Ltd
qualified for loans totalling 1.5 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the Ugandan projects lined up for consideration this
year is Mosa Courts, which is seeking an 800,000-Dollar loan for
the expansion of its apartments in Kampala at a cost of 2.7
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, five projects have been approved by the IFC. The
biggest, worth four million Dollars, went to Sunflag (Tanzania)
Ltd to streamline and expand its textile operations in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Data Network got 2.25 million Dollars to build and
operate a public data communications network for domestic and
international service.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's biggest beneficiary of all time is the Tourism
Promotion Services (T) Ltd which got a loan of eight million
Dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
There is no standard application form of IFC financing. A
company or entrepreneur, foreign or domestic, seeking to
establish a new venture or expand an existing enterprise can
approach IFC directly by requesting a meeting or by submitting
preliminary project information.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of IFC's funding required for lending is
borrowed in the international financial markets through public
bond issues or private placements, while the remaining 20 percent
is borrowed from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The IFC is the largest multilateral source of loan and equity
financing for private sector projects in the developing world.

<HEADLINE> China Red Cross Society Mobilized For Earthquake Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of China
(RCSC) has issued an urgent circular urging the Red Cross
Societies at all levels to assist the quake-hit areas in north
China's Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
The Society has also sent a working group to the region, with
the first batch of relief fund of 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 US
dollars). The group is working on-the-spot to evaluate the
disaster effects and help organize relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross Society of the Hong Kong Special Administration
Region (SAR) cabled the RCSC immediately after the quake, saying
that it would donate an emergency assistant fund amounting to one
million yuan for the quake victims.
</P>
<P>
The strong quake has also aroused great concern from the
international community. The Red Cross Society of Japan has rushed
10,000 blankets to the quake-affected areas. The International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have also
expressed sympathy to the quake victims.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Foil Misuse of Official Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Transport Department is taking measures to curb the misuse of
official cars to save government expenditure, local daily the
Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The transport department in Mpumalanga Province will install
electronic equipment on government cars in a bid to stop corrupt
officials from misusing them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Most civil servants who were responsible for crashing or
abusing government vehicles, costing millions in repairing fees,
often drove these vehicles without permission, according to
Jackson Mthembu, a top official in transport department in the
province.
</P>
<P>
"We want to monitor how they were being driven, the kilometers
they traveled and the areas they visited," Mthembu said.
</P>
<P>
Reckless driving and general disregard for the province's
property had cost Mpumalanga Province more than 770,000 Rand
(154,000 U.S. Dollars) in repairs in the financial year up to
March 1997. In the following 10 months that figure rocketed to
1.1 million Rand (220,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
These figures excluded some cases where vehicles were written
off as beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
In Gauteng, a major province where the administrative capital
of Pretoria and Johannesburg, the commercial and business center
in South Africa is situated, civil servants crashed more than six
government vehicles every day during the past financial year,
costing four million Rand (800,000 U.S. Dollars) in repairs.
</P>
<P>
Mthembu said Transport Minister Mac Maharaj and the provincial
governments throughout the country were treating the matter
seriously because of the financial implications.
</P>
<P>
Misuse of cars was "draining provincial and national
resources". "With the help of police, we have been impounding
cars taken without permits and are then charging the corrupt
officials," Mthembu said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economy Growth Predicted Slower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) downed its 1997 forecast for gross domestic product (GDP)
growth of Kenya to 3.2 percent from 3.6 percent in its January
monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
The eastern African country saw 4.6 percent GDP growth rate in
1996 and was expecting growth to rebound to a higher level this
year.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy grew 3.2 percent from November 1996 to
November 1997, the same as in the year to October, according to
the CBK report, adding inflation stood at just 8.3 percent in the
year to December.
</P>
<P>
The bank blamed the fall on political uncertainty in an
election year, drought hitting agriculture in the first quarter
of 1997, declining investment, continuous power interruptions and
generally poor infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The suspended three-year 205-million-U.S.-Dollar aid package
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on July 31 and a wave of
political and ethnic violence around the same time sent investors
and tourists scurrying for the exits.
</P>
<P>
That sent the Kenyan Shilling into a tailspin, losing 25
percent of its value in August and recovered slightly later.
</P>
<P>
So far the CBK's efforts to stabilize the currency and keep
inflation in single digit through tight monetary policies have
been widely believed successful.
</P>
<P>
But the high interest rates which have accompanied the bank's
tight monetary policy have also contributed to the economic
slowdown, analysts warn.
</P>
<P>
New Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae, however, says he would
seek bipartisan support to solve the problems and steer Kenya's
economy to better times.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae's appointment was announced on Thursday after general
elections held on December 29 and 30 returned President Daniel
arap Moi to power for his fifth and final five-year term.

<P>
DHAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for
Agriculture Development (IFAD) has assured Bangladesh that it
would continue its support to the South Asian country for boosting
its agriculture, local press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was given by visiting IFAD President Fawzi H.
Al-Sultan, who arrived here on Sunday for a four-day visit, at a
meeting with Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria, who
is also chairman of the Governing Council of the IFAD, soon after
his arrival.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the IFAD president will call on Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina, and hold meetings with ministers of
finance, local government and regional development, food and
agriculture, and state ministers for fishery and livestock and
land.
He will also visit Mymensingh and Netrakona, 120 and 140
kilometers north of here respectively, to see IFAD-assisted
development projects there.
</P>
<P>
The IFAD has so far granted 265 million U.S. dollars in
assistance to Bangladesh for projects in livestock, forest, water
resources and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sets Date for Resumed Talks over Loans to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A team from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) is set to visit Kenya on February 9 to resume
talks with new Kenyan Financial Minister Simeon Nyachae on a
suspended multi-million-Dollar loan program.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two sides -- and a three-year
205-million-Dollar aid package -- were suspended last July when
the IMF said it was not convinced the Kenyan government was
committed to ending corruption.
</P>
<P>
The IMF experts are returning at the invitation of the Kenyan
government, in part to learn how and when Kenyan plans to
implement economic reforms which it has promised would be carried
out after the 1997 poll, said Goodall Gondwe, deputy director of
the IMF's Africa Department and the team's leader.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was happy with Kenya's energy sector reforms and
welcomed the new Anti-Corruption Authority although it wished to
discuss how the authority would operate, Gondwe said in an
interview with the weekly East African published today.
</P>
<P>
However, the fund was disappointed that Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, who won the multi-party poll held on December 29
and 30, has not issued a public statement supporting the
independence of the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the IMF welcomed Nyachae's appointment and
considered him "a man who understands institutions and is a
stickler for legality."
</P>
<P>
An experienced and forceful Nyachae has been widely regarded
in the local business community as a command economy enthusiast
and a supporter of intervention.
</P>
<P>
Moi met with Gondwe and his team in coastal Mombasa in
September and agreed on measures to "strengthen management of the
energy sector, safeguard the independence of the KRA, ensure that
Anti-Corruption Authority would be independent and establish
accountability for past financial infractions."
</P>
<P>
Kenya promised to implement a series of reforms before and
after election and "a good deal" of what was promised had been
done, Gondwe said last week.
</P>
<P>
He said in September that substantive talks on a second-year
annually Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)
arrangement would start only after the government took decisive
action on reform issues.
</P>
<P>
The IMF allowed the first year's agreement to lapse with the
disbursement of the initial 37-million-Dollar slice soon after
the three-year ESAF loan package was signed in April 1995. Kenya
failed to convince the IMF to release the second
37-million-Dollar loan which was lost.
</P>
<P>
Hopes now hinge on salvaging the remaining 148 million Dollars
and accompanying structural adjustment credits from the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
New IMF guidelines on corruption say staff can recommend
halting a loan if they suspect poor governance is hurting
economic performance or threatening implementation of an IMF
refrom plan.

<HEADLINE> Air Europe Increases Flights to Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian-registered Air
Europe has increased its flights to Zanzibar from two to five a
week to meet the increasing demand of tourists to the Indian
isles, Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the airline's representative Hassan Gharib as
saying that Zanzibar, an archipelago made up of Pemba and
Zanzibar islands, along with roughly 50 smaller islands, is at
the moment in the peak tourist season normally extending to
April.
</P>
<P>
Air Europe's aircraft have started to fly to Zanzibar once on
Sundays and Tuesdays and three times on Wednesday since December
21, as compared with twice a week on Sundays and Wednesdays
previously, Gharib said.
</P>
<P>
The fight routes of the airline, which started in Zanzibar in
July of 1993, include Milano-Zanzibar, Verona to Zanzibar and
Rome to Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing-767 aircraft, each with a capacity of 271
passengers, fly from Italy to Zanzibar via Kilimanjaro of
Tanzania and Kenya's Mombasa for oil refueling, carrying an
average of 200 passengers each time.
</P>
<P>
The tourists, mostly on package tours, are being served by a
group of tour operators, such as Ventagilo, Franco Rosso, Tori
Zanda, Vera Tours and Clipper which have wide connections with
beach resorts scattered on the Zanzibar east, south and north
coasts.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become Zanzibar's top foreign exchange earner,
replacing clove whose prices in the world market have been
unstable in recent years.

<HEADLINE> China to Carry out Four Large Meteorological Experiments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China will carry out four
large-scale meteorological experiments in the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, the South China Sea, Huaihe River and the Taiwan Straits,
according to Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
The experiments, the largest in China's meteorological history,
will start in April and are expected to be completed by 2001, said
Wen Kegang, director of the State Meteorological Administration.
</P>
<P>
Wen said the experiments aim to study the following fields:
</P>
<P>
-- The influence of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau on the global
environment and China's disastrous weather;
</P>
<P>
-- How monsoons in the South China Sea affect the outbreaks of
droughts and floods in China;
</P>
<P>
-- The relationship between the global climate and the rainy
season in April and May in the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
-- The interaction of the ocean, continent and atmosphere and
their influence on the climate in eastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that the four experiments, which have their own
emphasis and intergrate with each other, will help further study
on monsoons and the disastrous weather in China. The result should
be improved the more accurate weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The four experiments will involve not only most provinces,
municipalities, and autonomous regions in China's interior areas
and the South China Sea, but also many countries and regions in
the Asia-Pacific region. More than 20,000 scientists and
technicians including 1,000 Chinese and 500 foreign scientists
will take part in the experiments.
</P>
<P>
State-of-the-art equipment will be used to study the
interaction between the continent and the atmosphere, and that
between the ocean and the atmosphere, the water system and the
ocean currents, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Trying to Transfer Water from Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is planning
to transfer water from neighboring Lesotho to Johannesburg to
meet water shortage of the city, local daily the Star reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Rand Water, a water utility, said last week that its was
investigating the viability of a 2.5 billion Rand (500 million
U.S. Dollars) water pipe to carry water directly from the Lesotho
Highlands Water Scheme to a water purification plant just south
of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The 10 billion Rand (two billion U.S. Dollars) Lesotho
Highlands Water Scheme, which started its first water delivery
last week, transfers water from the Lesotho Highlands into the
Vaal River for use in the thirsty industrial regions of Gauteng
Province, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Walter Coxon, Rand Water's chief development engineer, said if
water was piped directly from the highlands, it would flow
downhill virtually all the way to Johannesburg and would not have
to be pumped back uphill from the Vaal Dam as is presently the
case.
</P>
<P>
A pre-feasibility study had indicated that the utility could
make considerable energy savings if it eliminated the cost of
having to pump water up to Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
A detailed feasibility study was under way to investigate
whether the savings would outweigh the capital cost of building a
pipe, Coxon said.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study, which has been under way for a year,
was expected to report its finding within a month. This would
allow the utility to make a decision on whether to proceed in the
second half of this year.

BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China will reduce timber
production to protect natural resources and improve efficiency,
according to Chen Yaobang, Chinese minister of the Forestry, at
the conclusion of a recent forestry planning conference held in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The decision is in line with China's leaders' priorities on
protecting the environment and preserving natural forests, today's
People's Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to protecting primeval forests and
natural forests in the ecologically vulnerable regions, especially
those growing at the headwaters of big rivers and along both banks
of their upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to foster and protect these regions' water
resources as well as preventing land erosion and sand silt from
posing threats to production, lives, and large water resources
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will take steps to phase out logging in these
regions, where 60 percent of the country's natural forest
resources and varieties of species is concentrated.

<HEADLINE> EU Aid to S. Africa Might Be Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could
continue to get aid from the European Union (EU) after 1999, but
the package might be reduced from the current level of 600
million Rand (122 million U.S. Dollars) a year, the Business Day
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The current EU aid program expires in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether it (the aid) is specific to South
Africa or whether is part of the Lome Convention," the paper
quoted outgoing EU ambassador to South Africa, Erwan Fouere, as
saying at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other African nations, which receive aid from the EU
via the convention, South Africa gets bilateral development
assistance from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Fears have been expressed that the EU's eastward enlargement
could put pressure on its budgetary resources, resulting in less
funds being made available for former aid partners.
</P>
<P>
Fouere said future aid would have to focus on sectors that
would help South Africa stand on its own economically, such as
the promotion of small businesses.

<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun met here today with Leif Johansson, president and chief
executive officer of AB Volvo of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China, a developing country, has vast potential
for cooperation with Volvo, which has advanced technology and
management experience in auto-building.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said China is willing to cooperate with Volvo
in auto-manufacturing and all other fields. He believes that such
a cooperation could be deepened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said it is necessary to establish research ties between
Volvo and the Development Research Center of the State Council of
China. The two sides can jointly discuss cooperation in such
issues as communications and environmental protection. Such
cooperation would not only benefit the development of Volvo in
China, but also help enhance the friendship between Chinese and
Swedish peoples, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said during his visit here he had deeply felt the
sincere will of the two sides to enhance cooperation. The
sincerity would help lay a solid foundation for future
cooperation, he said, adding that Volvo is happy to join hands
with relevant Chinese departments to advance the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Johansson and his party arrived here as guests of the
Development Research Center of the State Council of China.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Suggests Forum for Nile River Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin has underlined the need to set up a forum to devise
mechanisms for the equal share of the waters of River Nile among
all riparian countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local Efoyita magazine, Seyoum said Egypt
has been preoccupied with projects from which it would be the
sole beneficiary impeding the realization of an agreement that
paves the way for a just utilization of the waters by all Nile
Basin countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported that unless viable
conditions are created among the riparian countries to forge an
agreement that guarantees equitable share of the waters, others
could follow suit to Egypt subsequently resulting in disputes
among the concerned countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, Ethiopia is not of the opinion that both
White and Blue Nile are the natural resources of an individual
country and upholds the stand that the waters are the common gift
to all the riparian countries which should be used in a way
benefiting all parties.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, he said, a country affected by recurrent droughts
should make use of its water resources in a bid to achieve food
self sufficiency as it would be rather difficult to bring about
sustainable agricultural development relying on rain-fed farming
alone.
</P>
<P>
The demand in Ethiopia for energy supply which is crucial for
development in the industrial, economic and social sectors has
been steadily growing, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has no intention of jeopardizing the interest of
others while seeking its own advantages, it wishes to cooperate
among countries.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the waters of River Nile is key to any form of
cooperation between Ethiopia and Egypt, he said, adding that an
agreement in principle with regard to the issue would open up the
opportunity to further promoting bilateral ties in other fields
of endeavor.

<HEADLINE> Leading Insurance Group Sets Annual Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China's largest insurance group
has mapped this year's strategy for sustained business growth with
minimal financial risks.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the People's Insurance Company of China (Group) is
expected to introduce more new insurance products, put more focus
on large- and medium-size cities, balance its insurance promotion
and door-to-door sales of insurance policies, and ensure a stable
growth in its premium income, said company chairman Ma Yongwei.
</P>
<P>
The group reported a 35.7 percent increase in its premium
income last year, which is above the market average, and received
78.8 billion yuan (9.5 billion U.S. dollars) in premiums,
according to company statistics.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, life insurance premiums surged more than 80.89
percent to 38.9 billion yuan last year, against 38 billion yuan
from property insurance and 10.5 billion from its re-insurance
business.
</P>
<P>
Although China is considered the world's biggest insurance
market with the most potential, competition is already mounting
with the inflow of foreign capital, Ma said, pointing to the fact
that seven of the 21 insurance companies in China are
foreign-funded.
</P>
<P>
The PICC Group, as the nation's only state-owned insurance
group, maintained its market share at more than 70 percent last
year, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Aside from posting business growth, the group is also expected
to take measures to ensure a professional and efficient management
of its premium funds, while adopting a responsibility system to
revitalize the existing inefficient assets.
</P>
<P>
The group recalled more than 600 million yuan in such assets
last year, and disengaged itself from the securities buiness
operations last year in a move to minimize financial risks.

<P>
ZHANGBEI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The strong earthquake Saturday
that shook the northern part of Hebei Province leveled the house
of Yang Fei, a resident of Zhangjiapo village in Zhangbei County.
</P>
<P>
Yang was working far away from home. His wife and little
daughter immediately were offered helping hands by their
warm-hearted neighbors after the quake. The neighbors helped the
mother and daughter settle down in makeshift shelters which
protected them from the severe cold.
</P>
<P>
To the local residents, it was just an ordinary case of helping
each other survive the horrible consequences of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yuming, a cadre in Hailiutu Township, Zhangbei County,
injured his foot in the quake, but he endured the pain and rode
his motorcycle four kilometers to inform township leaders of the
situation in his village. He then rushed back and took part in the
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Gao Bing, a teacher in Mijiagou village, forced open the door
of the classroom to evacuate his 20 students as soon as he felt
the first shock wave. He was the last to leave the classroom, with
his head injured by two falling bricks.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shoujun in Dahe Township has put up a large shelter soon
after the quake, and invited 18 people from six families to live
in, in addition to his three-member family.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the shelter, Wang told Xinhua: "We feel we are
like one big family."

<HEADLINE> IMF Optimistic About Indonesia's Restructuring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stanley Fischer expressed
optimism here on Monday that the Indonesian government will
succeed in restructuring the country's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
"President Soeharto's explanation was clear that Indonesia will
implement this (restructurization) program. There is no ambiguity
on that," he told the press after paying a courtesy call on the
president.
</P>
<P>
At their 45-minute meeting, Fischer said the discussion between
the Indonesian government and the IMF would go into details when
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus arrives here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed more about how to implement the program (to
restructure the financial sector) set up by the Indonesian
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here on Sunday at the head of an IMF team,
held discussion with some Indonesian government ministers Sunday
afternoon on the country's economic situation. He said last night
that the talks were making progress.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said President Soeharto briefed him about the proposed
state budget for fiscal year 1998-99, which amounted to 135
trillion rupiah (one U.S. dollar equals 4,000 rupiah).
</P>
<P>
Fischer, however, refused to explain the IMF's position on the
state budget.
</P>
<P>
The IMF envoy came to Indonesia after the sudden fall of the
Indonesian rupiah, which declined to a historic low of 11,000 to
the U.S. dollar last Thursday. The rupiah has devalued by more
than 200 percent against the greenback since July last year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, the IMF along with the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank agreed to provide 23 billion
U.S. dollars in financial and technical loans to Indonesia to help
overcome its monetary crisis, and Indonesia made a commitment to
conducting a series of economic reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The China server of the
American magazine, Science, co-sponsored by the State Natural
Science Fund Committee (SNSFC) and other Chinese governmental
organizations, began operation today at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
The server will provide researchers and students in China free
access to the lastest edition of "Science" on both the China
Science and Technology Network and China Education and Research
Network, said Zhang Cunhao, chairman of SNSFC.
</P>
<P>
Users of the China server of "Science" will also receive
additional information available on the magazine's Internet
edition, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the server has built a bridge for the exchange
of scientific information between China and the United States,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Science," a weekly publication, enjoys a high reputation in
international scientific research circles and is especially known
for its articles on biology and medical science. It has a large
group of readers not only in China but also worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that an average of 2,000 people read "Science"
through the China Server each day during its trial
operation. Experts predicted that the number would keep growing
after the server formally began operations today.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the China Server of "Science" signifies "the
importance and the tremendous future of Sino-U.S. scientific
cooperation," said Chang-Lin Tien, the first foreign Academician
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and former president of the
University of California, Berkeley, in the San Francisco Bay Area
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"It will help provide the most-advanced and updated scientific
information for the world's most populous country at the minimum
cost and fastest speed," he said.

BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A number of stone implements and
pottery pieces dating back nearly 5,000 years have recently

A large number of ancient items have already been found on the
campus of the university in the past like 2,200-year-old pottery
pieces, a 1,600-year-old ash pit and 1,200-year-old bricks, as
well as several tombs from different ages, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Upgrades Weather Forecast, Surveillance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has established one
of the world's most advanced weather surveillance and forecast
system, according to a local meteorological official.
</P>
<P>
The modern weather surveillance and forecast centre was
equipped with sophisticated devices at a cost of 80 million yuan
(9.6 million U.S. dollars), including an advanced Weather
Surveillance Radar-88 Doppler (WSR-88D) imported from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lei, director of the Municipal Meteorological
Administration, said the center's completion has greatly improved
the city's ability to forecast dangerous weather.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai boasts a history of more than 120 years of weather
forecasting since an observatory was built in Xujiahui in 1872.
At present, the city is the weather forecast center for east
China's six provinces, providing comprehensive meteorological
services such as numerical weather prediction for 41 cities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Municipal Meteorological Administration has
set many records in China's meteorological services. It has carried
out the longest consecutive meteorological observation; it was the
first to establish a meteorological alarm system; and it was the
first to experiment with artificial rainfall.
</P>
<P>
During the testing of the WSR-88D and the whole system in the
past year, the accuracy of 24-hour weather forecasts has increased
from 80 percent to 90 percent, and the forecast accuracy of
typhoons, rainstorms, high temperature, cold waves, tornados and
other disastrous weather has risen from 71 percent in 1994 to 84
percent last year. Forecast errors were also greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
Last August the city was hit by the strongest typhoon in the
1990s, but the damage to the city was minimized because of an
accurate forecast.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Shanghai would introduce large-scale computers
and other advanced equipment in the future to further improve its
weather forecast accuracy, and would continue such experiments as
artificial fog dispersal.

MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim
announced on Monday that he had teamed up with senator Sergio
Osmena for the 1998 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who would run for the presidency, said he and senator
Osmena from the southern Philippines had joined hands in pursuing
their bids in the May 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
"We would bring back law and order to our country not only to
give our countrymen the safety and security they deserve but to
restore investors' confidence and put us back on the road to
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lim said they would fight corruption and try to revive the
country's economy which was slowing down due to the financial
turmoil sweeping Asia, if they won in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was reported that Lim and former defense secretary
Renato de Villa would team up. However, both of them did not want
the vice presidency, leading to the demise of their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
De Villa has set up his own political party and is preparing
for the coming elections.

<P>
Both the ruling and the opposition parties have filed their

<HEADLINE> Revenue of Northern Ethnic Region Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The revenue income of Inner
Mongolia, an ethnic area in north China, has surpassed 10 billion
yuan for the first time.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics provided by the regional financial
department, the region earned 10.72 billion yuan last year, up 1.4
billion yuan or 15 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Local economists described the revenue increase as "historic
progress" in Inner Mongolia, which only had a revenue of 900,000
yuan when the region was founded in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The progress was credited to a series of measures taken by the
local government in recent years such as government support to the
development of large enterprises or enterprise groups and
increased input in agricultural and animal husbandry production.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the annual revenue of 19 counties exceeded 100
million yuan by the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> More American Travelers Bypass Travel Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Americans nowadays do not
have to rely on agents who make travel arrangement for them as
they have found other ways to save money.
</P>
<P>
For instance, they could check Web sites set up by airlines and
see whether there are cheap last-minute Internet specials on
unsold seats.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about four million air tickets, or one percent of
the total, were transacted via the Internet in the United States,
according to a report from the Air Transport Association.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, some 13.4 million Americans will buy
tickets on-line, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts noted that when travel agents began to charge
customers additional fees, more and more Americans might choose to
buy tickets directly from airlines' toll-free numbers or via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, an estimated half of the
travel agents on the U.S. west coast have begun charging
"processing fees" tacked onto the regular cost of a ticket or
reservation, which range between 5-40 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said that the number of such agents, who have been
suffering from cuts of commissions by airlines, is to grow, which
will lead to the fact that more and more travelers opt to bypass
travel agents.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 300
prisoners, after holding a guard hostage, took over part of a
Colombia prison Sunday, in an attempt to seek better prison
conditions, police said.
</P>
<P>
Joined by more than 500 of their women relatives, these
prisoners at the San Isidro jail in Popayan, 370 kilometers
southwest of the capital, demanded improved conditions and more
visits, as well as an end to overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
The women relatives were at the prison during Sunday visiting
hours.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners and their family members asked the Red Cross and
national ombudsman's office to negotiate, police said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had surrounded the prison. Three women, one of them
pregnant, left the jail after the takeover. No bloodshed was
reported.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's prisons currently hold 43,000 inmates, far more than
the 29,000 it was built to house. Although the Congress passed a
law in December to ease overcrowding by granting early release to
some prisoners, legal red tape has kept most of the releases
stranded.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia in "Gravest Crisis," Singapore Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said Southeast Asia is facing its "gravest" crisis and
biggest test since the end of World War II and called on the
United States, Japan, and Europe to rescue the region's troubled
economies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Straits Times on Monday, Goh said the
worsening currency crisis in Southeast Asia is a "systemic
problem," which he called one of confidence and market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote address to a closed-door ruling People's
Action Party (PAP) convention on Sunday, Goh, who is the party's
secretary-general, stressed that the market has to be calmed.
Confidence in currencies has to be restored through taking painful
and necessary measures prescribed by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and Japan should work together to help restore market
confidence and to rescue the troubled economies. Europe should
also join in," he said.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis would create tension within the region and
between the region and its major partners the United States and
Japan, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"It is in every one's interest to help calm down the situation
and lessen the danger of economic meltdown leading to political
turmoil," Goh emphasized, adding that Asian economies must of
course help themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times noted that Goh's message came just a few days
after he received a phone call last Thursday from U.S. President
Bill Clinton, who reiterated America's support for the programs
the IMF has tailored for the region.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said he is optimistic that Singaporeans
would "more than survive" the current crisis, as the country has
paid close attention to sound fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"In a crisis, a country's leadership and people are tested.
There is no crisis in Singapore. But if the region is in economic
difficulties and gripped by political turmoil, we will be
affected. We can expect tough times ahead," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Negotiate With Myanmar on Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will negotiate with
Myanmar to resume border trade after two months of border closure
halted millions of baht's worth of business transactions.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Commerce Minister Pothipong Lamsam was quoted
Monday by the local press as saying concerned agencies would
travel to Yangon soon to persuade the Myanmar authorities to lift
an order issued in November to close three border passes between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar reasoned that the closure would enable it to streamline
its border trade formalities and set up new orders requiring that
all business transactions be made through banks in order to meet
international standards.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Corps Leads China In Cotton Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Production and
Construction Corps, China's largest state farm, harvested 1,435
kilograms of cotton per hectare in 1997, 50 kilograms more than
the national average to rank first in China.
</P>
<P>
The corps, located in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, is the country's largest enterprise in
agriculture, industry, commerce and trade. Ninety percent of the
corps members are engaged in agricultural production and
management.
</P>
<P>
The corps planted more than 300,000 hectares of cotton in 1997
and harvested 450,000 tons of cotton, accounting for nearly 40
percent of the region's total, according to Hu Zhaozhang, deputy
commander of the corps.
</P>
<P>
The state designated the corps as one of China's cotton
production unit in 1995. The corps, in turn, began developing
cotton as its pillar industry, setting a goal of 500,000 tons of
cotton by the turn of century.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the increased production resulted from the widespread
application of advanced cotton-growing techniques and research
achievements, including new varieties and plastic sheeting used on
98 percent of the cotton acreage.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Pacific Dialogue Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Pacific
Dialogue, an annual gathering of prominent regional economic and
security experts, opened here Monday to discuss the financial
turmoil crisis in Southeast and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, chaired by Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, is set to discuss the currency and stock
market problems facing the countries in Southeast and East Asia
and issues pertaining to cooperation in regional security, culture
and civilization.
</P>
<P>
Officiating the dialogue, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said his country has been able to tackle problems such as
the currency and stock market turmoil fairly well because of its
stability.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian government wants stability not only in
the country but in the region as well.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed we want to see stability throughout the world -- but we
cannot do much about that, not being even a bit player. We have
worked hard for stability in Malaysia and despite the opposition
we have succeeded quite well," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if only some of the countries in the region were
facing problems while others were not then they would not have
equal capacities to work together.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are all facing the problems at the moment and we intend
to use our common misfortunes to enhance our cooperation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 political leaders, policy makers, academicians and
business leaders from countries of the Asia and Pacific rim are
participating in the dialogue, organized jointly by the Malaysian
Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS), the
Washington-based Asia Pacific Policy Center and the Malaysian
Institute for Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who arrived here Sunday
at the start of an 11-day Asia tour which will also take him to
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, China, Japan and South Korea, is
among the participants.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Projects Launched In Hainan's Economic Development Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The 31-sq.km. Yangpu Economic
Development Zone in South China's Hainan province, on the Beibu Gulf,
has launched five large pioneering industrial projects, according to Wang
Yongchun, head of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu was approved as an economic development zone by the
State Council in 1992 and was China's first industrial zone solely
developed by foreign investors, with one of the most favorable
open policies in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first project, a 30-million-US-dollar grain processing
plant, began operation at the end of 1997, using new
technology to process 300,000 tons of rice every year, 70
percent of it for export.
</P>
<P>
The second, a Singapore-funded pulp plant, the largest in China,
involving an investment of 1.28 billion US dollars and having an
annual capacity of 600,000 tons of bleached pulp has begun
construction with the approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
There is also a high-speed wire plant, an oak panel plant, and
a float glass factory. Negotiations are also underway on oil-gas,
steel, and iron plant projects at a combined cost of seven billion
US dollars, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
Four billion HK dollars have been used over the past five years
for infrastructure construction, and the zone now has a
315,500-kilowatt power plant, an expressway to the provincial
capital of Haikou, and a modern post and telecommunications
project under development. The zone has completed the first phase
of construction work on Yangpu port.

<HEADLINE> Minsheng Bank Sees Growing Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The China Minsheng Banking
Corp, China's only non-state bank, registered a satisfactory
development record in its first two year's operation, a leading
bank official was quoted as saying in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Minsheng's assets have topped 20 billion yuan at the end of
1997, up from 1.3 billion yuan at the bank's opening in January
1996.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tax profits for 1997 are expected to surpass 200 million
yuan, said the official, adding that the figure will grow to 300
million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng was launched by private Chinese entrepreneurs' chamber
of commerce, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. So
far, nearly half of its loans went to private firms.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the bank will continue to hold a leading
position in supporting private firms.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank official, the bank plans to launch some
impressive projects this year in providing financial support to
these firms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank will be increasingly cautious in granting
new loans for good assets quality.
</P>
<P>
So far, the overdue loans only accounted for two percent in its
lending.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng is preparing for a capital enlargement, with an
anticipated equity investment from the International Finance Co,
the private sector arm of the World Bank, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said the bank will continue to seek development in the
coastal regions and big cities. The bank has opened branches in
Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Wuhan.

<HEADLINE> No Reason to Devalue Renminbi: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China has no reason to
depreciate its currency, the renminbi yuan, in a market where the
supply of US dollars significantly exceeds demand, an government
official was quoted in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The official from the China Foreign Exchange Trading System
said that by far, sellers of US dollars outnumber buyers. "We
should not devalue the yuan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, turnover in the system totalled 69.7 billion US
dollars. The yuan closed at 8.2796 to the dollar last week.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that since 1994, when China devalued the yuan
to 8.7 against the US dollar and replaced its dual-rate system
with the new regime, the yuan has always been under the pressure
of appreciation, largely due to excessive market supply.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, had to
buy the oversupply to maintain balance in the market. That has
helped push the country's foreign exchange reserve to 140 billion
US dollars at the end of 1997 from 105 billion US dollars at the
beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have repeatedly rebutted speculations that
the country might devalue the yuan to help China's exports remain
competitive while other currencies in the region nosedived to
record lows.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Making Gains in Anti-Poverty Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province helped more than
910,000 local people rise above the poverty line in 1997 despite
continued drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
People still living below the national poverty line in this
inland northwest province has been reduced to 2.84 million, or
14.2 percent of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
With more than 70 percent of the rural population living below
the poverty line two decades ago, Gansu has been a focal point of
the country's poverty relief campaign.
</P>
<P>
Years of effort has paid off. By 1994, the number of people
suffering from insufficient food and clothing dropped to four
million, with most of those living in remote mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
Though the province suffered from three consecutive years of
drought, the fight against poverty remained persistent and
successful, with efforts concentrating on support for farming,
breeding and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The province issued low-interest loans worth 485 million yuan
(58 million U.S. dollars) to poor areas and sent more than
10,000 officials to assist in 6,600 impoverished villages. The
per-capita annual income in the poor areas rose to 570 yuan (68
U.S. dollars).

<P>
JAKARTA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard called Indonesian President Soeharto on Sunday to express
concern over the economic crisis in Indonesia, the official Antara
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Howard called Soeharto on Sunday morning, said the report. But
it did not give details of their talks.
</P>
<P>
This was the second call to Soeharto by a foreign government
leader. On Friday, U.S. President Bill Clinton also spoke to
Soeharto on the phone about the economic situation in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In their 25-minute conversation, Clinton said he believed
Indonesia will overcome its monetary crisis. He urged the
Indonesian government to push forward its economic reform program,
which it has agreed to in exchange for a 23 billion U.S. dollar
bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IMF special envoy Stanley Fisher held talks on
Sunday here with Indonesian government officials on the country's
economic situation. The envoy, who arrived here Sunday morning,
will meet Soeharto on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The telephone conversations between Soeharto and foreign
leaders and the IMF envoy's visit to Indonesia followed a sudden
fall of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, which declined to a
record low of 11,000 per U.S. dollar last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has depreciated by more than 200 percent against the
dollar since July last year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Raise Structural Steel Imports Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will raise the duty on
structural steel imports to 10 percent from the current level of
2-3 percent to curb dumping by foreign producers, according to a
Customs Department official.
</P>
<P>
The current duty of 40 satang per kilogram or 2-3 percent of
import value is not sufficient to protect the country against
dumping, especially by Korean producers.
</P>
<P>
The official was quoted Monday by the local press as saying
local manufacturers would not exploit the situation by raising
steel prices if the higher duties are imposed. For one thing,
steel demand is still far below supply due to the economic slump.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 10-percent duty is in line with the customs tariff
structure which taxes semi-finished products at between 10 and 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Local manufacturers, citing high water and electricity costs
among other factors, have complained frequently about dumping and
lack of protection from the government.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Increases In Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Some Korean and Japanese
investors seem unaffected by the financial turmoil back home and
are doing well in the Chinese port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin was one of the first cities to open up in China and has
had one of the country's fastest growing economy, with
double-digit GDP growth for five successive years.
</P>
<P>
Because of its potential, 11,400 overseas-backed companies have
been set up here, with 20 billion U.S. dollars worth of
investment, and 200 of the world's top 500 multinationals have
invested in 300 companies in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are reportedly satisfied with Tianjin's
investment environment, according to municipal government
officials, who have regular talks with them. The result has been
an additional 300 million U.S. dollars in investment from 70
companies last year. The US's Motorola has expanded its investment
in Tianjin from 120 million dollars to 1.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The overseas capital has helped meet the economic development
needs of the city, which uses 2.4 billion dollars of foreign
capital annually from more than 90 countries. In recent years,
overseas funds provided a third of Tianjin's total investment in
fixed assets. Last year, overseas-financed companies had 40
percent of the city's industrial output value and accounted for
more than 60 percent its five billion dollars worth of
exports.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Leveling Shops To Build Gardens In Downtown Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A green project to pull down a
number of shops and stores on Nanjing Road, downtown Shanghai's
commercial center, has started this year.
</P>
<P>
The leveling of the shops and stores that are currently
generating 10,000 yuan (1,200 US dollars) of profit per square
meter annually is to provide rooms for gardens, trees and flowers.
</P>
<P>
One shop with annual sales of nearly 700 million yuan will be
moved to make way for a 20-hectare garden. Its owner, Han
Binsheng, said, "Although moving off the road is a big loss for
us, it's a good thing for the whole city."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the construction of ten 3,000-sq.m. green areas
in the downtown area, there will also be a 100 meter-wide and
97-km-long green belt along the city's outer ring road.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Shanghai municipal government issued regulations
governing afforestration and green-up management which stipulate
that there should be no less than 30 percent green coverage in any
new residential quarters.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, the green area coverage per capita

<TEXT>
<P>
On the so-called cultural oppression and population elimination
in Tibet, Joseph Yu Kuo said that since Liberation in 1951, the
Tibetan culture has not only survived, but also
flourished. China's central government has worked hard to
diligently preserve and develop the folk art and religion of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Numerous and excellent new works of literature and drama,
paintings, sculpture, television and movie works from Tibet are
spreading to the rest of China and abroad every year. New artists
and writers have an environment that is very conducive towards
creativity and artistic inspiration, as well as a government that
warmly supports their efforts, Yu Kuo said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Kuo's article continues that the Tibetan population has
increased since Liberation. Between 1982 and 1990, the ethnic
Tibetan population increased by 309,800. From 1990 to the present
the ethnic Tibetan population has grown by no less than 38,000 per
year. Altogether yearly Tibetan population growth rates have
increased well in advance of that for the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Liberation, the average life expectancy of an ethnic
Tibetan was a mere 36. Today the average life expectancy of an
ethnic Tibetan is an astounding 65 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Comparing Tibetans' living conditions between pre-Liberation
and post-Liberation periods, Joseph Yu Kuo said that the standard
of living for the Tibetans has grown enormously since the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has established welfare centers and
retirement homes for the elderly, unemployment insurance and
poverty assistance have both spread throughout Tibet since 1980.
</P>
<P>
He said that now Tibet is marching with the rest of China to a
new and brighter future, shining with hope for all citizens of
China as the motherland grows economically stronger and takes its
rightful place among the leading nations of the world.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Lowers GNP Target for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
further scaled down the gross national product (GNP) growth target
for 1998 to 3 to 4 percent from 4 to 4.5 percent because of the
deepening currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Development Budget Coordinating Committee is also expecting
a higher inflation rate of 7.5 to 8.5 percent from an earlier
target of 6.5 to 7.5 percent, the local newspaper Manila Standard
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a preliminary report from the inter-agency committee,
the newspaper said the full impact of the currency crisis on
consumer prices and the economy in general would be felt this
year.
</P>
<P>
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said earlier
that the expected slowdown in domestic output would be caused by
the high interest rates which discourage investments and the El
Nino phenomenon which would reduce agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
The government economic managers had already substantially
reduced the original GNP target of 6.5 to 7.5 percent for 1998 in
late December 1997 and the initial inflation target of 6 to 7
percent last August.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicted the country's
inflation to hit double-digit levels this year, fueled by the peso
depreciation and spending related to the May presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
But the ADB estimate of about 4 to 4.5 percent GNP growth for
the country this year is closer to the government's targets.
</P>
<P>
GNP sums up all goods and services produced by a country,
including income from abroad. Inflation, on the other hand, shows
how fast consumer prices have risen.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Stuns Brazil to Win Indoors Soccer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANERIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay rallied back
to demolish host Brazil 4-2 to win the third South America indoors
soccer tournament in Natal, northwest Brazil, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The showdown was their second encounter in the tournament after
Paraguay was humiliated by Brazil 7-3 in the first round on
January 6.
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayans renewed their forms in the final and
established their edges against Brazil with an early goal in the
7th minute.
</P>
<P>
Two goals from the host came in a row in the first 20 minutes,
enabling Brazil to overturn the scoreboard 2-1 till the break.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Brazilians resorted to their defensive tactics in the
second half while the Paraguayans kept on unleasing their bullets,
converted an equaliser in the 11th minute, and capitalized in a
Brazilian defensive fault in the 25th minute to overtake for the
second time for 3-2.
</P>
<P>
The momentum of the guests forced Brazil to switch back to its
original attacking style but the latter only found no target as
Paraguay's goalie made his superb saves.
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute before the final whistle, the Paraguayans
took another advantage of Brazil's loose defense and netted again
to seal the match 4-2.
</P>
<P>
This marked the first time for Paraguay to win the four-nation
tournament, started on January 4, which featured other two nations
of Uruguay and Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Review Anti-Dumping Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
review its anti-dumping laws as other Asian countries hit by the
currency crisis are expected to dump cheap products into the
country, local press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautisa was quoted as saying
the review would be aimed at shortening the time for processing
anti-dumping cases from the present 150 days to 60 days to the
benefit of local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have simpler anti-dumping procedure which
will benefit our local businessmen in a much shorter time. Because
of delays and tedious proceedings, businessmen are saying that by
the time the government is able to resolve the issue, the damage
has already been done," Bautisa said.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries such as South Korea and Thailand, two of the
most battered economies in the region, are expected to
aggressively export their products below their normal cost just to
liquefy their assets and pay their obligations.
</P>
<P>
The shorter anti-dumping procedure would not run counter to the
Philippines' commitment to the World Trade Organization, according
to Bautisa.
</P>
<P>
Bautisa admitted that in fact, local industrialists have
already complained to the government that the Philippines has
become a junkyard for cheap Asian goods.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Philippine Industries earlier asked the Trade
and Industry Department for tougher anti-dumping laws to
discourage countries experiencing currency problems from flooding
the domestic market with cheap goods.
</P>
<P>
The federation complained that South Korea and other countries
with currencies that were depreciating faster than the Philippine
peso were dumping cheap goods into the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Appliances and other goods from South Korea are reported being
sold here at dirt-cheap prices, with some retailers offering a
free television set for every two bought.
</P>
<P>
Dumping occurs when imported items are priced lower than in the
countries where these goods come from and when the difference in
prices is harming local industries.

<HEADLINE> China's Sovereignty over Tibet Brooks No Dispute(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, January 12 (Xinhua) -- An American student named
Joseph Yu Kuo at Yale University recently sent a letter to China's
English weekly Beijing Review, to discuss China's sovereignty over
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The letter is to be carried on the January 12-18 issue of the
weekly.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yu Kuo who is double-majoring in East Asian studies and
history said, "I did a great deal of research and have written an
article refuting the current incorrect beliefs and accusations of
the so-called 'human rights activists' for Tibet and their cohorts
in the U.S. government while affirming China's sovereignty and
record of governance in Tibet."
</P>
<P>
On China's sovereignty over Tibet, Joseph Yu Kuo said that this
is abundantly confirmed through historical facts.
</P>
<P>
He said that as early as in the 7th century the King of Tibet,
then Sontsen Gampo, assumed the role of a vassal ruler to the Tang
Dynasty of China through his acceptance of such Imperial Chinese
titles as "Commandant-escort" to Emperor Gaozong and his payment
of tribute to the central government of China.
</P>
<P>
By the early 9th century, the Tibetan and Chinese governments
had forged a formal political alliance, in which the two parties
pledged "amity as though they were of one family", said the
article.
</P>
<P>
Both the Ming and Qing Dynasties further affirmed Chinese
sovereignty over Tibet from the mid-14th Century until the
beginning of the 20th century, he continued.
</P>
<P>
The Ming Dynasty recognized the status of the Dalai Lamas by
conferring upon them various supplemental titles after receiving
their tributary payments.
</P>
<P>
The Qing government of China appointed an Imperial Resident
Commissioner in 1727, whose function was to supervise Tibetan
administrative affairs. China's sovereignty over Tibet was further
bolstered through the subsequent establishment of military
garrisons in the region during Emperor Yongzheng's reign, Ku Kuo
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China's sovereignty over Tibet is thoroughly
based on historical facts and cannot be legitimately denied.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Pays Back 38 Billion Dollars of Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil paid back a total of 38
billion U.S. dollars of foreign debts last year, 4.6 billion more
than the previous year, the Central Bank announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They included 23 billion dollars of due capital and 15 billion
dollars of interest.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the country has to pay an estimated 30.6 billion
dollars of foreign debts this year, including 13.6 billion dollars
servicing.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, whose foreign debt totals 177.1 billion dollars, is the
number one debtor nation among the developing countries. The heavy
burden has been one of the major obstacles to its economic
development.

ROME, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Hilde Gerg of Germany captured her
second season victory by finishing first in a World Cup slalom in
Bormio, Italy on Sunday.

</P>

of one minute, 35.01 seconds to give German women's team 11th win
in 19 races.
</P>
<P>
Second to Koznick in the first run, 0.14 behind, Gerg clocked
the fastest second run in 47.94 seconds to vault to first.
</P>
<P>
Koznick, 22, from Minnesota, was 0.41 seconds slower than Gerg
in the second run and blamed her lack of speed in the bottomart of
the course for her defeat.
</P>
<P>
The last U.S. slalom victory in World Cup, by Julie Parisien,
dates back to November 1992.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pak Prime Minister Condemns Mominpura killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
has strongly condemned the killing of innocent people near
Pakistan's second largest city of Lahore Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said in a statement Sunday evening that the
incident in which more than 20 Shiite Muslims were killed and
dozens of others injured is "highly inhuman and un-Islamic act."
</P>
<P>
According to reports by the Associated Press of Pakistan, at
least 24 Shiite Muslims including women and children were killed
and more than 30 others injured by unidentified gunmen Sunday
morning at the Mominpura graveyard near Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said, "The possibility of involvement of a foreign hand
cannot be ruled out." "No Muslim can even think of shedding the
blood of a Muslim brother."
</P>
<P>
"The government is providing all required resources to the
anti-terrorist organizations to lay an effective hand on the
terrorists," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The anti-terrorist departments have achieved some
success in curtailing the terrorist activities. However, they have
to do more to completely eliminate terrorism through more coherent
and compact efforts."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he had instructed the concerned
departments to apprehend the culprits of "all such incidents and
give them exemplary punishment."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Opposition Leader, Benazir Bhutto, has expressed
her deep grief over the Mominpura incident and called it an act of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Benazir said the killing happened in
Mominpura is one of the worst incidents of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to her countrymen to exercise restraint, display
tolerance and try to promote the feelings of brotherhood.

<HEADLINE> NZ Economy Forecast to Perform Better in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The London-based influential
 Economic Intelligence Unit has predicted that New Zealand's
economy will grow 2.9 percent in 1998, higher than the 2.7
percent global average.
</P>
<P>
The unit was quoted today by the local newspaper The Dominion
as saying the weakening NZ dollar and tax cuts scheduled for July
will be bonuses for the economy while New Zealand should also
benefit from a more buoyant Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that the growth will pick up to 2.9 percent from
1.9 percent in 1997 while inflation should remain low at 2
percent. The growth level will be even higher than the 2.4 percent
growth predicted by the unit for the Asia-Australia-New Zealand
region.
</P>
<P>
However, the unit warned that New Zealand's continuing high
foreign debt level poses the greatest threat to continued growth.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the current account deficit is expected to rise
to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product, the highest level in the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
"A small merchandise trade surplus will be overwhelmed by a
massive invisibles deficit of nearly 5 billion U.S. dollars,
almost entirely owing to the cost of servicing New Zealand's
forecast 61 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign debt," the unit
noted.
</P>
<P>
"So far, financial markets have turned a blind eye to this
imbalance, but they may be unable to ignore it for much longer,"
it said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Speedskating Banned for Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Svetlana Fedotkina of Russia has
been banned for life for two doping offenses, a top official of
the International Skating Union said in Berlin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gerd Zimmermann of Germany said an appeal by the Russian
federation had been rejected, and Fedotkina, the Olympic silver
medalist in the 1,500 meters, was thus doomed for a life-long
suspension.
</P>
<P>
Early, Fedotkina had been banned for two years for testing
positive for anabolic steroids which expired on January 6.
</P>
<P>
While the ban was still in force, Fedotkina refused in November
to undergo a drug test during training in Calgary, saying she was
there on a private visit.
</P>
<P>
ISU officials said this amounted to a second drug offense,
mandating a life-time ban.

HAIKOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Haikou, capital of China's
island province of Hainan, has started a green project to make it
a "National Garden City" within this year.
</P>

Haikou's green coverage is now 39 percent, or 8.4 sq.m. per
capita, and 96.5 percent along major city streets and roads,
according to a local park and forest bureau official.
</P>
