<HEADLINE> Vance Calls For Ties with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cyrus R. Vance, who as secretary of state two  
decades ago helped guide the United States toward severing 
relations with Iran, on Wednesday called for the two countries to 
restore diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington and Tehran should take advantage of the presidency of  
moderate Mohammad Khatami, who has announced his intention to 
improve relations with the United States, Vance told an audience at 
the Asia Society in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that his proposal required ``political will with  
a leap of faith,'' but said restoring relations -- even at less than 
the ambassadorial level -- was sensible, simple and in the interests 
of both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Once both nations do so, ``other legitimate grievances,  
including our concerns about terrorism, the peace process and 
weapons of mass destruction, can then begin to be addressed,'' 
Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at an Asia Society event last June that Secretary of  
State Madeleine Albright first held out the possibility of 
improving relations with Iran, which were severed in 1979 after 
Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took scores 
of Americans hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	As secretary of state, Vance participated in the decision to cut  
ties -- something he recalled Wednesday as a ``painful and difficult 
step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also recalled that months later, he decided to resign in  
protest after the botched attempt by President Carter to rescue the 
52 American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the years that followed, I have watched from the sidelines  
with frustration and sadness as relations between our two countries 
plunged into increasing hostility, mistrust, name-calling and 
mutual recrimination,'' Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vance's comments came amid reports that Britain and Iran were  
close to restoring their own diplomatic relations, which improved 
last September after Khatami distanced the government from the 
``fatwah,'' or religious edict, calling for the death of 
British-born author Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
	The English-language Iran News in Tehran on Wednesday quoted an  
unnamed diplomatic source as saying that Tehran and London were 
likely to name their current charges d'affaires as ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his other duties, which have recently included acting as a  
U.N. special envoy, Vance is currently an honorary chairman of the 
American-Iranian Council.

<HEADLINE> Internet Shares Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It took non-Internet news to send cyber stocks  
in an unusual direction -- down -- and it took less than two hours of 
selling for investors to decide that the sudden discounts on 
popular ``e-shares'' were too good to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever detached from the normal parameters of stock valuation,  
Internet shares dove early Wednesday despite news of another robust 
profit report from Yahoo! and then quickly rebounded without any 
improvement in the Brazilian financial turmoil that triggered the 
opening slide to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	The early losses were staggering and showed just how vulnerable  
Internet stocks are to any sudden mood change among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online was sent tumbling as much as $23.62 1/2 a share to  
$130 and Yahoo! plummeted as much as $70 to $332 to lead a broad 
market retreat that initially sliced more than 260 points off the 
Dow Jones industrial average and nearly 115 points off the 
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit-taking quickly dried up, and by late morning, AOL had  
recovered to about $150 and Yahoo! had bounced back to about $400. 
The shares pulled back in the afternoon, but finished well off the 
day's lows: AOL closed $7.87 1/2 lower at $145.75 and Yahoo! fell $34 
to $368, while the Dow closed 125.12 points lower and the Nasdaq 
lost 3.94 points. 
</P>
<P>
	But even at the morning's low point, Wednesday's losses were  
rather marginal compared with the huge gains racked up by 
Internet-related shares in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Having more than tripled in price since early October, the  
market value of AOL and Yahoo! is more a reflection of a presumably 
rosy future on the World Wide Web than the either company's 
revenues and profits during the final months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the early selling came despite late Tuesday's  
impressive fourth-quarter report from Yahoo!, which showed that the 
Internet site operator's sales had nearly tripled to $76.4 million 
compared with the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's much analysis going on in the buying of  
these stocks,'' said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for 
Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif., asserting that the 
quick rebound will only add to the aura of invincibility 
surrounding Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's recovery from such a giant down on the opening is just  
further conditioning and reinforcement that investors will be well 
served to buy on dips and shrug off the market difficulties as they 
may occur,'' said Moore, warning that the rally remains as 
vulnerable as ever. ``It helps the mania continue to build, but 
will result ultimately in investors buying dips that don't come 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Jags' Coach Gets 4-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Tom Coughlin has proven himself a  
solid franchise builder and coach in four years with the 
Jacksonville Jaguars. Team owner Wayne Weaver recognized that 
Wednesday by awarding Coughlin a four-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the year remaining on Coughlin's original contract,  
it means he will be with the Jaguars as their coach -- given total 
control of personnel decisions -- through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars did not release the terms, but sources familiar with  
the deal told The Associated Press it was worth about $2.4 million 
per year. That would put Coughlin in the same range as Mike 
Shanahan of Denver and George Seifert of Carolina, but would fall 
short of Mike Holmgren's new $4 million-per-year contract with the 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Coughlin has done an outstanding job of building the  
Jaguars into a strong contender in the NFL,'' Weaver said. ``The 
Jaguars have been very fortunate to have a leader of his skill and 
character. Tom and I are excited about the opportunity to continue 
to work together toward the ultimate goal, a Super Bowl 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars came up three victories short this year, exiting the  
playoffs with a second-round loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they became the first expansion team to make the playoffs  
in three of their first four seasons. They're also one of only six 
teams to make the playoffs the last three seasons. Coughlin's 
record in four seasons is 38-32. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a marked difference from Jacksonville's expansion  
brethren, the Carolina Panthers. They won the NFC West in their 
second season, but followed with 7- and 4-win seasons, which 
resulted in the firing of Dom Capers and the hiring of Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am grateful to Wayne for his continued commitment,''  
Coughlin said. ``Following our first season on paper and four on 
the field, we are entering a new cycle with our football team. This 
is a time for vision; to evaluate, re-tool and refocus ourselves to 
where we are and where we are headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin has one -- maybe two -- big tasks to undertake in the  
offseason. First will be to rebuild a defense that has been ranked 
23rd and 25th in the NFL in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars have no fewer than seven free agents on defense and  
Coughlin is expected to let the majority of them leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some more players, let's face it,'' he said Monday,  
discussing the defensive effort in the 34-24 loss to the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	He may also need to rebuild his coaching staff. Offensive  
coordinator Chris Palmer has already interviewed for the vacancy 
with the Baltimore Ravens and is expected to talk to the Cleveland 
Browns soon. Defensive coordinator Dick Jauron is a candidate for 
the opening in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Palmer leave, former Chargers coordinator Mike Sheppard --  
a finalist when Palmer got the job -- could be considered. Fired 
Bears coach Dave Wannstedt is considered a possible replacement for 
Jauron.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Raping Woman in Coma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCE, Mass. (AP) -- A woman in a years-long coma who gave  
birth to a baby last fall was raped by a registered nurse's aide 
who worked at her nursing home since 1995, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel Moret, 37, of Lawrence was arrested Tuesday on suspicion  
of raping the 24-year-old patient at Town Manor Nursing and 
Rehabilitation Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing home workers only discovered the rape in October when  
they realized the woman was pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl 
on Oct. 23 -- 14 weeks premature. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Moret was implicated by DNA tests. He was fired  
Tuesday and was arraigned today on charges of rape and abuse of a 
patient in a long-term care facility. He pleaded innocent and bail 
was set at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Town Manor is one of 35 nursing homes in Massachusetts managed  
by Sunrise, a nationwide company based in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are shocked and dismayed that an employee has been  
implicated,'' the company said in a statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, formerly of Londonderry, N.H., has been in a  
drug-induced coma since 1995. Authorities have not released her 
name and she was moved to another, undisclosed facility in 
Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her baby, a girl born 14 weeks premature, apparently suffered  
brain damage and was in critical condition Tuesday at New England 
Medical Center's Floating Hospital for Children in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's parents are seeking legal guardianship of their  
daughter and custody of her baby. A hearing is scheduled for 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who authorities have not identified because she is a  
rape victim, is being treated at another, undisclosed facility in 
Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	Moret has a clean record and has never had a patient file a  
complaint against him, state Department of Public Health spokesman 
Mark Leccese said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has given Town Manor the highest possible score  
after unannounced inspections over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Flaherty, Town Manor's administrator, said the nursing  
home plans to contact other patients' families to discuss their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rochester, N.Y., a 29-year-old woman in a comalike state was  
raped in 1995 by a nurse's aide and gave birth to a boy. The aide 
was convicted of rape and is still in prison.

<HEADLINE> High-School Team Back After Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- A basketball team that was benched for  
poor grades earned a rousing ovation and a visit from the governor 
when it returned to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Richmond High School Oilers played their first game Tuesday  
night after their coach imposed a week-long exile to improve their 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis was there, along with local officials, a number  
of police officers, national and local media and about 300 
enthusiastic fans. The Oilers responded with a 61-51 victory over 
St. Elizabeth's of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	All eyes were on the unbeaten team, as well as on coach Ken  
Carter, who benched his squad last week when it didn't live up to 
its promised academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a hero,'' Davis said of Carter. ``Obviously, not  
every kid is going to the NBA. How they do in school will determine 
how they do in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers were banned from all basketball-related activities,  
including practices and rallies. They missed a non-league game and 
last Saturday's alumni game, a popular annual event between current 
and former players. 
</P>
<P>
	The message was received. On Monday, Carter and athletic  
director Roy Rogers determined that the players were headed in the 
right direction academically. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted to get our kids back on track,'' Carter said.  
``We knew they could play basketball. We wanted to turn some of the 
bad habits they had learned into good habits. And I think we did 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't as if the Richmond players were failing. They all had  
the 2.0 grade-point average required by the district to play. But 
they signed contracts with the coach back in September to maintain 
a 2.3 GPA, and they were falling short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't punish anyone,'' Carter explained. ``I disciplined  
them. There's a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Richmond High School gymnasium, banners from past  
championship teams hang along one wall. The cheerleaders work at 
the concession stand in between performances to hip-hop hits. And 
the parents are the loudest team supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	As players entered their locker room before the game Tuesday  
night, they curiously eyed the big turnout and all the television 
cameras pointed in their direction. Many said they were pleasantly 
surprised at all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to be back on the court,'' said 6-foot-8 senior  
starter Courtney Anderson. ``And it felt good that everyone was 
supporting what our coach did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the team's 14th straight victory, the players got a  
private audience with Davis. He challenged them, promising another 
visit and a ``Richmond High School Day'' state proclamation if the 
Oilers reached a 2.8 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe they can do it,'' said Davis, wearing a black and  
white Oilers T-shirt the players gave him. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most supportive of coach Carter's lockout were the  
parents, who were excited to see their kids hitting the books with 
such zeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see some kids on the honors rolls now because  
they're motivated,'' said Pamela Walker, mother of junior guard 
Chris Dixon. ``They really are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was just one vocal naysayer, a teen-age fan who wouldn't  
give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask me, that's kind of messed up -- that you can't play  
because of your grades,'' he scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers didn't seem rusty from their week-long hiatus: They  
controlled the Mustangs throughout most of Tuesday's game. At the 
half, Richmond was up 28-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Oliver, a 6-foot-7 senior who thrilled the crowd with his  
slam dunks, shrugged later when asked what he did all week instead 
of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	He said simply, ``I was in the library. Working hard.''

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Public With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A majority of Americans want the Senate  
impeachment trial of President Clinton to be quick and fair, 
several polls released this week suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion remains solidly in Clinton's corner, and six in  
10 Americans say a full trial with witnesses is unnecessary. Both 
sides have agreed to defer a decision on witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of Americans in a CBS News poll released Wednesday  
want the president to proceed with plans to give the State of the 
Union speech Jan. 19 but don't think it's necessary for him to 
mention the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	And about two-thirds of Americans in several polls approve of  
the job Clinton is doing. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's public appeal runs deeper than the robust  
economy and is unlikely to waver immediately even if the economy 
sours, said Thomas E. Mann, a Brookings Institution scholar on 
Congress and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a style of governance, of seeming to connect with the  
concerns of ordinary people in this country, that is also a source 
of the presidential strength, together with his very effective 
counterpunching in dealing with the majority Republicans in 
Congress,'' Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken over the weekend found the  
impeachment trial far down the list of issues the public wants the 
president and Congress to make a top priority in 1999. Education, 
health care and Social Security were the top three; the impeachment 
trial was No. 10, with 16 percent saying the trial should be a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been hurt politically by their role in the  
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll done by Gallup showed more than half disapproved of  
Senate Republicans' handling of the impeachment proceedings, while 
just over a third approved. Those results were reversed for Senate 
Democrats, with more than half approving. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two-thirds of Americans in polls by Gallup and ABC News  
said they want senators to vote against removing the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the old movies, you used to have to point a gun at  
someone's head to get them to dig their own grave,'' said 
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ``The Republicans are doing it 
willingly and with gusto.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early efforts by the full Senate to hold the trial in a  
bipartisan fashion have paid off. Forty-six percent approved of the 
Senate's handling of the impeachment trial and 41 percent 
disapproved in the CBS poll taken Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of Americans disapproved in September of the sharply  
divided way the matter was handled by the House Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS poll of 1,182 adults was taken Sunday and Monday, and  
the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 1,1014 adults was taken Friday 
through Sunday. Both had margins of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. The ABC poll of 923 adults taken Saturday 
through Monday had an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Customers Stock Up On 1-Cent Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People all over the country are emptying their  
piggy banks, turning out their pockets and fishing under the couch 
to buy the latest ``must have'': the 1-cent stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	With the price of postage to send a basic first-class letter a  
penny more than it was last week, customers nationwide are 
scrambling to stock up on the 1-cent stamps, in some cases cleaning 
out local post offices of their supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to hoard them,'' said George Kujan, manager for  
customer service at the Grand Shelby Post Office in Detroit. ``It's 
a very good possibility they think (the stamps) won't be there next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the 1-cent stamps will be around next week and  
thereafter. They are a permanent fixture at the post office. 
</P>
<P>
	But as customers make the transition from the 32-cent stamp to  
the 33-cent postal rate, which was effective Sunday, the penny 
stamp has become all the rage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lines are out the door,'' Danny Cashen, station manager at  
the Oak Lawn Post Office in Dallas, said Tuesday. ``It's very, very 
strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashen said his office sold 40,000 of the 1-cent stamps on  
Saturday. On Monday, he picked up another 40,000 from his local 
distribution center. By Monday afternoon, he needed to replenish 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't realize how quickly they would go out,'' Cashen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashen is surprised at how long people are willing to wait just  
to pick up some 1-cent stamps. One customer even came in and bought 
10,000 of the penny stamps, probably anticipating a shortage, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And many buying on behalf of their businesses have picked up  
sheets and sheets of the stamps. Demand is so high that the U.S. 
Postal Service has witnessed spot shortages in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want people to buy as many 1-cent stamps as they need,''  
said Roy Betts, Postal Service spokesman. But there's ``no need to 
stockpile 1-cent stamps. They'll always be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service is resupplying 1-cent stamps to those offices  
that are running low, Betts said. With 2.5 billion 1-cent stamps 
printed just for the rate increase, there are plenty to go around, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a question of supply,'' Betts said. ``There's ample  
supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase, the first in four years, may have caught some  
people off guard, even though the first 33-cent stamps went on sale 
last week. It's the Chinese New Year stamp commemorating the year 
of the hare. In addition, millions of undenominated ``H'' rate 
stamps are available at post offices to cover the 33-cent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Kujan predicted that after customers have overstocked with their  
penny purchases, they will realize they don't have quite that many 
32-cent stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, they'll use them all,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Legal Briefs -4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``As the Senate considers these Articles of Impeachment and  
listens to the arguments, individual senators are standing in the 
place of the framers of the Constitution, who prayed that the power 
of impeachment and removal of a president would be invoked only in 
the gravest of circumstances, when the stability of our system of 
government hung in the balance -- to protect the republic itself 
from efforts to subvert our constitutional system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has an obligation to turn away an unwise and  
unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of impeachment. If the 
Senate removes this president for a wrongful relationship he hoped 
to keep private, for what will the House ask the Senate to remove 
the next president, and the next? Our framers wisely gave us a 
constitutional system of checks and balances, with three co-equal 
branches. Removing this president on these facts would 
substantially alter the delicate constitutional balance, and move 
us closer to a quasiparliamentary system, in which the president is 
elected to office by the choice of the people, but continues in 
office only at the pleasure of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``In weighing the evidence and assessing the facts, we ask that  
senators consider not only the intent of the framers but also the 
will and interests of the people. It is the citizens of these 
United States who will be affected by and stand in judgment of this 
process. It is not simply the president -- but the vote the American 
people rendered in schools, church halls and other civic centers 
all across the land 26 months ago -- that is hanging in the 
balance.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Proposes Plan for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed a new $2  
billion, five-year package of health coverage, tax credits and 
rehabilitation services to help tens of thousands of disabled 
Americans return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should never have to choose between the dignity of  
work and the health care they need,'' Clinton said. ``With this 
initiative, they'll have a ticket to work, not an impossible 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates say that health coverage -- the largest piece of the  
package -- is the No. 1 barrier that prevents people with 
disabilities from returning to the workplace. Often they find jobs 
that do not offer health insurance coverage, and often their 
disabilities make it extraordinarily expensive to buy coverage on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton held a White House ceremony today to endorse legislation  
on health benefits being introduced next week by Sens. James 
Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``A major obstacle will be removed from the fulfillment of every  
disabled person's dream to work, live independently and be a 
contributing member of society,'' Kennedy said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will also offer tax credits to help disabled  
workers pay for transportation, equipment and other expenses and 
more money to develop new information and communications 
technologies to help people with disabilities function in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	And he will back a plan that would let people with disabilities  
choose their rehabilitation centers, creating competition for the 
first time for the organizations that train people to take jobs. 
Centers that successfully place people in jobs would get bonus 
payments, thus reaping some of the savings the government will 
realize from reduced disability payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, less than one-half of 1 percent of the  
10 million Americans receiving disability benefits ever return to 
work, including people in the Social Security system for workers 
and the Supplemental Security Income program for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Their advocates argue that's because the system punishes them  
when they go to work -- forcing them to choose between health 
benefits and a job. 
</P>
<P>
	The health insurance plan would cost $1.2 billion over five  
years, and is expected to be considered by the Senate Finance 
Committee, where it has two powerful advocates: Chairman William 
Roth, R-Del., and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the 
panel's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would encourage states to offer Medicaid to people  
who return to work, allowing them to buy into the program even if 
their incomes are too high under current limits. States could also 
let people buy into Medicaid even if their conditions have improved 
but they remain impaired and need health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would also allow people with disabilities to continue  
receiving Medicare benefits, which are not as generous as state 
benefits but would be available to people across the nation, 
regardless of a state's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will also endorse two other initiatives:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $750 million, five-year plan to give $1,000 tax credits to  
people with disabilities who go back to work. This would help 
defray the cost of transportation, technology and other expenses 
necessary to take a job. 
</P>
<P>
	--Doubling money spent on developing assisted technology to help  
people with disabilities function. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation being offered by Jeffords, chairman of the  
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and Kennedy, the 
panel's top Democrat, would also create a demonstration project to 
test the effect of phasing out benefits as people earn more. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, disability beneficiaries lose their entire  
grants if they earn more than $500 a month, prompting some to turn 
down raises or limit their hours.

<HEADLINE> Study: Gov't Pays More Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Taxpayers foot the bill for much more of the nation's health  
insurance than is commonly thought, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau has reported that 61.2 percent of the U.S.  
population has job-related insurance, and 25.9 percent is insured 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many of the people counted as covered by private  
insurance actually got much of their insurance from the government, 
Olveen Carrasquillo of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New 
York City reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he said the Census Bureau lists most federal,  
state and local government workers as privately insured, even 
though taxpayers ultimately pay for that insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, people who get both private and federal insurance  
are listed by the government in both groups or only as privately 
insured. And some people are listed as having insurance provided by 
their company, even though the workers pay all the premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	By Carrasquillo's count, private employers' insurance covered  
43.1 percent of the population in 1996, while 34.2 percent had 
publicly funded insurance. A total of 7.1 percent of Americans 
bought their own insurance, and 15.6 percent were uninsured, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Won't Change Dollar Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insisted today  
that there has been no change in the administration's policy of 
supporting a strong dollar, despite the fact that the U.S. currency 
fell this week to a 28-month low against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar reached the low against the yen on Monday, extending  
a slump that has seen the American currency lose one-third of its 
value against the yen since hitting a high this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar was staging a strong rally today, boosted by  
reports that the Bank of Japan was intervening to sell yen and buy 
dollars to halt the dollar's slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin would not comment directly on reports that Japan was  
intervening to support the dollar, but he did say: ``I'll just 
repeat what I've said so often, which is a strong dollar has served 
us well and our dollar policy is absolutely unchanged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin spoke to reporters outside Blair House, the government's  
official guest residence, after a meeting with Argentine President 
Carlos Menem. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers have been pushing the administration to  
let the dollar fall in value, arguing that it will require a weaker 
U.S. currency to deal with a U.S. trade deficit that is expected to 
hit an all-time high of $167 billion for 1998 and climb even higher 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The weaker currency makes American products cheaper and more  
competitive on overseas markets while making imported goods more 
expensive for American consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But a strong dollar has helped to keep inflation at bay in the  
United States and low inflation has given the Federal Reserve the 
maneuvering room to cut interest rates, cuts that helped to spur a 
rebound in the stock market last fall and provide momentum for the 
U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> NBA Greats on Michael Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The greatest said he was the greatest ever.  
</P>
<P>
	With a few exceptions, many of the NBA's 50 greatest players  
agreed that Michael Jordan was the best of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of their comments: 	
</P>
<P>
                            *PAUL ARIZIN 	
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can pick a single greatest. Jordan is more a  
forward than a guard. But how do you compare him to a center? 
They've got different jobs. It's apples and oranges. It's comparing 
golfers to tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly a great player. Is he the greatest in his 	
category? I wouldn't say that. A guy like Elgin Baylor got less 
publicity. Wilt, Russell, there are many great players. You can 
name the 15 greatest. He'd probably be in that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *RICK BARRY 	
</P>
<P>
	``I keep hearing he's the greatest and that upsets me. It's not 	
fair to other players. You can't compare a 2-guard to a center. 
There are five different and distinct positions. He's the greatest 
2-guard I ever saw and the most exciting player.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *ELGIN BAYLOR 	
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do I admire Jordan's accomplishments and his 	
phenomenal basketball ability, but also the way he has conducted 
himself on and off the court. I don't think there will ever be 
another player to have the same impact on the game of basketball as 
Michael Jordan. If you look up the definition of greatness in the 
dictionary, it will say Michael Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *DAVE BING 	
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is the most talented player I've ever seen. Wilt was  
the most dominating, but Michael has the most talent in every 
aspect of the game, even defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best ever because of his combination of skills, his 	
competitiveness. Russell, Wilt, Kareem dominated because of their 
size, but they didn't have Michael's skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *LARRY BIRD 	
</P>
<P>
	``Is he the greatest? He's in the top two.'' 	
</P>
<P>
                             *BOB COUSY 	
</P>
<P>
	``He's by far the best since Naismith hung up the basket. He 	
touches every base. He could play three, maybe four positions and 
maybe even center, too. He has no discernible weakness. The keys to 
basketball, despite the emphasis on big men, is still speed and 
quickness. He has them in abundance. When I jumped as high as I 
could, I got to the bottom of the net. When he jumps as high as he 
can, he's over the backboard. He's the best, without question.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *DAVE COWENS 	
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a young player and you have to have a role model, 	
following up Dr. J with Michael Jordan, it certainly doesn't get 
any better than that. From all I've heard the last few years, 
there's nobody anybody wants to see in our league except Michael 
Jordan. He wanted to be known not only as a great scorer and a 
winner, but a great defender. And he was. As good as Chicago was 
offensively, they were better defensively primarily because of 
Michael Jordan.''	
</P>
<P>
                         *BILLY CUNNINGHAM 	
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was the best ever. The whole package. He's scary 	
sometimes with his defense. The passion he had amazes me. At a 
certain age, it's more difficult to get up for a game. A big game, 
sure, it's easy. But he did it for every game. How did he do it? To 
motivate himself at a level to perform. There's no burnout there. 
It's something within himself. If I had to play him, I'd pray a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *PATRICK EWING 	
</P>
<P>
	``All I can speak for is people in my era, and from what I've 	
seen, he's definitely the greatest. Unfortunately, I didn't have an 
opportunity to see Bill, Wilt or Oscar or some of the other guys. 
But based upon what I've seen, definitely.	
</P>
<P>
                           *MAGIC JOHNSON 	
</P>
<P>
	``He's an icon, a one-man show. He's won one more championship 	
than I did. He'll be rubbing it in my face for eternity. I was 
hoping he would stay just one more year to help these young NBA 
players learn how to be a true professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *SAM JONES 	
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he knows how good he is. He's tremendous. I've 	
never seen anything like him. He's only 6-6. That's amazing. You 
seldom see a person that size do those things. He's so creative and 
to be able to take over a game at that size, it's amazing. Oscar 
and West were the best, but there's no other version of Jordan, the 
hang time, how high he jumps, how quick he moves. The guy amazes 
me. ... He's the best I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *JERRY LUCAS 	
</P>
<P>
	``He's been probably the most important player in the history of  
the game as far as its success, popularity and growth. Magic 
Johnson and Larry Bird provided a lift when the game needed it. 
Michael took it to another level and brought more and more fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the greatest player who ever lived, a unique attraction. 	
He's such a competitor. He forced the players around him to play at 
a higher level. He's a competitor. That describes a special player. 
When the sport loses him, it's like losing Babe Ruth in baseball. 
I've never seen a player who can do what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *GEORGE MIKAN 	
</P>
<P>
	``He's the one and only Michael Jordan. He does everything well. 	
He's great offensively and defensively. What else would you want a 
guy to do? When you see a guy scoring 40 points every time ... and 
he plays more with his head today. He doesn't rely on instinct 
anymore. He's always in the right place.'' 
</P>
<P>
                         *SHAQUILLE O'NEAL 	
</P>
<P>
	``Michael's definitely the best basketball player of all time. 	
He's the greatest offensive weapon to ever play, and probably the 
best defensive player we've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
                          *OSCAR ROBERTSON 	
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is a tremendous basketball player who understands the 	
game immensely. I think Michael learned how to play the game in the 
pros. Because of TV and media, he became bigger off the court than 
on it. He is a tremendous marketing vehicle to sell everything. I 
think he hesitated to say `No more' because he did it once before 
and that turned out to be a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *BILL RUSSELL 	
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot imagine anyone playing any better.'' 	
</P>
<P>
                           *DOLPH SCHAYES 	
</P>
<P>
	``Michael's had the greatest impact on the NBA than any player  
in history. He was the greatest competitor who came through when 
asked. He rarely had a bad game. You'd expect 10 percent of the 
time that he would not do well. He beat those odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll surely be missed the first year or two out. He sold out 	
buildings because people want to see him. He got a lot of people 
who were not fans watching the game. There's nobody on the horizon 
to take his place, not Grant Hill and not Kobe Bryant. He's the 
player of the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *BILL SHARMAN 	
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Jordan is the greatest all-around basketball performer 	
of all time. ... I don't believe Michael was the greatest shooter 
or the greatest dribbler or passer or the greatest defensive 
player, etc. However, I believe he could do all these things better 
than anyone else who ever played in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *ISIAH THOMAS 	
</P>
<P>
	``From all the players I have seen and played against, he's 	
definitely the best player ever. A lot of people like to argue this 
guy was better or this guy was better. But every player you think 
of there was some weaknesses and deficiencies in their game. He has 
the complete package in all facets of his offensive game, and when 
you break him down defensively, he's also the best defensive player 
in the game. ... He should be remembered as the greatest of all 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *NATE THURMOND 	
</P>
<P>
	``He's the greatest that ever touched a basketball, that ever 	
lived, any way you want to put it and without a doubt. I hope I'm 
alive when there will be an argument of who is another player who 
comes along who's as good. I hope I'm around to see this guy. 
</P>
<P>
                            *BILL WALTON 	
</P>
<P>
	``He has no peers but Michael Jordan. He competes against 	
himself. That's the level he's taken it to.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            *JERRY WEST 	
</P>
<P>
	``I have to think he's the greatest player ever. Not because of 	
his ability to score, but because of his total game. To me he's the 
best offensive player and the best defensive player in the league 
for a number of years. To be the defensive player of the year with 
all the other things he had to do, to me, he's a marvel. He has 
separated himself from the rest of the good players as far as I'm 
concerned. He's the modern day Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *LENNY WILKINS 	
</P>
<P>
	``He became the greatest. I won't say he was when he first  
started, but he developed into, I think, the greatest player who 
ever played basketball. I think he combined all of it, the 
athleticism with the skill. And every year he improved his skill. 
And also the mental toughness it takes to come out night in and 
night out and deliver your best performance. ... You know I've seen 
a lot of great players, but never one who could dominate a game 
like Michael could.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Wednesday  
following Wall Street's sharp overnight loss. Hong Kong's key index 
plunged on more troubling news about the financial health of 
China-related companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng index shed 437.79 points, or 4.1  
percent, to close at 10,273.77. It rose 0.7 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the 1.5 percent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  
on Tuesday, Hong Kong investors were also unnerved by more bad news 
about companies with strong ties to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors dumped so-called ``red chip'' shares on news of  
financial troubles at two more companies based in the southern 
Chinese city of Guangzhou, following the recent collapse of 
Guangdong International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp., traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd. and its Hong Kong-listed  
unit, Guangnan Holdings Ltd., said late Tuesday that they did not 
have enough cash to pay back bank loans due soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there were renewed fears that currency speculators  
are back in the market to attack the Hong Kong dollar, driving 
local interbank interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rates are rising at a quicker pace than people expected,''  
quashing hopes of further interest rate cuts, said Lino Delgado, an 
associate director at Amsteel Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Japan bucked the regional trend, closing slightly  
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 42.63  
points, or 0.32 percent, to finish at 13,403.60 points. It lost 
7.51 points, or 0.06 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market sentiment hasn't improved ... although the rise of  
international blue chips such as Sony, Honda and Canon supported 
the Nikkei average,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor 
information group at Kankaku Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar fell against the  
Japanese yen, following a surge Tuesday immediately after 
intervention by Japan's central bank to stem the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen would keep Japanese exports competitive in overseas  
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 111.55 yen, down 0.95 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 112.43 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Southeast Asia, mounting concerns over Brazil's financial  
stability triggered a sell-off in the region's currencies, which 
dragged down share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	A currency devaluation in Brazil, which many investors  
anticipate, would be a major blow to Asia's recovering, but still 
wobbly economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's benchmark JSX Composite Index sank 4 percent to  
419.104 points, Singapore's key Straits Times Index slipped 2 
percent to 1,506.06 points, and Thailand benchmark SET index 
dropped 3.6 percent to 385.58 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished mixed as most investors  
stayed on the sidelines ahead of a long holiday next week. The 
benchmark Composite Index closed at 594.04 points, up 0.71 point. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Most Philippine shares fell following gains in previous  
sessions, but the key stock index shrugged off Wall Street's loss 
to finish higher. The PSE index closed 0.9 percent higher at 
2,167.40. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices in South Korea ended higher on abundant  
market liquidity following the recent decline in local interest 
rates. The key Kospi index closed at 633.03 points, up 0.29 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, with industrial  
shares sagging more than 1 percent while resource stocks received a 
much-needed boost. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,822.0 
points, down 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares fell on Wall Street's overnight loss. The  
Weighted Price Index fell 0.7 percent to 6,319.34 points. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices fell for a second day, in  
line with other Asian bourses. The benchmark NZSE-40 capital index 
closed 1.4 percent lower at 2,107.37.

<HEADLINE> Texas Man Kills Three, Then Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- A man believed to have been lurking  
around his ex-wife's home ambushed and killed the woman, her mother 
and their friend, then killed himself early Wednesday with a 
shotgun that police had confiscated but returned a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Dale Price, 48, was found dead inside the home in this  
Dallas suburb. Police said he turned his shotgun on himself and 
gunned down Janette Jeffers, 43; her mother, Margaret Compton, 67; 
and her friend, Mary Roland, 63. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-year-old son of the woman's current husband escaped from  
a second-story window and was not injured. He was in the front yard 
when police arrived. Officers don't believe he witnessed the 
shootings. His father was in California on business. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Michael Hauver said the motive was believed to be  
related to recent legal action between Price and Mrs. Jeffers, who 
had been divorced about 15 years. Specifics were not known but the 
case possibly involved child support for their college-age 
daughter, who was not at the house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hauver said the 12-year-old told of Price having a ``history of  
some problems like theft of mail and tire slashing,'' but nothing 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 3, police had stopped Price for running a red light and  
impounded the car because it was an overdue rental. 
</P>
<P>
	They also took a loaded shotgun from the back seat, even though  
he was in legal possession of it. He agreed to allow officers to 
take it for safekeeping, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Steve Upchurch said there was ``no legal recourse'' but to  
return the gun when Price requested it Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Late the next day and again this Tuesday, there were reports of  
a prowler at the house. Police did not get a clear description 
given, but suspect Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Upchurch said Price may have been ``lying in wait'' in or near  
the garage early Wednesday when Ms. Compton and Ms. Roland went to 
pack their car for a trip. He likely killed them, then went after 
his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the nation's second quadruple killing case in less than a  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Frankton, Ind., 53-year-old Terry M. Jones shot his wife  
and two children late Tuesday before calling police and taking his 
own life, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Valve Check Urged for Boeing 737s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most operators of the Boeing 737 will have to  
perform a one-time inspection of a replacement valve being 
installed in the airplane's rudder after the manufacturer and some 
airlines found parts with cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday the mandatory  
inspection would ``further minimize the already small risk of 
inadvertent rudder movement on Boeing 737s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uncommanded rudder movement is suspected in two fatal crashes,  
the September 1994 crash of a USAir 737 outside Pittsburgh and the 
March 1991 crash of a United Airlines 737 in Colorado Springs, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 airworthiness directive, the FAA ordered airlines to  
replace their 737 rudder valves with the new design. They have 
until Aug. 4 to complete that work. The proposed test would ensure 
that valves that have already been replaced don't have cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudders run up the back of a plane's tail and are used to move  
the aircraft nose left or right. That is especially important when 
landing in a crosswind. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, investigators looking into the USAir crash discovered  
that a jam inside the original valve could make it reverse. That 
meant the rudder could turn left when a pilot was pushing right -- a 
potentially catastrophic problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board also has been studying  
whether a valve reversal might explain the United Airlines crash. 
Like the USAir accident, it occurred as the plane was preparing to 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and the FAA acknowledged in November that they were  
examining the new valves after cracks were found in nine parts 
still at the manufacturer, Parker Hannifin. Since then, ``some 
cracks were found by operators, but prior to the valves being 
installed in aircraft,'' the FAA said Wednesday in an order known 
as a ``notice of proposed rulemaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection will take about an hour per aircraft and cost  
about $60. The order applies to all 737 models from the 100 series 
through the newer 500 series, a total of 1,334 planes in the United 
States. There are 3,059 aircraft worldwide that would be covered by 
the proposed inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	While FAA orders do not apply to foreign-registered aircraft,  
civil aviation authorities usually heed each other's advice on 
safety matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA will take comment on its proposed rule for the next 30  
days. It is aiming to have the inspections completed by the August 
replacement deadline.

<HEADLINE> Key Points in Impeachment Brief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key points put forward by the White House in the impeachment  
brief filed to the Senate Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
	--The alleged offenses of perjury and obstruction of justice do  
not meet the constitutional standard of high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	--The evidence does not support the allegations of perjury before  
a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	--The charges exist only because the president had a wrongful  
relationship and sought to keep the existence of that relationship 
private. 
</P>
<P>
	--The articles of impeachment contain more than one charge per  
article, and do not specifically delineate the charges against the 
president, and therefore violate the president's most basic rights 
as a criminal defendant.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Advance Mastectomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The increasingly common practice of removing both breasts while  
they are healthy is an effective, if radical, way of preventing 
breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease, researchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings published in today's New England Journal of  
Medicine were first reported by The Associated Press in 1997 when 
they were released at a medical conference in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said they consider prophylactic mastectomy, as  
it is called, to be at least 90 percent effective in reducing 
breast cancer. It's not totally effective because the disease may 
already have spread before the breasts are removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lynn Hartmann and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic reviewed  
the cases of 639 women who had both breasts removed because of 
their family history of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 425 considered to be at moderate risk, 37 cases of  
breast cancer would have been expected after 14 years of follow-up. 
Only four actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors also followed the sisters of the 214 considered at  
high risk. None of these sisters got prophylactic mastectomies, and 
39 percent developed breast cancer. By comparison, just over 1 
percent of the high-risk women getting mastectomies later had 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can only be viewed as good news for women who are  
considering this option and even better news for women who have 
already undergone the procedure,'' Drs. Andrea Eisen and Barbara 
Weber wrote in an accompanying editorial.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Hernandez: No Cuba Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins pitcher Livan Hernandez wants no  
part of any plan to play major-league exhibition games in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban immigrant said he would be against anything that could  
bring profit to Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to this country to have freedom,'' Hernandez told The  
Palm Beach Post for a story Wednesday. ``I wouldn't want to go back 
to play in Cuba and have part of my salary go to Fidel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration recently announced a proposal to  
relax long-standing trade restrictions against Cuba but said any 
profits from the games should go to humanitarian efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles are planning two exhibition games this  
spring against the Cuban national team -- one in Baltimore, one in 
Cuba. The Marlins have no such plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see doors open, and I'd like to see a lot of Cuban  
ballplayers come to the U.S., as long as the money would be for 
them or if they stayed in this country,'' said Hernandez, whose 
half-brother Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez also defected from Cuba 
and now pitches for the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they would have to return to Cuba with the money, and then  
it goes to Fidel,'' Livan continued. ``I know all about that 
situation. I came here and left my family in Cuba just to escape 
from that situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last major-league team to play in Cuba was the Brooklyn  
Dodgers, who trained in Havana in 1947.

<HEADLINE> State Accused of Dumping Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Loretta Rolland says all she wants is  
``a real home and a real life'' again. 
</P>
<P>
	For 51 years her mother had provided the help that Rolland, who  
suffers from cerebral palsy, needed to have that life. But, when 
her mother died, the state put her in a nursing home. Six years 
later, she is still there. Still yearning to ``be with people my 
own age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Ames managed to live on his own for more than 20 years. He  
even got and kept a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames was one of thousands of mentally retarded people in western  
Massachusetts to benefit when a federal judge was appalled by 
inhumane conditions at the Belchertown State School and devoted the 
next decade to forcing Massachusetts to create community placements 
for its residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, when the family Ames had been living with had to give up  
the work, the state Department of Mental Retardation put the 
47-year-old into a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said it would be temporary. That he wouldn't be there for  
more than three months,'' said his sister Linda Bock of Weare, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he is still in a nursing home.  
</P>
<P>
	``These are the forgotten people,'' said Steven Schwartz of the  
Center for Public Representation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center and other advocacy groups have filed a federal suit  
in U.S. District Court here on behalf of Rolland, Ames, and an 
estimated 1,600 other mentally retarded and developmentally 
disabled people now in Massachusetts nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers don't have exact numbers, but they estimate that about a  
third are in their 40s and 50s. More than half have already 
qualified for community care. And they say that out of the more 
than 870 people the state's own screening found needed specialized 
services aimed at their disability, only 114 are receiving the 
extra help in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say the problem is too little money and a  
waiting list of 3,000 people already seeking residential 
placements. Over the past two years, the legislature has 
appropriated $15 million towards reducing the waiting list, 
including $10 million to create group and other homes for those 
being cared for by elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of a larger problem,'' said Leo V. Sarkissian,  
executive director of the Massachusetts chapter of The Arc, an 
advocacy group for the mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legislature has been unbelievably understanding, and we  
are making progress,'' he said. Still, he estimated it would cost 
$100 million over the next four years to erase Massachusetts' 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	And the situation is getting worse.  
</P>
<P>
	About 2 million of the nearly 7.5 million mentally retarded  
people in the United States are older than 50. And as their parents 
age or die, many of these adult children face uncertain futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, nearly a quarter of a million mentally retarded people  
are on waiting lists for either residential or day services, 
according to The Arc. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, about 750 families -- nearly a quarter of all  
those on the waiting list -- had been waiting at least a decade for 
a residential placement for their adult son or daughter, according 
to a 1977 study commissioned by the Massachusetts Arc. 
</P>
<P>
	The average age of those caring for retarded adults is in their  
60s, and some are in their 80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough enough for the average citizen facing their senior  
years, but imagine adding to that the worry of how you can be 
assured that your son or daughter will get the support they need,'' 
Sarkissian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts isn't alone in struggling with the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki has proposed spending $230 million  
over the next five years to trim his state's waiting list of 6,500. 
Maryland also has a multimillion-dollar plan. And the state of 
Florida has been ordered by a federal appeals court to move on its 
lengthy waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey voters approved a $160 million Human Services bond  
issue in 1994, half of it devoted to group homes to reduce its 
waiting list. Four years later the waiting list has grown from 
4,000 families to 5,124 as more families that had been taking care 
of their adult children sought help. New Jersey officials now say 
it will take $323 million to meet the need. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if we are taking advantage of our elders  
twice,'' said Sarkissian. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't get any help taking care of their retarded  
children when they were younger,'' he said. ``Now the time has come 
when they desperately need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And, now in their 70s, when their energy level is lower and  
it's harder for them to fight, we are abandoning them.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks Test for Year 2000 Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss banks will join together to  
test if their systems are ready for the arrival of the year 2000, 
the Swiss Bankers' Association said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks are trying to guard against the so-called millennium  
bug, which could disrupt computer operations on Jan. 1, 2000 when 
computers designed only to read the last two digits of a year may 
assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests will concentrate on links between organizations and  
the association is recommending that banks test their internal 
systems at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruedi Spitzli, information technology chief of the private Bank  
Vontobel, said he anticipated few problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that most Swiss banks will be eager to test their  
systems' preparedness for the year 2000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have already run numerous tests in-house to iron out the  
wrinkles and expect relatively smooth sailing.

<HEADLINE> No One Can Replace His Airness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- This isn't going to be easy, finding a  
replacement for Michael Jordan who can wow the kids, sell the goods 
and carry the league. In fact, it's going to be downright 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Hill? Nice guy, but no. Didn't even make the playoffs last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Penny Hardaway? Forget it. Got his coach fired and then took  
almost a whole season off. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson? Please! Jordan never had a rap sheet.  
</P>
<P>
	Kobe Bryant? Getting warmer, but let him learn how to pass the  
ball first. 
</P>
<P>
	Get used to it, basketball fans: His Airness is gone, and  
there's no one who can even find his shoes, let alone fit into 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never going to be another Dr. J., and I knew that.  
There was never going to be another Elgin Baylor, I knew that. So 
the kids of tomorrow, there's never going to be another Michael 
Jordan,'' the original said Wednesday as he retired for a second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be a Grant Hill, you can be an Anfernee Hardaway, you  
can be a Kobe Bryant, but Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan,'' he 
said. ``You might take bits and pieces of his game or his 
personality and somehow correlate them to yours, but either way, 
you have to develop into the person that you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For anyone who has forgotten, Jordan wasn't Jordan right away,  
either. When he arrived in the NBA in 1984, he was a brash, skinny 
kid from North Carolina who still had hair. He didn't have a 
complete game, and some players called him a ball hog. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan had something that set him apart from everyone -- a  
competitive fire that drove him to become the greatest player and 
refused to let him lose. He developed a deadly jump shot, and 
learned to make the most of his teammates' talents. Eventually, his 
mental ability surpassed his physical skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of this came the six NBA championships, 10 scoring titles  
and five MVP awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe there was a better player,'' said Jeff  
Hornacek, whose Utah Jazz lost to the Bulls in the last two NBA 
Finals. ``Maybe Wilt (Chamberlain), but that's because of size. At 
6-5, there's nothing (Jordan) couldn't do. No matter what you did, 
he was impossible to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dolph Schayes, voted one of the NBA's 50 greatest players,  
insists no player in league history had a bigger impact on the game 
than Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got a lot of people who were not fans watching the game,''  
Schayes said. ``There's nobody on the horizon to take his place, 
not Grant Hill and not Kobe Bryant. He's the player of the 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant can only try.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel responsible as a young player to try to carry on the  
tradition that he and other players have developed, both on and off 
the court,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And while today's young stars are criticized as selfish or lazy,  
Jordan got better because he loved the game, not because he thought 
it would get him a bigger contract or a new shoe deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what happens in the business of basketball, if you  
didn't get paid a dime, you still would play the game of basketball 
somewhere,'' he said. ``And that love has to be illustrated in the 
way that you play the game and the way that you carry yourself on 
and off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Jordan's skills on the court are unparalleled, it was his  
off-the-court personality that made him a superstar. When it came 
to endorsements, his smile could sell dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter that he was worth more than many small  
countries or that his competitiveness could make him cranky. Anyone 
who watched him play or heard him speak figured he was a swell guy 
who'd make a great next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever tried to invent Michael Jordan,'' said his agent,  
David Falk. ``We didn't try to create something in 1984, it just 
evolved. When you try to create that, the public sees through it 
and they think it's insincere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Look at the NBA's other stars. Shaquille O'Neal can't do much  
more than dunk and rap. Karl Malone used to be one of the nicest, 
most down-to-earth players in the league -- remember his knock on 
the knuckleheads? -- but he hooked up with Dennis Rodman's agent, 
became a pro wrestler and started sounding like he took one too 
many dropkicks to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley is entertaining, but even Jordan says his good  
buddy is lazy. Then there's Kevin ``It Wasn't About the Money'' 
Garnett. All he has to show for himself is a monster contract that 
irked owners so much they locked their players out. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe this is why fans said they couldn't care less when the  
lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a long time -- if ever -- before we see anybody with  
Michael's ability, but basketball's a team game,'' Chicago Bulls 
assistant Tex Winter said. ``In the long run, it might be just as 
well so the fans and the NBA itself can concentrate a little bit 
more on the team aspect of the game as opposed to the individual, 
NBA-superstar syndrome that they seem to want to sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But don't doubt that advertising executives and TV producers  
turned off Jordan's news conference and immediately start plotting 
the next great pitchman. Bryant has been called ``the next Jordan'' 
since he joined the league, and one of Iverson's shoe campaigns 
touted him as ``The Answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael has been great for the game. The game is going to miss  
him,'' Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said. ``But another young 
star will come along. They won't do it like Michael. No one can.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Toyota To Name New Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, has  
decided to promote vice president Fujio Cho to succeed company 
president Hiroshi Okuda, according to a published report Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda will become Toyota's new chairman to make room for Cho,  
who once served as chief of the company's North American 
subsidiary, Kyodo News agency said, citing unnamed company sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota officials were unavailable for comment late Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The reported move comes less than a week after Okuda was  
nominated to serve as head of a leading business lobby, sparking 
speculation he would become chairman and leave day-to-day 
operational duties to a new president. 
</P>
<P>
	Okuda, 66, will replace current chairman Shoichiro Toyoda, who  
is likely become head of the Toyota group's holding company, Kyodo 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho, 61, was hired by Toyota in 1960 and has served as vice  
president since last June, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Okuda was appointed the first president from outside  
the founding Toyoda family in almost three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Toyota is publicly held, it traditionally has been run  
by the family of Sakichi Toyoda, who founded the automaker's 
predecessor, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, in 1925.

<HEADLINE> Peru 1998 Economic Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's economy grew by only 1 percent in 1998,  
far below the government's original prediction of 5 percent, said 
Luis Chang Ching, head of the government's economic commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru's economy grew 7.4 percent in 1997, but slowed sharply in  
1998 due to the El Nino weather phenomenon and the global financial 
crisis, which hurt its exports, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang Ching's statements were published Wednesday in the Lima  
daily El Comercio. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino's warm waters decimated Peru's fishing catch and caused  
flooding that washed out much of its road and bridge 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is predicting Peru's economy will recover in 1999  
and grow by 5.5 percent, although that estimate is likely to change 
following Brazil's devaluation of its currency Wednesday after the 
nation's central bank president resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Private sector analysts have estimated the economy will grow by  
3.5 to 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government plans to release the official 1998 growth figure  
in the first week of February.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on Brazil News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro and other major  
currencies as Brazil effectively devalued its currency, churning 
financial markets worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average and the dollar both plummeted  
initially, then recovered from their early lows as the economic 
waters smoothed somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar rose against the yen as Japanese officials  
verbally backed Tuesday's foreign exchange intervention that had 
halted the dollar's recent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro rose to $1.1666 in late New York trading from $1.1555  
Tuesday as the dollar bought 113.33 Japanese yen in New York, up 
from 112.43 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets fizzled and the dollar fell as Brazil's central  
banker resigned unexpectedly and his successor expanded the trading 
range of the Brazilian real, effectively devaluing the Brazilian 
currency by 7.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was halted as Brazil's Bovespa stock market index fell  
more than 10 percent within minutes of the market's opening. The 
index closed down 5 percent. Major stock indices in Britain, 
Germany and France ended lower by at least 3 percent. The Dow Jones 
industrial average plummeted more than 261 points at the opening of 
the New York Stock Exchange before recovering to close 125 points 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar tumbled to $1.1790 against the euro before it mounted  
its own moderate recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar did of course knee-jerk stumble but did recover,''  
said Lisa Finstrom, a senior currency futures analyst at Salomon 
Smith Barney, adding that the dollar was helped by the strong 
overall U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was also boosted by remarks from President Clinton.  
At a news conference, he said he had consulted with the 
International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven major industrial 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil ... carry forward  
with its economic reform plan and succeed,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States would be interested in Brazil's success  
particularly since IBM, Coca Cola, Ford and General Motors are 
among the 2,000 U.S. businesses operating in Latin America's 
strongest economy. With $27 billion invested in Brazil, U.S. banks 
also are vulnerable to the tumult. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar continued rising against the yen Wednesday as  
Japanese leaders called for exchange rate stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sharp moves are highly undesirable,'' Vice Finance Minister  
Koji Tanami told reporters, spurring a bout of dollar-buying in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also fell to 1.3681 Swiss francs from 1.3887 Tuesday  
but rose to 1.5210 Canadian dollars from 1.5125. The British pound 
rose to $1.6472 from $1.6308. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6764 German 
marks, down from 1.6926 late Tuesday; 5.6243 French francs, down 
from 5.6786; 1,661.13 Italian lire, down from 1,675.04.

<HEADLINE> Burghoff Not on BP's 'Radar' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) -- Gary Burghoff ran into trouble trying to  
fill up at a BP station, even though he is a spokesman for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Burghoff, who played Radar O'Reilly on TV's ``M A S H,'' was  
asked to produce identification Monday to pay for his gas with a 
check during a trip through Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime pitchman for British Petroleum stations, Burghoff had  
his BP card rejected, then spent the next hour on the phone with BP 
officials to resolve the mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems Burghoff's account was suspended after a recent move.  
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the matter was cleared up, and the station clerk  
allowed the purchase to go through for an autograph. Burghoff, who 
won an Emmy for his portrayal of Radar, lives in California.

<HEADLINE> Court Makes Hospital Suits Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, unanimously reviving a  
Kentucky woman's lawsuit, today made it easier to sue hospitals for 
``dumping'' patients in need of emergency care onto other 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsigned decision said such lawsuits do not have to allege  
or prove any ``improper motive'' behind the transfers from one 
facility to another. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said a 1986 federal law that prevents such treatment  
of patients, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 
``contains no express or implied `improper motive' requirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
had ruled the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision, a victory for Wanda Johnson of Bardstown, Ky.,  
was not unexpected. When the case was argued last month, a lawyer 
for the hospital Johnson sued conceded that the law does not 
require such proof. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had asked the justices to bar Johnson's $10 million  
lawsuit on other grounds. The justices refused to do so, and sent 
the case back to the lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson says she was prematurely transferred to an Indiana  
nursing home after a six-week stay in 1992 at Humana 
Hospital-University of Louisville in Louisville, Ky. She had been 
treated there after being run over by a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Johnson said  
she has no memory of the accident or her stay at the Louisville 
hospital. Her lawsuit contends that her health at the time of her 
transfer remained in a volatile state, and that her health 
deteriorated significantly after the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed for Johnson by her aunt and guardian, Jane  
Roberts, says the Louisville hospital violated the federal law when 
it sent her to a nursing home, from where she later was transferred 
to an Indianapolis medical center. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's medical bills at that center totaled about $400,000,  
and Medicaid did not cover them because she was not an Indiana 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's eight months of hospitalization were followed by  
almost two years of nursing care and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Roberts vs. Galen of Virginia, 97-53.

<HEADLINE> Lots of Bugs in Dog and Cat Bites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What's worse than a dog's bite? Germs, for starters -- though a  
bite from Fido is still much ``cleaner'' than one from a human 
being. 
</P>
<P>
	Cultures from 107 infected dog and cat bites turned up 152 kinds  
of bacteria, including 10 not previously known to infect people, 
according to a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	There were an average of five kinds of germs per bite.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the best study of the topic so far and should persuade  
doctors not to try the cheap route when treating infected bites, 
emergency physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
	The germs aren't dangerous unless the skin is broken, meaning  
it's probably OK to let your dog lick your face. In fact, human 
bites are much more dangerous, in terms of germs transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a choice about being bitten, you don't want a  
person. Choose your cat,'' said Dr. Toni Mitchell of the American 
College of Emergency Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people get bitten every year. About 270,000 go to  
emergency rooms to have dog and cat bites treated, and about 9,000 
have to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the time, it's because of the damage to flesh and bone  
from the bite itself. However, infections can force amputation and 
even cause death. The class of germs found most often includes ones 
that can cause meningitis and blood infections. 
</P>
<P>
	This study looked at people treated for infected bites at 18  
emergency rooms around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of the germs they found took up a full page in small  
type. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly expands our knowledge in that area,'' said Dr.  
Robert McNamara, president of the American Academy of Emergency 
Medicine. And, he said, it shows that the broad-spectrum 
antibiotics usually prescribed for bites are the right treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of the patients treated at 18 emergency rooms  
did not get those drugs, said Dr. David Talan of UCLA Medical 
Center, the study's lead author. 
</P>
<P>
	``One concern with treating these infections is that the  
antibiotics you use are fairly expensive,'' McNamara said. 
``Sometimes people try to get away with the cheaper medicines, like 
penicillin alone. Hopefully, this will eliminate that 20 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers were struck by how quickly the infections can  
develop. The average time was 12 hours for cat bites and 24 hours 
for dog bites. Several bites took less than eight hours to show 
signs of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animals shouldn't be biting people. But since that's always  
going to happen sometimes, keep a close eye on infections,'' Talan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common sort of bug, found in half the dog bites and  
three-quarters of the cat bites, is pasteurella. Pasteurella germs 
can cause meningitis or blood infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer  
Inc.

	ALDAMA, Mexico (AP) -- Dozens of rebel sympathizers blocked 450  
soldiers and police from entering their village in southern Chiapas 
state, exchanging blows and insults with them for more than an hour 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported in the scuffles that started before  
dawn on a remote rural road. The security forces were on their way 
to destroy nearby marijuana fields when a large group of men, women 
and children stopped the 20-vehicle military convoy outside Aldama. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the leftist Zapatista rebels runs high in Aldama,  
about 44 miles north of San Cristobal de las Casas. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters threw rocks and military police fought back with  
police batons and at one time threatened to fire tear gas canisters 
into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Aldama residents said they were afraid that if they allowed the  
army in, the soldiers would set up a base there to fight the 
Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
	After a lengthy argument, the protesters allowed the task force  
access to the fields in surrounding hills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in January, 1994,  
demanding greater democracy and Indian rights. Peace talks between 
the rebels and the government have been stalled since 1996.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Angry onlookers shouted ``thief''  
Wednesday when one of the leading figures in a banking scandal was 
brought before a judge after four years on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	Former banker Orlando Castro, 73, was extradited from New York  
City to Venezuela late Tuesday. His lawyers requested that he be 
granted house arrest because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban-born Castro is accused in Venezuela of misusing $229  
million of emergency funds provided by the government in 1994 to 
save his Banco Progreso. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 40 percent of Venezuela's financial system went under  
during the crisis and had to be taken over in an $8 billion 
bailout. Castro fled to the United States shortly after Banco 
Progreso was taken over in December 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He had become one of the symbols of the crisis. Just weeks  
before he fled the country, he handed out buttons with his bank's 
name that said, ``Here we are, here we stay.''

<P>
	On Thursday, Siew will meet with President Rene Preval, who made  
a state visit to Taiwan in May 1998.

<P>
	The possibility of a $6 million loan for a water project will be  
discussed, and the delegation will also investigate investment 
opportunities in Haiti, said Taiwanese embassy official Zhang

	In 1997, Taiwan was Haiti's fourth largest benefactor after the  
United States, Canada, and France.

neighboring Dominican Republic before coming to Haiti and is to end 
its 10-day, three-country Caribbean trip in Belize, Central

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Argues Vs. Libel Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers for McDonald's on Wednesday rejected the  
claims of two vegetarian campaigners that their pamphlet attacking 
the multinational corporation should be protected as an expression 
of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Morris, 44, and Helen Steel, 33, are seeking to overturn a  
1997 judgment that they had defamed McDonald's by distributing 
pamphlets entitled ``What's wrong with McDonald's? Everything they 
don't want you to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of their appeal at the Royal Courts of Justice on  
Tuesday, Morris and Steel told the three-judge panel that Britons 
should be free to criticize corporations in the same way they can 
criticize government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	They contended the pamphlet was a statement of opinion,  
deserving of protection as free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Rampton, lead lawyer for McDonald's, argued that while  
an elected government does not have the right to sue citizens for 
libel, the same does not apply ``to the rights of individuals or 
corporations to protect themselves from unwarranted damage to their 
reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There must be a balance, he said, between freedom of speech and  
the protection of the reputation or rights of others. 
</P>
<P>
	If a corporation were not allowed to sue for libel, Rampton  
said, ``there would be damage to commercial interests on an 
enormous scale,'' and to the nation's financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, widely known as McLibel, was the longest trial in  
English history, at 314 days in court, spread over 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Although McDonald's won the judgment, it was embarrassed when  
the judge ruled that substantial parts of the leaflet were true. He 
said McDonald's was, in fact, responsible for animal cruelty, that 
it exploited children through its advertising and that it paid 
workers in Britain poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris and Steel, who are unemployed, conducted their own  
defense and McDonald's is estimated to have spent $16 million on 
the case. The corporation did not bother trying to collect its 
winnings of $98,000 in damages from the defendants.

<HEADLINE> Safety Panel Urges Kid Seat-Fitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government should set up a nationwide  
network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's 
lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board 
recommended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NTSB believes that the federal and state governments  
should be more directly involved in assuring that child safety 
seats are used correctly,'' said Jim Hall, the chairman of the 
safety agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Most parents do not know a child seat is improperly installed  
until after their child is killed or injured in a crash, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are 
used improperly. If all children using child seats were restrained 
properly, 68 more lives would be saved annually, the agency 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated parents struggle to properly install about 70 models  
of child car seats in hundreds of different types of cars each 
year, meaning there are ``potentially 100,000 different ways to 
confuse the average consumer,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Properly used child seats reduce the risk of fatal injuries by  
more than 50 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fitting stations could be established across the United  
States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration 
offices, fire stations or automobile dealerships, Hall said. He 
said the initiative should be funded out of government 
transportation dollars but had no cost estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The board can only recommend auto safety initiatives, but its  
recommendations carry great weight within the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also reiterated other NTSB initiatives as part of a package  
the board believes would reduce child deaths and injuries in 
traffic accidents. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--Built-in child seats should be available in more cars and  
trucks. Hall believed they should be used on airplanes and school 
buses as well. ``Isn't it unbelievable that regulations require 
everything to be secured on (airplane) takeoffs and landings -- 
everything except our smallest children,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	--All states should adopt laws that allow police to pull autos  
over when passengers are not wearing seat belts. Seat belt surveys 
have shown when a driver is buckled, restraint use for children is 
94 percent. When a driver is unbuckled, restraint use for children 
is 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children 12 and under should ride in the back seat.  
</P>
<P>
	--Children ages 4 to 8 should be properly secured in booster  
seats because they are not old enough to fit adult seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Child safety groups said permanent checkpoints would send a  
strong message about the importance of proper child seat 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do this, it will reduce the mortality of children  
(in car crashes) by at least 25 percent to 35 percent nationwide,'' 
said Martin Eichelberger, a surgeon at Children's National Medical 
Center and president of the National Safe Kids Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHTSA is set to announce early this year a federal  
requirement that all new child safety seats must have the same, 
simple anchoring system in new cars. The average car is about 9 
years old, however, underscoring the need for child seat fitting 
stations for the millions of vehicles already on the road, Hall 
said.

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge may have to decide how  
to divide up President Clinton's $850,000 settlement check in the 
Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton mailed the check to Mrs. Jones in California on Tuesday.  
But besides Mrs. Jones, the check was made out to her current and 
former lawyers. And the two sets of lawyers are fighting with each 
other over legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The check may be placed in the custody of U.S. District Judge  
Susan Webber Wright until the dispute is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday is the deadline for Mrs. Jones to respond to an $874,000  
claim in legal fees from her former lawyers in the sexual 
harassment case, Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said when the case was settled that we would want to  
have a reasonable division of that. And if all are fair and 
reasonable and not greedy, that it can be resolved without court 
intervention,'' Cammarata said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cammarata said Mrs. Jones' camp responded with a threatening  
letter and a take-it-or-leave-it offer of $25,000, so Cammarata and 
Davis went to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cammarata nor Mrs. Jones' current lawyer Bill McMillan  
would comment Wednesday on how much of the settlement check they 
thought should go to Cammarata and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata and Davis quit the case in 1997 when Mrs. Jones  
rejected a settlement with Clinton that did not include an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of  
Arkansas, made a crude advance in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton 
denied her accusation and, in the settlement, admitted no 
wrongdoing and offered no apology. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawsuit brought to light the president's affair with  
Monica Lewinsky and set in motion the investigation that led to his 
impeachment.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert W. ``Wally'' Guenther, a journalist  
who worked for 30 years at the Los Angeles Times and was editor in 
chief of House Beautiful magazine for eight years, died Monday of 
cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Guenther began his newspaper career in 1948 as a copy boy for  
the Los Angeles Daily News. He joined the Times seven years later 
as a suburban section copy editor. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked as editorial director of the Los Angeles Times  
magazine and several of the paper's specialty magazines including 
Home, You and TV Times. He also was edited the Travel and the Times 
on Demand sections. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he left the Times to serve as editor in chief of House  
Beautiful in New York. He returned to the Times in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Jolene; daughters, Jane Gamble and  
Anne Guenther, who is managing editor of TV Times; and three 
grandchildren.

<P>
	WALL, S.D. (AP) -- Ted E. Hustead, who helped build Wall Drug  
into an international tourist attraction, died Tuesday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Hustead, who opened Wall Drug Co. in 1931, grossed $350 his  
first month. But the store was on a popular travelers route, and 
Hustead and his wife, Dorothy, decided to put up signs to promote 
free ice water to lure in customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy wrote the copy for the first sign, which read: ``Get a  
soda. Get a beer. Turn next corner. Just as near. To Highway 16 and 
14. Free ice water. Wall Drug.'' Cars started turning in as soon as 
the signs went up. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave Ted Hustead the inspiration to line the highway with  
more signs advertising Wall Drug. Signs and bumper stickers telling 
the number of miles to Wall Drug now appear around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The store soon gained international attention from the free  
publicity and was written up in more than 700 newspapers.

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Logan, a football player for the Tampa  
Bay Buccaneers who later served as an announcer for the team's 
flagship radio station, died Tuesday night of a blood clot in the 
lungs. He was 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan, who played nose tackle, joined the Buccaneers in 1979  
after being drafted out of the University of Pittsburgh. He was 
named an All-Pro in 1984. He finished his Buccaneer career in 1986 
with a streak of 103 consecutive starts, a team record until it was 
broken in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He played an additional season in 1987 for the Green Bay  
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan then began his broadcasting career with NBC affiliate  
WFLA-TV in Tampa. He also worked a variety of college football 
games as a color analyst and sideline reporter for CBS and the 
Sunshine Network. He also hosted a television sports talk show.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jim Peters, the British runner who broke the world  
marathon record four times in the 1950s but is best remembered for 
a poignant failure in the 1954 Commonwealth Games, died Jan. 9, 
according to news reports. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times of London said he had suffered from cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Peters finished ninth in the 10,000-meter race in the 1948  
Olympic Games. Afterward, his new coach persuaded him to become a 
marathoner. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters first broke the 26-mile marathon record in 1952 and he  
remained the world's best for that distance until 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1954 Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, British Columbia,  
he entered the stadium at the end of the marathon with an 
astonishing three-mile lead over the rest of the field but began to 
stagger from effects of severe dehydration. He fell more than a 
half dozen times, even crawling on all fours as he tried but failed 
to complete the last lap.

<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- William W. Warren, a broadcaster who worked his  
way up the ranks at KOMO Radio to oversee its parent company for 
radio and television operations, died Friday after undergoing heart 
surgery. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren entered broadcasting as a salesman in 1933. He was  
quickly promoted to the position of program manager at KOMO-KJR 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren started the first radio news department in the Northwest  
and helped develop KOMO-TV in Seattle and KATU-TV in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1987 as chairman of Fisher Broadcasting Inc.,  
parent company of the television stations and radio STAR-FM, 
KOMO-AM and KVI-AM. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his honors is a Peabody Award for a television program  
about a group of senior citizens fighting crime in their community. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, three children and six  
grandchildren.

                           *William Whyte    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- William H. Whyte, an expert on urban planning  
who warned against corporate conformity in his bestseller ``The 
Organization Man,'' died Tuesday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte took camera and notebook in hand and walked urban streets,  
where he painstakingly observed how people used urban spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Whyte's 1956 bestseller ``The Organization Man,''  
written while he was a Fortune magazine editor, that brought him 
public attention for rethinking America's corporate ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	The book lamented that individualists' once-bold visions had  
been replaced by ``organization men who lower their sights to 
achieve a good job with adequate pay and proper pension and a nice 
house in a pleasant community populated with people as nearly like 
themselves as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, Whyte left his job as Fortune's assistant managing  
editor to become a scholar of human habitats. His 1959 study 
``Conservation Easements'' was credited with helping bring 
open-space legislation in New York, California and other states. 
Other books included ``The Last Landscape'' (1968) and ``The 
Exploding Metropolis'' (1993).

<HEADLINE> Study: Gov't Pays More Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Taxpayers foot the bill for much more of the nation's health  
insurance than is commonly thought, according to a study in today's 
New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau has reported that 61.2 percent of the U.S.  
population has job-related insurance, and 25.9 percent is insured 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many of the people counted as covered by private  
insurance actually got much of their insurance from the government, 
said Olveen Carrasquillo of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he said the Census Bureau lists most federal,  
state and local government workers as privately insured, even 
though taxpayers ultimately pay for that insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, people who get both private and federal insurance  
are listed by the government in both groups or only as privately 
insured. And some people are listed as having insurance provided by 
their company, even though the workers pay all the premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	By Carrasquillo's count, private employers' insurance covered  
43.1 percent of the population in 1996, while 34.2 percent had 
publicly funded insurance. A total of 7.1 percent of Americans 
bought their own insurance, and 15.6 percent were uninsured, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Suspect's Story Called Ludicrous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A politically connected lawyer's actions  
-- having affairs and dumping a mistress' body -- may be repugnant to 
most people, but they weren't criminal, a defense lawyer said 
Wednesday during closing arguments in Thomas Capano's murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things may offend you, and many of them should, but ...  
you can't vote guilty because you don't like Tom Capano or what he 
did,'' his lawyer, Joseph Oteri, told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued Capano, 49, killed Anne Marie Fahey, the  
governor's 30-year-old secretary, then took 2 1/2 years to come up 
with his story: that another mistress accidentally shot Ms. Fahey 
and that he kept quiet to protect the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, that story is ludicrous. It defies  
common sense,'' prosecutor Colm Connolly said. ``The defendant 
thought he would get away with murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was expected to get the case Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fahey was last seen dining with Capano in a Philadelphia  
restaurant in 1996. Capano at first told police and others that he 
knew nothing about her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	But at his trial, he admitted that Ms. Fahey died at his house  
that night and that he crammed her body into a cooler and dumped it 
at sea the next day with his brother Gerard's help. Capano said his 
longtime mistress Deborah MacIntyre accidentally shot Ms. Fahey. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said if that were true, then Capano, a member of  
a wealthy Delaware construction family and a former gubernatorial 
aide, could have simply called for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody was going to be given the benefit of the doubt, it  
was the defendant with his political connections,'' Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre denied being at Capano's home the night Ms. Fahey  
died. She testified against him, saying she bought Capano a gun at 
his request a month earlier.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Oil Refinery Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMACKOVER, Ark. (AP) -- Three men working on a tank at an oil  
refinery were killed Wednesday in explosion that was heard for 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a loud explosion, a big boom that rattled the doors and  
windows and everything else,'' said Joel Hooks, a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract employees were working on a naphtha tank valve at  
the Cross Oil Refinery, said State Police Capt. Larry Gleghorn. 
Naphtha is a colorless, volatile petroleum distillate -- usually an 
intermediate product between gasoline and benzine. It's used as a 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
	The local fire department and hazardous materials team were  
working to handle the naphtha leak. 
</P>
<P>
	No cause was immediately known but the blast happened in an area  
where welding was being done, said Cross Oil lawyer Bill Prewett. 
An ensuing fire was quickly put out. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims worked for Systems Contracting Corp., which had been  
hired by Cross Oil. They were identified as Dale Hamilton, 54, 
Scott Shoffnor, 28, and Clay Yarbrough, 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the men were on the ground and one was on top of the tank  
when the morning explosion occurred, said Trocky Ibert, a sheriff's 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	The company shut down the refinery plant, but doesn't expect a  
long interruption. The plant employs about 100 people. Prewett said 
it has been almost 75 years since a fatal accident at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
	Smackover is about 110 miles south of Little Rock.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Recoups Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc.'s stock tumbled more than 16  
percent this morning, as investors sold off shares in the Internet 
site operator despite its better-than-expected fourth-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yahoo! bounced back from its early lows by midday as the  
stock market rebounded from a steep selloff that was prompted by 
the resignation of Brazil's central bank chief and the subsequent 
devaluation of its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! fell as much as $66.87 1/2 in early trading, but was down  
only $5.06 1/4 at $396.93 3/4 at midday. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff came on what should have been a strong day for  
Yahoo. Late Tuesday, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company said it 
earned $18.5 million in the fourth quarter, reversing a loss from 
the year-ago period and easily surpassing Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!'s earnings equaled 16 cents per share for the quarter  
ended Dec. 31. The results compared to a loss of $1.9 million, or 2 
cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding costs related to acquisitions, Yahoo! earned $25  
million, or 21 cents per share -- beating the official analysts' 
estimate of 16 cents per share, according to First Call Corp. The 
results also topped the 20-cent ``whisper'' number -- the rumored 
predictions that circulate prior to earnings announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue soared to $76.4 million from $26.6 million as increasing  
visitors to its Web sites helped fuel advertising. The company's 
sites include a range of features from chat rooms to news and 
search services. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least they're making some money,'' said Jim Balderston,  
director of Zona Research Inc., an Internet market research company 
in Redwood City, Calif. ``Some of these Internet stocks have been 
going through the roof while continuing to pile up negative 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what the market has been doing, this is an  
encouragement not just for Yahoo! but for a lot of Internet 
stocks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Yahoo! announced that Tim Koogle, president and  
chief executive officer, was appointed chairman and CEO, effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Mallett, the company's chief operating officer, was  
elevated to the president's post and made a board member, in 
addition to his current title. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which had been  
expected by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Yahoo! earned $25.6 million, or 23 cents per  
share, reversing a loss of $25.5 million, or 29 cents per share, in 
1997. Revenue jumped to $203.3 million from $70.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Seat Spots in Senate Substantial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like almost everything in the Senate,  
seniority governs where senators sit. And that's what they'll be 
required to do during most of President Clinton's impeachment trial 
-- sit silently at their desks. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight desks are up for grabs due to retirements and  
election-night upsets, but neither Democrats nor Republicans had 
finalized seating arrangements for their respective sides of the 
Senate aisle as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when live television coverage of the trial begins Thursday,  
the four newcomers in each party are likely to be sitting at those 
vacant desks until the seating charts are completed, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the eight seats changed parties, but Sens. Blanche  
Lincoln, D-Ark., and Michael Crapo, R-Idaho, who held the seats for 
their parties, are likely to sit where their predecessors did. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, though, seniority rules: The newest and most junior  
members typically occupy that ring of seats at the back of the 
ornate, blue-carpeted 19th century chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	And as their Senate stock rises, they can try to move closer to  
the central dais or to a more photogenic location, unless a more 
senior member claims the vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, they can just stay put.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's all sorts of reasons why people choose to move or not  
to move,'' said Donald Ritchie, the associate Senate historian. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 Senate desks, arranged in a semicircular pattern, are  
divided by political party. Viewed from the dais, where Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist will preside over the trial, the 55 
Republican senators sit to the left of the center aisle and the 45 
Democrats to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Another way to secure a front-row seat is by being elected to  
leadership. The majority and minority leaders and their whips, or 
vote-counters, sit up front. 
</P>
<P>
	After seating is determined, a brass plaque with the senator's  
name is affixed to the desk, Ritchie said. Tradition also calls 
upon senators to carve their names inside the drawers, a way of 
letting senators know who preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the desks have very famous names,'' Ritchie said.  
``Some of them have very obscure names in them. I think it's 
interesting to the senators to open the drawers and realize who sat 
there before them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the body's most senior members have their pick of  
choice seating, a few have opted to remain on the back benches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in his seventh term, sits there  
and, for sentimental reasons, occupies a desk used by his brother, 
John F. Kennedy, until he was elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	Other veterans in the back row include Sens. Slade Gorton,  
R-Wash.; Dick Lugar, R-Ind.; Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., also in his 
seventh term; and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., occupies the desk used by Daniel  
Webster, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate but was a New 
Hampshire native. A 1974 Senate resolution assigned the desk to New 
Hampshire's senior senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, a 1995 Senate resolution linked Jefferson Davis' desk  
to Mississippi's senior senator, currently Republican Thad Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there's the tradition of the candy desk.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George Murphy, R-Calif., started it when he encouraged  
colleagues to partake of the candy stashed in the drawer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie, the Senate historian, said the seat usually goes to the  
most junior Republican, who is obligated to continue providing 
sweets. The occupants ``usually don't stay there for more than a 
Congress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., the current occupant, ``enjoys  
having the responsibility of being the candy senator,'' said his 
spokesman, Robert Traynham. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected in 1994, Santorum has supplied Hershey's chocolates from  
his home state, jelly beans and candy corn.

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Decline in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices charged by producers such as factories,  
food-processing plants and oil refineries edged down 0.1 percent in 
1998, declining for a record second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices plunged 1.2 percent in 1997, the steepest drop in 11  
years, and slipped further in 1998 as the world economic slump 
depressed demand for oil, manufactured goods and farm commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	The two years marked the first back-to-back drops in the Labor  
Department's Producer Price Index since the department began 
compiling it in 1947. However, the brief era of deflation may be 
drawing to a close. Economists are predicting a modest increase 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices will firm in 1999 as the world economy stabilizes, but  
I don't think they'll rise to any significant degree,'' said 
economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, producer prices for finished goods jumped a  
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent, the most in 15 months, driven up 
by a stunning 30.7 percent jump in prices charged by cigarette 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tobacco prices are soaring to pay for the settlement with  
attorneys general in many states,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak 
of Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released late Tuesday, was not scheduled for release  
until today. However, it was inadvertently posted early Tuesday 
afternoon for about an hour on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 
Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second such early release of market-sensitive data  
via the Internet. The last was in November, with job-growth 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement today, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said she was  
``deeply troubled and dismayed'' by the latest slip. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics Commissioner Katharine G. Abraham said it was the 
result of ``a computer programming error.'' She said 40 to 50 saw 
the report during trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Her special assistant, William Parks, said, ``We don't believe  
there was any market impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the year, including December, falling or flat energy  
and food prices have helped offset modest inflation in other goods. 
But in December, that wasn't enough to offset the tobacco rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices fell 2.3 percent in December and food prices  
slipped 0.1 percent. But goods other than food and energy, 
so-called core prices, jumped 1 percent, the most in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, a 1 percent increase in core prices would be enough to  
raise concern at the Federal Reserve and spark market speculation 
over the prospect for an interest-rate increase. But, excluding 
cigarettes, core prices actually fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's largely tobacco prices and that was something we knew  
about. I don't think there's any news here,'' Fed Vice Chairwoman 
Alice Rivlin said on CNN's ``Moneyline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, energy prices plunged 12.1 percent -- including a 34.1  
percent drop for gasoline. Food prices edged 0.1 percent lower for 
the year. Wholesale pork prices fell 26.9 percent and fruit and 
vegetables fell 20.9 percent, offsetting a 10.8 percent increase 
for dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for goods other than food and energy rose 2.4 percent  
last year after showing no change the year before. Sharp currency 
devaluations, primarily in Asia, lowered the prices on imported 
manufactured goods. That, in turn, forced domestic producers to 
match price cuts. Computer prices fell 25.9 percent; home 
electronic equipment, 1.8 percent, and toys, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a shift in the value of the dollar, from an eight-year  
high of 147 yen in August to a 28-month low of 108 yen on Monday, 
may keep prices of imports from falling further. 
</P>
<P>
	A Labor Department report on prices paid by consumers for both  
goods and services in December is scheduled for release Thursday. 
They rose at a 12-year low annual rate of 1.6 percent through the 
first 11 months of the year.

<HEADLINE> Dean Smith Recalls Young Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- The first image Dean Smith had of  
Michael Jordan was of a shy teen-ager sitting on the living room 
floor of his family's home in Wilmington, cradling a miniature 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a beautiful home and there were enough chairs, but I  
remember Michael sitting down on the floor because he had a little 
basketball,'' the former North Carolina coach said. ``I guess he 
didn't want to leave that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan went on to star for the Tar Heels, hitting the  
title-clinching shot as a freshman in the 1982 NCAA championship 
game. He left Chapel Hill after his junior season and was drafted 
by the Chicago Bulls in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Jordan has retired. Smith, who himself retired in 1997 as  
college basketball's winningest coach, said Wednesday he was 
astonished by Jordan's list of achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the national player of the year in 1984, but we never  
dreamed here, 14 or 15 years later, he would accomplish what he's 
accomplished,'' said Smith, who remains close to Jordan. ``I think 
it's remarkable that ever year he improved. He really is special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him now. At this point, he's happy, his teams  
have won and what more could you want from anyone you care about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Black, who assisted on Jordan's game-winning shot in 1982,  
said he had thought that James Worthy, another member of that team, 
had a better shot at stardom than Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell (Jordan) would be good because of how hard he  
was willing to work, but no one could have imagined all this,'' 
Black told The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Doherty, another member of the 1982 championship team and  
now an assistant coach at Kansas, said he knew in May that Jordan 
would retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard he wasn't working in the offseason, it only  
confirmed things because Michael would never go into a season 
unprepared,'' Doherty said. ``He entertained us for many years, and 
for that we should all thank him. The game will sorely miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith wouldn't be surprised if Jordan returned to the sports  
spotlight in another form. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he attempts to be a senior golfer at 50, do not be  
surprised if he is successful,'' Smith said. ``He really got a bad 
rap when he tried baseball. More and more baseball people told me 
he could've done it. It was going to take time but he was 
improving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Jordan's most remarkable characteristic is the way he  
has handled the media scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have so many great memories of him, I couldn't begin to  
start with one,'' Smith said. ``I'm still amazed at how he handled 
something that's impossible to do -- the adoration. It's amazing how 
he survives with so much attention given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hit a clutch putt for me once. I'll remember that, too.''

<HEADLINE>  Sharpe Apologizes for Marino Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After being admonished by his coach and  
77-year-old grandmother, Shannon Sharpe admitted he misspoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, Denver's loquacious tight end, offered a public apology  
Wednesday to Miami quarterback Dan Marino, whom he labeled as ``a 
loser'' following the Broncos' 38-3 victory over the Dolphins in 
last week's AFC playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan, if I offended you, your family, your wife, your kids,  
your mother, your father, your brothers and sisters, I stand before 
you and I sincerely, sincerely apologize,'' Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you feel about me as a player, I can understand.  
Whether you like or dislike me, I can live with that. But I would 
never want you to dislike me or disrespect me as a person. ... I'm 
sure you will get this message as you have all the other messages 
that I have sent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The animosity between Sharpe and Marino began last summer when  
Sharpe was asked to compare Marino with Broncos quarterback and 
1983 NFL Draft classmate John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe suggested Marino's best days are behind him by saying  
Elway ``doesn't want to be like another quarterback I won't name, 
but he's a guy who plays in the southern part of the United States 
who is no longer the player that he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino shot back in September, referring to Sharpe as  
``Stanley,'' and said Elway is the main reason Sharpe has been 
selected to seven Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Things remained quiet until last Saturday when Denver eliminated  
the Dolphins from the AFC playoffs. After the game, Sharpe walked 
into a group of reporters and declared: ``Don't ask me about Marino 
because I don't talk about losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe's comment drew criticism from Broncos coach Mike  
Shanahan, who said he was disappointed in his veteran tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Sharpe's grandmother, Mary Porter, who helped raise Sharpe,  
scolded him during a phone call earlier this week. She said 
Marino's feelings were probably hurt and that Sharpe should never 
say such mean things about anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't calling Dan Marino a loser,'' Sharpe explained  
Wednesday. ``I was saying I didn't want to talk about anybody that 
had lost the game, so therefore I didn't want to talk about Dan 
Marino or anybody else on that ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is the NFL's career passing leader with 58,913 yards and  
is sure to be a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee. Though he is 
still without a Super Bowl ring after 16 seasons, Marino's resume 
is hardly lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got misconstrued,'' Sharpe said, ``or the way I said it may  
have seemed that I was calling Dan Marino a loser, and in no shape, 
way or form would I ever do that.''

<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- The next best place to see Michael  
Jordan in action will be on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day he retired from basketball, Jordan committed to play  
in the pro-am portion of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, organizers

<P>
	The five-round tournament will be played Jan. 20-24 on four  
courses in the Palm Springs area. Fred Couples is the defending 
champion. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Michael Jordan Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The NBA's greatest player made it official today.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls after 13 seasons,  
six championships and countless soaring dunks. But he left open the 
slightest possibility that he might return one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, I'm exhausted. I don't feel I have a challenge,''  
Jordan said at a news conference at the United Center, where a 
bronze statue of him stands outside. ``Physically, I feel great. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect time for me to walk away from the game. I'm  
at peace with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he was ``99.9 percent'' sure he would never return  
and added, ``You can read that for what it's worth. ... I'm very 
secure in my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed why he wouldn't say he was 100 percent certain,  
Jordan said: ``Because it's my 1 percent and not yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Jordan's retirement broke late Monday, but he had  
refused to comment until today. After leading the Bulls to their 
sixth championship in June, Jordan said he would make an 
announcement on his future only once the NBA lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The players and owners reached a deal last week to save what's  
left of the season, and everyone's next question was whether Jordan 
would return. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan era included five MVP awards, 10 scoring titles, 12  
All-Star appearances and many magic moments, from last-second shots 
to phenomenal scoring outbursts. More important, Jordan had charm 
and a nice-guy image that earned him multimillion-dollar 
sponsorship deals and reached even non-sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to be the best basketball player I could be,'' said  
Jordan, who was joined by his wife, Juanita, Bulls chairman Jerry 
Reinsdorf and NBA commissioner David Stern. ``I've had a great 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan alluded to his first retirement in 1993, when he briefly  
pursued a professional baseball career before returning late in the 
1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we do this again, a second time,'' he said to open the  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Bulls unveiled a banner in the rafters from  
Jordan's first retirement. It said ``Jordan 1984-1993'' -- but it 
will now have to be updated. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had lost his desire to play, he said: ``The desire  
is always going to be there.'' But he said he wanted to make sure 
that the desire was there ``not one-fourth of the time I step onto 
the court, but every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who had a bandage on his right index finger, said he  
severed a tendon while trying to cut a cigar and would need 
surgery. But he said he had already decided to retire before the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to enjoy life and do things I've never done  
before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he looked forward to being a parent and would ``live  
vicariously through my kids,'' whether or not they played 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life will take a change,'' said Jordan, adding that he also  
will tend to his many business interests. He makes an estimated $45 
million a year from endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Added his wife: ``I see Michael doing a lot more carpooling.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf called Jordan's announcement ``a tough day for  
basketball fans all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day I hoped would never come,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Countered Stern: ``I disagree with Jerry. This is a great day.  
The greatest basketball player in the history of the game is 
getting the opportunity to retire with the grace that described his 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked after the news conference how the league would survive  
after the nasty six-month lockout and Jordan's retirement, Stern 
said: ``We're going to be in fine shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House today, President Clinton said Jordan had ``a  
remarkable set of qualities of mind, body and spirit ... who always 
expected to do whatever it was he tried to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's appropriate that the sports fans around America  
take a day or two to `Ooh' and `Ahh' and hold their breath again 
and be glad again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, 35, said he hoped the Bulls would re-sign teammate  
Scottie Pippen but added that was only his opinion and that he 
didn't know what decisions the team would make. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set high standards around here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan met with a few teammates at his home Monday and told them  
the thought of playing an abbreviated, 50-game season wasn't enough 
of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jordan goes out as he always wanted -- on top. His  
last-second shot -- the last one he ever took -- gave the Bulls a 
victory over the Utah Jazz and their sixth title. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a way to go out as an athlete, and that's the way to  
go out,'' said B.J. Armstrong, one of about a dozen players working 
out Tuesday at the Berto Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who now plays with Charlotte, is a good friend of  
Jordan's and a teammate on Chicago's first three NBA championship 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out on top, he made the last shot, he made all the  
right plays. He's had a fabulous career and everything you could 
ever ask as an athlete, he's done. He had a chance to leave and 
this was the chance,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Bach, an assistant coach on three of the Bulls'  
championship teams, praised Jordan for not only his skill, but for 
the joy he brought to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never looked like he'd been sentenced by a judge to play  
basketball,'' Bach said. ``I've seen too many athletes not go out 
at the right time. They stay and struggle and lose some of the 
dignity they are entitled to.''

<HEADLINE> Bias Suits Filed Against Prudential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Ten former employees of Prudential Insurance  
Company of America have filed separate federal lawsuits that allege 
sex, race and age discrimination at Prudential offices in the 
Minneapolis area. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, filed Jan. 4 in U.S. District Court in  
Minneapolis, allege that some women were subjected in 1995 and 1996 
to unwanted physical contact, including kissing, and were exposed 
to crude computer screen savers, sexually explicit games and 
photocopies and pornographic pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Some female sales agents claim they were promised extra help or  
better sales regions in exchange for sexual favors. They also say 
they were sometimes denied promotions because of their gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the cases contend that Prudential offices in the Twin  
Cities and surrounding suburbs failed to protect women from sexual 
harassment and discrimination, seven of the 10 plaintiffs are men. 
</P>
<P>
	The men claim either racial or age discrimination but also say  
they were retaliated against for complaining about a sexually 
hostile workplace for women. Some of the men were sales managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob DeFillippo, vice president of corporate affairs at  
Prudential's New Jersey headquarters, said ``Prudential has a 
longstanding and very explicit policy against any kind of sexual 
harassment in the workplace. We take it very seriously, and we 
enforce it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not comment on the specifics of the lawsuits.  
</P>
<P>
	The suits were filed following a change in federal law that  
previously bound securities brokers and insurance agents to 
arbitration in the event of a workplace dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal change on Jan. 1 gave employees registered with the  
National Association of Securities Dealers the right to sue their 
employers on work-related issues. The cases were filed in U.S. 
District Court in Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Collapse at Campbell's Soup Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPOLEON, Ohio (AP) -- A snow-covered roof at a Campbell's soup  
plant collapsed today, slightly injuring five workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the employees were in good condition at Henry County  
Hospital in Napoleon, hospital spokeswoman Donna Masney said. The 
conditions of the three others weren't available, although fire and 
company officials said the injuries were not serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof collapsed at about 10 a.m. over a section of the plant  
that makes vegetable juices, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting fire Capt. Tom Bergstedt said ice and snow piled on the  
roof likely caused the collapse. Northwest Ohio has received about 
16 inches of snow and ice in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory, which makes soup and vegetable juices, is one of  
Campbell's largest in the country, employing more than 2,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Napoleon is about 40 miles southwest of Toledo.

<HEADLINE> Magic Calls Jordan 'Incredible' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Calling Michael Jordan ``the most  
incredible athlete I've ever seen,'' Magic Johnson said Wednesday 
that Jordan's retirement is a blow to pro basketball in the wake of 
the labor lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an icon, a one-man show. It's going to be a devastating  
loss. It's a loss for basketball, but for kids, too'' in terms of 
not being able to see a superb role model in action, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was the dominant player of the 1980s with five NBA  
championship Los Angeles Laker teams, before Jordan's Chicago Bulls 
and their six NBA titles in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's won one more championship than I did. He'll be rubbing it  
in my face for eternity,'' Johnson laughed as he talked with 
reporters outside the offices of Magic Johnson Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a part-owner of the Lakers, thinks the era of a  
superstar dominating the league ends with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think one person can carry the baton and lead the  
league, it'll have to be the teams. ... The Lakers have to become 
the team they are supposed to be. Indiana and New York are going to 
have to come up,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like when the Lakers dominated, and the Celtics  
dominated, we have to turn to somebody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball needs to develop new role models as well, Johnson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to continue to be the good guys until the young guys  
break through. Maybe it will be Kobe Bryant or Shaquille O'Neal or 
Grant Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to phone Jordan Wednesday night or Thursday  
to talk, and hopes to have some pickup games. Both were part of the 
U.S. ``Dream Team'' in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Johnson's not about to talk himself into 1-on-1 action  
against Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's his game. If we played 10 times he'd win 10 times. My  
game was leadership, and passing. He can't match my passes. But I 
can't score 60 points. I can't compete against him dunking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping he would stay just one more year to help these  
young NBA players learn how to be a true professional,'' Johnson 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA has to have a great year, 50 games,'' Johnson said, to  
regain fans and respect in recovering from the labor dispute that 
will keep the league idle until next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have any incidents, players getting into trouble. ...  
I feel sad because we won't be able to watch the superstar and the 
best player anymore. It's really disappointing because of the 
lockout. But I'm happy for him because he found peace with himself, 
and will have more time with his wife and kids.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura will not be ferried  
about in a luxury sedan like those wimpy other governors. 
</P>
<P>
	The former pro wrestler has chosen a full-size luxury sport  
utility vehicle, the Lincoln Navigator, as his official car. He 
announced the choice Tuesday after visiting the assembly line in 
St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt I wanted something comfortable and practical,'' he  
said, noting Minnesota's snowy winters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he needs the extra room because he's bigger and taller,  
and joked that he wanted extra strong shocks ``for running over 
reporters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've assured me I can be accommodated,'' he said with a  
smile.

<HEADLINE> Fans Worldwide Mourn Jordan Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Once again proving his worldwide  
fame, Michael Jordan's retirement was met with remorse outside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA will never be the same again without Michael Jordan,''  
moaned Alexis Lanado, an employee at a hotel in Manila, the capital 
of the basketball-crazed Philippines. ``We LOVE him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jordan announced he was hanging up his Air Jordan  
shoes, his impact on the world of sport, fashion and merchandising 
is likely to remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Even where basketball has little following, his retirement was  
given the kind of page-one coverage that American sports seldom 
receive outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan Retires! Shock Felt Around the World,'' headlined  
Tokyo's Nikkan Sports newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Several papers said the news was bigger than U.S. President Bill  
Clinton's impeachment trial, or suggested Americans would rather 
see Clinton retire than Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shattering retirement announcement will even drive Bill  
Clinton's sex scandals off America's front pages,'' announced 
London's tabloid The Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The response indicated both the huge effect Jordan has had in  
popularizing the American sport, and the economic impact of his 
marketing clout. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, stocks of Nike subcontractors Pou Chen Corp. and Feng  
Tay Enterprise Corp. both dove on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 
anticipation of falling sales of Air Jordan shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made $15 billion for the U.S. economy since 1984, and now  
he's caused Nike share prices to plunge,'' headlined the Sydney 
Morning Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Philippines, many poor teen-agers must play on makeshift  
neighborhood courts either barefoot or in flip-flops. But for those 
who can afford them, Air Jordan shoes are de rigueur. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who makes an estimated $45 million a year from  
endorsements, helped lead a U.S. worldwide cultural tidal wave that 
included basketball, fashion, movies and TV and increased American 
influence in countries from Australia to Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Several papers compared Jordan to other universally known  
American products like Coca-Cola or Mickey Mouse and noted his 
popularity -- particularly in places where the sport is hardly 
followed -- was not restricted to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``His popularity is unprecedented and without limit,'' said  
Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport in a front page editorial. ``He's way 
better known than basketball itself because he goes beyond its 
limits: Jordan is myth, poetry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan received the highest possible accolade in a world in  
which soccer dwarfs the NBA: He was likened to legendary soccer 
star Pele. 
</P>
<P>
	For a comparable retirement you ``have to go a long time back to  
when Pele was the God of soccer,'' Australian National Basketball 
League general manager Bill Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to affect everybody around the world  
because Michael was the ambassador of basketball,'' said Tim Cone, 
coach of the Philippine national basketball team at the Asian 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's number, 23, ``was the number everybody wanted to  
wear,'' Cone said. ``He combined the fundamentals, the desire to 
play, the great physical talents, the ability to get the team 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In countries like Britain, where the NBA has a tiny following,  
much of the coverage was about the millions Jordan has earned. 
Swiss papers took a similar approach and said he deserved every 
penny. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's retirement even made waves in China, where the NBA and  
Jordan have a large following among China's sports-crazy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 1,000 people in nine Chinese cities conducted last  
May named Jordan as the second-most widely known American after 
Thomas Edison. Similar polls in France and Australia have found him 
better known than local sports stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's retirement was followed in the Middle East -- although  
basketball seldom is. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basketball legend announces his retirement,'' said a  
headline in Egypt's Al-Ahrar daily, describing him as ``the 
greatest player the world had ever seen.''	   In Taiwan, Chinese Professional Basketball League players were 
unanimous in the opinion that Jordan quit too early, citing his 
freedom from injuries and stellar performance last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the least, Jordan should be able to play another year or  
two,'' said Lee Yun-hsiang of the Hung Fu Rams. ``On top of the 
player-management dispute, his retirement really rubs salt into the 
wounds of the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian's Los Angeles correspondent, Robert Lusetich,  
said Jordan retired ``in a league of his own'' and at the peak of 
his profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a sadness, but also a spiritual symmetry to it; he  
had changed our times irrevocably and taken us to the end of the 
century, and now we are on our own,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Lucent To Buy Ascend Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc., the huge  
telecommunications equipment maker, is buying Ascend Communications 
Inc. for about $20 billion in stock in a deal that could reshape 
the market for telecom equipment and speed the growth of telephone 
calls on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced today, should also fill gaps in Lucent's  
product line with the addition of Ascend's equipment designed to 
help telecommuters hook up to their headquarters, and to assist 
businesses in creating their own computer and telephone networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very strategic fit,'' said Liza Henderson, director of  
consulting for TeliChoice Inc., telecom consulting firm in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, spun off from the AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1996 and based in Murray  
Hill, N.J., is a pioneer in telecommunications research and a 
venerable supplier of traditional equipment used by telephone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascend, which is based in Alameda, Calif., is a major supplier  
of computer networking gear, and is expected to provide the 
expertise in Internet-style communications technology Lucent needs 
to compete in the $200 billion-a-year telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascend competes in a field dominated by Cisco Systems, the  
networking company that has supplied about three quarters of the 
nuts and bolts used to build the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of Lucent's acquisition of Ascend had been circulating  
for several days, but the two companies have been talking for more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lucent helped adapt telephone lines for online data  
transmission, Cisco has led the charge toward providing video and 
audio capabilities on the Internet and computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	With both Internet access providers and cable television  
companies gearing up to provide telephone service, Lucent stands to 
fall behind in a lucrative market that its technology helped make 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich McGinn, chairman and chief executive of Lucent, said the  
deal gives Lucent a ``broader and more powerful portfolio'' on 
developing the next generation of networks for delivering phone 
calls, handling data transfers and providing video services. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced today, each share of Ascend will be  
exchanged for 0.825 shares of Lucent. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Lucent's close of $107.87 1/2 a share on Tuesday, the deal  
would value each Ascend share at about $89.82, or 19.9 percent more 
than Ascend's closing price of $74.93 3/4 a share Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lucent's stock was down $4.81 1/4 at $103.06 1/4 a share in late  
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange at a time when 
stocks were broadly and sharply lower in response to economic 
turmoil in Brazil. Ascend's shares shot up $4.81 1/4 to $79.75 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second deal this week for Lucent. On Monday, Lucent  
announced it was paying $1.5 billion in stock for Kenan Systems 
Corp., which makes software for billing and customer service.

<HEADLINE> Judge Asks About Microsoft Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust case asked a government witness whether the company is 
following a strategy of ``delayed gratification'' by keeping its 
software prices low. 
</P>
<P>
	As the government prepared to end its case after 10 weeks at  
trial, the unexpected question posed Tuesday by U.S. District Judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson appeared to undermine a key Microsoft 
defense: If the company wields such power in the high-tech 
industry, why doesn't it raise prices more? 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's first witness, economist Richard Schmalensee, who is  
expected to take the stand today, told the judge previously in 
written testimony that if the company wielded monopoly power, it 
would charge computer makers ``at least 16 times'' more for its 
Windows operating system than its current prices, which are a 
closely guarded secret, but believed to be $45 to $65. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Stephen Houck, the lead lawyer for the 19 states  
suing Microsoft with the Justice Department, called Schmalensee 
``one of the only economists -- one of the few people in the country 
-- who refuses to acknowledge that Microsoft has a monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants to convince the judge that it doesn't possess  
monopoly power because many of the government's claims of 
predatory, anti-competitive behavior hinge on that definition. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge asked the final government witness whether  
Microsoft might be strategically setting prices for Windows lower 
than it might otherwise with its eye on future profits. He called 
it ``a concept of delayed gratification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As more and more people become interested in using PCs, they  
will buy PCs so long as the overall cost is something they can 
afford. Otherwise, they'll buy a larger television set,'' Jackson 
said, asking whether Microsoft might be looking to long-term 
profits ``by keeping its contribution to the cost of a PC low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's entirely possible, your honor,'' answered economist  
Franklin Fisher, who was expected to finish testifying today. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally bundled its  
Internet browser software free into newer versions of Windows to 
``crush'' rival Netscape, whose own popular browser is a direct 
competitor and earned tens of millions of dollars when it dominated 
the browser market. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers say Microsoft was motivated by the fear that  
Internet software eventually might assume many roles that Windows 
now performs as a computer's central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher asserted that Microsoft's ability to raise prices ``might  
be exercised later. To assume a monopolist with power will not 
always exercise the power is to rely on the benevolence of the 
monopolist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to question Fisher again briefly today,  
marking the end of the government case and the start of Microsoft 
calling witnesses. The trial is expected to last until March. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare appearance at the courthouse, U.S. Assistant Attorney  
General Joel I. Klein lauded government lawyers for showing a 
``pattern of anti-competitive practices'' that resulted in 
``restricted consumer choice, stifled innovation, and led to higher 
prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to e-mails introduced during the trial, Klein also  
cited ``an extraordinary mountain of evidence that this company did 
not compete on the merits.''

<HEADLINE> Smokeless Tobacco Revenues Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Makers of smokeless tobacco took in about  
$1.82 billion in revenues in 1997, up from $1.74 billion in 1995, 
the Federal Trade Commission reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its biennial report to Congress on smokeless tobacco, the  
commission also found the industry spent an all-time high on 
advertising their products. Expenses for promoting smokeless 
tobacco products reached $150.4 million in 1997. This represents an 
18 percent increase from 1995, when expenditures for advertising 
were about $127.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Although revenues were up, the total number of pounds of  
smokeless tobacco sold by manufacturers fell in 1997 to its lowest 
level since the commission began collecting data in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, in its seventh report to Congress on the matter,  
offered no recommendations on legislation, but said it would review 
its own regulations on smokeless tobacco this year to see if any 
changes are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	More money was spent in 1996 on public entertainment such as  
sponsorship of a sporting event than on any other expense. In 1997, 
public entertainment expenses came in second behind retail value 
added promotions, such as offers for customers to ``buy one, get 
one free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on magazine advertising reached an all-time high in  
1996 but declined in 1997. Expenses to distribute free samples of 
smokeless tobacco decreased, while outdoor billboard advertising 
expenditures went up. 
</P>
<P>
	Moist snuff topped loose leaf/chewing tobacco as the leading  
seller of smokeless tobacco products in terms of total pounds sold. 
With sales of 55.28 million pounds in 1997, moist snuff had 
revenues of $1.40 billion in 1997. Advertising and promotional 
expenditures for moist snuff -- at $103.6 million in 1997 -- exceeded 
expenditures for all other types of smokeless tobacco combined.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reassure Financial Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton tried to restore confidence  
in badly shaken financial markets on Wednesday after an abrupt 
devaluation of Brazil's currency called into question his strategy 
for dealing with the 18-month-old global economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he and members of his economic team were monitoring  
the crisis in Brazil closely and had been in contact with Brazilian 
authorities, the International Monetary Fund and U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil, with whom we have  
worked on so many important things around the world, carry forward 
with its economic reform plan and succeed, and we certainly hope 
that they will,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America accounts for 20 percent of U.S. export sales and  
increased trouble there could add to the burden of American 
factories and farmers who already have seen their Asian markets 
shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, with the financial crisis threatening to claim Brazil  
as its next victim, the administration convinced the IMF to try a 
new approach -- offering bailout money up front as a way of keeping 
nervous investors from fleeing developing nations rather than 
offering assistance only after a country's economy has been 
leveled. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil became the first test case of that strategy in November  
when the IMF put together a $41.5 billion bailout package, 
including $5 billion from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort did buy time and along with three interest rate cuts  
from the Federal Reserve helped stock markets in the United States 
and other countries recover from massive losses suffered after the 
August collapse of Russia's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been renewed turmoil in Brazil in recent weeks,  
however, as President Fernando Henrique Cardoso ran into roadblocks 
in starting the economic belt-tightening he pledged in return for 
the IMF money. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt resignation of the head of the Brazilian bank and the  
effective devaluation of Brazil's currency by 7.6 percent sent a 
jolt through financial markets Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial 
average lost more than 250 points in the first hour of trading 
before recouping some of those loses to close down 123.48 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists warned that more turbulence is likely.  
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's test case is looking shaky right now,''  
said Clyde Prestowitz, head of the Economic Strategy Institute 
think tank. ``The problem is that the Brazilians haven't been able 
to get their act together and that is posing a lot of real dangers 
for the rest of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said the new investor doubts about emerging  
markets could become serious enough to trigger more currency 
devaluations both in other Latin American nations and also in the 
Asian countries that have already been battered. They also could 
affect China, which so far has avoided devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, can Brazil hold the line or will its problems  
get worse and trigger further devaluations elsewhere?'' said David 
Wyss, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Saxon, R-N.J., a leading IMF critic, said the  
resumption of the Brazilian crisis shows the administration's new 
approach doesn't work and Congress erred in approving $18.5 billion 
in additional IMF support last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that providing a front-loaded bailout has not been  
any more successful than the previous strategy,'' Saxon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials, informed by Brazilian authorities of  
their intention to devalue Tuesday night, spent Wednesday on the 
telephone to other rich G-7 nations and developing countries in an 
effort to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said what's needed is  
``implementation of a strong, credible economic program'' by 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	But private economists questioned whether Brazil would be any  
more successful than other nations in standing up to nervous 
investors intent on fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York,  
predicted that Brazil's troubles would spill over into other Latin 
American nations, pushing many into recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Schott, an economist at the Institute for International  
Economics, said he was more hopeful, believing the events could 
serve as a lesson to opponents of Cardoso's effort.

<HEADLINE> Four Boxers Considered for Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Four boxers were considered for what is supposed to be the  
supporting role in Mike Tyson's latest comeback Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	And the winner was Francois Botha, who said he's getting $1.98  
million to fight Tyson in a 10-round pay-per-view match in the MGM 
Grand Garden in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people also say he going to get a beating.  
</P>
<P>
	The people involved with Tyson's career, of course, don't want  
to see him beaten. A third straight loss on the heels of his 
disqualification for biting Evander Holyfield's ears would cook 
boxing's Golden Goose. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand they don't want a repeat of the one-round  
Peter McNeeley fiasco in Tyson's first fight after he was released 
from prison in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shelly (Finkel, Tyson's boxing advisory) gave me a list, and  
from that we mutually agreed on Botha,'' said Jay Larkin, in charge 
of boxing for Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The other names on the list were Vaughn Bean, an excellent boxer  
who gave Holyfield a good fight; Axel Schulz, a tall German who 
moves well; and Brian Nielsen, a towering Dane with all the 
movement of a statue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want another Peter McNeeley for Mike's first fight  
back,'' Finkel said. ``Botha is credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, an 8-1 underdog, has a 39-1 record, with 24 knockouts. He  
outpointed Schulz for the vacant IBF heavyweight title in 1995, but 
he tested positive for a steroid and was stripped of the title. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Africa native's loss came when he was stopped in the  
12th round by Michael Moorer in a bid for the IBF title in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who resides at Newport Beach, Calif., and has lived in  
the United States for nine years, fought twice in 1997, scoring a 
10-round technical knockout and winning a 12-round decision. Both 
of his fights last year ended in the first round, meaning he's 
fought less than two full rounds in 19 months. 
</P>
<P>
	That inactivity had to make Botha an attractive opponent for  
Tyson, who also will be fighting for the first time in about 19 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout also will be Tyson's first on a new four-fight deal  
with the MGM Grand, and he would like to have four fights this 
year, capped by a third fight with Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Showtime still has a multiple-fight deal with Tyson. Larkin  
would not say how many fights, only that ``it is a substantial 
number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin wants Tyson to fight again on April 24 and his opponent  
``depends on how he looks Saturday night. If he looks awesome, 
plans are for stepping up the level of competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third fight with Holyfield, who won the WBA title by stopping  
Tyson in the 11th round Nov. 9, 1996, would be a huge money fight, 
especially if Holyfield becomes undisputed champion by beating 
Lennox Lewis on March 13 in Madison Square Garden in New York. 
Holyfield also holds the IBF title, while Lewis is WBC champion. 
</P>
<P>
	A third Holyfield-Tyson bout would be big even if Holyfield  
loses to Lewis, but in that case Holyfield might not want another 
Tyson match. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson-Holyfield III would be on SET, Showtime's pay-per-view  
arm. Lewis, however, is tied to HBO, which probably would keep him 
from defending the undisputed championship against Tyson. The 
Holyfield-Lewis fight will be a pay-per-view presentation of TVKO, 
owned by Time Warner, also the operator of HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll be selling Italian ices in hell before we let Mike  
Tyson fight Lennox Lewis anywhere but on Showtime,'' Larkin said.

<HEADLINE> Saturn-Bound Spacecraft Has Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The plutonium-powered Cassini spacecraft  
went into a safe mode this week when it detected a possible error 
in its orientation en route to Saturn, NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The operations team was in contact with the spacecraft, which  
sensed the possible problem on Monday and triggered a program 
designed to halt all non-critical activity and maintain a 
communications link with Earth, a JPL statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini, NASA's biggest and most complex interplanetary probe,  
is on a $3.4 billion mission to explore the ringed planet. It was 
launched on Oct. 15 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., over the objections 
of anti-nuclear protesters who feared what might happen if the 
rocket exploded while carrying Cassini and its 72 pounds of 
extremely poisonous plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft is on a roundabout trip through the solar system  
in which it will use gravity assists from planets to reach Saturn 
in July 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The JPL statement said that at about 3 p.m. Monday, the  
spacecraft was in the midst of an instrument checkout exercise when 
it sensed a potential error. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft used its safe program to begin using minimum  
power and pointing its 12-foot antenna toward the sun to shade the 
rest of the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Communication with the spacecraft was being conducted with a  
low-gain antenna. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini Program Manager Bob Mitchell said engineering data from  
the spacecraft are being transmitted to Earth to help engineers 
pinpoint what caused Cassini to enter the safe mode. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he expects Cassini will be taken out of safe mode  
later this week after the problem has been identified and data 
thoroughly analyzed.

<HEADLINE> Murder-Mystery a Real-Life Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Md. (AP) -- A groom sips poisoned champagne and dies. A  
husband is found dead in his smoke-filled hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly and Stephen Hricko watched the first scenario unfold on  
stage in a murder-mystery play last Valentine's Day weekend. Within 
hours, the latter fate really befell Hricko -- and now his wife is 
standing trial on murder and arson charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say the evidence is inconclusive and that  
Hricko, a 35-year-old golf course superintendent, was depressed and 
a suicide risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Robert Dean told jurors that Hricko's death was  
nothing more than cold-blooded murder at the hands of an unhappy 
wife who stood to collect on a $200,000 life insurance policy and 
had talked to colleagues about killing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing more that Kimberly Hricko wanted than to get  
rid of her husband,'' Dean said in opening statements Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene of the crime, prosecutors contend, was a resort in the  
quaint waterfront town of St. Michaels. The Hrickos had been having 
marital problems and went on what was supposed to have been a 
romantic Valentine's Day weekend getaway. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple went to a campy ``Mafia Wedding'' whodunit, in which  
a groom sips poisoned champagne and drops dead at his wedding 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	After attending the play, the couple fought and he began  
drinking heavily, Mrs. Hricko contends. She said she left to drive 
to a friend's home in Easton but got lost. When she returned, 
around 1 a.m., she saw smoke and went to the front desk for help. 
</P>
<P>
	A hotel guest and a worker broke into the cottage and dragged  
out Hricko's body in the early morning hours of Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire appeared to have started on or near the bed but had  
burned out. 
</P>
<P>
	One cigar was missing from a new pack, and Mrs. Hricko told  
investigators that her husband smoked when he drank. 
</P>
<P>
	But no alcohol was found in his system -- and friends told police  
he didn't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed Hricko was already dead when the fire started.  
The report said he was probably poisoned, although the medical 
examiner did not suggest how. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge William Horne ruled Tuesday that the jury may not  
hear testimony from an arson investigator that the fire was 
deliberately set. The defense had argued that Deputy State Fire 
Marshal Mike Mulligan did not rule out all possible accidental 
causes of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the Hrickos' marriage had been in trouble. The  
couple, who were raising a daughter, now 9, had been attending 
counseling sessions. According to court documents, Mrs. Hricko had 
asked her husband for a divorce, but he refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean alleges that Mrs. Hricko, a surgical technician, had  
offered a co-worker $50,000 to arrange his murder in early 1998 and 
weeks later confided to a friend that she had been planning to give 
her husband a drug that would paralyze him. 
</P>
<P>
	She was ``progressively digging herself into a hole of  
violence,'' said Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Harry Trainor suggested Hricko may have been  
suicidal. The lawyer also said Hricko worked with toxic pesticides 
that may have contributed to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``No medical doctor, pathologist or toxicologist can reliably  
tell us the cause of Stephen Hricko's death,'' Trainor said.

<HEADLINE> Lucent To Buy Ascend for $18.7B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc. is buying Ascend  
Communications Inc. in an $18.7 billion stock deal that reflects 
the growing influence of the Internet on the telecommunications 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	As the lines blur between telephone, cable and the Internet, the  
companies that make equipment for these industries are quickly 
pairing up. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which had been widely expected, was announced  
Wednesday and followed Lucent's $1.5 billion agreement earlier this 
week to purchase Kenan Systems Corp., which makes software for 
billing and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent is the world's No. 1 phone equipment maker. Ascend is a  
major supplier of computer networking gear, and is expected to 
provide the expertise in Internet-style communications technology 
Lucent needs to better compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real thing that's happened is the emergence of the  
Internet and data transmission,'' said John Zahurancik, vice 
president of international telecommunications for Strategis, a 
consulting firm in Washington. The Lucent-Ascend deal signals ``how 
important data networking is to the world of telecommunications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring that point, Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd., the  
world's second-largest maker of phone equipment, announced 
separately Wednesday that it would eliminate 8,000 jobs and sell 
plants over the next three years to focus its business on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While most U.S. consumers take for granted that they can pick up  
a phone and easily call anywhere in the world, soon it will be just 
as effortless for a business to send e-mail, files or video. 
</P>
<P>
	The market is lucrative and growing.  
</P>
<P>
	The $400 billion networking communications industry is expected  
to expand to $650 billion by 2001, said Rich McGinn, Lucent's 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying Ascend fills gaps in Lucent's product line with the  
addition of Ascend's equipment designed to help telecommuters hook 
up to their headquarters, and to assist businesses create their own 
computer and telephone networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent and Ascend also are working on equipment that allows  
consumers and businesses to make local and long-distance phone 
calls over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very strategic fit,'' said Liza Henderson, director of  
consulting for TeliChoice Inc., a telecom consulting firm in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk, however, as with many mergers, is that Ascend's  
employees will defect to competitors or start their own firms. 
Ascend, which is based in Alameda, Calif., had its own problem with 
fleet-footed employees when it bought Cascade Communications Corp. 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a war for talent around the world,'' acknowledged Dan  
Stanzione, chief operating officer of Lucent. But, he said, ``We're 
getting our fair share and then some. ... They want to work for 
market leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mory Ejabat, 48, Ascend's president and chief executive officer,  
will stay on for a six- to 12- month transition period, and then 
leave the company. The acquisition is expected to close in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent plans to create a new Broadband Networks Group, which  
will include Ascend's operations, Kenan Systems, as well as 
Lucent's data, optical, and communications software groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of Lucent's acquisition of Ascend had been circulating  
for several days, but top-level negotiations started last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced Wednesday, each share of Ascend will be  
exchanged for 0.825 shares of Lucent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's stock fell $3.62 1/2 to $104.25 on the New York Stock  
Exchange in a market that was unsettled by Brazil's financial 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	That values each Ascend share at $86, or 14.8 percent more than  
Ascend's closing price of $74.93 3/4 a share Tuesday, before the deal 
was announced. Ascend's shares rose $5.37 1/2 Wednesday to $80.31 1/4 on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Markets Shudder on Brazil Bank News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's central banker  
unexpectedly resigned Wednesday and his successor devalued the 
currency by 7.6 percent, roiling world financial markets. Many 
feared the economic contagion could spread through Latin America 
and even threaten the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street reacted sharply after the announcement that Central  
Bank chief Gustavo Franco had stepped down, but recovered half its 
losses by the end of trading. Investors worry that if Brazil falls, 
Latin America's largest economy and most populous country could 
drag others in the region into the maelstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2,000 American businesses operate in Brazil,  
including such giants as IBM, Coca Cola, Ford Motor Co. and General 
Motors Corp. U.S. banks have a $27 billion stake in Brazil, and 
weak operations overseas could pinch profits back home. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton consulted with the IMF and the  
G-7 group of wealthy nations, saying: ``We have a strong interest 
in seeing Brazil ... carry forward with its economic reform plan 
and succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just a day earlier, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin listed  
Brazil as among his chief concerns, along with the financial mess 
in Russia and Japan's continuing struggles to right its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's first order of business was the announcement by new  
Central Bank chief Francisco Lopes to allow the Brazilian currency, 
the real, to trade in a wider band against the dollar. His move 
effectively devalued the currency by nearly 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, opened an  
hour late because of Franco's resignation and plunged 10 percent 
within minutes. It closed down 5 percent Wednesday. The smaller Rio 
de Janeiro exchange lost 5.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged as much as  
261.58, but based on preliminary calculations it regained nearly 
half that to close at 9,349.56, down 125.12. Markets in Mexico, 
Europe and elsewhere were also sharply off. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso cut short his vacation on  
the Atlantic coast and flew back to Brasilia, the capital. Finance 
Minister Pedro Malan canceled a trip to Portugal because of the 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso, who was overwhelmingly re-elected last October to a  
second four-year-term, went on national television to reassure 
investors and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government will honor all its domestic and foreign  
contracts, always, because that is the basis of reliability,'' he 
said. ``Rules are made to be followed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a special session late Wednesday, the Senate approved a  
presidential decree raising corporate income taxes, a measure 
expected to yield $3.8 billion this year. A measure reducing 
long-term interest to 12 percent a year from 19 percent, was also 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil has been unable to calm the anxiety that has immersed  
it since August, when it seemed the government would have trouble 
covering a $65 billion spending deficit and might default on debt 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, investors have pulled some $40 billion out of the  
country. Reserves have plunged to around $35 billion -- and another 
$1.2 billion left on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to save the region's biggest domino, international  
lenders in November came up with a $41.5 billion aid package. But 
the money depends on Brazil's ability to cut the deficit by $23 
billion in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gov. Itamar Franco of Minas Gerais, Brazil's  
third-wealthiest state, shook those prospects by suspending debt 
payments to the federal government for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cardoso, who succeeded Itamar Franco as president in  
1994, has an arsenal of weapons to guarantee payment, the 
moratorium raised doubts about whether he has the political support 
to pass reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying the central bank switch is a bitter debate over  
interest rates. Gustavo Franco had defended high rates to attract 
foreign capital and protect reserves. But he was under fire from 
businessmen and unions, who blamed the policy for strangling growth 
and raising unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco cited his weariness and ``chiefly'' professional reasons  
for stepping down after five years in public service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to give room for new people ... to consolidate the  
'Real Plan,''' he said, referring to Brazil's 1994 anti-inflation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The new person is Lopes, a respected economist.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has a lot of credibility both in Brazil and abroad,'' said  
Luciana Fagundes, an economist at Lloyds Bank in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes announced that Brazil would widen the band within which  
the real trades against the dollar. The new band is 1.20 to 1.32 
reals, compared to 1.12-1.22 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, the bank will allow the dollar to float within  
the band, instead of keeping it within a much-smaller 
``mini-band.'' On Wednesday, the real rose to 1.32 to the dollar, 
up from 1.2114 a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Lopes said the real -- which is widely considered  
to be overvalued -- would slip 12-15 percent against the dollar, 
compared to about 7.5 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The change means a dollar will buy more reals and make Brazilian  
goods cheaper, hopefully reducing a $6.3 billion trade deficit as 
well as interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only way to attract foreign investors without  
relying on high interest rates,'' said Rodrigo Barros, a trader at 
Banco Cidade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very healthy,'' added Horacio Lafer Piva, president of  
the powerful Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Legal Brief -1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from President Clinton's legal brief responding to  
impeachment charges: 
</P>
<P>
	``The Articles of Impeachment that have been exhibited to the  
Senate fall far short of what the Founding Fathers had in mind when 
they placed in the hands of the Congress the power to impeach and 
remove a president from office. They fall far short of what the 
American people demand be shown and proven before their democratic 
choice is reversed. And they even fall far short of what a prudent 
prosecutor would require before presenting a case to a judge or 
jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the will of the people be overruled and the president  
of the United States be removed from office because two people have 
a different recollection of the details of a wrongful relationship 
-- which the president has admitted? That is what the House of 
Representatives asks the Senate to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing said in this Trial Memorandum is intended to excuse  
the president's actions. By his own admission, he is guilty of 
personal failings. As he has publicly stated, 'I don't think there 
is a fancy way to say that I have sinned.' He has misled his 
family, his friends, his staff and the nation about the nature of 
his relationship with Ms. (Monica) Lewinsky. He hoped to avoid 
exposure of personal wrongdoing so as to protect his family and 
himself and to avoid public embarrassment. He has acknowledged that 
his actions were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the same token, these actions must not be mischaracterized  
into a wholly groundless excuse for removing the president from the 
office to which he was twice elected by the American people. The 
allegations in the articles and the argument in the House managers' 
Trial Memorandum do not begin to satisfy the stringent showing 
required by our Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected president 
from office, either as a matter of fact or law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who seek to remove the president speak of the 'rule of  
law.' Among the most fundamental rules of law are the principles 
that those who accuse have the burden of proof, and those who are 
accused have the right to defend themselves by relying on the law, 
established procedures and the Constitution. These principles are 
not 'legalisms' but rather the very essence of the 'rule of law' 
that distinguishes our nation from others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ours is a Constitution of separated powers. In that  
Constitution, the president does not serve at the will of Congress, 
but as the directly elected, solitary head of the executive branch. 
The Constitution reflects a judgment that a strong executive, 
executing the law independently of legislative will, is a necessary 
protection for a free people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When articles of impeachment have been exhibited, the Senate  
confronts this inescapable question: Is the alleged misconduct so 
profoundly serious, so malevolent to our constitutional system, 
that it justifies undoing the people's decision? Is the wrong 
alleged of a sort that not only demands removal of the president 
before the ordinary electoral cycle can do its work, but also 
justifies the national trauma that accompanies the impeachment 
trial process itself? The wrongdoing alleged here does not remotely 
meet that standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When articles are based on sexual wrongdoing, and when they  
have passed only by the narrowest, partisan margin, the future of 
our constitutional politics is in the balance. The very stability 
of our constitutional government may depend upon the Senate's 
response to these articles. Nothing about this case justifies 
removal of a twice-elected president, because no 'high crimes and 
misdemeanors' are alleged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president testified truthfully before the grand jury.  
There must be no mistake about what the president said. He admitted 
to the grand jury that he had engaged in an inappropriate intimate 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky over a period of many months. He 
admitted to the grand jury that he had been alone with Ms.Lewinsky. 
He admitted to the grand jury that he had misled his family, his 
friends and staff and the entire nation about the nature of that 
relationship. No one who heard the president's Aug. 17 speech or 
watched the president's videotaped grand jury testimony had any 
doubt that he had admitted to an ongoing physical relationship with 
Ms. Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if the president and Ms. Lewinsky disagreed as to the  
precise number of such encounters, it is of no consequence 
whatsoever to anything, given his admission of their relationship. 
This is precisely the kind of disagreement that the law does not 
intend to capture as perjury.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Down; Dow Off 125.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower going into the close but above  
their worst levels of the day, after Brazil's devaluation of its 
currency ignited a sharp but brief sell-off in morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 125.12 at 9,349.56.  
It had been as low as 9,213.10, down 261.58, in the first hour of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume was heavy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composites both opened  
lower and sank in early trading, moved up into positive territory 
this afternoon, but sank back near the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes recovered along with Internet-related stocks,  
which continued to show some resiliency. Yahoo!, Amazon.com and 
America Online all pared their losses. In Nasdaq trading, Intel and 
Microsoft were higher on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 2.72 to 1,236.79. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 3.43 to 2,317.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,025 up, 2,114 down and 434 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 929.94 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
789.45 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 3.87 to 590.72, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.26 to 699.39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.51 to 424.85.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks tumbled at the open after the head of the Brazilian  
central bank, Gustavo Franco, resigned. His replacement, Francisco 
Lopes, immediately allowed the Brazilian currency, the real, to 
fall 8 percent against world currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is important to U.S. markets because it is a huge  
importer of U.S. goods, and because a bad stumble in its economy 
could send emerging markets tumbling throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil is a big part of the Latin American economy, and the  
economy in Latin America is pretty important to companies in the 
United States,'' said Bill Meehan, market strategist at Canter 
Fitzgerald in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's stock market opened in a free fall, with the Bovespa  
index dropping 10 percent, triggering a circuit breaker that halted 
trading temporarily. The index was down 3.9 percent in late 
afternoon. In Mexico, the IPC index was down 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. market was technically poised to fall, after the Dow  
gained a scintillating 5 percent in the first week of trading this 
year, said Greg Nie, a technical analyst at Everen Securities in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a market that's vulnerable to news. The kind of  
action that we've seen collectively late last week and early this 
week, continues to protray a market where the bulls must come after 
it with outstanding, broad-based, big-time momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's new sent worldwide stock markets falling. The jitters  
spread to markets throughout Europe and Latin America. London's 
main stock index closed down 3 percent, while Paris fell 3.3 
percent and Frankfurt slid 4.1 percent. o

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `At First Sight' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What happens to a person who gains sight after a lifetime of  
blindness? This is the most compelling element of ``At First 
Sight,'' an earnest, thoughtful drama based on a real event. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-selling author-physician Oliver Sacks provided the  
story in his book ``An Anthropologist on Mars.'' Sacks has gained a 
reputation for uncovering unusual medical cases. One of them became 
the basis for the Robin Williams-Robert De Niro movie 
``Awakenings,'' which ``At First Sight'' resembles. Both illustrate 
the limits of medical miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgil Adamson (Val Kilmer) works as a masseur at a high-priced  
mountain spa. He lives alone next door to his sister Jennie (Kelly 
McGillis), his long-time guardian. At night he listens to 
broadcasts of the New York Rangers and skates alone on a pond 
hidden in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Benic (Mira Sorvino), a burned-out New York architect,  
arrives at the spa for the regimen of rest and yogurt. She becomes 
intrigued by the handsome young man who gives her a sensuous 
massage. Only afterward does she realize that he is blind (this is 
hard to believe). 
</P>
<P>
	A love affair ensues, and against Jenny's wishes, Virgil  
accompanies Amy to Manhattan. She helps him overcome his reluctance 
to consult with Dr. Charles Aaron (Bruce Davison), whose institute 
has developed new techniques for improving damaged sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgil fears the operation, and his sister opposes it. But Amy  
prevails. For the first time Virgil is able to see. In the 
beginning, the burst of light pains him. Soon he adjusts, but now 
he must grasp the elements of depth perception and other factors 
that children learn in their infancy. This is absorbing stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its good intentions, the rest of ``At First Sight''  
seems strangely unmoving. The characters and events of Steve 
Levitt's screenplay have an air of predictability, and Irwin 
Winkler's direction lacks excitement. John Seale's cinematography 
contrasting the mountain greenery and the bold colors of Manhattan 
is a vital asset. 
</P>
<P>
	Val Kilmer, the most underrated of today's leading men, brings  
humanity and charm to the role of Virgil, and Mira Sorvino in her 
first big lead role shows she has what it takes. Kelly McGillis and 
Bruce Davison are strong in support, but Nathan Lane is wasted in a 
brief appearance as a blindness therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	The MGM release was produced by Winkler and Ron Cowan. Rated  
PG-13 because of adult material. Running time: 124 minutes.

<HEADLINE> INS Citizenship Fee Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citizenship is becoming more expensive.  
</P>
<P>
	Effective Friday, the fee for filing a citizenship application  
is more than doubling to $225 from $95. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase comes even as the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service struggles with huge backlogs that have some would-be 
Americans waiting more than two years for their paperwork to clear. 
</P>
<P>
	In proposing the increase last year, INS Commissioner Doris  
Meissner promised that it wouldn't take effect until her agency had 
made progress in reducing the backlog and speeding processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the backlog remains at 1.8 million cases, near its  
record high of 1.9 million, INS officials said they are making 
progress. The national average wait stood at 23 months as of 
December, down from the 27-month average at the start of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are certainly not pleased, we are happy that we are  
heading in the right direction in bringing that down,'' the acting 
head of INS' immigration services division, Bill Yates, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But some immigrant advocates say the progress is not occurring  
fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly a lot of frustration in immigrant  
communities that services appear not to have gotten substantially 
better and the fee is going up dramatically,'' said Cecilia Munoz, 
vice president of the National Council of La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Swenson, a Texas Immigration and Refugee Coalition policy  
analyst, said Meissner hadn't fulfilled her pledge. ``The wait for 
citizenship is still over two years in most places, which is just 
ridiculous,'' she said. ``We're really disappointed that (the fee) 
is going up right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yates said the INS hopes to reduce the citizenship processing  
average to 12 months by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 31 and 
to Meissner's longstanding goal of six months by the end of next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the INS' internal budget problems, Yates said: ``We are  
confident we will accomplish the commissioner's objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The INS, which processed 1.6 million citizenship applications in  
1997, saw the number of applications dip dramatically last year to 
771,000, said INS spokeswoman Elaine Komis. This year, the agency 
estimates 700,000 people will seek to become naturalized citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in citizenship requests in 1996 and 1997 was driven in  
large measure by changes in federal law denying welfare and other 
benefits to noncitizens. ``We think that we've pretty much hit the 
peak, but we never know,'' Ms. Komis said. 
</P>
<P>
	People seeking to beat the citizenship fee increases must act  
quickly. The INS must have received those applications in the mail 
by Thursday, Ms. Komis said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS has seen a surge in applications in recent weeks, receiving  
95,000 applications last month. Typically, 58,000 to 60,000 
applications are received monthly, Yates said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Down; Dow Off 125.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fierce selloff hit Wall Street Wednesday  
following Brazil's dramatic currency devaluation, but stocks 
bottomed out quickly and partly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves demonstrated that even serious economic problems with  
an important trading partner like Brazil were not enough to 
completely undo a stunning rally in U.S. stocks that last week sent 
the Dow Jones industrials up 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The index of 30 blue chip companies ended the day down 125.12,  
or 1.3 percent, at 9,349.56. Earlier in the day, the Dow had been 
down as much as 261. The Nasdaq composite index also plummeted 
nearly 115 points, or 4.9 percent, but closed just 3.94 points 
lower at 2,316.81. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed 
down 5.11 to 1,234.40. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a 
heavy 1.12 billion shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin American and European stock indexes also plunged, but  
didn't recover. Brazil's main stock index fell 5 percent, Mexico's 
lost 4.6 percent. Frankfurt's DAX index fell 5.2 percent. Paris's 
CAC index fell 3.5 percent, and London's FT-SE 100 fell 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff occurred after Brazil's central bank chief resigned,  
and his successor allowed the country's troubled currency, the 
real, to fall nearly 8 percent against major world currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's action was not a surprise. But it stirred fears that  
Latin America's largest economy could drag the entire region -- and 
maybe even the United States -- into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Brazil devalues the real, then the chances are high that  
other countries in Latin America, perhaps including Mexico, will 
also devalue,'' said Hugh Johnson, market strategist at First 
Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	That could have serious implications for U.S. companies that are  
already having trouble selling goods in recession-wracked Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is Latin America's largest economy, generating about 40  
percent of the region's gross domestic product last year. Depending 
on how emerging China is counted, Brazil is either the eighth or 
ninth-largest economy in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Brazil consumes a relatively small 2 percent of U.S.  
exports, it is an important customer of some industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilians and their companies are heavy buyers of U.S.-made  
industrial and consumer products, from heavy machinery and cars to 
consumer products like razors and household cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 of the 500 companies in the S&AMP;P 500 index have  
some exposure in Brazil, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	By cutting Brazilians' buying power, the real's devaluation  
threatens to slow those exports to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The profit situation for U.S. companies is immediately hurt by  
the devaluation,'' said David Orr, chief economist at First Union 
Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Brazil has as deep a recession as it could have, then  
Argentina will go into recession, and Chile will have trouble 
avoiding a recession,'' Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to Latin America of hard goods aren't the only problem.  
U.S.-based banks like Citigroup have lent heavily to companies 
throughout Latin America. If those loans are not repaid, the banks 
will suffer. Bank stocks fell sharply Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton moved to soothe the market by announcing that  
he and other world leaders were working hard to solve Brazil's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Wall Street did was say, OK, we see this problem, we know  
there's a solution, we assume the solution will take place,'' said 
Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachtel said that for the last four years, individual stock  
investors, who have provided most of the buying power that has 
pushed the market to its record heights, have calmly viewed 
selloffs as buying opportunities. That happened again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachtel also said stocks were already primed for a tumble. ``If  
there had been no Brazil today, I don't think anybody would have 
been surprised at a 125-point loss in the Dow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what should investors do now?  
</P>
<P>
	Most large, multinational companies are involved in Brazil, if  
not Latin America, Wachtel said. ``Be aware that Citigroup has a 
major stake in Brazil, be aware that Whirlpool, Coke, and Ford do, 
too,'' he said, urging caution before investing in such companies. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Microsoft, for example, doesn't do a lot of  
business there, Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachtel advised investors to buy the stocks of healthy companies  
that have fallen in sympathy with the real losers. BankAmerica and 
First Union, for example, closed sharply lower Wednesday but have 
virtually no exposure to Brazil, he said.

<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- He was a small boy trying to be a big  
man, so when they asked him to sign the statement, he practiced his 
signature in the margins -- the sweet, oversized cursive of an 
8-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy Brown Jr.  
</P>
<P>
	Perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	But signing his name may have sealed his doom.  
</P>
<P>
	In the document, the boy everyone knew as B.J. described the  
wounding of his mother's boyfriend and identified the man with the 
gun. B.J. was a key witness to an attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly nine months later, that status became more precarious  
with a second, more successful shooting. This time, boyfriend Rudy 
Snead was killed, and suddenly what B.J. had seen became part of a 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	But B.J. won't be testifying against anybody. This month,  
someone killed 30-year-old Karen Clarke and her beloved only son -- 
a happy, well-mannered child who loved nothing better than playing 
basketball and riding his bike. 
</P>
<P>
	Was B.J. killed because he was a witness? The investigation  
continues. Did authorities neglect to protect him? The 
recriminations resound. 
</P>
<P>
	But this much is clear: The death of B.J. Brown is a tragedy in  
three violent acts. Crime may be waning across the country, but the 
last 16 months of this boy's life were awash with blood. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 2, 1997, Rudolph Snead Jr. took B.J. and another  
7-year-old boy to Bridgeport's Boys and Girls Club, where B.J. 
played basketball. They left shortly before 6 p.m., the boys in the 
back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	He was driving on Boston Avenue, Snead later told police, when  
he saw a burgundy Chevy Lumina approach with Russell Anthony Peeler 
in the front passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The men had known each other for years. Their relationship  
remains hazy. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler, who turns 27 Friday, has a minor arrest record, but  
police and other sources say he has been a drug dealer. The son of 
a former Bridgeport police officer, Peeler is ``the most 
respectful, quiet-spoken guy I've had in years,'' says his former 
attorney, Frank Riccio. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Clarke told police Peeler and Snead had argued over some  
money a few weeks before -- $90, she said. ``Rudy didn't tell me any 
details,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Snead saw Peeler in the approaching car, he spun around and  
sped away. But Peeler's car caught up and cut in front of him. 
According to Snead -- and B.J.'s statement -- Peeler lowered his 
window and fired. 
</P>
<P>
	One shot hit the driver-side door. Another grazed Snead's  
forehead. A third shattered a passenger-side window. Flying glass 
cut B.J.'s leg. 
</P>
<P>
	A detective who interviewed Snead at St. Vincent's Hospital  
noted the two boys ``appeared traumatized and were unwilling to 
talk about the incident.'' The other boy never gave a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But B.J. eventually talked, in June 1998. Yes, he recognized the  
gunman. He picked out his photograph. ``I don't know his name, but 
I know that he used to be a friend of Rudy's. Rudy took me over to 
his house once,'' he said in his signed statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The night of the shooting, Clarke got a call. ``Russell ... was  
saying that he didn't do it and that Rudy was a punk. During the 
phone call, Angie Bush (Peeler's girlfriend) got on the phone and 
said Rudy should not have been driving with kids in the car when he 
had a beef with someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler was arrested Sept. 26 and charged with attempted murder.  
He was released Oct. 10 on $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In the following months, Clarke told police, Peeler sent Snead a  
series of warnings: Forget what happened or else. 
</P>
<P>
	She bumped into Peeler at a clothing store: ``He told me to tell  
Rudy that he better drop the charges or else Russell was going to 
get Rudy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, prosecutors asked that the trial be moved up  
because Snead had complained of threats. Three months later, the 
trial hadn't started. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after 7 p.m. May 29, a man with a jacket over his head  
walked out of the rain into the Boston Avenue Barber Shop and 
stalked directly to the rear, where Snead was standing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, man, go ahead with that ----,'' Snead said, according to a  
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	The man fired a semiautomatic, hitting Snead seven times at  
pointblank range. Snead collapsed in front of Douglas Walton, who 
had known him since high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Russell, yo,'' Snead told Walton.  
</P>
<P>
	Peeler was arrested and charged with murder two weeks later.  
Prosecutors asked that bond be revoked. Instead, bail was raised to 
$900,000, and he was ordered to wear an electronic tracking device 
on his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded innocent and was released July 13 after friends  
presented $50,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic records indicate Peeler was home last week when  
Clarke and her son were killed. Authorities say they want to talk 
with him but do not describe him as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler's lawyer, Gary Mastronardi, did not return repeated  
telephone calls by The Associated Press seeking comment this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Connecticut Post he seriously doubts Peeler had  
anything to do with killing Clarke and her son. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler ``is under the highest level of scrutiny possible; he  
wears a security bracelet and his whereabouts are monitored 
daily,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastronardi said that an enemy of his client might have more  
motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody who really wanted to shaft Russell Peeler could do  
this to cast suspicion on Russell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Jamaica, Karen Clarke moved with her family to Florida  
in the early 1980s. Friends say she was a devout Christian; 
colleagues at U-Haul in Orange, Conn., say she was friendly, a hard 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	And everyone says she was devoted to B.J. He was, says neighbor  
Ann Zolt, ``a nice kid, a funny kid, a very outgoing kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks after Snead's murder, Clarke reported no threats,  
said Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict. Though ``she 
expressed concern,'' she turned down special police protection 
after a few days; she said it was too disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
	The state sought a protective order allowing prosecutors to  
withhold witness names and addresses from the defense. The request 
was denied. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, Karen Clarke had bought a duplex a couple miles  
away, on Earl Avenue -- the first house she'd ever owned. When 
Benedict suggested she and B.J. enter the state's witness 
relocation program, she said no. 
</P>
<P>
	She did ask that her son -- who spent the summer with his father  
in New York -- be transferred to another school, and he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke had Jan. 7 off. That night, around 6, police received a  
call. Someone in the neighborhood reported gunshots but also said 
it could have been a car backfiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, when Clarke failed to show, a co-worker was sent  
to her home. He found Leroy's body on the second floor near the top 
of the stairs. He'd been shot once in the back of the head, once in 
the back. His mother was a few feet away, shot twice in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Grocery bags were near the front door; it seems mother and son  
were surprised as they returned from shopping. Evidently, they had 
tried to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	The outrage at this crime was immediate, and immense. But the  
sorrow was also extraordinary; the deaths of a loving mother and 
her son grabbed at the heart of this old industrial town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Courtney Williams was to give the eulogy at their  
funeral Thursday. After the police finished, he visited the house 
on Earl Avenue. There, on Clarke's bed, he found a Bible open to 
Psalm 20, words that might have offered balm to a small family that 
knew the meaning of peril. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lord answer you in the day of trouble!'' the psalm says.  
``The name of the God of Jacob protect you!''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Plan for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed a new $2  
billion, five-year package of health coverage, tax credits and 
rehabilitation services to help tens of thousands of disabled 
Americans return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should never have to choose between the dignity of  
work and the health care they need,'' Clinton said. ``With this 
initiative, they'll have a ticket to work, not an impossible 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates say that health coverage -- the largest piece of the  
package -- is the No. 1 barrier that prevents people with 
disabilities from returning to the workplace. Often they find jobs 
that do not offer health insurance coverage, and often their 
disabilities make it extraordinarily expensive to buy coverage on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton held a White House ceremony today to endorse legislation  
on health benefits being introduced next week by Sens. James 
Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``A major obstacle will be removed from the fulfillment of every  
disabled person's dream to work, live independently and be a 
contributing member of society,'' Kennedy said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will also offer tax credits to help disabled  
workers pay for transportation, equipment and other expenses and 
more money to develop new information and communications 
technologies to help people with disabilities function in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	And he will back a plan that would let people with disabilities  
choose their rehabilitation centers, creating competition for the 
first time for the organizations that train people to take jobs. 
Centers that successfully place people in jobs would get bonus 
payments, thus reaping some of the savings the government will 
realize from reduced disability payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, less than one-half of 1 percent of the  
10 million Americans receiving disability benefits ever return to 
work, including people in the Social Security system for workers 
and the Supplemental Security Income program for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Their advocates argue that's because the system punishes them  
when they go to work -- forcing them to choose between health 
benefits and a job. 
</P>
<P>
	The health insurance plan would cost $1.2 billion over five  
years, and is expected to be considered by the Senate Finance 
Committee, where it has two powerful advocates: Chairman William 
Roth, R-Del., and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the 
panel's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would encourage states to offer Medicaid to people  
who return to work, allowing them to buy into the program even if 
their incomes are too high under current limits. States could also 
let people buy into Medicaid even if their conditions have improved 
but they remain impaired and need health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would also allow people with disabilities to continue  
receiving Medicare benefits, which are not as generous as state 
benefits but would be available to people across the nation, 
regardless of a state's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will also endorse two other initiatives:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $750 million, five-year plan to give $1,000 tax credits to  
people with disabilities who go back to work. This would help 
defray the cost of transportation, technology and other expenses 
necessary to take a job. 
</P>
<P>
	--Doubling money spent on developing assisted technology to help  
people with disabilities function. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation being offered by Jeffords, chairman of the  
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and Kennedy, the 
panel's top Democrat, would also create a demonstration project to 
test the effect of phasing out benefits as people earn more. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, disability beneficiaries lose their entire  
grants if they earn more than $500 a month, prompting some to turn 
down raises or limit their hours.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Creates Global Splash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Jordan's retirement did the unthinkable:  
it eclipsed soccer in the world's media. 
</P>
<P>
	From Warsaw to Rome, Sydney to Santiago, Jordan was given the  
kind of page one coverage Wednesday that American sports seldom 
receive outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
	In a world in which soccer dwarfs the NBA, Jordan received the  
highest possible accolade: he was likened to the legendary soccer 
star Pele. 
</P>
<P>
	For a comparable retirement, you ``have to go a long time back  
to when Pele was the God of soccer,'' said Australian National 
Basketball League general manager Bill Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some papers likened the news of his retirement to the death of a  
close family member. One suggested Americans would rather keep 
Jordan and see President Clinton leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``America would willingly take Clinton's retirement in exchange  
for Jordan's,'' said Rome's La Repubblica newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	London's tabloid The Sun was even more to the point.  
</P>
<P>
	``The shattering retirement announcement will even drive Bill  
Clinton's sex scandals off America's front pages. If you thought 
boxer Mike Tyson, football legend Pele or racing driver Ayrton 
Senna were the most recognized names in the world -- forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In countries like Britain where the NBA has a tiny following,  
much of the coverage was about the millions Jordan has earned. 
Swiss papers took a similar approach and said he deserved every 
penny. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era ``when stock market coups and mergers allow the oddest  
of fellows to shamelessly amass fistfuls of dollars, ... we don't 
begrudge the fact that Jordan has earned enough to buy a basketball 
stadium every day until the end of time,'' said the Lausanne daily 
Le Matin. 
</P>
<P>
	Several papers compared Jordan to other universally known  
American exports like Coca-Cola or Mickey Mouse and noted his 
popularity -- particularly in places where the sport is hardly 
followed -- had nothing to do with basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``His popularity is unprecedented and without limit,'' said  
Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport in a front page editorial. ``He's way 
better known than basketball itself because he goes beyond its 
limits: Jordan is myth, poetry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonso Reyes, a Spanish international and the center for the  
Spanish club Estudiantes, described playing against Jordan a year 
ago in the McDonald's Classic in Paris as something ``to tell my 
grandchildren about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the best of all time,'' Reyes told the Madrid daily  
Diario 16. ``As the years go by, we will realize what he was and he 
will become a myth. There's nobody about to replace him -- neither 
on the court nor in charisma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Spanish daily, La Razon added, ``His mere presence  
guaranteed entertainment just as great actors take over the screen 
with a gesture or a look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's retirement made waves in China, where the NBA (known as  
``Gongniu'') and Jordan (known as ``Qiaodan'') have a large 
following among China's sports-crazy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 1,000 people in nine Chinese cities conducted in May  
named Jordan as the second-most widely known American after Thomas 
Edison. Similar polls in France and Australia have found him better 
known than local sports stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flying Man Jordan is Coming Back to Earth'' the state-run  
Beijing Morning Post said in a front-page story that likened 
reports of his retirement to hearing of a close relative's death. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chile, Santiago's Las Ultimas Noticias offered a huge,  
front-page photo of a smiling Jordan, with the caption: ``Jordan, 
the moment of good-bye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One German paper honed in on Jordan's apolitical nature and his  
ability to cross racial divides. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ``winsome, friendly and so non-controversial that  
Americans forgot that he was black, and that means something,'' 
wrote the Frankfurt daily Frankfurter Rundshau. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was also covered on German TV, unusual in a country  
where biathlon gets more exposure than basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	France's most prestigious daily Le Monde wrote, ``The status of  
American blacks doesn't bother him. ... Simply, M.J. is a 
professional basketball player with an acute sense of business and 
an oversized ego.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's retirement was followed in the Middle East -- although  
basketball seldom is. Most Arab satellite TV networks such as 
Egypt's Channel 2, Nile TV, and Al-Gazeera carried the retirement 
on main news bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basketball legend announces his retirement,'' said a  
headline in Egypt's Al-Ahrar daily, describing him as ``the 
greatest player the world had ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, one daily was cautious and recalled that Jordan  
retired five years ago, only to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike America, our eyes are not misted with tears, so we  
won't rush to join the farewell,'' the daily Segodnya wrote. 
``Maybe it's premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan got big treatment in Britain, probably Europe's least  
basketball-savvy country. His retirement even made the front page 
of the Daily Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Daily Mail buried the retirement in a six-line note in  
agate type alongside darts and squash results. 
</P>
<P>
	A headline in the Polish paper Gazeta Wyborcza probably said it  
best. 
</P>
<P>
	``NBA without Jordan?''

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Nana Nouskouri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Every night, the movie screen came to life under  
the Greek stars. From rickety chairs, hundreds of people met Judy 
Garland on celluloid, singing up Hollywood's yellow brick road. 
</P>
<P>
	In a house just behind the big screen, a shy 7-year-old would  
peek out of her bedroom window. She saw ``The Wizard of Oz'' over 
and over, fuzzy and in reverse from the wrong side of the screen. 
After the audience left, she would sneak out and stand on the small 
stage, facing the empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dreamed of the heroes I saw in the movies, and I pretended I  
was singing,'' says Nana Mouskouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Since those nights growing up in Greece in the 1930s, the singer  
with the trademark square glasses and soaring voice has appeared in 
the world's top concert halls. Over four decades, album after album 
has gone gold and platinum, offering love songs in styles ranging 
from gospel, pop and jazz to folk and classical. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Miss Mouskouri's name is mentioned, most Americans  
still say, ``Who?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so, at 64, the chanteuse is taking on the United States  
again, with a new CD of songs from her ``Concert for Peace,'' 
televised on PBS last year from Manhattan's Cathedral of St. John 
the Divine. On that evening, she switched musical gears from a 
Mahalia Jackson gospel song to Greek songs to Schubert's ``Ave 
Maria'' to Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Love Changes Everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The music may not be hip, but Nana has become a hip name in some  
cutting-edge places. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli and Maria Callas, Miss  
Mouskouri is a trendy diva to drag queens who impersonate her in 
clubs from Brussels to Los Angeles. And wearing square specs is 
considered cool for hot Generation X singer Lisa Loeb. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a challenge to seek fresh success in a country where Miss  
Mouskouri made her recording debut in 1962, with an album produced 
by Quincy Jones; a year later, she toured with Harry Belafonte. Bob 
Dylan wrote ``Every Grain of Sand'' especially for her. 
</P>
<P>
	But for decades, her tours took her to other countries,  
accompanied by her husband, guitarist George Petsilas. In recent 
years, divorced and with her two children grown, she was drawn once 
again to the United States. A 1993 tour was capped by a Carnegie 
Hall recital, and she returned in a 1997 tour accompanied by a 
newalbum, ``Return to Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not being a superstar is a novelty for her.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is very tough. And in my position, at this age, after all  
the successes, it's even harder,'' she said with a wry smile in an 
interview during a recent visit to New York. ``But if you want to 
keep what you have done already, you have to go a little bit 
further. If you don't, then you go backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Mouskouri's artistry is rooted in childhood memories of the  
Greek civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so traumatized by this hate that it made me very  
insecure in life, searching always for love, tenderness, 
understanding,'' she says. Her concern for children now also 
extends to being a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father was the projectionist at the outdoors theater in  
Athens. And on those nights, watching old movies of the Ziegfeld 
Follies, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, she first understood that 
art could change people. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes she would run to the street and peer at the audience  
arriving, then leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always watched the faces. I was trying to find if they were  
the same coming in and out, after seeing the movie. Are they happy, 
are they sad?'' she said. ``And they were never the same. When they 
were coming out they shared something -- they had watched the same 
film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So this was what art could do. She was hooked.  
</P>
<P>
	While studying classical singing at the Athens Conservatory, she  
dabbled in popular music. ``I was a rebel, and my teacher was very 
angry at me,'' she said. ``At the end, I was chased away from the 
conservatory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She debuted in a nightclub and went on to record hit music for  
movies such as ``Never on Sunday'' and ``The Umbrellas of 
Cherbourg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she calls herself ``the shyest person in the world,''  
she shunned trends and insisted on singing the music she really 
felt. Of her varied repertoire, which includes songs by Dylan, 
Leonard Cohen, Bette Midler and Nat ``King'' Cole, she says, ``I'm 
a musical chameleon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has won tens of millions of fans with more than 1,000 songs  
delivered in a dozen languages and a voice packed with 
Mediterranean emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, for me and for all Greeks, everything is a tragedy,  
a psychological drama. I'm very emotional,'' she says. And a 
concert career ``can be very lonely. I can cry all by myself on my 
bed, many times. ... But then, I'll go on stage and a big laugh 
comes and I start all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For that, she's been dubbed ``Medea without the tragedy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Being on stage for her is ``like walking on a tightrope,  
crossing from dream to reality. And if you make it, it means the 
audience has come with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She calls the stage ``my space. The audience and me. My most  
wonderful love story of all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she lives in France and Switzerland, she feels that  
Greece is home and she has represented it as a member of the 
European Parliament since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have your country, you feel those ties. And you feel  
better anywhere you go if you know that you have a home,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Miss Mouskouri returned to Athens for a three-hour  
solo recital near the Acropolis. Her son, Nicholas, and daughter, 
Helen, told her it was the best performance of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	As for success in the United States, she says, ``If it happens,  
it happens; if it doesn't, it doesn't.''

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Wants To Meet Thai Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Hollywood heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio  
has asked to meet with Thailand's prime minister to discuss 
promoting tourism to the Southeast Asian nation, a government 
spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio is in Thailand filming the motion picture ``The  
Beach,'' but the film has been dogged by controversy and legal 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Akaphol Sorasuchart, the government spokesman, said the film's  
producer had made the request on DiCaprio's behalf through a member 
of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	``He apparently feels Thailand has been very welcoming to him  
and the film crew, and so he is willing to say good things about 
Thailand,'' Akaphol said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that DiCaprio would have to submit a formal request to  
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism is one industry that is booming in Thailand despite an  
economic crisis that has gripped the country since mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists, however, claim the 20th Century Fox project  
is irrevocably harming the ecosystem of Maya Beach, a national park 
conservation area protected by law, on the island of Phi Phi. On 
Tuesday, a civil court refused to issue an injunction halting 
production.

<HEADLINE> Jets Can't Fall Behind Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Unless they stop Denver's quick strikes,  
the New York Jets could be quickly out of the AFC championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	They understand that. Dealing with it is another matter  
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the Broncos lead the AFC in scoring with 501 points  
(the Jets scored 416), they outscored opponents 144-54 in the first 
quarter and 156-87 in the second. By halftime, the Broncos were in 
control nearly every week, leading each home game but one -- they 
were 21-21 with Kansas City -- and averaging a 23-8 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ominous numbers.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be ready to jump in with both feet,'' receiver  
Wayne Crehebt said of Sunday's trip to Mile High Stadium, where 
Denver has won 18 straight. ``We have to take advantage of our 
opportunities and try to keep their offense off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is for our offense to not get caught  
up in the emotions of the game. Even if we do not strike the first 
time with the ball, we have to keep executing. We want to take 
their team out of their game. Heck, they're usually ahead by a 
couple of touchdowns at the end of the first quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets aren't nearly as impressive on the road in the first  
half, outscoring opponents only 80-75 in eight games, five wins. 
And 40 of those points came in losses. 
</P>
<P>
	They are much stronger in the second half, but the second half  
might not matter Sunday if they can't stay close to the Broncos for 
30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to go into Denver with more momentum and a lot more  
fire,'' linebacker Pepper Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we can't make mistakes,'' added quarterback Vinny  
Testaverde, who is 0-2 in his career vs. Denver. ``We've played in 
hostile environments -- Miami on Sunday night, New England on Monday 
night, Buffalo in December -- and won. We played well in those 
environments, stayed focused and won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos strike in so many ways on opening drives. They have  
a 54-9 edge on first possessions, with six touchdowns and four 
field goals. Against Miami in last weekend's playoff game, Denver 
went 92 yards on 14 plays to Terrell Davis' 1-yard TD run on the 
first series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play for 60 minutes and don't hold anything back at any  
time, from the first play to the last we're always on attack,'' 
John Elway said. ``We hit the ground running to start the game and 
go full speed ahead from the first play to the last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are no slouches when they have the ball, and their  
defense yielded the second-fewest points, 266, one more than the 
Dolphins. That defense will be severely tested early, and it's 
ability to survive the opening moments could be pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denver is a a team that if they are able to get a good lead on  
you, then their defense becomes more and more effective, as most 
team's defenses do when you become more one-dimensional,'' Jets 
coach Bill Parcells said. ``They keep attacking on offense and try 
to separate themselves from a team, and then they allow the defense 
to pressure. I don't want to use the word gamble because it's a 
selective type of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's their formula and it has been successful.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos are battle-hardened. If they don't succeed early,  
they hang in and get to an opponent late. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Broncos have won so many games in the last few years,''  
Parcells said. ``I don't think anything happens on the field is 
going to damage their mentality.''

<HEADLINE> Venus vs. Graf in Adidas Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Steffi Graf and Venus Williams set up a  
quarterfinal power showdown in the Adidas International with 
contrasting second-round victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was in top form today in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory over  
South Africa's Amanda Coetzer, while Graf struggled to beat Serena 
Williams 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 in an exciting match that lasted almost 2 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	With Venus Williams and Graf winning on center court, top-ranked  
Lindsay Davenport was pushed to an outside court for her opening 
match after a first-round bye. Davenport beat Mary Joe Fernandez 
6-4, 7-6 (8-6) to advance to a quarterfinal match against 
Switzerland's Patty Schnyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf took women's tennis to another level with her awesome power  
in a decade of domination, but concedes Venus Williams is now the 
hardest-hitting player on the tour. Williams downplayed the 
advantage against Graf, who has 21 Grand Slam titles to her credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can overpower someone, but sometimes they like the pace,  
so power isn't everything,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she considered Venus the better of the Williams  
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venus plays with a little more thought, with more control,''  
Graf said. ``They're both hitting incredible serves and some 
amazing shots, but Venus is the more stable one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf has changed her approach as she chases her fifth Australian  
Open title and first since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old German star, fit again after a long battle with  
injuries, admits things changed while she was weighed down by 
surgery and therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a different generation,'' Graf said. ``If you  
look at Venus and Serena Williams, they're physically so much 
stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams said she admired the way Graf has fought back  
from knee, ankle, back and wrist injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steffi is a smart player, a great player with a lot of  
experience,'' Venus Williams said. ``She just kept coming and kept 
coming no matter what hit her, and she's on top of her game and 
playing just about as well as she did when she took off. It's 
really great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf withdrew from an exhibition final against Venus Williams in  
Hong Kong last week because of a stomach ailment. But her decision 
to play the two Australian Open tuneups goes against her usual 
practice of heading straight to Melbourne after a month of training 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to have as many matches as possible before playing a  
Grand Slam,'' said Graf, who last played in Sydney 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, defending champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain  
beat Germany's Anke Huber 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, and Schnyder defeated 
Slovakia's Karina Habsudova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's draw, Australia teen-ager Lleyton Hewitt followed  
Tuesday's victory over U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter with a 6-4, 
6-2 victory over Germany's Nicolas Kiefer. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matches, third-ranked Alex Corretja of Spain beat  
Switzerland's Marc Rosset 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2); defending champion 
Karol Kucera of Slovakia routed France's Cedric Pioline 6-4, 6-0; 
and Spain's Albert Costa beat American Jan-Michael Gambill 6-3, 
7-5.

<HEADLINE> Fight Over Clinton-Jones Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Just because President Clinton has  
mailed an $850,000 settlement check doesn't mean the Paula Jones 
case is wrapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton mailed the check to Mrs. Jones in California on Tuesday.  
It was made out to her -- and to her current and former lawyers. And 
the two sets of lawyers are fighting with each other over legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The check may be placed in the custody of U.S. District Judge  
Susan Webber Wright until the dispute is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones must respond no later than Friday to an $874,000  
claim in legal fees from her former lawyers in the sexual 
harassment case, Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said when the case was settled that we would want to  
have a reasonable division of that. And if all are fair and 
reasonable and not greedy, that it can be resolved without court 
intervention,'' Cammarata has said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cammarata said Mrs. Jones' camp responded with a threatening  
letter and a take-it-or-leave-it offer of $25,000, so Cammarata and 
Davis went to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Cammarata nor Mrs. Jones' current lawyer, Bill McMillan,  
would comment Wednesday on how much of the settlement check they 
thought should go to Cammarata and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata and Davis quit the case in 1997 when Mrs. Jones  
rejected a settlement with Clinton that did not include an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of  
Arkansas, made a crude advance in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton 
denied her accusation and, in the settlement, admitted no 
wrongdoing and offered no apology. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawsuit brought to light the president's affair with  
Monica Lewinsky and set in motion the investigation that led to his 
impeachment trial.

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Welfare for Newcomers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A skeptical Supreme Court appeared wary of  
arguments Wednesday that California is justified in paying 
newcomers lower welfare benefits than it pays longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, with the blessing of Congress, approved the policy to  
save money and discourage welfare recipients from moving to 
California just to get more benefits. But a majority of the 
justices suggested the different payments violate the 
constitutionally protected right to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Constitution's underpinnings is the notion that  
Americans can move freely from state to state, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the genius of the United States,'' said Justice Ruth  
Bader Ginsburg. ``People can pick their states, and states can't 
pick their people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In overhauling the federal welfare law in 1996, Congress  
specifically authorized states to pay newcomers lower benefits than 
longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers feared that under the new system, where states could  
write dramatically different welfare laws, states with more 
generous benefits might become magnets for welfare recipients. 
Conversely, Congress worried that other states would ``race to the 
bottom,'' cutting benefits more and more to push poor people away. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little evidence so far that states with higher benefits  
have attracted large numbers of welfare migrants. 
</P>
<P>
	But California -- along with 14 other states -- opted to pay new  
residents who sign up for welfare only as much as they would have 
received in their former states. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, that's a big difference: California pays a family  
of four $673 a month; Mississippi pays just $144. At the same time, 
California in general has a higher cost of living than most other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for California argued that newcomers are not that  
much worse off: The lower payments apply only to their first year, 
and they can participate fully in all other aspects of the welfare 
program, including job training and child care, said Theodore 
Garelis. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said, ``You'd be hard-pressed''  
to tell a family that must rely on welfare that hundreds of dollars 
each month are not significant, saying, ``This has grave 
consequences for that family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Ginsburg wondered whether such a policy could be applied to  
other state programs. For example, could a state force families to 
pay higher taxes if their former state had higher tax rates? Or, 
Ginsburg asked, ``Is there something special about welfare that 
distinguishes it from other kinds of benefits?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Garelis  
acknowledged that one purpose of the law was to get rid of the 
incentive someone might have to move to California for a higher 
welfare check. 
</P>
<P>
	That, Kennedy responded, suggests the law does infringe on  
travel. If the idea was simply to save money, he added, why not 
just cut benefits for everyone, or for random citizens -- say those 
whose last names began with ``Q.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also expressing skepticism about California's policy were  
Justices Stephen G. Breyer and John Paul Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to come down on the other side,  
saying states aren't preventing people from moving, just treating 
them differently once they arrive. Under that reasoning, he said, 
states have a lower standard to meet to justify their policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is taking a middle-of-the-road position:  
It wants the court to keep the policy on hold while sending it back 
to a lower court to consider whether it fulfills the goals of the 
1996 welfare law. 
</P>
<P>
	Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman said it might be OK to keep  
benefits low for people who are already on welfare when they move, 
for instance. California, though, may have gone too far, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	California's policy, blocked the day it was to take effect, was  
ruled unconstitutional by the federal district court and the 9th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The state appealed.

<HEADLINE> Jamaican Spellers' Ban Sparks Tiff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The national spelling bee -- as innocent as  
apple pie, right? -- has spawned an international incident of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Young spellers from Jamaica, home of the reigning champ, have  
been disqualified from this year's competition. The island nation 
is in an uproar. A spelling coach is quoting scripture in his 
defense. Even the Rev. Jesse Jackson has entered the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	And it doesn't end there. Some people in spelling bee land  
wonder whether Jamaica is drilling students to be super spellers to 
beat the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that there's this crop of kids spelling their minds  
out in a spelling factory is not accurate at all,'' says O'Neil 
Hamilton, a spokesman for Jamaica's embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	It all started last May when 249 spellers traveled to the 71st  
annual spelldown in Washington. The contest is open to contestants 
from areas with official sponsors, and have come in the past from 
the continental United States, Mexico, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Virgin 
Islands, American Samoa, Puerto Rico and Guam. The event is 
sponsored by Scripps Howard, part of the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 
E.W. Scripps Co., which operates newspapers and television 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried that some youngsters might be getting extra time to  
study, spelling bee officials imposed a new rule: To be eligible 
for this coming May's competition, spellers had to win a qualifying 
regional or local contest held no earlier than this Feb. 1. That 
would require a change in Jamaica, which for nearly four decades 
has held its spelling bee the August before the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's bee, however, was held again in August. Scripps Howard  
then disqualified the sponsor, Phillips &AMP; Phillips Stationery 
Supplies Ltd., from sending spellers to this year's competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have taken this action as anti-Jamaica. We have  
not banned the country,'' says Paige Kimble, director of the 
spelling bee. ``It's a specific move against a sponsor, not a 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the action hit hard in Jamaica, which has sent spellers to  
Washington only twice -- both with good results. In 1997, Jamaican 
speller Jason Edwards James placed eighth and last year, Bettina 
McLean finished sixth and Jody-Anne Maxwell became the first 
non-U.S. citizen to win the competition by successfully spelling 
her final word C-H-I-A-R-O-S-C-U-R-I-S-T (an artist who works in 
lights and darks). 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a folk hero. She's like Michael Jordan,'' Hamilton said  
of Jody-Anne. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Thomson of sponsor Phillips &AMP; Phillips says she didn't get  
written news of the rule change until two weeks before Jamaica held 
its bee on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Bee officials claim the sponsor tried to qualify two contestants  
for this year based solely on their previous qualification to last 
year. Ms. Thomson says that's not true -- that she only was 
inquiring about rules for repeat contestants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We basically are a Third World country. We have a very small  
voice -- like a squeak -- and nobody listens,'' says Ms. Thomson, who 
claims she's spent nearly $1,500 since August on long-distance 
calls to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Thomson says she told bee officials that to comply, Jamaica  
would hold new regional competitions after Feb. 1. But officials 
said they didn't want to start making exceptions. Two other 
companies in Jamaica offered to be the sponsor, but Ms. Kimble said 
they had connections to the August bee, and for the ``sake of 
propriety,'' officials essentially told the Jamaicans they'd 
consider them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, founded by Jackson, has written  
letters to bee officials, saying their action has effectively 
excluded the young spellers of African descent. ``This certainly 
appears to be very exclusionary,'' says spokeswoman Valerie 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kimble disagreed. ``We have been very proud and very blessed  
that we have a rainbow event,'' she said. ``There are children from 
all walks of life, all nationalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Lewis, 12, who won the Jamaican bee in August and was  
eager to compete in Washington, hasn't given up. ``It doesn't look 
like I will be able to go, but I'm still hoping the Lord will work 
it out,'' she said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. spellers wonder if Jamaica isn't taking the bee a bit  
too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jody-Anne was really nice and that's why I feel bad about it.  
I think they are really great spellers,'' says former contestant 
Yan Zhong, 13, of Vero Beach, Fla. ``But I guess they broke the 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Glen Archer, a high school religious studies teacher  
who has coached nearly a dozen spelling champs in Jamaica, says he 
expects excellence from his students. But he says Jamaica must 
accept the decision and look to the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do my work well. It's taken very seriously here. If people  
want to call that a spelling bee factory, that's their problem,'' 
Archer says. Then he quotes Ecclesiastes 9:10: ``Whatsoever thy 
hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.''

<HEADLINE> NYSE Expects More Foreign Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange, expecting a surge  
in the number foreign companies listing on the NYSE, will open a 
foreign trading room in June 2000 when it moves to its new 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE chairman Richard Grasso said Tuesday he expects a 25  
percent increase in the number of foreign companies on the exchange 
this year as more U.S. companies merge with global competitors and 
emerging countries privatize their industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign trading floor will be open far beyond the normal  
exchange hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Grasso said. When the 
new trading room opens, investors will be able to buy and sell 
shares from 5 a.m. until 10 p.m. or midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	While looking ahead to greater foreign representation on the  
NYSE, Grasso recalled the ``moment when globalization came to U.S. 
markets,'' when DaimlerChrysler AG's new global shares began 
trading on his exchange on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Daimler Chrysler is a German-based company, its shares  
trade in dollars on the NYSE like stock in any U.S. company. 
Traditionally, foreign companies issue American Depositary 
Receipts, which represent a certain number of the company's common 
shares held by a bank or clearing house. 
</P>
<P>
	``With DaimlerChrysler we saw, for the first time, a truly  
global equity,'' Grasso said at a conference sponsored by the 
Conference Board, a business research group. 
</P>
<P>
	While other foreign companies have been slow to embrace the new  
global shares, international mergers continue to make weekly 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's largest cellular company, last  
week offered $55 billion for San Francisco-based AirTouch 
Communications Inc. Two weeks ago, British Petroleum PLC completed 
its merger with Amoco Corp. And Deutsche Bank is expected to 
complete its acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp. in the first half 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, emerging countries like Brazil, China and Russia are  
selling off state-owned industries in record numbers. Brazil's 
telephone company, Telebras, for example, was split up in into a 
dozen publicly held companies late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the NYSE is still the largest stock market in the world,  
it no longer dominates capital markets. Twenty-five years ago, the 
companies traded on the NYSE accounted for 80 percent of the 
world's capitalization value, but today it controls just half. The 
NYSE faces fierce competition from exchanges in London, Germany and 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a move to protect their competitive position,'' said  
Samuel Hayes, a finance professor at Harvard Business School. 
``More of the companies they trade on their exchange are not on 
East Coast time, and their investors aren't.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson To Resign From Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three rings were enough for Jimmy Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	He planned to resign today from the Miami Dolphins and doesn't  
think he'll coach again, his father said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunning development came less than a week after the  
Dolphins were eliminated from the NFL playoffs with a 38-3 loss in 
Denver. The most lopsided postseason loss in franchise history 
spoiled Miami's bid to play at home in the Super Bowl on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy told me he was ready to retire and wanted to start  
enjoying himself,'' C.W. Johnson said from his home in Port Arthur, 
Texas. ``He said the season wore on him. I told him I was glad and 
that was the best news I had heard in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 55, coached the Miami Hurricanes to the 1987 national  
championship and led the Dallas Cowboys to consecutive Super Bowl 
titles in 1992-93. He was hired by the Dolphins in January 1996 and 
said he would have the team in the NFL title game in three years, 
but he won only one playoff game with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	His expected resignation as coach and general manager was first  
reported by Fox Sports News. According to the elder Johnson, his 
son said ``this is it for him in coaching. He said he was going 
down to his place in the Florida Keys and work on his house down 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has two years remaining on the original five-year  
contract he signed with Miami. Following Saturday's loss, Johnson 
talked optimistically about next season, but he hasn't met with the 
media since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Johnson's mother, Allene, on Dec. 20 may have been  
a factor in his decision, and his father has been battling cancer. 
Johnson also complained frequently during the past season about 
officiating, media criticism and the attitudes of modern players. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation means 10 of the 31 NFL teams, including  
expansion Cleveland, have had to look for a new coach since the 
season ended. Johnson's departure would leave five teams with 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, in California to complete the  
sale of his Florida Marlins baseball team, rushed back to Miami and 
was expected to meet with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox reported that Johnson would meet with his coaches this  
morning and then with quarterback Dan Marino before holding a news 
conference to announce his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins media relations coordinator Neal Gulkis said no news  
conference had been scheduled as of late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anything about it,'' Gulkis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson worked for Fox in 1994-95 during a hiatus from coaching.  
C.W. Johnson said his son said: ``Well, I guess I never got it out 
of my system, but I've got it out of my system now. I think this is 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami made steady progress after Johnson replaced Don Shula. The  
Dolphins went 8-8 in his first season, 9-7 in 1997 and 10-6 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached the playoffs in 1997 and earned their first playoff  
victory in four years this season, beating the Buffalo Bills 24-17. 
Johnson's competitive zeal seemed as intense as ever after that 
game, when he celebrated by crushing a box of Flutie Flakes in the 
locker room, an act that he subsequently apologized for. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said recently that he believes Miami needs only a couple  
of offensive playmakers to join the NFL's elite. Following the 
Denver debacle, he said he didn't consider the loss devastating, 
but said Miami simply must earn a higher seed in next season's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our players that you need to win enough games during  
the season to get a bye, get people healthy and get ready for an 
opponent,'' Johnson said. ``We didn't win enough games during the 
season to get that advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson simplified the team playbook this season to put more  
emphasis on the run and less pressure on the 37-year-old Marino, 
but the offense frequently sputtered. The defense, however, allowed 
the fewest points in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of late-season injuries and playing at Denver were too  
much for the Dolphins to overcome. Johnson was uncharacteristically 
pessimistic before the game, saying the Dolphins faced almost 
insurmountable odds to win the Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jordan Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The NBA's greatest player made it official today.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls after 13 seasons,  
six championships and countless soaring dunks. But he left open the 
slightest possibility that he might return one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, I'm exhausted. I don't feel I have a challenge,''  
Jordan said at a news conference at the United Center, where a 
bronze statue of him stands outside. ``Physically, I feel great. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect time for me to walk away from the game. I'm  
at peace with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he was ``99.9 percent'' sure he would never return  
and added, ``You can read that for what it's worth. ... I'm very 
secure in my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed why he wouldn't say he was 100 percent certain,  
Jordan said: ``Because it's my 1 percent and not yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Jordan's retirement broke late Monday, but he had  
refused to comment until today. After leading the Bulls to their 
sixth championship in June, Jordan said he would make an 
announcement on his future only once the NBA lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The players and owners reached a deal last week to save what's  
left of the season, and everyone's next question was whether Jordan 
would return. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan era included five MVP awards, 10 scoring titles, 12  
All-Star appearances and many magic moments, from last-second shots 
to phenomenal scoring outbursts. More important, Jordan had charm 
and a nice-guy image that earned him multimillion-dollar 
sponsorship deals and reached even non-sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to be the best basketball player I could be,'' said  
Jordan, who was joined by his wife, Juanita, Bulls chairman Jerry 
Reinsdorf and NBA commissioner David Stern. ``I've had a great 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan alluded to his first retirement in 1993, when he briefly  
pursued a professional baseball career before returning late in the 
1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we do this again, a second time,'' he said to open the  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Bulls unveiled a banner in the rafters from  
Jordan's first retirement. It said ``Jordan 1984-1993'' -- but it 
will now have to be updated. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had lost his desire to play, he said: ``The desire  
is always going to be there.'' But he said he wanted to make sure 
that the desire was there ``not one-fourth of the time I step onto 
the court, but every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who had a bandage on his right index finger, said he  
severed a tendon while trying to cut a cigar and would need 
surgery. But he said he had already decided to retire before the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to enjoy life and do things I've never done  
before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he looked forward to being a parent and would ``live  
vicariously through my kids,'' whether or not they played 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life will take a change,'' said Jordan, adding that he also  
will tend to his many business interests. He makes an estimated $45 
million a year from endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Added his wife: ``I see Michael doing a lot more carpooling.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf called Jordan's announcement ``a tough day for  
basketball fans all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day I hoped would never come,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Countered Stern: ``I disagree with Jerry. This is a great day.  
The greatest basketball player in the history of the game is 
getting the opportunity to retire with the grace that described his 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked after the news conference how the league would survive  
after the nasty six-month lockout and Jordan's retirement, Stern 
said: ``We're going to be in fine shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House today, President Clinton said Jordan had ``a  
remarkable set of qualities of mind, body and spirit ... who always 
expected to do whatever it was he tried to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's appropriate that the sports fans around America  
take a day or two to `Ooh' and `Ahh' and hold their breath again 
and be glad again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, 35, said he hoped the Bulls would re-sign teammate  
Scottie Pippen but added that was only his opinion and that he 
didn't know what decisions the team would make. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set high standards around here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan met with a few teammates at his home Monday and told them  
the thought of playing an abbreviated, 50-game season wasn't enough 
of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jordan goes out as he always wanted -- on top. His  
last-second shot -- the last one he ever took -- gave the Bulls a 
victory over the Utah Jazz and their sixth title. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a way to go out as an athlete, and that's the way to  
go out,'' said B.J. Armstrong, one of about a dozen players working 
out Tuesday at the Berto Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who now plays with Charlotte, is a good friend of  
Jordan's and a teammate on Chicago's first three NBA championship 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out on top, he made the last shot, he made all the  
right plays. He's had a fabulous career and everything you could 
ever ask as an athlete, he's done. He had a chance to leave and 
this was the chance,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Bach, an assistant coach on three of the Bulls'  
championship teams, praised Jordan for not only his skill, but for 
the joy he brought to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never looked like he'd been sentenced by a judge to play  
basketball,'' Bach said. ``I've seen too many athletes not go out 
at the right time. They stay and struggle and lose some of the 
dignity they are entitled to.''

<HEADLINE> Declining Dollar Hurting Japan More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar has lost more than a third of its  
value against the yen since last summer, but for now, the country 
that seems to be worrying the most about it is Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The strengthening yen is hurting Japanese exporters like Toyota  
and Sony just when Japan's economy is mired in its deepest 
recession since World War II. That helps explain why Japan's 
central bank sold yen for dollars Tuesday in an effort that lifted 
the U.S. currency, at least briefly, from the 28-month lows reached 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's fall from August's eight-year highs isn't expected  
to show up soon on stickers of Japanese cars and price tags of 
VCRs, but travelers returning to Japan for the first time since 
last summer may find their dollar buys a lot less in an already 
expensive country to visit. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, U.S. financial authorities do not appear to see the  
dollar's slide as a threat. Despite frequent assertions from top 
U.S. officials in favor of a strong dollar, there was no sign that 
the Federal Reserve joined the Bank of Japan in propping up the 
dollar in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insisted the  
administration's advocacy of a strong dollar remains in place. 
``I'll just repeat what I've said so often, which is a strong 
dollar has served us well and our dollar policy is absolutely 
unchanged,'' he told reporters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, currency experts agree that the shift in the dollar's  
fortunes against the yen is being felt far more in Japan than in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a bigger issue for Japan, where the economy is in a much  
more precarious situation,'' said Bob Sinche, a currency strategist 
at Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's surge from historic lows in 1995 through last  
summer's peak has bolstered the U.S. economy by helping to keep the 
prices of imported goods low. By curbing inflation, the strong 
dollar has given the Federal Reserve leeway to lower interest 
rates. Three rapid-fire rate cuts last fall are keeping borrowing 
costs low and have been a factor behind the stock market's rally 
and keeping alive the American economy's second-longest expansion 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But a prolonged slump in the dollar could also be felt in the  
United States. Eventually, Japanese manufacturers would be forced 
to raise prices for goods sold in the United States even though it 
would make it easier for American companies to compete in the 
Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade tensions already are high between the countries, with the  
United States on Tuesday warning Japan to act quickly to halt a 
flood of cheap steel shipments to U.S. markets or face trade 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	By making U.S. stocks and bonds less attractive to international  
investors, a weak dollar already has led to higher interest rates 
on U.S. bond markets. It could also push down American stock prices 
if foreigners start pulling money out. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, rising bond yields in Japan appear to be  
leading some major investors there to keep their money at home. 
This trend may be accelerating with the end of the Japanese fiscal 
year coming up in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor weighing down on the dollar is the prolonged  
impeachment battle in Washington. ``Any time you have a crisis of 
confidence in the leadership of a country, the currency suffers,'' 
said David DeRosa, former currency trader who now teaches 
international finance at Yale School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
	The deep economic problems in Brazil, a close neighbor to the  
United States, are also seen as a negative for the dollar. The 
sharp declines in Brazilian stocks this week, including a plunge of 
nearly 8 percent plunge Tuesday, have been keeping the dollar 
reined in, currency traders say. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the political problems in Washington and the economic  
woes in Latin America, many experts agree that most of the reasons 
for the dollar's volatility against the yen has more to do with 
Japan than with the United States. They point out that the dollar 
has hardly changed at all against other major currencies such as 
the British pound and Canadian dollar since last August, when it 
began falling against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a yen volatility story rather than a dollar  
volatility story,'' said Citicorp's Sinche. ``It was an overshoot 
on one side, and now we're getting an overshoot in the other 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's decline against the yen has also come at the same  
time as the birth of Europe's new unified currency, but it does not 
appear that the euro has established itself as a challenger to the 
dollar as the world's dominant currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But the advent of the euro is clearly of prime concern to Japan,  
which fears that the euro could supplant the yen as the world's No. 
2 currency after the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's intervention in currency markets came just  
as Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was wrapping up a trip to Europe 
during which he called for greater stability in currency markets.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rehnquist Demands Preparation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment lawyers can stay on Chief Justice  
William H. Rehnquist's good side by following a few rules: Be 
prepared. Speak plainly. And for heaven's sake, get his title 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take care not to waste anyone's time,'' advised Charles  
Cooper, a former law clerk to Rehnquist who has frequently argued 
before the Supreme Court. ``Keep the matter focused because the 
chief has a real knack for not letting a proceeding meander into 
irrelevant details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice often sharply rebukes lawyers who misstep  
during Supreme Court arguments. Even Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr drew a verbal slap when, as the Justice Department's top 
courtroom lawyer, he argued a case in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me share with you a bit of the record in the case,'' Starr  
began, and within seconds Rehnquist cut in: ``Why don't you just 
tell us about the record, rather than share it with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton's impeachment trial is new territory and  
it's unknown whether Rehnquist, as presiding officer, will be as 
strict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we don't have any conventions,'' said Northwestern  
University law professor Tom Merrill. ``He might be much more 
forgiving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, impeachment trial lawyers will have much more  
than the standard half-hour for each side in a Supreme Court 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	When lawyers' time runs out at the court, Rehnquist doesn't  
hesitate to cut them off in mid-sentence. With 24 hours allowed in 
the Senate for each side to initially lay out their case, the chief 
justice might have less reason to move things along. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Rehnquist's impeachment trial duties is to rule on which  
evidence can be admitted. But there are few standards to guide him. 
He can rule evidence irrelevant or repetitive, and he can bar 
leading questions -- and then the senators can overrule him with a 
simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it's the senators, not Rehnquist, who will decide  
whether Clinton is convicted of perjury or obstruction of office 
and removed from office. When it's time to vote, Rehnquist's job is 
to ask each senator for his or her judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist might not let a lawyer get away with evading a  
difficult question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very smart and he knows when somebody is answering a  
question or not answering a question,'' said Carter Phillips, a 
frequent advocate before the highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice, a trim 6-foot-2-inches tall, might stand up  
now and then during trial proceedings to stretch his back. He 
underwent back surgery in 1995, and at the Supreme Court he 
occasionally goes behind the curtain in back of the bench, where he 
can still hear the arguments over loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he can seem stern on the bench, Rehnquist isn't stuffy.  
Friends know him as a regular but bad poker player who enjoys small 
bets on sports or even on how deep the snow outside is. When Warren 
Burger was chief justice, then-Justice Rehnquist surprised him with 
an elaborate April Fool's Day joke by arranging for a street 
photographer to stand outside the court with a life-size cutout of 
Burger, offering tourists the chance to pose with it for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate chamber, Rehnquist is expected to be more  
restrained than he usually is when hearing arguments at the Supreme 
Court and to try to avoid having a major effect on the trial's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``One great mystery is why the chief justice is there'' at all,  
since the senators control the significant decisions, said 
Georgetown law professor David Cole, suggesting one reason might be 
that ``his presence underscores the solemnity of the process and 
puts everyone on their best behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said  
Rehnquist's job is an easy one in a way because ``he's got a role 
without authority, without power.'' He could step in, however, if 
it appeared senators were bent on railroading the president, 
Gillers added. 
</P>
<P>
	And what should Rehnquist's title be? At the court, he is ``Mr.  
Chief Justice,'' and attorneys who call him ``Justice Rehnquist'' 
are likely to be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	In the impeachment trial, ``Mr. Presiding Officer'' might also  
be appropriate, as would ``Mr. President'' because the chief 
justice is serving as temporary president of the Senate. If in 
doubt, a lawyer can't go wrong with the generic ``Your honor.''

	Stocks End Down; Dow Off 125.12  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower going into the close but above  
their worst levels of the day, after Brazil's devaluation of its 
currency ignited a sharp but brief sell-off in morning trading. The 
Dow Jones industrial average closed down 125.12 at 9,349.56. It had 
been as low as 9,213.10, down 261.58, in the first hour of trading. 
Declining issues led advancers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was heavy. The Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 composites both opened lower and sank in early trading, moved 
up into positive territory this afternoon, but sank back near the 
close. The Nasdaq fell 3.43 to 2,317.32.

	Markets Shudder on Brazil Bank News  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's central banker  
unexpectedly resigned today and his successor devalued the currency 
by 7.6 percent, roiling world financial markets. Many feared the 
economic contagion could spread through Latin America and even 
threaten the United States. Wall Street fell sharply after the 
announcement that Central Bank chief Gustavo Franco had stepped 
down. Investors worry that if Brazil falls, Latin America's largest 
economy and most populous country could drag others in the region 
into the maelstrom. Stocks recovered some of the lost ground later. 
An estimated 2,000 American businesses operate in Brazil, including 
giants IBM, Coca Cola, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. U.S. 
banks have a $27 billion stake in Brazil, and weak operations 
overseas could pinch profits back home.

	Apple's Quarterly Profit Triples  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc., buoyed by sales of its  
hot new iMac computer, today reported its quarterly profit more 
than tripled, easily beating Wall Street forecasts. It was Apple's 
fifth straight money-making quarter, confirming expectations set 
last week by interim chief executive Steve Jobs. Apple said it 
earned $152 million, or 95 cents a share on a diluted basis, in the 
three months ended Dec. 26, 1998. That was up from a profit of $47 
million, or 33 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago period. 
Revenues grew 8 percent to $1.71 billion from $1.58 billion. The 
company sold 519,000 of the colorful iMac computers since they went 
on sale last August. Apple shares on the Nasdaq finished up 3/8 at 
46 1/2. The earnings report was issued after the market closed.

	Producer Prices Decline in 1998  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices charged by producers such as factories,  
food-processing plants and oil refineries edged down 0.1 percent in 
1998, declining for a record second consecutive year. Economists 
are predicting modest hikes this year. ``Prices will firm in 1999 
as the world economy stabilizes, but I don't think they'll rise to 
any significant degree,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional 
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. Prices plunged 1.2 
percent in 1997, the steepest drop in 11 years, and slipped further 
in 1998 as the world economic slump depressed demand for oil, 
manufactured goods and farm commodities. The two years marked the 
first back-to-back drops in the Labor Department's Producer Price 
Index since the department began compiling it in 1947.

the company's top executive said today. The one factor that will 
remain constant, said Bernard J. Ebbers, MCI Worldcom's president 
and CEO, is his company's association with sports great Michael 
Jordan, who retired from pro basketball today. ``We knew he would 
not be playing basketball for 10 years when we entered into the

they inflated corporate earnings and took $4.6 million in 
kickbacks. Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
accused Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb in a lawsuit of 
siphoning off money for themselves by inflating invoices paid to 
vendors. Drabinsky, Livent's former chairman and chief executive, 
and Gottlieb, former president, allegedly had a senior vice 
president, Gordon Eckstein, write off most of the $4.6 million as 
pre-production expenses. Eckstein also was named in the SEC 
lawsuit, as were five other former company executives.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc., the huge  
telecommunications equipment maker, is buying Ascend Communications 
Inc. for about $20 billion in stock in a deal that could reshape 
the market for telecommunications equipment. The deal announced 
today was approved by the boards of both companies yesterday and is 
expected to be completed by early summer. Lucent, spun off from the 
AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1996, is among the oldest suppliers of traditional 
equipment used by telephone companies. Ascend is a major supplier 
of computer networking gear.

	ABC Union Lockout May Be Ending  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The end seemed in sight today for ABC's  
10-week-old lockout of 2,400 behind-the-scenes workers, as union 
leaders awaited an answer from network management on a key 
provision. Agreement on contract and back-to-work terms was nearly 
complete, said Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the National 
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. ``We're ready 
to go in at the next shift.'' NABET represents camera operators, 
producers and editors at ABC who have been working without a 
contract since March 31, 1997. After they staged a one-day strike 
over health benefits on Nov. 2, ABC locked them out of their jobs 
until they promised advance warning on future job actions. NABET 
refused. ``What the union offered Monday to the company was an 
ironclad guarantee against spontaneous disruption of network 
operations,'' Donahue said.

multinational corporation should be protected as an expression of 
free speech. Dave Morris, 44, and Helen Steel, 33, are seeking to 
overturn a 1997 judgment that they had defamed McDonald's by 
distributing pamphlets entitled ``What's wrong with McDonald's? 
Everything they don't want you to know.'' At the start of their 
appeal at the Royal Courts of Justice yesterday, Morris and Steel 
told the three-judge panel that Britons should be free to criticize 
corporations in the same way they can criticize government

<HEADLINE> The Philosophy of STD Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Knowing what mattered to poor black and Hispanic women in one  
Texas city helped counselors make almost a 40 percent difference in 
the number reinfected with sexually transmitted diseases, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS, gonorrhea, chlamydia and other STDs are far more common  
among minorities than among whites. Clinic workers have found that 
it is harder to get women to stop doing things that put them at 
risk than it is to get men to change. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochelle Shain's group at the University of Texas found a way to  
deal with that, according to today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Before researchers began counseling women for this study, they  
spent 18 months looking at local black and Hispanic life, cultures, 
values, beliefs, behavior and knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	They then enrolled 617 women who were being treated for STDs at  
clinics in the San Antonio area. The women were divided into two 
groups, and the researchers looked at the numbers who came down 
with a second STD. 
</P>
<P>
	One group got standard counseling. The other group's counselors  
got the benefit of the research. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the researchers found that cleanliness, including  
not ``eating behind'' others -- sharing their plates or silverware -- 
is important among blacks. So the counselors explained that just as 
it is important not to eat or drink behind someone, you don't want 
to have sex ``behind someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The infection rate in the experimental group was 34 percent less  
than that in the control group at six months, 49 percent less at 12 
months, and 38 percent less overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shain cautioned that people who want to help other groups  
would have to study them, to learn what they feel is important. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not look at AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Fed Mob Trial Nets One Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- The federal trial of nine men accused of  
participating in a murderous battle to seize control of a New 
England crime family has ended with just one conviction -- on 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors couldn't reach a decision on more than half of the 34  
counts, and prosecutors said they plan to retry those charges 
against seven of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult to get 12 people to come to the same  
conclusion,'' said juror Linda McManus. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had attempted to prove that the defendants, indicted  
nearly two years ago, had waged a five-year plot to wrest control 
of the Patriarca crime family. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities contended the suspects tried to kill reputed mob  
boss Francis ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme outside a restaurant in 
Saugus in 1989, and later succeeded in killing three of his 
associates. Most of the violence occurred over an eight-month 
period in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kill a few of them (Salemme loyalists) and the rest of them  
will scatter,'' Robert F. ``Bobby Russo'' Carrozza, the purported 
ringleader, told two codefendants, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrozza was acquitted of a firearms-related charge and jurors  
couldn't agree on three racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The only man convicted was Anthony Ciampi, found guilty of  
illegal gambling in poker games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors began their deliberations on Dec. 17, and had to wade  
through nearly three months of testimony, including 100 witnesses 
and 300 exhibits.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Prepare To Land New Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- H. Wayne Huizenga and John Henry met in  
the hotel lobby and shook hands. Huizenga's ownership of the 
Florida Marlins was about to end and Henry's was about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	After turning the Marlins from a World Series champion into a  
doormat, Huizenga is selling the team to Henry for $150 million, 
$55 million more than Huizenga paid as an expansion fee. 
</P>
<P>
	No opposition has emerged to the deal, which was agreed to Nov.  
6. Commissioner Bud Selig expects a vote tonight or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga founded the team, which began play in 1993, but became  
convinced the team needed a new ballpark with a retractable roof 
and got angry when government officials wouldn't fund a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the Marlins beat Cleveland in Game 7 of the 1997  
World Series, Huizenga ordered a payroll purge unprecedented in 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's payroll dropped from $52.5 million to $19.1 million,  
and the Marlins went 54-108, the worst record ever for a defending 
champion and the poorest record in the NL since 1969. Just four 
players remain from the World Series roster: Antonio Alfonseca, 
Craig Counsell, Cliff Floyd and Livan Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, a commodities trader from Boca Raton, Fla., wants a new  
ballpark and says that if the government doesn't pay for it, he 
would provide the money himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed $75 million purchase of the Kansas City Royals by  
Miles Prentice's group from the estate of Ewing Kauffman will not 
be voted on this week. Prentice and the Royals announced the deal 
Nov. 13, but his group has more than two dozen investors, 
necessitating months of background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meetings, Selig will tell owners he intends to start  
stricter enforcement of baseball's 60-40 rule -- a team's debt can't 
exceed 40 percent of its assets -- which he hopes will restrain 
spending on players by high-revenue teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Dodgers signed pitcher Kevin Brown to a $105 million,  
seven-year contract last month, some small markets have said they 
have no chance and are pushing for change after the 2001 season, 
when the collective bargaining agreement is likely to expire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of initiatives underway, but that's for the  
future,'' Selig said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan to switch authority over umpires from the American and  
National leagues to the commissioner's office, originally scheduled 
for a vote this week, was put off and won't go into effect until 
2000 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have a labor contract with the AL and NL, not the  
commissioner's office. If owners switched authority without the 
umpires' approval, they would have been liable for up to $400,000 
per umpire in termination pay, according to a baseball official 
familiar with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor deal with umpires expires after this season and a  
switch is likely next year. Selig wants umpires to report to former 
Oakland president Sandy Alderson, the new executive vice president 
for baseball operations of the commissioner's office.

<HEADLINE> CBS Premieres'60 Minutes II' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First things first: The watch ticks here, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years after ``60 Minutes'' signed on, CBS finally got  
around to spinning off a second weekly edition of the venerable 
news magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The much-awaited ``60 Minutes II,'' which premiered Wednesday on  
CBS, clearly aims to be a clone of the original, and, based on 
opening night, is poised to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	With executive producer Jeff Fager at the helm, ``II'' felt  
instantly familiar and mostly satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
	You know the components like the back of your hand. The ``tick,  
tick, tick.'' The magazine cover (revealing a Roman numeral II when 
the corner of the ``page'' dog-ears). A correspondent introducing 
each story, with a magazine layout as background. Three stories 
told grippingly and with no nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like the old original on Sunday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Even Mike Wallace was on hand for the ``II'' kickoff, updating a  
story he did 17 years ago on Vietnam children fathered by American 
servicemen and left behind after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly enough, this ```60 Minutes' Classic'' (to be a regular  
feature) was the hour's only disappointment: the reprised report 
dragged in its retelling and the update, although heartwarming, was 
predictable. The idea has promise, however, especially as ``II'' 
gets off the ground: a little nourishment from the other show's 
archives and stars can't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the other two pieces had ``60 Minutes''-worthy  
payoffs. And they featured two from ``II's'' own team, which 
includes correspondents Dan Rather, Charlie Rose, Bob Simon and 
Vicki Mabrey, as well as contributor Carol Marin. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in time for the Senate's impeachment trial of President  
Clinton, Marin profiled David Schippers in ``Leading the Charge.'' 
Marin showed how, as the chief Republican investigator on the House 
Judiciary Committee, this Irish-Catholic Democrat has played a 
major, yet low-profile, role in the Republican drive to remove 
Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rather narrated ``Secret City.'' It told of a Siberian  
metropolis not visible on any map whose 100,000 citizens, since the 
1950s, have been covertly manufacturing plutonium for nuclear 
bombs. And still are. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS reporter George Crile and a film crew were granted unique  
access not only to this phantom city but to its nuclear reactor 
buried deep inside a mountain. There workers are still making 
plutonium, Rather intoned -- ``enough to heat their city and enough, 
every three days, to make another bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One more thing: Before the final ``tick, tick, tick,'' this  
broadcast's surrogate Andy Rooney, humorist Jimmy Tingle, offered 
the first installment of what he calls ``Uncommon Sense.'' He 
reflected on the peculiar happenings of 1998, among them that 
``Newt Gingrich resigned, practicing what he preached: term 
limits.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	A wintry mix of rain, sleet and snow was roaming over portions  
of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast today as powerful snow clouds 
stretched from Illinois to northern New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Further south, a narrow band of freezing rain and sleet was  
forecast from central Missouri, east and north through central 
Ohio, and into central Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for  
freezing rain in central Ohio and a winter weather advisory for 
snow and mixed precipitation in the rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was predicted from the lower Mississippi Valley, into the  
southern Ohio Valley, and across the mid-Atlantic states. Dense fog 
should loom over the region all day. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas from eastern Texas to southern Mississippi could have a  
good chance of thunderstorms, with an inch of rain, powerful winds 
and hail. Florida, Georgia and South Carolina were expected to be 
balmy. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure over the West was building and areas of the  
central and southern Plains were forecast to see clearing skies. 
Snow was set to dapple areas from the northern Plains through the 
northern and central Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the forecast calls for highs in the teens, 20s and 30s in  
New England, the eastern Great Lakes and from the Canadian boarder 
to South Dakota; in the 40s and 50s along the mid-Atlantic coast, 
Ohio Valley and central and southern Plains; in the 50s and 60s 
across the lower Mississippi Valley, southern Rockies, California 
and the Southeast; and in the 70s in Texas and the deserts of 
Arizona and New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> MediaNews, Donrey Papers Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- William Dean Singleton is adding 10 daily  
newspapers to a dozen he already owns in California, acquiring 
control of Donrey Media Group properties in what he calls a ``true 
merger into a partnership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No money will change hands when the Donrey newspapers in  
northern California and in greater Los Angeles become part of 
Singleton's MediaNews Group Inc. of Denver and its Garden State 
Newspapers subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close Feb. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	``We took our marbles, they took their marbles and we jumbled  
them all up,'' Singleton said Tuesday. ``Putting them both together 
gave us nice potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garden State Newspapers will own two-thirds of the new group and  
Donrey will own one-third. MediaNews Group will manage the group, 
which will publish 20 daily newspapers with a daily circulation of 
about 531,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 493,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the greater Los Angeles market, MediaNews already owns the  
Daily News of Los Angeles, Press-Telegram of Long Beach and three 
newspapers in the San Gabriel Valley east of downtown Los Angeles. 
The Daily News and Press-Telegram are not included in the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaNews' 22 daily newspapers in California will have a  
combined circulation of more than 830,000, Singleton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donrey newspapers include the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
of Ontario, the Vallejo Times-Herald, the Chico Enterprise-Record, 
The Hemet News, The Daily Democrat of Woodland, The Lompoc Record, 
the Ukiah Daily Journal, the Daily News of Red Bluff, the Oroville 
Mercury Register and the Redlands Daily Facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included are Donrey's non-daily Advocate-News of Fort Bragg  
and The Valley Times of Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Singleton's newspapers include the San Gabriel Valley Tribune of  
West Covina, The Whittier Daily News, the Star-News of Pasadena, 
The Oakland Tribune, The Daily Review of Hayward, the Tri-Valley 
Herald of Pleasanton, The Argus of Fremont, The Alameda Times-Star, 
The San Mateo County Times, and the Times-Standard of Eureka, plus 
23 non-daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Donrey's second-largest paper,  
has a circulation area adjoining that of Singleton's West Covina, 
Whittier and Pasadena papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Donrey, with headquarters in Fort Smith, Ark., is owned by  
Stephens Group Inc. of Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	'' While all of these newspapers are good newspapers on a  
stand-alone basis, operating together they will provide important 
new synergies,'' Singleton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about the opportunities,'' said Warren  
Stephens, president of Stephens Group. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaNews also owns The Denver Post and 37 other daily  
newspapers and 119 non-dailies in 13 states, mostly in the West and 
the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Donrey continues to own 14 other newspapers in eight states,  
including the Las Vegas Review Journal, and newspapers in Arkansas, 
North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma, Washington and Hawaii. 
It also owns an outdoor advertising company and KOLO-TV in Reno, 
Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, the Donrey Media Group sold 28 newspapers to  
Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. of Birmingham, Ala. Those 
newspapers are in Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, 
New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.

<HEADLINE> Ford Mum on Possible Volvo Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- As Ford Motor Co.'s board of directors gathered  
to hold its quarterly meeting today, speculation was growing that 
the world's No. 2 automaker was poised to acquire the automotive 
operations of Sweden's Volvo AB. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger speculation that has been rife throughout the industry  
for months has focused on a possible Volvo-Ford linkup since a 
report last week that Volvo had hired a Wall Street investment bank 
to explore a possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Volvo thing probably's going to break pretty soon,''  
analyst Stephen Girsky of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat of Italy and Germany's Volkswagen AG also have been named  
as possible suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's board meeting was to be held in Dearborn, the Detroit  
suburb where Ford is headquartered. Chief spokesman Vaughn 
Koshkarian declined to comment on the agenda or the Volvo rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jac Nasser, speaking at an industry conference Tuesday  
night, also declined to say whether Ford was negotiating with 
Volvo. But Nasser again said Ford was open to tapping its more than 
$20 billion cash reserve to expand the company's global reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the right price, we're always prepared to sit down and talk  
to anyone,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's acquisition of Chrysler Corp. by Daimler-Benz AG led  
to a flurry of talks among automakers looking to strengthen their 
position in an industry beset with too much production capacity 
worldwide. The conventional wisdom is that smaller automakers will 
be ill-equipped to compete in the 21st century as the industry 
becomes dominated by several international automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fundamentally believe the industry will consolidate  
further,'' Nasser said. ``I also very strongly believe that any 
company that is producing less than a million units a year probably 
won't survive in a robust fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that Volvo wants to sell off its car  
business only and retain its commercial truck and bus divisions. 
Ford, which just shed its commercial truck division in 1997, 
probably would be reluctant to get back into that business. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo, one of the world's smaller automakers, produces less than  
500,000 vehicles annually. Last year it sold 100,227 cars in the 
United States, one of its largest markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford reportedly has been courting debt-laden Nissan Motor Corp.  
as well, and turned down an offer last month for a 20 percent share 
in the Japanese automaker. Ford also lost in bidding late last year 
for financially troubled Kia Motors Corp. of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in any hurry to swap our hard-earned cash for  
someone else's hard-earned debt,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Ford and Volvo are a better fit.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Volvo thing is more plausible than anything else,'' said  
analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, which is becoming good at cost-effectively developing a  
variety of very different cars with the same basic chassis and 
major parts, could help Volvo expand its product line, Girsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could bring out smaller cars under the Volvo brand or  
sport utilities with the Volvo brand, you could command a premium 
price,'' he said. Ford has similarly expanded Jaguar's vehicle line 
since it bought the British luxury automaker in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Girsky, however, does not expect Ford to overbid for Volvo.  
</P>
<P>
	``They had every opportunity in the world to buy Kia Motors and  
they walked way from it because the price got to high,'' he said. 
``I don't think Ford needs Volvo; it would be nice to have Volvo, 
but only at the right price.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Statue Removed for Restoration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The golden statue of Prometheus that overlooks  
the Rockefeller Center skating rink is getting a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	The sculpture's dirty, scratched exterior will be regilded,  
while its mostly copper interior is corroded and will be repaired, 
said Marc Roussel of Roussel Studios, which is handling the 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue was hoisted by a crane from the sunken skating rink  
Monday and placed at street level outside NBC headquarters, where 
the tree stands during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-foot-tall, 8-ton sculpture, by Paul Manship, depicts  
Prometheus holding a ball of fire. It was first installed in 
January 1934, shortly after the Christmas tree tradition began. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the  
gods and gave it to humans. He was tethered to a mountain by Zeus 
as punishment, but was later freed. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue's restoration, expected to be completed this spring,  
is part of a larger renovation of Rockefeller Center.

<HEADLINE> Phila. Mayor Calls Pack GM a 'Jerk' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mayor Edward G. Rendell, saying he was sick  
of people using the city as a punching bag, threw a few jabs of his 
own Wednesday, calling Green Bay Packers general manager Ron Wolf a 
``jerk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell was upset about Wolf's comments during a Monday press  
conference to introduce former Eagles coach Ray Rhodes as the new 
coach of the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have any worse situation than be in Philadelphia,  
Pa., and be either a manager or a coach,'' Wolf said, dismissing 
the Eagles' 3-13 season as an aberration on Rhodes' coaching 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who had held his tongue when other cities criticized  
Philadelphia's selection to play host to the 2000 Republican 
National Convention, could no longer contain himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter faxed Wednesday to the Packers, Rendell wrote that  
while he admired Wolf's ``acumen as a judge of football 
personnel,'' he ``must reluctantly conclude that you are also a 
jerk.'' He also wrote that Wolf's comments were ``classless, 
clueless, and crass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor told reporters Wednesday that he was ``appalled'' that  
Wolf had trashed the city in front of a national audience, and was 
worried about the impact of Wolf's statements on Philadelphia's 
efforts to remake its image. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sick and tired of being used as a punching bag,'' Rendell  
said. ``I'm going to fight back.'' He said Wolf disparaged 
Philadelphia because ``he was looking for a way out of explaining 
to his media why he hired a 3-13 coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Rendell said Wolf ``would have shown a great deal  
more class if you told Packer fans about what a terrific person Ray 
Rhodes is, or how he became Coach of the Year while leading the 
Eagles to two 10-win seasons and an incredible playoff victory. ... 
But you chose not to, and rather, to insult our city and its 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the letter, Rendell offered Wolf and his wife an  
all-expenses-paid trip to Philadelphia during the Packers' bye 
weekend next season ``so you can see for yourself how badly you 
have misjudged us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Green Bay Packers said Wolf had read the  
letter but declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Concludes Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government concluded its sweeping  
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday after more than 
10 weeks at trial, highlighted by embarrassing e-mails and video 
showing a defiant Bill Gates arguing with government lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's first witness, an economist, testified that the  
company can't be considered to wield monopoly power -- a crucial 
distinction in antitrust law -- because it faces upstart competitors 
making rival computer operating systems, such as Linux and BeOS. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short run, those are not terrific alternatives,'' said  
Richard Schmalensee. ``In a year, or two years, the answer may well 
be different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies showed Schmalensee  
earlier sworn statements that he was ``not aware of anything that 
at present would count as viable competition'' for Microsoft's 
dominant Windows operating system, used by roughly 80 percent of 
the world's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee will be followed over the coming months by some of  
Microsoft's top executives -- but not Gates, its famous billionaire 
chairman. The trial, which began in late October, is likely to last 
into March. 
</P>
<P>
	In a final jab at Microsoft before they rested their case,  
government lawyers released more than 1,000 pages of new evidence -- 
mostly e-mails -- and more videotape of Gates during his sworn 
testimony last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States rests,'' Boies then told the judge.  
</P>
<P>
	``States conclude their case as well,'' said Stephen Houck of  
the New York attorney general's office, the lead lawyer for 19 
states joining Justice in suing Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	In a procedural move, Microsoft asked the judge to rule  
immediately in its favor. But even the company's lead lawyer, John 
Warden, wasn't hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have indeed forecast your decision, we are prepared to  
move ahead with our case,'' Warden offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have indeed,'' answered U.S. District Judge Thomas  
Penfield Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its final evidence, the government submitted more  
videotape of its deposition of Gates last summer. In it, Gates is 
asked whether he had once asked an employee to investigate the 
financial model of software competitor Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I did,'' Gates said. ``I'm quite certain I  
wasn't the one who asked for the information.'' Houck then showed 
Gates a December 1996 e-mail asking: ``What kind of data do we have 
about how much software companies pay Netscape?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houck also asked Gates during the deposition whether he was  
trying to disparage Netscape in mid-1996 when he talked about the 
company's opportunities for profits being ``not very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a goal to do that, and my only comments about  
Netscape's business would have come in response to direct questions 
about that topic from reporters,'' Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also released a July 1997 e-mail from Microsoft  
vice president Brad Chase considering whether the company might 
charge $49 for a version of the browser that eventually was 
included in Windows 98, in part because it ``starts getting people 
to think about everything won't be free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft challenged the government's last witness earlier  
Wednesday over claims that the company rewards some computer makers 
and punishes others by charging different prices for its Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends those price fluctuations help illustrate  
Microsoft's monopoly power, a distinction important to its claims 
that the company used predatory, anti-competitive behavior to 
``crush'' Netscape, a rival whose Internet software competed 
directly with Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the price differences are largely due to volume  
discounts given to companies that sell more computers, which is 
generally legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you name a single software vendor that doesn't  
price-discriminate?'' Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my general belief that this may or may not be a  
widespread practice. I just don't know,'' economist Franklin Fisher 
answered.

<HEADLINE> Apple's Quarterly Profit Triples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc., buoyed by sales of its  
hot new iMac computer, on Wednesday reported its quarterly profit 
more than tripled, easily beating Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Apple's fifth straight money-making quarter, confirming  
expectations set last week by interim chief executive Steve Jobs 
and suggesting a further rebound from two years of red ink at the 
personal computer pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple said it earned $152 million, or 95 cents a share on a  
diluted basis, in the three months ended Dec. 26, 1998. That was up 
from a profit of $47 million, or 33 cents a diluted share, in the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time gains, the company earned 78 cents a diluted  
share in the recent quarter, surpassing the 70 cents forecast by 
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released at the close of financial markets,  
after Apple stock rose Wednesday by 37 1/2 cents a share to $46.50 on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's revenues grew 8 percent to $1.71 billion from $1.58  
billion. The company sold 519,000 iMac computers, which now come in 
five colors, since they went on sale last August. The new brand 
became the top-selling desktop machine sold at retail in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says it's selling 32 percent of iMacs to first-time  
PC buyers, suggesting that Apple is successfully reaching beyond 
its core of loyal Macintosh users. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple chief financial officer Fred Anderson said the company  
plans to take unspecified steps to keep stores supplied if they run 
out of a popular color, but for now is selling iMacs in five-packs 
to retailers, with one computer of each color included. 
</P>
<P>
	``They clearly have tapped into a market that most of us  
suspected was there,'' said analyst Barry Jaruzelski, a partner 
with Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York, who said the earnings 
success was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of cute comments about the fruit basket  
colors, but the reason the thing is doing so well is that it's a 
great industrial design,'' he added, ``which is super easy to use 
and super easy to set up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs said in a statement that Apple's stock of unsold computers  
was a healthy two days, better than Dell Computer's 
industry-leading seven days of inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's sales in foreign countries accounted for 47 percent of  
the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac's unusual-looking translucent colored cover makes them  
stand out sharply on store shelves against traditional beige home 
PCs.

<HEADLINE> Lots of Bugs in Dog and Cat Bites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A dog's bugs can be worse than its bite.  
</P>
<P>
	Cultures from 107 infected dog and cat bites turned up 152 kinds  
of bacteria, including 10 not previously known to infect people, a 
study found. There were an average of five kinds of germs per bite. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the best study of the topic so far and should persuade  
doctors not to try the cheap route when treating infected bites, 
emergency physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
	The germs aren't dangerous unless the skin is broken, meaning  
it's probably OK to let your dog lick your face, as long as you can 
stand its breath. In fact, human bites are much more dangerous, in 
terms of germs transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a choice about being bitten, you don't want a  
person. Choose your cat,'' said Dr. Toni Mitchell of the American 
College of Emergency Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people get bitten every year. About 270,000 go to  
emergency rooms to have dog and cat bites treated, and about 9,000 
have to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the time, it's because of the damage to flesh and bone  
from the bite itself. However, infections can force amputation and 
even cause death. The class of germs found most often includes ones 
that can cause meningitis and blood infections. 
</P>
<P>
	This study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, looked at people treated for infected bites at 18 
emergency rooms around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of the germs they found took up a full page in small  
type. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly expands our knowledge in that area,'' said Dr.  
Robert McNamara, president of the American Academy of Emergency 
Medicine. And, he said, it shows that the broad-spectrum 
antibiotics usually prescribed for bites are the right treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of the patients treated at 18 emergency rooms  
did not get those drugs, said Dr. David A. Talan of UCLA Medical 
Center, the study's lead author. 
</P>
<P>
	``One concern with treating these infections is that the  
antibiotics you use are fairly expensive,'' McNamara said. 
``Sometimes people try to get away with the cheaper medicines, like 
penicillin alone. Hopefully, this will eliminate that 20 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers were struck by how quickly the infections can  
develop. The average time was 12 hours for cat bites and 24 hours 
for dog bites. Several bites took less than eight hours to show 
signs of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animals shouldn't be biting people. But since that's always  
going to happen sometimes, keep a close eye on infections,'' Talan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common sort of bug, found in half the dog bites and  
three-quarters of the cat bites, is pasteurella. Pasteurella germs 
can cause meningitis or blood infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer  
Inc.

<HEADLINE> Brazil News Sinks Grains, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, weighed down by economic troubles in 
Brazil and beneficial weather for competing crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat, corn and soybean prices suffered after Brazil effectively  
devalued its currency in a bid to halt a slide in Latin America's 
largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The move provided additional uncertainty to world financial  
markets that are struggling to recover from a global economic 
crisis. Economic troubles among some of the largest purchasers of 
U.S. farm products have stymied American exporters at a time when 
supplies are plentiful. The troubles in Brazil could trickle down 
to other Latin American economies, exacerbating weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were pressured by continued rains in  
Argentina, which were helping competing corn and soybean crops 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 7 1/4 cents to $2.74 1/4 a bushel; March  
corn fell 2 cents to $2.15 1/4 a bushel; March oats fell 2 1/2 cents to 
$1.06 a bushel; March soybeans fell 4 3/4 cents to $5.33 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures also retreated as world economic  
jitters affected traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle fell .17 cent to 62.15 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .60 cent to 72.32 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs fell 1.05 cents to 40.15 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell 1.8 cents to 53.42 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Former Buccaneer David Logan Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- David Logan, a nose tackle for the Tampa Bay  
Buccaneers who later was a color analyst for the team's flagship 
radio station, has died at age 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan died Tuesday night of a blood clot in the lungs, the team  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were shocked by it,'' said Rich McKay, general manager of  
the Buccaneers. ``He was a very unassuming guy. A true success 
story, but yet not one who ever really publicized his success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan joined the Buccaneers in 1979 after being drafted out of  
the University of Pittsburgh. He finished his Buccaneers career in 
1986 with a streak of 103 consecutive starts, a team record until 
C. Tony Mayberry surpassed it in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Honors Slain Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While Chicago and the nation were honoring him on  
his retirement, Michael Jordan took time out Wednesday to remember 
a Chicago police officer killed in a shootout over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said the fatal shooting of Officer John Knight on a South  
Side street Saturday ``puts a lot of things in perspective about 
what life is really about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to pass on my condolences from my family to his,''  
the Chicago Bulls superstar told a news conference called to 
announce his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan didn't mention Knight by name but it was plain he was  
referring to the 38-year-old officer who left a widow and three 
children. The case has been major news in Chicago for five days. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight's funeral Wednesday was attended by Mayor Richard M.  
Daley and top police brass as well as officers, FBI agents, state 
troopers and firefighters. Chicago police, many wearing white 
gloves, stood at attention and saluted while a bagpipe wailed 
mournfully as Knight's coffin was carried out of the church to a 
waiting hearse. 
</P>
<P>
	James Scott, 23, who had two previous drug arrests, has been  
charged with murder. Police say he opened fire after officers found 
crack cocaine in his car, fled and later was captured while hiding 
in a South Side attic.

<HEADLINE> Source: House Contacts Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of opening arguments in his trial,  
President Clinton said today he intends ``to spend as little time 
thinking about'' his impeachment as possible and focus instead on 
issues facing Americans. House prosecutors made their first contact 
with Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, The Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources familiar with the situation, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said a member of the House prosecution team made the 
contact within the previous 24 hours. They described it as an 
``initial inquiry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the sources works in the House. Lewinsky spokeswoman Judy  
Smith declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors have made clear they would like to call Ms.  
Lewinsky as a witness, but the senators must give their permission 
first. The issue will be resolved after both sides make their 
opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution team also contacted Kathleen Willey about a  
possible appearance as a witness. A legal source, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said the conversation touched on her 
allegation that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance, but mostly 
was about any possible intimidation to get her to change her story. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton's lawyers told senators in a legal brief that  
they had an ``obligation to turn away an unwise and unwarranted'' 
House impeachment that threatens the American democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote the American people rendered ... is hanging in the  
balance,'' the presidential lawyers said in their trial brief, 
arguing that there are no legal, constitutional or factual grounds 
for removal of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is strong agreement among constitutional and legal  
scholars and historians that the substance of the articles does not 
amount to impeachable offenses,'' the attorneys wrote. They said 
the allegations ``do not begin to satisfy the stringent showing 
required by our Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected president 
from office, either as a matter of fact or law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke for the first time about the crisis since his  
impeachment last month: ``I think the Senate has to deal with that. 
We filed our brief today. It makes our case. The important thing 
for me is to spend as little time thinking about that as possible 
and as much time working on the issues we are here to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have their job to do in the Senate and I have mine and I  
intend to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president indicated he has no plans to address the  
impeachment matter in his State of the Union speech Jan. 19. ``I 
think the American people have heard about that quite extensively 
and my understanding is that I should do their business,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., suggested today that Clinton  
should delay his State of the Union speech ``because of the 
awkwardness'' of the timing. A number of Republicans also have 
asked him to postpone the speech, but White House officials have 
said repeatedly it will go on as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The House filed papers today that contested the White House's  
legal assertions but did not make any expansive arguments. The 
papers contended the articles of impeachment ``properly state 
impeachable offenses,'' warrant Clinton's removal from office and 
disqualification from further office and are not 
``unconstitutionally vague'' as presidential lawyers argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sent to the Senate: all the public evidence in the case,  
including prosecutor Kenneth Starr's referral, votes of the House 
Judiciary Committee in executive session, all the materials from 
the Paula Jones case, transcripts of two telephone conversations 
between Linda Tripp and her friend Lucianne Goldberg, a government 
report on Starr's expenditures, audio tapes of Tripp's recordings 
of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky and material on the House 
impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House brief acknowledged that the testimony of Clinton  
and Ms. Lewinsky differed on some matters, such as the number of 
their encounters, the date of their first intimate contact and how 
the relationship was conducted. But the brief said, ``These 
squabbles are utterly immaterial ... precisely the kind of 
disagreement that the law does not intend to capture as perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House officials indicate the impeachment case will be prosecuted  
like a conspiracy, alleging that the president schemed to keep Ms. 
Lewinsky from revealing their extramarital affair and ultimately 
plotted to ruin her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts will move from written pages to the Senate chamber  
Thursday when the House opens its presentation. There, television 
cameras will show Americans their first live presidential 
impeachment trial and record the proceedings for history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 130-page White House brief offered a preview of the case  
that Clinton's attorneys will present in defending him against 
perjury and obstruction of justice charges in the Senate 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has an obligation to turn away an unwise and  
unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of impeachment,'' the 
president's lawyers said in their brief today. ``If the Senate 
removes this president for a wrongful relationship he hoped to keep 
private, for what will the House ask the Senate to remove the next 
president and the next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brief said that removing Clinton on the basis of the  
allegations facing him would ``substantially alter the delicate 
constitutional balance'' of power among the branches of government 
and ``move us closer to a quasi-parliamentary system in which the 
president is elected to office by the choice of the people but 
continues in office only at the pleasure of Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not simply the president -- but the vote the American  
people rendered in schools, church halls and other civic centers 
all across the land 26 months ago -- that is hanging in the 
balance,'' the lawyers said 
</P>
<P>
	The brief did not present new evidence. Instead, White House  
officials described it as the most comprehensive and detailed 
presentation to date about Clinton's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers argued that the articles of impeachment against  
Clinton ``fall far short of what the American people demand be 
shown and proven before their democratic choice is reversed.'' And 
in a slap at Starr and the House impeachment team, the brief said 
the charges ``fall far short of what a prudent prosecutor would 
require before presenting a case to a judge or jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to show a scheme to conceal the relationship and  
eventually destroy Ms. Lewinsky's reputation and credibility, the 
prosecutors plan to weave together conduct including: searching for 
a job for the former intern, hiding gifts she exchanged with 
Clinton, having her sign a false affidavit in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case against the president, possibly coaching 
presidential secretary Betty Currie and the president's making 
comments to aides that portrayed Ms. Lewinsky as the aggressor.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Defense Must Stop Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Don't look back. Well, at least not  
too far. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how the Minnesota Vikings' defense is handling this  
week's most pertinent question regarding Sunday's NFC championship 
matchup with Atlanta's punishing ground game. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Vikings are vulnerable, it's against a rugged rushing  
attack. Tampa Bay proved that Nov. 1, when it ran for a team-record 
246 yards and didn't punt once during a 27-24 victory over the 
Vikings, Minnesota's only loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	So with Jamal Anderson bringing 1,800-plus yards and a wicked  
stiff-arm to town this Sunday, are the Vikings studying their 
failures against the Buccaneers? 
</P>
<P>
	``Next question, man,'' nose tackle Jerry Ball said, clearly  
miffed by the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play like that and what they (Tampa Bay) did, naturally  
you're embarrassed, you're insulted,'' defensive coordinator Foge 
Fazio said. ``It's not very nice. You don't want those things to 
happen again, so they want to guard against that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings (16-1) have done just that.  
</P>
<P>
	Since Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott left skid marks on them, the  
Vikings have been outstanding against the run. They have given up 
over 100 yards just twice in nine games since Tampa Bay, allowing 
fewer than 77 yards a game in that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the course of a full season, that would have ranked third  
in the NFL. During that time, Minnesota's worst performance against 
the run -- 138 yards allowed -- came in a 50-10 victory over 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	That's called learning from mistakes. And while Vikings  
defenders don't mind being overshadowed by their prolific 
teammates, they know they cannot be overrun by Anderson and the 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a team that can play good defense can win in the  
playoffs,'' coach Dennis Green said. ``Offensively, there have been 
a lot of teams that have been high-flying offenses that didn't get 
a chance to start well because they couldn't stop people. You must, 
in my opinion, be able to stop the run. That's where it starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's where so many of Minnesota's recent seasons have  
unravelled. The Vikings declined precipitously in that category 
after leading the NFL in 1994, bottoming out last season when they 
ranked 23rd and allowed more than 123 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	In a divisional-round playoff loss at San Francisco, the 49ers  
burned Minnesota for 175 yards on 41 rushes. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what the Falcons hope to do. Their plan, as it has been  
all season, will be to pound Anderson at the Vikings. That not only 
opens passing lanes for Chris Chandler to find Terrance Mathis and 
Tony Martin, but it takes the fuse out of Minnesota's explosive 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson set an NFL record with 410 carries during the regular  
season, nearly 26 a game. He had 29 for 113 yards and two TDs in 
last weekend's victory over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we can do some other things offensively so I don't  
have to carry that many times,'' Anderson said. ``Obviously, we're 
probably looking at having 25 to 30 carries for sure. Hopefully not 
40. But I'll do whatever it takes to give us a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings' defenders are showing Anderson plenty of respect  
this week. Ball, who tied middle linebacker Ed McDaniel for the 
team and NFL lead with 15 tackles for losses during the regular 
season, said Anderson has the power of Natrone Means and the 
quickness of Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a big challenge for us to get behind the line of  
scrimmage and gang tackle,'' said McDaniel, a Pro Bowl backup. 
``When he cuts back, he has good balance. He has good vision where 
the hole is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's defense finished 13th in the NFL this season, 11th  
against the run, a tremendous improvement from 1997. The unit 
clearly has benefited from the offense's ability to jump out to 
quick leads and force teams away from their game plan, but the 
defense also has made a habit out of playing its best early in 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has allowed zero first-quarter points 10 times this  
season and no more than a field goal three other times. Meanwhile, 
the offense has been shut out in the first quarter just three 
times, all victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, how we play defense has not been totally  
understood,'' Green said. ``How we play offense has probably been 
somewhat overblown. If you look at the first quarter and take the 
average score, see how many times the opponent did not score in the 
first quarter. If you don't give up points in the first quarter, 
then you're well on your way to having a chance to win the ball 
game.''

<HEADLINE> Seat Spots in Senate Substantial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are obliged to remain silent, seated  
at their desks, during most of President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. And where they sit, like almost everything else in the 
Senate, is determined by one thing -- seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight mahogany desks became available due to retirements and  
election-night losses, but Democrats and Republicans have yet to 
agree among themselves about where their members will sit on their 
respective sides of the Senate aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when the trial resumes later today, and live television  
coverage begins, the four newcomers from each party will be seated, 
although not necessarily at desks they can call their own for the 
duration of their six-year terms, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of those seats changed hands, but Sens. Blanche Lincoln,  
D-Ark., and Michael Crapo, R-Idaho, retained them for their parties 
and could end up sitting where their predecessors did. The 
remaining 92 senators should be in their regular seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, though, seniority rules: That means the newest and  
most junior members typically occupy seats at the back of the 
ornate, blue-carpeted 19th century chamber. As their Senate stock 
rises, they can try to move closer to the central dais or to a more 
photogenic location, unless a more senior member claims the 
vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Or they can just stay put.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's all sorts of reasons why people choose to move or not  
to move,'' said Donald Ritchie, the associate Senate historian. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the 100 desks are arranged in a semicircular  
pattern. Seen from the dais, where Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
will preside over the trial, the 55 Republican senators sit to the 
left of the center aisle and the 45 Democrats to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	A front-row seat can be had by being elected to the leadership.  
The majority and minority leaders and their whips, or 
vote-counters, sit in the first row. 
</P>
<P>
	Once seating is determined, a brass plaque with the senator's  
name is affixed to the desk, Ritchie said. Tradition also calls for 
senators to carve their names inside the drawers as a way of 
letting senators know who preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the desks have very famous names,'' Ritchie said.  
``Some of them have very obscure names in them. I think it's 
interesting to the senators to open the drawers and realize who sat 
there before them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the body's most senior members can have their pick of  
choice seating, some have opted to remain on the back benches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in his seventh term, sits there  
and, for sentimental reasons, occupies a desk used by his brother, 
John F. Kennedy, until he was elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	Other veterans in the back row include Sens. Slade Gorton,  
R-Wash.; Dick Lugar, R-Ind.; Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., also in his 
seventh term; and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., whose desk will 
open up after he retires at the end of his term in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., occupies the desk used by Daniel  
Webster, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate but was a New 
Hampshire native. A 1974 Senate resolution assigned the desk to New 
Hampshire's senior senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, a 1995 Senate resolution linked Jefferson Davis' desk  
to Mississippi's senior senator, currently Republican Thad Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the tradition of the ``candy desk.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George Murphy, R-Calif., started it by encouraging  
colleagues to partake of the candy stashed in his drawer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie, the Senate historian, said the seat usually goes to the  
most junior Republican, who is obliged to continue providing 
sweets. The occupants ``usually don't stay there for more than a 
Congress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., the current occupant, ``enjoys  
having the responsibility of being the candy senator,'' said his 
spokesman, Robert Traynham. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected in 1994, Santorum has supplied Hershey's chocolates from  
his home state, jelly beans at Easter and candy corn for Halloween.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Makes Futures Development Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tammie Green, Meg Mallon and Karrie Webb all spent some time on  
the Futures Tour, a 19-tournament circuit that rarely pays more 
than $5,000 to the winner. Because of a new agreement with the 
LPGA, the tour can offer a little bit more. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a five-year deal announced Wednesday, the LPGA will use  
the Futures Tour as its official developmental tour and give its 
top three players exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the growing number of women worldwide entering the game,  
it was evident to me there was a growing chasm between amateur or 
collegiate golf and the LPGA Tour,'' commissioner Jim Ritts said. 
``This continues to ensure that potential stars are not being lost 
in that chasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is effective immediately. At the end of the year, the  
top three on the Futures Tour money list will earn their LPGA 
cards, while the next seven will automatically get into the final 
round of the LPGA qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
	It will similar to the men's Nike Tour, which has produced  
players like David Duval, John Daly, Jim Furyk and Tom Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he became the British Open champion and PGA player of the  
year in 1996, Lehman was bouncing around mini-tours in California 
and other tours around the world. He was on the verge of giving up 
the game to become a golf coach in Minnesota when he used the Nike 
Tour -- then known as the Hogan Tour -- as his road back to the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much less rich would the golf world be without Tom  
Lehman?'' Ritts said. ``He's probably selling skis without the 
Hogan tour. I know there's a need for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts and his staff have been working on a developmental tour  
for the past four years, trying to decide whether to start their 
own or sign up an existing tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Futures tour has been around for 19 years and now has 19  
tournaments from coast to coast, playing for a total purse of $1 
million. The agreement with the LPGA now offers its players a 
direct link to the LPGA and its $36 million in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relationship will be a catalyst to take women's golf to  
the next level,'' said Zayra Calderon, chief executive officer of 
the Futures Tour. ``We are thrilled that it has evolved into a 
national tour with recognized players and is a natural 
steppingstone to the LPGA Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 160 alumni of Futures events is Karrie Webb of  
Australia. She played the circuit in 1995, a year before she became 
the first rookie to win over $1 million on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this alliance is a positive situation for  
everyone,'' Ritts said. ``Potential stars will have a vehicle to 
hone their skills and an additional avenue to qualify for the LPGA, 
and the official relationship ensures the growth and depth of 
talent over the long term for women's golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that it has signed up as the official developmental tour for  
the LPGA, the Futures Tour is trying to find a corporate title 
sponsor, which would help increase purses and make it even more 
attractive to players who did not qualify for the LPGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to open up new markets for them, simply because  
it automatically opens a door to the LPGA,'' Ritts said.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons Not Intimidated by Vikings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Ray Buchanan is sleeping just fine this  
week. No, he hasn't suffered any nightmares about the prospect of 
lining up across from Randy Moss in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take a butter knife out on the field,'' Buchanan,  
the Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl cornerback, said Wednesday. ``If I 
cut him and he bleeds, that let's you know this man is human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Buchanan was being facetious. No knives will be  
allowed Sunday at the Metrodome, though it might be the only 
effective way to halt the seemingly unstoppable Minnesota offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings set an NFL record with 556 points during the regular  
season, then blew out Arizona 41-21 in a divisional playoff game 
last week. They have an endless supply of weapons that only begin 
with Moss, the NFL's rookie of the year with 69 receptions for 
1,313 yards and 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	There's NFC offensive player of the year Randall Cunningham, who  
threw for 3,704 yards and 34 TDs in a remarkable comeback season. 
There's Cris Carter, who had a team-high 78 receptions for 1,011 
yards and 12 scores. There's Robert Smith, who rushed for 1,187 
yards. There's an offensive line that features Pro Bowlers Todd 
Steussie, Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy. There's return 
specialist David Palmer, who lines up all over the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we're going to stop them,'' Falcons coach Dan  
Reeves said. ``What we're hoping to do is contain them, come up 
with a key play here and there to slow them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if there was ever a team capable of beating the Vikings,  
it's the Falcons. They have a punishing runner in Jamal Anderson 
and a close-to-the-vest offense that led the league in time of 
possession. They don't make many mistakes, either, also leading the 
NFL in turnover margin with a plus-20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest factor is going out there and letting them  
know they're not going to be throwing the ball all over the 
place,'' said Michael Booker, the other cornerback. ``They're not 
going to have that much time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Vikings averaged nearly 35 points per game, no team  
scored that many in even one game against the Falcons. They allowed 
just 18 points per game -- fourth-lowest in the NFL -- and ranked 
second in run defense and eighth in fewest yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the history of Atlanta, the defense has always been kind of  
the stepchild,'' end Lester Archambeau said. ``This is a different 
year. Our defense is respected now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, safety Eugene Robinson and linebacker Jessie Tuggle  
were voted to the Pro Bowl, and someone from the defensive line 
probably should have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great players and great defenses love great challenges,'' said  
Archambeau, who led the team with a career-high 10 sacks. 
``Everybody is excited about going up there and showing Minnesota 
and the rest of the country what kind of defense we really are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who had a team-high seven interceptions, spent most of  
the season lining up against the other teams' top receivers. But 
the Falcons aren't saying how they plan to stop Moss, Carter, 
Cunningham and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Buchanan lines up one-on-one against Moss. Or, more  
likely, the Falcons assign Booker and safety Eugene Robinson to 
double Moss and let Buchanan work solo against Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray can hold his own with anyone, so whoever Ray's on, we  
won't have to double,'' Booker said. ``If I'm on Moss, we'll 
probably double Moss and let Ray go over and freestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though seven inches shorter than Moss, the 5-foot-9 Buchanan  
clearly wants a chance to defend him at least a few times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm licking my chops a little bit. This is the opportunity of  
a lifetime,'' he said. ``Everybody has put this guy on a high 
pedestal. I don't want to take anything away from him. He's done 
something that's been great for the NFL. But for a defensive back, 
to get a chance to compete against somebody like this, you want to 
seize the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's coverage skills have allowed the Falcons to diversify  
their defense, providing greater latitude for blitzes and multiple 
coverage schemes involving the other defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't be where we are without Ray,'' Reeves said. ``He's  
done a great job against some great receivers. A lot of times, the 
size has definitely not been in his favor. He goes against guys who 
are a lot bigger. He battles them and comes up with some big 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan and the rest of the defense will need to come up with a  
few more Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Sneak Peek at Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met today with a group of  
labor leaders to sound out economic themes for his State of the 
Union address and try to show he is not consumed by his impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, along with Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and Treasury  
Secretary Robert Rubin, met with 11 labor leaders in the White 
House Cabinet Room. As the meeting began, Clinton told reporters he 
would discuss Social Security, public education and health care -- 
three themes he intends to address in his State of the Union 
message next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be discussing ways we can work together,'' Clinton  
said. ``In large measure, opportunity for America's labor families 
and their children will depend upon whether America can master the 
challenges of the global economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting those challenges, Clinton said, will require ``a very  
vigorous set of actions this year'' and he hoped his status report 
on the nation will help get that process started. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of it will involve the Congress, part of it will involve  
our work with other nations over the course of the year, but it 
will be very important,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton went into the meeting after a briefing from Rubin on the  
economic situation in Brazil and other world markets. ``We are 
monitoring the developments closely, especially what is going on in 
Brazil,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the president worked, his lawyers delivered a 130-page  
brief that spelled out his defense against perjury and 
obstruction-of-justice charges in the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering a rare comment on his impeachment, Clinton said he  
wouldn't speculate on his chances of being removed from office, but 
would focus on his job and ``spend as little time thinking about 
that as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is not important here,'' he said. ``My opinion is  
that I should be doing my job for the country and other people 
should be handling the defense and dealing with this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president took questions today after reporters complained  
that the White House was not providing enough access to him. White 
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday that holding a news 
conference would be ``unproductive'' because reporters were bound 
to focus several questions on his impeachment and Senate trial, and 
Clinton ``would love to talk about some other subjects.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Deal Will Speed Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some America Online customers will have the  
option of getting faster connections to the Internet under an 
alliance Wednesday with Bell Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, the nation's largest Internet service provider, hopes to  
begin offering this option by this summer to AOL customers who live 
in areas where Bell Atlantic is providing the new high-speed 
connections, called digital subscriber line, or DSL, service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local phone company, plans  
to make DSL service available to 7.5 million homes in certain 
markets in the Northeast by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL hasn't set prices for the high-speed option, but said it is  
expected to cost customers who want it less than $20 extra per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL customers who sign up for the DSL option would use Bell  
Atlantic's specially upgraded lines to connect their personal 
computers to the Internet at faster speeds. At a typical speed of 
up to 640 kilobits per second, DSL service is more than 20 times 
faster than the typical desktop computer modems hooked to regular 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL technology also would let customers avoid having to access  
AOL through a dial-up connection because they'll always be 
connected. Customers will be able to use their computer, telephone 
and fax at the same time on a single phone line, avoiding the need 
to buy additional lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance comes as AOL is trying to get access to high-speed  
connections provided by cable companies. AOL wants federal 
regulators to make cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. give it and 
other companies access to TCI's high-speed lines as a condition of 
that company's merger with AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> EU Parliament To Vote on Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRASBOURG, France (AP) -- The European Union's parliament will  
hold a key vote Thursday on whether or not the executive Commission 
should resign amid allegations of fraud and nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertainty lingered over the outcome of the no confidence vote  
but it seemed unlikely the two-thirds majority required to approve 
it would be reached after Commission President Jacques Santer put 
forward a proposal for management reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Socialist leader Pauline Green has said most of the members in  
her group will not vote against the Commission. The Socialist group 
-- with 214 members -- is the largest faction in the 626-member 
European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Socialists have said their main concern now is for Santer to  
push through the eight-point reform program that he promised 
earlier this week to prevent fraud and irregularities from taking 
place in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But Green said her group could vote in favor of dissolving the  
entire Commission if a majority of deputies approve another 
resolution -- due to be considered before the no confidence vote on 
Thursday -- singling out two commissioners and seeking their 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are Development Commissioner Manuel Marin, a Spaniard,  
and Research Commissioner Edith Cresson of France. Marin handled 
humanitarian aid programs in the early 1990s, a time of alleged 
fraud in those programs. Cresson is under pressure over alleged 
irregularities in her department. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-member Commission, based in Brussels, serves as the  
executive body for the European Union, which includes 15 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Democrats, who hold the second largest faction in  
parliament, put forward the resolution against the two 
commissioners -- but half the group's deputies have said they will 
not back it. 
</P>
<P>
	Under EU rules, parliament can only sack the entire Commission,  
not individual members. Even if the resolution could not be 
implemented, its adoption would be a blow to Santer's leadership 
and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Santer reportedly threatened on Wednesday to quit his job if  
Christian Democrats in the EU assembly stick to their resolution. 
Santer, a Luxembourg Christian Democrat, has firmly defended 
Cresson and Marin against fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners met late Wednesday ahead of the vote but did  
not comment on their meeting. Leaders of parliament's political 
groups held a separate meeting to discuss Thursday's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Democrats' resolution calls outright for Cresson's  
resignation and urges ``a viable solution regarding the 
responsibilities of Mr. Marin, including the possibility of him 
stepping down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current crisis erupted last month when allegations of fraud  
and financial mismanagement in the Commission led the parliament to 
refuse to approve the EU's 1996 accounts.

<HEADLINE> Hermann Maier To Race in Downhill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WENGEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Opting to protect his World Cup lead  
instead of his back, double Olympic champion Hermann ``The 
Herminator'' Maier confirmed Wednesday he planned to race this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning Tuesday's giant slalom in Adelboden with the help  
of painkillers and muscle relaxants, Maier, visibly in pain, had 
said he might skip the next two downhills to rest his back for the 
upcoming World Alpine Ski Championships at Vail, Colo., beginning 
Jan. 30. But the two races he would miss are the most prestigious 
on the Alpine calendar, the Lauberhorn here and the famed 
Hahnenkamm at Kitzbuehel, Austria next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	After a quiet Wednesday -- training was canceled because of heavy  
snow -- Maier said he felt well enough to tackle the Lauberhorn as 
well as a slalom on Sunday that awards combined points. 
</P>
<P>
	``My back is not so good, but not so bad,'' said Maier, who won  
a shortened downhill at this Swiss resort last season when high 
wind forced organizers to lower the start. ``We're working on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally it would be better for me to rest now, but I'm in  
pretty good shape otherwise and the only problem is my back,'' the 
reigning World Cup champion said. ``The downhill is a bit easier 
than the giant slalom because there is less movement required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Maier said he planned to race on the death-defying Streif  
course in Kitzbuehel next week, he would have to wait to see how he 
fared after this weekend's races. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my back doesn't get worse, I'll race in Kitzbuehel,'' Maier  
said. ``I took a break during Kitzbuehel last year in order to 
rest, and I don't really want to miss it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a break this year could allow Maier's rivals to chip away  
at his lead atop the overall World Cup rankings. Topping the 
standings with 911 points, Maier has a 228-point advantage over his 
nearest challenger Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, the 1994 overall 
champion and combined gold medalist in the 1997 world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I missed two downhills and that's too much if you  
want to win the World Cup downhill title,'' said Maier, who was 
second in the downhill standings a year ago to teammate Andreas 
Schifferer. ``It hurts in the overall, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maier has turned to modern and traditional Alpine medicine to  
help him brave the two most demanding and treacherous courses on 
the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to stock from the team doctor's pharmacy, a  
combination of groundhog grease, ``fango therapy'' (hot sands 
applied to the injury) and massages are being applied to get Maier 
through the next two weeks before the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying everything, absolutely everything,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Central Bank Boss Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The head of Brazil's central bank  
abruptly resigned today, and his replacement effectively devalued 
the battered currency by nearly 8 percent in hopes of stemming the 
financial crisis in Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian real was allowed to trade in a wider band against  
the U.S. dollar by new Central Bank chief Francisco Lopes, who 
replaced Gustavo Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, opened in  
free fall with the Bovespa index down 10 percent, triggering a 
circuit-breaker that suspended trading for a half-hour. The market 
later was trading 5.5 percent lower, and markets in New York and 
elsewhere also were sharply off. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso cut short a vacation today  
to give a brief nationally televised speech in which he said all of 
Brazil's foreign debt obligations would be honored. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso also said his government remains on course to implement  
tough economic reforms that the IMF and international lenders had 
sought in a November $41.5 billion rescue plan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said he had been in contact  
with the IMF and other countries about Brazil, and the Group of 
Seven nations that includes the United States, Germany and Japan 
held emergency talks about Brazil's economy, Germany's foreign 
ministry spokesman said in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action was indirectly sparked last week by an  
announcement by Minas Gerais state Gov. Itamar Franco, in his first 
week in office, that he would stop payment for 90 days on his 
state's $15 billion in federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	That raised pessimism about political support for Cardoso, who  
succeeded Itamar Franco as chief of state in 1994, and speeded the 
outflow of dollars, although markets had been speculating for a 
while that Gustavo Franco was on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing personal and ``chiefly'' professional reasons, Gustavo  
Franco said today from Brasilia, the capital, that he was leaving 
his post because ``I feel an obvious tiredness after five years of 
non-stop work (in the public sector).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes, who had been Central Bank monetary policy director, said  
there would be no major changes except for the new exchange policy. 
Finance Minister Pedro Malan canceled a trip to Portugal because of 
the economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustavo Franco's resignation comes at a delicate time for  
Brazil. Investors have pulled more than $40 billion from the 
country since July, and reserves have plunged to about $35 billion. 
On Tuesday alone, $1.2 billion left the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Luciana Fagundes, an economist at Lloyds Bank in Sao Paulo, said  
the appointment of Lopes was well-received by the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a lot of credibility both in Brazil and abroad. His  
appointment should have a tranquilizing effect,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagundes, however, predicted markets will be turbulent for the  
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency, which many analysts considered overvalued,  
immediately plunged beyond the new trading band set by the 
government. It was 1.3218 reals to the dollar in trading today 
compared with 1.2114 at Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank allowed the real to devalue 7.6 percent against  
the U.S. dollar today by changing the ``band'' within which the two 
currencies trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ``wide band'' is 1.20-1.32 reals to the dollar, up from  
1.12-1.22. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, international lenders put together a large aid  
package to shore up the economy but to get the funds, Brazil must 
sharply reduce its $65 billion deficit -- a goal that looks ever 
more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustavo Franco, who became head of the country's top monetary  
authority in 1997, has strongly defended high interest rates to 
attract foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But that policy is increasingly under fire from businessmen and  
workers, who claim it strangles growth and raises unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows Cardoso's promise that debt obligations would  
be honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what we will do, we know what we are doing, we will  
pay all our debts,'' Cardoso said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments, however, failed to stem losses on the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange, which closed down 7.6 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The head of Brazil's central bank  
abruptly resigned today, and his replacement effectively devalued 
the battered currency by nearly 8 percent in hopes of stemming the 
financial crisis in Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian real was allowed to trade in a wider band against  
the U.S. dollar by new Central Bank chief Francisco Lopes, who 
replaced Gustavo Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, opened in  
free fall. Twelve minutes after opening, the Bovespa index had lost 
10 percent, triggering a circuit-breaker that suspended trading for 
30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic moves came one day after President Fernando  
Henrique Cardoso sought to calm investors by pledging the nation 
would honor all its foreign debt obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing personal and ``chiefly'' professional reasons, Franco  
said today from Brasilia, the capital, that he was leaving his post 
because ``I feel an obvious tiredness after five years of non-stop

defusing pressure from businessmen and opposition politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency, which many analysts considered overvalued,  
immediately plunged beyond the new trading band set by the 
government. It was 1.3218 reals to the dollar in trading today

<HEADLINE>  U.S., Allies Discuss Brazil Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the United States  
has consulted with allies about the economic crisis in Brazil and 
he hopes the problem ``will be resolved in a satisfactory way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that Latin America is the fastest-growing market  
for American goods and services and that Brazil is the largest 
country in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke with reporters in the Cabinet Room as the U.S. stock  
market plunged after the abrupt resignation of Brazil's central 
bank chief and the subsequent devaluation of its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are monitoring developments closely,'' the president said  
at the opening of a meeting with labor leaders to preview his State 
of the Union address Tuesday. He said U.S. officials have consulted 
with key officials in Brazil, the G-7 organization of wealthy 
industrial nations, other countries and the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement aimed at calming economic anxieties, Clinton  
said: ``We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil, with whom we 
have worked on so many important things around the world, carry 
forward with its economic reform plan and succeed. And we certainly 
hope that they will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States had worked hard to keep the financial  
crisis in Asia from spreading to Brazil, noting the high stakes for 
the U.S. economy in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we hope that the situation will be resolved in a  
satisfactory way not only for the people of Brazil but for all of 
the people in the Americas that want to continue to enjoy the good 
progress that all of us have enjoyed in the last several years,'' 
Clinton said. ``And we're working to that end and we'll continue to 
do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a key architect of the  
administration's global crisis plan, said in a separate statement 
that he viewed Brazil's decision to effectively devalue its 
currency as an effort to ``enhance the flexibility of its exchange 
rate system.'' He said it was important that ``Brazil carry forward 
the implementation of a strong, credible economic program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday, Rubin had listed Brazil as among the  
chief concerns for the global economy while also pointing to the 
economic mess in Russia and Japan's continuing struggles to right 
its own economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Global markets, which had gone through a period of relative calm  
following a tumultuous fall, were rocked again today when the head 
of Brazil's central bank abruptly resigned and his replacement 
effectively devalued the country's currency by 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 250 points  
in the first half-hour of trading as investors worried that events 
in Brazil could trigger another round of turbulence in emerging 
markets around the world. An hour later, it had recovered 75 points 
of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who met with reporters Tuesday before the latest crisis  
in Brazil, said a lot of hard work remained to be done to reform 
the global financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have looked for magic wands and quick answers and there  
are no magic wands and there are no quick answers,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about Brazil on Tuesday, he refused to discuss what the  
United States and other rich nations would do if the $41.5 billion 
rescue package put together by the International Monetary Fund last 
November begins to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
	The international support was provided to Brazil under IMF terms  
that required Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to 
impose an economic austerity program, something he has had trouble 
winning political backing to implement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brazil program should work,'' Rubin said. ``Politics is  
obviously the key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As other potential trouble spots, Rubin listed Russia's economic  
travails, Thailand's efforts to deal with debt-laden corporations, 
Indonesia and the open question of whether Japan will be able to 
put together an economic pump-priming program that will pull it out 
of its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the stock market turbulence, the U.S. economy so far  
has been able to weather the foreign storms, with a rising trade 
deficit the only blot on an economic expansion that in December 
became the longest period of uninterrupted peacetime growth in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, Rubin said he held the same view as private economists  
that the economy may slow a bit but still turn in a healthy 
performance with low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin ducked a question about whether he was concerned that  
foreigners could become spooked by a lengthy impeachment trial and 
start pulling their investments out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of worrying about that, Rubin said it was important for  
the administration to continue pursuing sound economic policies, 
including reforming Social Security and protecting the budget 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``has been enormously focused'' on preparing the new  
budget, Social Security reform and the international economy, Rubin 
said. These are the types of issues that will have a big role in 
determining ``the confidence of foreign investors in our economy,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Rubin, the 26-year Wall Street veteran, has stayed  
around to guide Clinton's economic policy, has also been seen as a 
key to the rebound on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his plans in 1999, Rubin indicated he was staying  
put. ``I am focused on the issues in front of me and that has been 
my focus,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Comments on Impeachment / Presidential Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	President Clinton's comments Wednesday in response to questions  
about his impeachment trial: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, what do you think will be the outcome of the  
impeachment trial? We know what your hopes are, but what do you 
think is really going to happen? 
</P>
<P>
	A: I think the Senate has to deal with that. We filed our brief  
today. It makes our case. 
</P>
<P>
	The important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking  
about that as possible and as much time working on the issues we 
are here to discuss as possible. They have their job to do in the 
Senate, and I have mine. And I intend to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: (inaudible)  
</P>
<P>
	A: I think that the brief speaks for itself. And the statements  
which have been made by hundreds of constitutional experts and 
others. I trust that the right thing will be done. And I think in 
the meanwhile I need to work on the business of the people. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, your impeachment is before the union, and  
you're giving your State of the Union address. Don't you think you 
should directly address that matter during your speech? 
</P>
<P>
	A: I think the American people have heard about that quite  
extensively over the last year. My understanding is that I should 
do their business. 
</P>
<P>
	I think they would like it if somebody up here were putting  
their interests first, their business first, and I think that's 
what they expect me to do. They know the Senate has a job to do; 
they expect them to do it. There is nothing else to be said to the 
House about it. The Senate has to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	And my position is that in addition to that, we have to deal  
with the problems of America, the challenges of America, the 
opportunities of America, and that's what I intend to do in the 
State of the Union speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, your lawyers are arguing that the charges  
against you don't amount to high crimes and misdemeanors. Do you 
personally believe that perjury and obstruction of justice are not 
impeachable offenses? 
</P>
<P>
	A: I believe that it's not necessary for me to comment further  
than our brief. The important thing that I think you should be 
asking yourself is why did nearly 900 constitutional experts say 
that they strongly felt that this matter was not the subject of 
impeachment? 
</P>
<P>
	My opinion is not important here. My opinion is that I should be  
doing my job for the country. And other people should be handling 
the defense and dealing with this issue, and that's what I intend 
to do.

	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 7  
</P>
<P>
	Deming (N.M.) Headlight, on State of the Union address:  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Senators urging President Clinton not to deliver his annual  
State of the Union address should reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	They should remember that the president stands accused of an  
impeachable offense: he is not convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires presidents to report on the state of  
the union each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents in the 19th century typically sent written reports to  
Congress. But 20th century presidents have personally delivered 
them to joint sessions of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton should carry on the tradition and speak before  
our elected representatives. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 11  
</P>
<P>
	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on black farmers:  
</P>
<P>
	Most African-Americans never got the 40 acres and a mule  
promised to them after emancipation in 1865. Instead, they were 
trapped in no-win sharecropping arrangements and forced into Jim 
Crow segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who oppose affirmative action and believe discrimination  
is a thing of the past should review recent evidence of systematic 
racial discrimination against black farmers during the 1980s and 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Long overdue compensation came through when the Clinton  
administration recently moved to settle a class-action lawsuit 
brought on behalf of black farmers. Under the agreement, an 
estimated 4,000 black farmers are eligible to receive the 
equivalent of $200,000, including a $50,000 cash settlement and 
forgiveness of federal loans. Still, the settlement will not reach 
thousands who left farming or died waiting for recompense. 
</P>
<P>
	Biased farm aid decisions contributed to reducing the number of  
black farmers from 925,000 in 1920 to 18,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	President Bill Clinton set the tone to make this landmark  
settlement and recognition possible. The next step should include 
``affirmative actions'' to expand opportunities and increase the 
ranks of black farmers. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 11  
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Florida (Fort Walton) Daily News, on the Hoffa name:  
</P>
<P>
	Will the Teamsters get a better Hoffa?  
</P>
<P>
	His name is as politically valuable as gold, Kennedy or  
Rockefeller. It got him elected president of the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters, though by fits and starts. What James P. 
Hoffa does with the Hoffa name now could ameliorate what his 
father, Jimmy, did to it during his glory and gory years as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	With the name recognition has come, like it or not, the sins of  
the father. They were visited upon the son in 1996 when James P. 
Hoffa first sought to unseat incumbent reformer Ron Carey. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out, of course, that the reformer himself needed some  
reforming. Mr. Carey was kicked out of the union for using its 
money to beat Mr. Hoffa, his election voided by the federal 
government. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Hoffa ... didn't waste his second chance, defeating a  
comparative unknown ... in a special election. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Now, James P. has an opportunity to redeem the Hoffa name.  
</P>
<P>
	He can start by using his power to benefit the members ... of  
the largest labor union in America. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Cape Cod Times, Hyannis, Mass., on foster children case:  
</P>
<P>
	Once again, a court in Massachusetts has separated young  
siblings and placed them in foster homes hundreds of miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Judicial Court recently upheld a Juvenile Court  
decision separating a 4-year-old boy and his 6-year-old sister in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the children exchanged stuffed animals and hugs in an  
emotional farewell that is hard to fathom in our so-called 
``civilized'' society. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was reminiscent of the separation of twins in Plymouth  
less than two years ago when court officers forcibly placed one of 
the twins in a waiting vehicle, only to be whisked away from her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	This latest case of separating siblings could spark a U.S.  
Supreme Court ruling on the rights of siblings who are adopted or 
in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers for the 4-year-old boy -- called Hugo L. in court  
papers -- have appealed to the highest court. The lawyers argue that 
Hugo would have been better off if he remained in his foster home 
with his sister, a place where he has lived for most of his life. 
...
</P>
<P>
	If it chooses to hear the case, the Supreme Court will no doubt  
be asked to review the Constitutional issues involved in sibling 
separations. Do siblings have the right to remain together? Does 
the state have the right to separate minors? Do relatives of 
siblings have more rights than foster families even if it can be 
shown that a foster family would provide a better home?

<P>
	In reviewing such lofty questions, the court would probably not  
decide which home would be best for Hugo.

	And that would be a shame. As is often the case, Hugo would  
simply become a means to an end -- a cog in our legal system. ...

	In Hugo's case, the Supreme Court should simply review what is  
best for the child and not issue a blanket ruling that could affect 
thousands of separated siblings. ...

	Amarillo (Texas) Globe-News, on military spending:  
</P>
<P>
	GOP lawmakers, as well as some Democrats, were skeptical  
following President Clinton's announcement recently of a proposed 
six-year infusion of $100 billion in new Pentagon spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the proposal said simply it is not enough. That may  
be true, but it is a promising start and a positive element from an 
administration that has previously not given a high budgetary 
priority to military spending. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would be the largest budget increase since  
President Reagan's Cold War buildup of the mid-1980s. Republican 
Sen. John Warner, incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, as well as Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., the ranking Democrat 
on the House National Security Committee, have remarked the 
increase is not substantial enough to meet the military's growing 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The military is plagued with falling recruitment and expanding  
commitments -- such as in the Persian Gulf -- that justify an 
increase in the military budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the Clinton administration's proposal falls short of  
meeting the financial standard, but the proposal does represent a 
foundation for a possible bipartisan common ground that previously 
did not exist.

	The Observer, La Grande, Ore., on technology and national  
security: 
</P>
<P>
	A special U.S. House committee unanimously concluded that  
technology deals with China over the past two decades have harmed 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been concern about this issue for some time. Pressure  
was put on Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a special 
investigator to look into donations by Chinese officials to the 
Democratic Party during the last election and potential links to 
the kind of information being given to the Chinese government. It 
now appears that both Republican and Democratic administrations are 
to blame for giving sensitive information to the Chinese. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Our government's policy since the founding of the nation has  
been to provide information to other countries if it is in our best 
interests. We provided technical support to countries like Iran, 
only to have it come back and bite us when the Shah was deposed. 
Dozens of other countries have been used by us to maintain balances 
in regions of the world. Hopefully this sensitive information 
shared with nations won't create long-lasting negative consequences 
for either the U.S. or its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the time has come for our leaders, whether political or  
military, to stop manipulating other countries, especially if the 
results could hurt us.

	The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, on pregnant honor students:  
</P>
<P>
	Two Kentucky high school juniors, denied membership in the  
National Honor Society earlier this year because of their 
pregnancies, must be admitted by Jan. 31, a federal judge ruled in 
a sex discrimination suit the American Civil Liberties Union filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the girls said their pregnancies made them unfit to  
be role models. 
</P>
<P>
	But isn't that a very narrow view?  
</P>
<P>
	Isn't it admirable and a point of strong character for a person  
to admit a mistake? To take responsibility for that mistake, work 
hard, succeed, and all the while become an outstanding scholar and 
volunteer? 
</P>
<P>
	It is true that community standards count in assessing a  
student's eligibility for membership in the National Honor Society. 
But fairness and the perception of fairness in those standards are 
important, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling was correct. It should not be appealed.

	Daily News of Los Angeles, on Michael Jordan:  
</P>
<P>
	In his 13 years in the National Basketball Association, Jordan  
demoralized his opponents with his feats of basketball fancy that 
no one, not even the great Magic Johnson, could replicate. He could 
score at will, whenever the Bulls needed a bucket, a play was 
designed for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	But offense was just a portion of his game. Year after year he  
was voted one of the league's best defensive players. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Time will tell if there will be another player talented enough  
to win 10 scoring titles and five most valuable player awards, and 
dominating enough to help his team win six championships. ... 
</P>
<P>
	His decision to retire following a bitter labor dispute that  
shut down the league for six months is a requiem for the NBA, which 
will endure a long, slow march before its fans can forgive the 
owners and players. ...

	The New York Times, on Michael Jordan:  
</P>
<P>
	For selfish reasons, we wish that Michael Jordan had stayed on.  
His absence denies us the pleasure of watching one of the world's 
great athletes and surely the most accomplished basketball player 
in the history of the game. His presence might have redeemed this 
sadly truncated season and restored some of the affection we had 
for the game before the owners and players almost took it away. It 
will not be easy to replace a global icon. ...

	But what will save the NBA?  
</P>
<P>
	Now that multi-millionaire players and multi-millionaire owners  
have resolved their little squabble over $2 billion, the big 
question is: Who cares? 
</P>
<P>
	Die-hard fans of course will be overjoyed that the lockout has  
ended. But the rest of us, who watched only because of Michael 
Jordan and who grew tired of hearing about bratty, overpaid 
athletes, simply marked the occasion with a stifled yawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever hold professional basketball may have had on the  
country before the lockout has come undone. Fascination with the 
sport has been replaced with hurt feelings and apathy. 
</P>
<P>
	And an abbreviated season won't do anything to change that. It  
would have been preferable if the whole season had been scrapped. 
Then maybe owners and players would have really felt the pain of a 
lost season. 
</P>
<P>
	With no major revenue flowing into their bank accounts, maybe  
they would have gained a new appreciation for the fans who really 
make the NBA. ...

<P>
	Daily Telegraph, London, on the European Union:  
</P>
<P>
	That there is systematic fraud in Brussels will not have come as  
a surprise to many. But the EU's back-handed response to the latest 
disclosures has astounded even its fiercest opponents. The 
commission has shown itself to be tolerant of corruption, but 
intolerant of criticism. It now falls to the European Parliament to 
determine whether the EU, as a whole, can retain any integrity.

</P>
<P>
	This is sheer madness.  
</P>
<P>
	But it shows one thing.  
</P>
<P>
	The entire EU set-up will not work. Corruption is rife.  
</P>
<P>
	There is no accountability.  
</P>
<P>
	You only have to look at some of those commissioners on TV to  
know they are overpaid, arrogant dimwits. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why we should stay out of the European single currency .  
</P>
<P>
	And we should think carefully about even staying in Europe.

</P>
<P>
	Tribune de Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland, on corruption at the  
European Commission: 
</P>
<P>
	It could not be said that the Europe of Brussels has a great  
democratic tradition. It hasn't had the time, and its shape is such 
that it cannot find a model to copy among its member states. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the European Union is not used to the idea of  
censure motions or of ministerial responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	So the motion of no-confidence in the Commission tabled in the  
European parliament at Strasbourg yesterday by the liberal 
democratic group is only the fifth in the history of the parliament 
and the first to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, the Union has no great parliamentary tradition. ...  
That's why the motion of censure tabled against the Commission for 
bad management and even alleged fraud in two departments ... is not 
-- as one might think -- a sign that things are going badly in 
``Brussels Land'' but paradoxically a sign that things are going 
better. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This learning process will probably not end by the dismissal of  
the Commission, which would in fact be disastrous, but it will push 
the services in Brussels to adopt a more scrupulous standard of 
administration in the interest of its users, who include the 
citizens of countries outside the EU.

<P>
	Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on currency volatility:  
</P>
<P>
	The current strength of the yen cannot be considered an accurate  
reflection of the respective economic fundamentals of Japan and the 
United States. U.S. President Bill Clinton in his New Year's speech 
declared that his country's economy is in the midst of its 
longest-ever peacetime expansion. The U.S. unemployment rate in 
December was lower than that of Japan in November. The Japanese 
economy, on the other hand, is still not on its way to a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who visited Europe just after the  
birth of the euro, agreed in a series of talks with the leaders of 
Germany, France and Italy that stability of the yen-euro exchange 
rate is important to the international currency system. Obuchi also 
told the leaders that Japan and the United States will cooperate to 
promote the regulation of speculative short-term funds and of 
reforms to the international monetary system. 
</P>
<P>
	These words will be meaningless, however, if they are not backed  
by action. It is important that effective and practical agreements 
be hammered out at the upcoming meetings. For this to happen, the 
three key currency leaders -- Japan, the United States and Europe -- 
must show leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Needless to say, the nation's top priority must be to overcome  
its own factors leading to instability -- the economic slump and 
unease over the financial system.

	The Jerusalem Post, on Israeli election economics:  
</P>
<P>
	One thing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cannot be accused of  
recently is subtlety. While pushing through a series of spending 
measures in the Knesset, he and his government have barely bothered 
to make a minimal effort to hide the fact that the interests of the 
country matter less than their desire to be reelected in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, Netanyahu appears uninterested in the fact that the  
economic damage wrought by such `shoot from the hip' measures -- in 
terms of deeper recession, higher unemployment and crushing 
deficits -- will be borne by the public for a long time after the 
the last campaign speech has been forgotten and the posters and 
slogans have been cleared away.

<P>
	La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on President Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. President Bill Clinton continues to oscillate relentlessly  
between the characters of war-bound Mars and the goddess of love, 
Venus. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has never seen such a Janus-faced president,  
bearing a war mask against Saddam Hussein and an expression of 
contrite repentance for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Yet the 
perception that the world has of America is that it can afford the 
luxury of an external warrior president and, at home, one charged 
for minor sins and childish lies. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment, hoped for both by Saddam and the strongest wing  
of Clinton's opponents, will probably not take place. 
</P>
<P>
	But even an extension of the trial, with statements from some 15  
witnesses, including Lewinsky, can be dangerous for the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The image of Clinton, and that of the United States, would be  
weakened and Saddam's fortified. In other words, a virtual 
impeachment, even if not effective, would strike the president and 
paralyze the first and only world power for too long. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the reason why most Americans would like the nightmare  
to end as soon as possible. The majority believes Venus to be a 
private affair and Mars a national one.

<HEADLINE> Owners Approve Sale of Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Baseball owners voted unanimously  
Wednesday to approve the $150 million sale of the Florida Marlins 
from H. Wayne Huizenga to John Henry. 
</P>
<P>
	The team Henry takes over is a shell of the club that won the  
World Series in 1997. After the Marlins beat Cleveland to win the 
World Series in their fifth year of existence, Huizenga began a 
payroll purge. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's payroll dropped from $52.5 million to $19.1 million,  
and the Marlins went 54-108, the worst record ever for a defending 
champion and the poorest record in the National League since 1969. 
Just four players remain from the World Series roster: Antonio 
Alfonseca, Craig Counsell, Cliff Floyd and Livan Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga founded the franchise, which started play in 1993, but  
became disenchanted in 1997 when Florida failed to fund a publicly 
financed ballpark with a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, a commodities trader from Boca Raton, Fla., hopes to get  
a new stadium for his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, The Associated Press learned that baseball  
commissioner Bud Selig moved to appoint a three-man panel to 
investigate the sport's economic system, to appease owners 
grumbling about the latest salary escalation. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, former Federal  
Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and television commentator George 
Will were to be appointed to the special panel, a baseball official 
with knowledge of Selig's action said on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Volcker was head of the independent study panel appointed  
jointly by owners and the union following the 1990 spring training 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, currently heading a panel investigating alleged bribes  
involving the awarding of the 2002 Winter Olympics to Salt Lake 
City, was mentioned in the early 1990s as a possible candidate for 
baseball commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Will is a long-time fan who has authored books about baseball in  
addition to his political commentaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Some baseball owners have been angered by the recent rise in  
salaries, with several outbursts following the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
$105 million, seven-year contract with pitcher Kevin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The player compensation system we have is a Rube Goldberg  
contraption. It is completely out of whack,'' San Diego Padres 
president Larry Lucchino said. ``It is one thing to have the first 
million dollar player, it is another thing when you have the first 
hundred million player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's collective bargaining agreement runs through the 2000  
season, but the players association is expected to exercise its 
option to extend it for an additional year. If that happens, the 
earliest a confrontation could occur would be in spring training 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In other business, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner  
was replaced on baseball's executive council by Seattle Mariners 
chairman John Ellis at the American League meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, a maverick among owners since buying control of  
the Yankees in 1973, was elected to a three-year term on the 
council in March 1995 and was not reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees and Adidas agreed to a $95 million, 10-year  
marketing contract that conflicted with parts of baseball's 
national deals and then sued, Steinbrenner was suspended from the 
council on May 13, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was settled nearly a year later and Steinbrenner was  
reinstated last April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	While the leagues sometime reappoint owners to the council, they  
also rotate the spots. The eight-man council ran baseball from 
commissioner Fay Vincent's forced resignation in September 1992 
until last July, when Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig -- who had 
been acting commissioner for nearly six years -- was voted to a 
formal five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig then placed his ownership shares of the Brewers into a  
trust that picked his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, to take over.

<HEADLINE> 2 Take Pleas To Avoid Gotti Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The list of co-defendants in John A.  
``Junior'' Gotti's racketeering trial has dwindled again, with a 
66-year-old man taking a plea bargain from his hospital bed and his 
son offering a courtroom confession. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bedside court session Tuesday at the Westchester Medical  
Center, Gregory DePalma -- who is ill with lung cancer -- told a 
federal magistrate that he was guilty of gambling, extortion, labor 
racketeering and tax crimes, defense lawyer John Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors agreed to a prison sentence of between 10 and 13  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he won't be appearing at Gotti's federal racketeering  
trial, DePalma still is likely to be major presence because many of 
his conversations are among the thousands collected by federal 
agents with wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Gotti, the 34-year-old son of  
imprisoned-for-life don John J. Gotti, ran the Gambino crime 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, who has refused a plea bargain, could be sentenced to 20  
years if convicted of racketeering, extortion, robbery and other 
charges at his trial, likely to begin in March or April. 
</P>
<P>
	In court later Tuesday, DePalma's 32-year-old son, Craig  
DePalma, confessed to racketeering, extortion, loansharking, 
bribery, labor racketeering, gambling and tax violations. 
Prosecutors recommended a sentence of 6 1/2 to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The pleas were the fourth and fifth this week and leave just six  
of 23 original defendants.

<HEADLINE> Coke Satisfied With IOC's Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- One of the Olympics' oldest and best-known  
sponsors said Wednesday it was satisfied with the IOC's efforts to 
deal with the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co. officials had a ``very productive'' meeting  
Tuesday night with IOC marketing director Michael Payne, company 
spokesman Ben Deutsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that they are going to do what they said they  
would do -- take swift and decisive action,'' Deutsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Payne answered questions and briefed Coke, a major  
Olympic sponsor since 1928, about the IOC's response to allegations 
of bribery in the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne met Wednesday with officials of two other sponsors, United  
Parcel Service and The Home Depot, at their Atlanta headquarters. 
He launched a series of meetings this week to reassure sponsors 
worried about the scandal's impact on the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said the company ``felt really  
comfortable'' after the meeting about its sponsorship of the 2000 
Summer Games in Sydney. UPS plans to decide later this year whether 
to extend Olympic sponsorship past then. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Payne described a ``very tenacious'' and complex IOC  
investigation that will result both in action against individuals 
and in recommendations for future safeguards in the selection of 
Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Atlanta-based sponsor, Delta Air Lines, didn't have a  
session with Payne but said it is following the developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're monitoring the situation,'' Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner  
said, adding that the company was awaiting the IOC's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it will release a report on the allegations  
Jan. 24. The U.S. and Salt Lake City Olympic committees also are 
investigating, as is the Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Sharply Different </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The proceedings in President Clinton's  
impeachment trial will depart sharply from anything ever seen in a 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there will be a judge, a jury, prosecutors and  
defense lawyers. But in a courtroom, the judge has the final say. 
In Clinton's trial, the jury of senators can overrule any decision 
by Chief Justice William Rehnquist with just 51 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a criminal trial, Clinton could never be forced to testify  
against his will. But the Senate could try to bring the president 
in for questioning. However, there is no guarantee senators will 
allow either side to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not Court TV, not a criminal trial in any classic  
sense,'' said Washington criminal defense attorney Mark Biros. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions and answers about how the Senate impeachment  
trial contrasts with cases tried in court: 

</P>
<P>
	Q. What is the standard of proof required to convict Clinton and  
remove him from office? 
</P>
<P>
	A. There is no required standard of proof. It's up to each  
senator to decide, and conviction requires the votes of 67 
senators, two-thirds of the Senate. In a criminal trial, 
prosecutors must prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and get 
a jury to agree unanimously. In most civil cases, the standard is a 
preponderance of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. What is Rehnquist's role?  
</P>
<P>
	A. He presides and makes the first decisions on any evidentiary  
and procedure questions. But his decisions on admissibility of 
evidence and other issues can be overruled by a majority of 
senators. ``The strict separation of roles between judge and jury, 
none of that exists here,'' Hofstra University law professor Eric 
Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Who are the prosecutors?  
</P>
<P>
	A. The House appointed 13 Republican members of the Judiciary  
Committee, which started the impeachment case against Clinton, to 
be the ``managers'' or prosecutors at the trial. Judiciary 
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is expected to open their 
case Thursday with a brief introduction followed by Rep. F. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who is to make the opening statement. Other 
prosecutors will follow with their presentation of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Who will defend Clinton?  
</P>
<P>
	A. White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff will lead a team of  
Clinton's government and private lawyers in presenting his defense. 
Private attorneys David Kendall and Nicole Seligman and White House 
lawyers Gregory Craig, Lanny Breuer and Cheryl Mills are expected 
to assist Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Does the concept of an impartial jury apply in Clinton's  
Senate trial? 
</P>
<P>
	A. Not really. In court, people ordinarily are kept off juries  
if they are found in pretrial questioning to have opinions about 
the case. In high-profile court trials, judges admonish jurors not 
to read anything about the case and not to talk with anyone about 
it. Court jurors aren't supposed to take into account anything they 
hear outside the courtroom. None of this applies to senators, who 
nonetheless are declaring in many instances that they are 
withholding judgment until they hear the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Who calls the witnesses?  
</P>
<P>
	A. In a court, the lawyers for either side. At Clinton's trial,  
House managers and the president's legal team may propose 
witnesses, but the Senate must approve any witness before he or she 
is heard. And there is no guarantee that senators will allow any 
testimony. Decisions on witnesses won't occur until each side has 
presented its case and senators have questioned the lawyers for 
both sides. Each side has 24 hours -- spread over several days -- to 
present its case. Senators then get 16 hours, spread over more than 
one day, to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never heard about a jury before that gets the opportunity  
to approve witnesses. We aren't a jury composed like other 
juries,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. What happens if the Senate decides to call Monica Lewinsky or  
another witness? 
</P>
<P>
	A. First, Ms. Lewinsky would be questioned by lawyers for both  
sides in a private deposition. Such a practice is common in civil 
cases, but unusual in criminal cases. The exception is Florida, 
where prosecutors and defense lawyers routinely question the other 
side's witnesses beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioning witnesses outside a courtroom is ``a tremendous  
benefit to the defense because there's no such thing as trial by 
ambush'' with surprise testimony from prosecution witnesses, said 
Tom Spencer, a Miami defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Could the Senate call Clinton to testify?  
</P>
<P>
	A. Yes. Clinton could never be compelled to testify in a  
criminal court proceeding in which he is a defendant. He has a 
Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. In a Senate 
trial, the Senate could seek to call him, though the chances of 
that appear to be nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent presumably  
would still apply, said Duke University law professor William Van 
Alstyne. However, he said, ``I wouldn't be surprised to see'' 
Clinton wanting to make an appearance if the trial appears not to 
be going well for him.

<HEADLINE> Books &AMP; Authors: Peter Guralnick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST NEWBURY, Mass. (AP) -- Peter Guralnick has found Elvis.  
</P>
<P>
	The writer details his discovery in ``Careless Love: The  
Unmaking of Elvis Presley,'' the continuation of his highly 
regarded ``Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley,'' 
published four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Careless Love'' is the darker, largely Las Vegas, side of the  
story, the one in which a lord of popular music -- perhaps only 
Sinatra and the Beatles share his sovereignty -- begins the long 
slide after the death of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The second volume, like the first, draws its strength from  
enlightening context, facilitated by Guralnick's encyclopedic 
understanding of rhythm and blues -- displayed in four previous 
books and many articles -- by his fine writing, and by hundreds of 
interviews conducted over 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Guralnick's biography puts in full, tragic context the final  
years of a life that ended on the floor of Elvis' bathroom at 
Graceland, with his gold pajamas around his ankles and a halo of 
vomit about his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Through vast research, Guralnick gives us an Elvis few saw, a  
man of generally uncommon politeness who could grow suddenly 
vicious, a man uncommonly adored but ever lonely, a man who sang 
silly songs at times but an artist uncommonly attuned to the soul 
of rhythm and blues, gospel and ballads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Careless Love'' (Little Brown &AMP; Co., 776 pages, $27.95) opens  
with Elvis in the Army in 1958, wailing for ``momma'' and already 
worried about whether his other great love, his fans, would stay 
true to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had nightmares until the day he died of being alone and  
deserted,'' Guralnick said in a recent interview at his home in 
this rural community north of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	As far back as his Army days, Elvis was taking the drugs he used  
to alter his body clock until it quit on him in 1977 at age 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Guralnick shows Elvis' wide range of music and emotions, such as  
his pain over those lousy songs from his mostly miserable 1960s 
movie musicals, his highs from giving his all to the Swedish hymn 
``How Great Thou Art'' and then quickly turning to a playful 
version of the rowdy R&AMP;B tune ``Down in the Alley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guralnick offers an Elvis who can handle 23 meticulous takes of  
``In the Ghetto'' and then go on a private binge of sorrow at home, 
listening repeatedly to a Charles Boyer recording of the lachrymose 
``Softly As I Leave You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the writer gives us an Elvis not the way he's known to his  
fans, but through the whipping boys who made up his entourage and 
lived with him many years before turning against him. And we learn 
a good deal more from the women he ``dated'' -- often by cuddling up 
in pajamas with them and talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Priscilla (Elvis' wife) is one of the many women who say that  
people couldn't have imagined the other side of him, so needy and 
vulnerable,'' Guralnick said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also many stages of his life stemming from his  
ever-changing fascinations such as karate, collecting badges and 
guns, owning a horse ranch, spiritualism. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is no easy way to sum up his complex relationship with  
his extraordinarily effective promoter, Colonel Tom Parker, the 
Dutch-born carnie who also would be undone in Vegas (in his case, 
by gambling). 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end both were watching each other self-destruct,''  
Guralnick said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his isolation Elvis indulged himself in drugs and  
possessions. Once during his gun phase he showed up at a wedding 
with two weapons in shoulder holsters, two in his waist, and a 
derringer in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis also indulged his camp followers, although always  
questioning their loyalty and often dictating their behavior and 
sometimes even their dress. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1973 he was on a precipitous decline because of his excesses,  
and the popular music scene had long been dominated by the Beatles 
and other performers. But he loomed so large with his old fans that 
he could make $500,000 from a concert if he could just stay on his 
feet for an hour and go through the motions. 
</P>
<P>
	Guralnick, himself a fan, is no apologist. As he wrote after  
studying the uncut version of a CBS special Elvis recorded in his 
dwindling days: ``... even after more than 20 years it is almost 
unbearable to listen to or watch, the obliteration not just of 
beauty but of the memory of beauty, and in its place sheer, stark 
terror.''

<HEADLINE> Suicide-Disaster Link Retracted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers have retracted a study suggesting that suicides  
increase after natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The original report, published last February in the New England  
Journal of Medicine, concluded that the stress brought on by 
floods, earthquakes and hurricanes could trigger a few hundred of 
the nation's 31,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in Thursday's issue of the journal, the same  
researchers said they had discovered a computer programming error 
that caused the number of suicides in 1990 to be counted twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the error was corrected, a new analysis showed no  
significant increase in suicide rates after natural disasters,'' 
wrote Dr. Etienne G. Krug and others from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention.

<HEADLINE> Reno To Hear Pleas for Spy Pollard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three prominent Jewish figures want to make a  
personal humanitarian plea that President Clinton grant clemency to 
Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, prompting Attorney General Janet Reno 
to postpone delivering her recommendation on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Writer and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel; Edgar M.  
Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress; and Harvard law 
professor Alan Dershowitz, who once represented Pollard, wrote 
Clinton on Tuesday to seek a meeting with him before he reaches a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crimes of Jonathan Pollard were contemptible, and we  
reject any effort to justify or rationalize them,'' the three 
wrote. ``At the same time, in light of his many years of 
incarceration and his repeated statements of contrition, we would 
wish to address to you our hope that as president you could 
consider the redeeming quality of mercy by invoking compassion at 
the human level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their bid came as Justice Department officials were preparing  
for Reno a recommendation against clemency, repeating the 
opposition she and the department had expressed in earlier reviews, 
officials said. Other national security aides to Clinton also were 
steering him away from clemency in recommendations forwarded to the 
White House by its loose deadline of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A former civilian analyst for the U.S. Navy, Pollard was  
convicted in 1985 of espionage for giving Israel tens of thousands 
of top-secret documents. He is serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has requested he be granted clemency, such as a reduction  
of his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pollard question almost derailed a U.S.-brokered  
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement in October. Under last-minute 
pressure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton 
promised to take a fresh look at clemency even though two previous 
reviews, also requested by the Israeli government, found no grounds 
to commute his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Jewish leaders sought a meeting with Clinton, but they  
were to be offered a meeting instead with Reno or top Justice 
officials who normally process information about clemency cases 
before they are sent to the president, government officials said 
Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno did not want to send a recommendation to Clinton before the  
three had an opportunity to make their case. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last week, the FBI took the unusual step of publicly  
opposing clemency. Bureau spokesman Frank Scafidi said, ``Justice 
has been done to this point. To release Pollard now would undo 
everything that law enforcement and prosecutors worked tirelessly 
to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's criminal division also adamantly  
opposes clemency, senior officials have said. Justice and FBI 
officials believe neither Pollard nor the Israelis have ever fully 
cooperated in identifying all the secret information he sold the 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,  
said the three men wrote Clinton as individuals only. ``They are 
three of the most prominent Jewish figures in the country, and they 
are close to Clinton,'' Steinberg said in an interview. ``They 
wanted to make an appeal solely on humanitarian grounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three had not received a formal reply Tuesday, but Steinberg  
said he had informal word that Clinton could take months to reach a 
decision. ``We're pleased the decision will be removed from this 
turbulent period in Washington,'' Steinberg said, referring to the 
impending Senate trial of Clinton on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice voted by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. official said Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright has told Clinton there are ``no compelling foreign policy 
considerations'' to justify releasing Pollard. CIA Director George 
Tenet reportedly reiterated his threat of last October to resign if 
Pollard were set free, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters last week the  
Defense Department was not expected to alter its earlier, strong 
opposition to Pollard's release.

<HEADLINE> Property Owners Should Plan Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Many people accumulate valuable real estate as  
they get older. It may be the family home, a farm or ranch, rental 
property, a second home, business property, or a portfolio of 
investment property. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the owner's heirs may live far away from the property and  
may be more interested in owning financial assets, not real estate. 
So what should owners do with their family real estate as they get 
older? 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the key points is that both property owners and their  
heirs need to adopt a plan,'' says Michelle Augustine, an academic 
associate at the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd be surprised how often people don't have a plan. Owners  
and their heirs should discuss real estate holdings and have a good 
understanding of the options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The options include selling or gifting family real estate to  
heirs before death, selling it to nonheirs, passing it on to the 
heirs for them to continue to manage, or passing it on to the heirs 
for them to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Augustine stresses the importance of reviewing these options  
while the property owners are still alive, since the decision -- or 
nondecision -- can create significant tax and income consequences, 
as well as emotional consequences for the heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first steps property owners should take is to  
determine the value of the property. In the case of the family home 
or a second home, this may mean getting a simple appraisal or 
estimate of the market value of the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Owning a farm or ranch, rental property, business property, or  
other investment property presents a more complicated issue, since 
these forms of property typically produce income. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should have a professional valuation analysis of an  
income-producing property to see if maintaining ownership of the 
property makes financial sense,'' Augustine says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a variety of valuation methods, such as an  
income/expense analysis, break-even analysis, or a present value 
analysis. Which analysis you should use depends on the complexity 
of the estate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a present value analysis helps you compare the rate  
of return of the property to that of a ``risk-free'' rate of 
return, such as from a Treasury security. Depending on your income 
needs, particularly for retirement, you may find it more beneficial 
to sell the property and invest in higher-returning assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option many property owners aren't familiar with is  
what's called a ``like-kind'' exchange. Basically, this is a tax 
strategy that allows you to save taxes by trading real estate you 
own for other real estate, instead of selling it, paying capital 
gains taxes on the profits, and then buying real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Augustine cited the example of a dentist in Oklahoma who  
``exchanged'' his office building and his residence for a primary 
residence on a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the issue of your current or future income needs from any  
income-producing property, you may have a variety of tax issues, 
such as depreciation recapture tax or estate tax. Passing on a 
family farm or business, for example, without cash available to pay 
for estate taxes, could force the heirs to sell the property to pay 
for the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, sit down with your heirs to discuss both your wishes and  
their wishes. Keep in mind that deciding what to do with family 
real estate isn't simply a financial issue. It often is a deeply 
emotional issue, too. 
</P>
<P>
	A classic example is passing on a second home or rental property  
that is in a desirable vacation spot. If you have more than one 
heir, who is going to own the property? If it is equal ownership, 
who is going to maintain the property and decide who can use the 
vacation property at any given time? 
</P>
<P>
	These kinds of issues can cause real battles among heirs,  
Augustine warns. Similar turf battles can occur in passing on a 
family farm or business. 
</P>
<P>
	What about your own wants and needs? Perhaps you want to sell  
the family home or farm and move closer to your children, yet they 
may want to keep the property in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, passing on family real estate may be a burden  
for heirs who live far away. For instance, if you've accumulated 
several rental properties in the community where you live, distant 
heirs probably won't be in a good position to rent and maintain the 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	And heirs, even ones living close by, may not want the job of  
maintaining the property. Selling the property after you die also 
can also be a challenge since your heirs probably aren't familiar 
with your local real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
	``These difficult financial and nonfinancial issues make it  
critical that you thoroughly discuss your real estate issues with 
both professional advisers and your heirs, and adopt a plan while 
you are still in healthy position to do so,'' Augustine says. 
``Doing nothing could leave your heirs with a real headache.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Leaders Line Up Behind Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese leaders lined up behind the dollar today,  
calling for exchange rate stability after a massive intervention by 
the Bank of Japan blunted the yen's advance against the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sharp moves are highly undesirable,'' Vice Finance Minister  
Koji Tanami told reporters, spurring another brief spurt of 
dollar-buying in Tokyo today. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ action in currency markets Tuesday stopped the dollar's  
freefall against the yen. The greenback hit a low of 108 yen 
earlier in the week -- a blow to a currency that was over 147 yen in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading today, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 111.55 yen on  
the Tokyo foreign exchange market in late trading, down 0.95 yen 
from late Tuesday, but still well above the 28-month low it hit on 
Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese dollar-buying seemed for the short-term to quell  
currency markets marked by rapid jumps in recent weeks, and traders 
today were loath to let go of dollars in fear of another 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also did their part in buoying the currency.  
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of our dollar policy, I think that a strong dollar  
has served us well over the past six years,'' Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Longer-term, traders were uncertain where the dollar would go,  
in large part because the surge of the yen seemed to defy 
expectations that the currency would stay weak along with Japan's 
stagnant economy and stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, there have been factors fueling the yen. Rising bond  
yields in Japan appear to be leading some major investors there to 
keep their money at home. And deep economic problems in Brazil are 
also seen as a weight on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Andrew Shipley, economist with Shroeders Securities Japan  
Ltd. in Tokyo, said the factors backing up the yen -- including 
expectations that U.S. interest rates would fall relative to 
Japanese rates -- had run their course. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of those forces, the exchange rate in the coming  
weeks should more clearly match the relative economic power of the 
United States and Japan -- meaning a stronger dollar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. stock market ... reflects the underlying  
competitiveness of U.S. industry,'' Shipley said. ``Conversely, the 
continued collapse of Japanese asset prices suggests that 
investment opportunities here are quite limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States is enjoying a booming stock market and  
the lowest unemployment rate since 1970, Japan is mired in its 
worst recession since World War II with a record-high jobless rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say the U.S. is still the best place to park your  
money,'' Shipley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Japanese themselves seem divided over where they  
want the yen to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's latest spike against the dollar was sparked in part by  
Japanese Vice Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibara, who said last 
week that the U.S. economy was in a speculative bubble -- suggesting 
that the U.S. was a risky investment. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Japanese government has been very vocal about its aim to  
make the yen a global currency on par with the dollar and the newly 
launched euro. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, a stronger yen could hurt Japanese exports by  
making them more expensive in the United States at a time Tokyo is 
trying to keep a lid on unemployment -- a factor that certainly 
played a role in the BOJ's dollar-buying binge on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a coordinated view on what direction the policy  
should be,'' Shipley said. ``You get conflicting comments from 
various ministries in regards to developments in the financial 
markets.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Calm During News Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson suggested earlier this week that his  
mere presence at a fight guaranteed a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	So even with ticket sales reportedly lagging for Saturday's  
fight with Francois Botha, it wasn't surprising that Tyson did 
little at the final prefight press conference to try to get a few 
more fans in the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Tyson used Wednesday's event to promote a new line of  
clothing that his wife is selling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to sponsor it,'' Tyson said of the clothing line.  
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion actually appeared for only about  
15 minutes, then complained that he didn't get to say what he 
really wanted to say. 
</P>
<P>
	An incident a day earlier in which he cursed repeatedly in a  
conference call with radio and TV reporters led promoters to ask 
Tyson to tone things down. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put a muzzle on me,'' Tyson said. ``I can't really  
express what I want to today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though MGM Grand hotel officials claimed last minute demand  
would be heavy, tickets priced from $200 to $1,200 were reportedly 
not selling well for Tyson's first fight since he bit Evander 
Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Even promoter Dan Goosen's proclamation that ``when Mike Tyson  
becomes involved in an event, it becomes the biggest spectacle in 
boxing'' fell flat among an audience that didn't come close to 
filling a theater at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only buzz generated by the final appearance of the two  
fighters together came before the press conference even started, 
when a Tyson associate who goes around dressed in camouflage 
shouting ``guerrilla warfare'' was led away in handcuffs after 
ignoring police requests to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve ``Crocodile'' Fitch was later released and allowed to join  
Tyson on the dais. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who formerly held a piece of the IBF heavyweight title  
and whose only defeat was to former champion Michael Moorer, used 
his time to proclaim he was in great shape and couldn't be 
intimidated by Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be scared,'' said Botha, a South African who now lives  
in California. ``I've fought bigger guys when I was an amateur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson actually had to be introduced twice at the press  
conference, after first refusing to come out at the same time Botha 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on the dais, he put his head on the table before answering  
a few questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to fight, man,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The fight is Tyson's first in the 19 months since he bit  
Holyfield's ears and was disqualified in the third round of their 
heavyweight title fight. It was Tyson's second straight loss to 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm never going to put it out of my mind,'' Tyson said of the  
losses to Holyfield. ``But, hey, I'm not fighting Holyfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is expected to make more than $20 million for Saturday's  
scheduled 10-round fight, which will be televised by Showtime on 
pay-per-view at a cost of about $45 a household. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha will receive a little less than $2 million, but also the  
same shot that everyone who fights Tyson gets -- the chance to make 
himself a big name in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Francois Botha has the opportunity to graduate himself  
overnight into stardom,'' said Botha's manager, Sterling 
MacPherson. ``If you beat Mike Tyson, you should be realized as one 
of the best fighters in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Auction Set for Art by Cezanne, Picasso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Up to $110 million worth of art, including  
paintings by Cezanne and Picasso, and objects from the estate of 
Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney are heading for the auctioneer's 
block. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of important Post-Impressionist paintings, including  
works by Cezanne and Seurat, are among the pieces to be sold by 
Sotheby's auction house for three days and two nights in April and 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``This collection has to be one of the greatest American art  
collections ever formed, if not the greatest,'' said Diana Brooks, 
Sotheby's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The family decided to sell the property from Mrs. Whitney's five  
homes to raise money to pay taxes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York socialite and philanthropist left more than $300  
million worth of art by van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso and other 
masters to four major museums when she died last March. 
</P>
<P>
	Some the works that will be offered include Cezanne's ``Still  
Life With Curtain, Pitcher and Bowl of Fruit'' and Seurat's 
``Island of the Grande Jatte,'' each of which could fetch $25 to 
$35 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included are two important Picassos, both acquired in 1968  
from Gertrude Stein's collection.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pays Paula Jones $850,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paula Jones is awaiting the arrival of an  
$850,000 check from President Clinton, bringing an official end to 
the four-year saga spurred by her allegations of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton mailed the settlement check to Mrs. Jones on Tuesday,  
even as he braced for the heaviest fallout yet from her harassment 
suit -- an impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	To finance the settlement, the president drew about $375,000  
from his and Hillary Rodham Clinton's personal funds and got the 
rest of the money, about $475,000, from an insurance policy, a 
White House official told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ends it. The check is being Fed-Exed'' to Bill McMillan,  
one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the personal funds were drawn from the  
Clintons' blind trust, which was valued in their financial 
disclosure statement at between $1 million and about $5 million. 
None of the money was drawn from Clinton's legal defense fund, 
which raises money from private citizens to defray his legal bills, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	How much of that money Mrs. Jones will see is still at issue. As  
the settlement was reached in November, Mrs. Jones faced an 
outstanding claim by Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert Davis, the two 
lawyers who quit her case last year and filed an $800,000 lien 
against any settlement in order to collect legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's been decided yet'' how much Mrs. Jones will  
receive, said her friend and adviser, Susan Carpenter McMillan 
Tuesday night. ``We did hear they are sending out the check. We 
hope to receive it soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawsuit brought to light the president's affair with  
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and set in motion a 
criminal investigation that resulted in a historic House vote last 
month to impeach Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president files his trial brief today, and House prosecutors  
on Thursday will begin presenting to the Senate their case that the 
president obstructed justice in the Jones lawsuit and lied about it 
before a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reached a settlement with Mrs. Jones on Nov. 13 after  
four years of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that settlement, Clinton didn't admit any wrongdoing or  
apologize and simply agreed to make a cash settlement to Mrs. 
Jones, a former Arkansas state worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of  
Arkansas, made a crude advance in a room at a Little Rock hotel in 
1991. Clinton has steadfastly denied her accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified in that lawsuit on Jan. 17, 1998, and during  
questioning about his relationships with other women, denied he had 
``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky. Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr got permission to investigate whether Clinton was trying to 
obstruct the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was forced to acknowledge a relationship with Ms.  
Lewinsky in testimony before a federal grand jury last August. 
Starr's investigation led to a referral to the House of 
Representatives accusing Clinton of several criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed the lawsuit  
last April 1, ruling that Mrs. Jones' allegations, even if true, 
wouldn't qualify as a case of sexual harassment. An appeal of that 
dismissal was pending before a federal appeals court when the 
settlement was reached.

<HEADLINE> UCLA's Farris Spurred by Rejection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- When Kris Farris didn't perform up to  
expectations as a high school senior, Southern Cal withdrew its 
scholarship offer and Farris went across town to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Motivated by the snub and several years of postseason awards  
Farris failed to win, he developed into the 1998 Outland Trophy 
winner as college football's top interior lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a direct result of not being selected to any high school  
all-conference teams,'' Farris said Wednesday at a news conference 
preceding the Outland Trophy banquet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last season was the first time I've ever been a first-team,  
all-conference anything,'' said Farris, an All-Pac 10 and 
All-American junior who has declared himself eligible for the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Farris played a big role on the UCLA offense that averaged 40.5  
points last season, and not just because he's 6-foot-9, 315 pounds. 
In 360 passing plays, Farris never relinquished a sack. 
</P>
<P>
	Although UCLA's national title dream ended with a loss to Miami,  
it was a huge season for Farris. After learning he had won the 
Outland, Farris said he knew it was time to give up his senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole thing before the season was to win the award,''  
Farris said. ``After I learned I had won it, it changed my 
thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision preserved Dave Rimington's distinction as the only  
two-time Outland winner, and the former Nebraska All-American had a 
chance to thank Farris in person. 
</P>
<P>
	Rimington was invited to the ceremony, where he received a  
cast-iron trophy like those awarded in recent years to Outland 
winners. When Rimington won in 1982 and 1983, the winner got a 
plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventeen years it took that guy to build this thing,'' joked  
Rimington, who went on to play five seasons with the Cincinnati 
Bengals and three with the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rimington said he doesn't expect another two-time Outland  
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it will ever happen again because of the  
amount of money out there that is available to linemen now,'' 
Rimington said. ``It's a tremendous lure. You'd almost be foolish 
to walk away from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rimington recalled that he considered relinquishing his senior  
season to try the NFL draft. Back then, he said, it had been done 
by only a handful of college stars like Herschel Walker of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to be the first person to try to go pro as a  
junior, but I would have been the first lineman,'' Rimington said. 
``You look at Kris and he's 6-9, 320 pounds. I was 6-2. I thought I 
needed an extra year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Outland has been presented since 1946, and the list of  
winners includes plenty of famous names, including Alex Karras, who 
won at Iowa in 1957 and Merlin Olsen, who won at Utah State in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the pinnacle for an offensive lineman,'' Farris said.  
``This is the Heisman for us. You can't ask to go out any higher. 
The only thing I could have asked is that our team would have done 
better.''

<HEADLINE> Co. Ties Free Long-Distance to Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- What is your time worth?  
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland company is offering free long-distance service to  
callers around the country if they agree to listen to 
advertisements first. 
</P>
<P>
	BroadPoint Communications, a Landover, Md.-based company, tested  
the plan in Pittsburgh last year and began offering it nationwide 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Company president and CEO Perry Kamel says BroadPoint expects to  
have 1 million members by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	People who sign up for the service, called Freeway, will get up  
to two minutes of free long-distance calling in the United States 
for each advertisement of 10-15 seconds that they listen to. 
</P>
<P>
	Users must listen to the advertising before they are able to  
obtain the free call. For example, for a free 10-minute call, the 
user must listen to five ads. Broadpoint won't allow the call to 
extend beyond the 10 minutes, issuing a warning before cutting the 
caller off. The user, however, is free to call back and listen to 
more ads for additional long-distance time. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of weeks of advertising, the service began in  
Pittsburgh last April with about 800 people using the service, 
Kamel said. The number of users quickly grew to 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamel said enrolling in the service is free, but that Broadpoint  
may have to look at the possibility of charging if demand moves 
beyond expectations and the company needs to expand rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts question whether people will be willing to pay for  
free long-distance with their time, and whether those who are will 
be the customers businesses want to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question ... is whether the kind of customer who uses a  
free long-distance service is a demographic match with upscale 
customers advertisers want to get to,'' said Gary Arlen, president 
Arlen Communications Inc., which analyzes consumer 
telecommunications services. 
</P>
<P>
	BroadPoint started Freeway in partnership with Duquesne  
Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of DQE, Inc. The company 
says its demographic profile represents a cross-section of the 
population ``with an emphasis on advertisers' most desirable, 
upscale customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People can only sign up for the service through the company's  
Web site, located at www.BroadPoint.com. They are asked to fill out 
a detailed questionnaire requesting information about demographics, 
work, education, hobbies and shopping and travel tendencies. 
Advertisers can then select target audiences for their messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do is allow advertisers to determine what group they  
want to target,'' Kamel said. ``It really extends their ability to 
deliver the right message to the right people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers pay only for messages delivered. Freeway ensures  
that people who use the service hear the messages because they have 
to enter a response after hearing each one, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that have signed on to advertise through Freeway  
include TGI Friday's, Acura and Blockbuster Entertainment. But in 
addition to large companies, local businesses can advertise as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe's Lumber wants to advertise in a particular radius of  
his store in Minneapolis, we can accommodate that,'' Kamel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers can offer trial offers that consumers can order with  
a touch of a phone button, or companies can solicit information 
such as whether the caller planned to buy a car within the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense, we're extending the whole concept of interactive,  
media and electronic commerce well beyond the Internet,'' Kamel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are wary this will work, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``The more sophisticated telephone user is going to be more  
difficult to crack,'' said Jack Trout, of the marketing strategy 
firm, Trout &AMP; Partners Ltd. ``They have money and probably are more 
resistant to being hustled over the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he said, the phone is ``a privacy vehicle. It's going to  
be hard to make it a commercial vehicle.''

<HEADLINE> Calpine Buys geothermal Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Calpine Corporation has bought Unocal  
Corporation's steam field assets at The Geysers, the largest 
producing geothermal resource in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could help the city of Santa Rosa's plan to build a  
34-mile pipeline to carry Sonoma County wastewater to the 
steamfield about 60 miles north of San Francisco, where it would be 
turned into energy. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar pipeline has been in operation in Lake County since  
1997, using wastewater to increase geothermal production by about 
50 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should create a more efficient operation,'' Calpine  
Senior Vice President Ron Walter said on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose-based Calpine, which built the 26-mile pipeline that  
takes Lake County's treated wastewater to The Geysers, already 
owned a 25 percent interest in Unocal's Santa Rosa venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The steamfield also fuels Pacific Gas and Electric Company's 12  
Sonoma County power plants, which have a total capacity of 544 
megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase price was not disclosed. The deal is subject to  
regulatory approval and is expected to close within the next two 
months.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Jockey Still Enthusiastic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Linda Hughes said she never considered the  
possibility of never walking again, even as she was being airlifted 
to the hospital unable to feel anything in her legs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the prospect of never riding a horse again that was more  
upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Riding was my passion. It made my heart happy,'' the  
34-year-old jockey said Wednesday. ``Hopefully I'll be able to do 
it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, paralyzed from the waist down in a Dec. 1 fall at Calder  
Race Course, beamed with enthusiasm as she was wheeled into a 
briefing room at Jackson Memorial Hospital. It was her first public 
appearance since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's always been like that,'' said Lou Ann Feinberg, Hughes'  
twin sister. ``That's Linda. That's the attitude she's always had. 
It's amazing she's not lost it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes damaged her spinal cord when she was thrown from her  
mount, Exuberant Lady, who was making her second career start in 
the six-furlong maiden race. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandwiched between Tricky Majestic and eventual winner Sultry  
Boldness on the outside, Exuberant Lady clipped heels with the hind 
hooves of Sultry Boldness and stumbled. Hughes was catapulted over 
Exuberant Lady's head. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never want to hear `click-click' when you're behind a  
horse,'' Hughes said. ``I've clipped heels before, but was able to 
roll with it and get up. I did gymnastics for a lot of years and 
knew what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, she hit the dirt face-first before her legs  
pitched over the top. She remembers nothing of the impact, or the 
tense moments when she was loaded into the track ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I remember was in the ambulance and the  
outrider said, `Helicopter to Jackson,''' she said. ``I thought, 
`Oh, no, I'm in trouble.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was diagnosed with a severely bruised spinal cord, along  
with a punctured lung, bruised ribs and injured spleen. Three days 
later, doctors performed surgery to fuse parts of her spine 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	She still must wear a back brace until March, but has adjusted  
well to the wheelchair and new skills that come with it. On 
Wednesday, therapists tested her ability to maneuver around her 
home and gave her high marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``She can do everything herself,'' therapist Maria Gomez said.  
``She can dress herself, she can get in and out of bed. She's doing 
excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, Hughes may even get to go home. Though she still will  
return for outpatient therapy, the Miami Beach apartment she shares 
with her sister is ready for use after modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a big question mark over my head -- what to do with the  
rest of my life,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Rupert, Idaho, Hughes had been a successful jockey  
at Detroit Race Course before deciding to cast her fortunes on 
Florida's tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	She had 55 mounts and one winner at the 122-day Calder summer  
meeting. She had only a handful of rides during the first 24 days 
of the Tropical-at-Calder winter meet, with no winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes returned to the track on New Year's Day, welcomed back in  
a ceremony at Gulfstream Park. Surrounded by fellow jockeys, fans 
crowded four-deep in the winner's circle to wish her well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fortunate there were a lot of people there, so I  
couldn't see the horses,'' she said. ``It's still upsetting that I 
might not get back up there again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes plans to stay close to horses, though, and even sees  
herself riding again -- if only for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes in life bad things happen, but you can't let it get  
you down,'' she said. ``This wheelchair isn't going to beat me.''

<HEADLINE> Brit. Firm Plans U.S. Air Cargo Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) -- A British corporation hopes to create a  
competitor to Federal Express Corp. and United Parcel Service by 
transporting oversized, heavy cargo between the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins Group PLC, a holding company, has signed a letter of  
intent to build a cargo hub at the airport in Smyrna, Tenn., as the 
first step in its plan to create a network for transport of 
oversized equipment and other cargo, John Ellington, director of 
the Smyrna/Rutherford County Airport, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smyrna is located about 20 miles southeast of Nashville.  
Ellington said the company was looking for a smaller, low-cost 
airport with space for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins Group has created a Tennessee subsidiary called  
PlaneStations Inc. to build the hub. PlaneStations wants to fill a 
niche that air cargo companies such as Federal Express and UPS 
avoid -- oversized equipment, said chief executive officer Clinton 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Within two years, PlaneStations could offer direct passenger  
flights from Europe, with tourists either staying in Tennessee or 
catching flights in Nashville to other U.S. destinations, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company eventually hopes to develop 100  
international service stations -- including 20 in the United States 
-- with Smyrna serving as the U.S. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the establishment of open trade links in the European  
Union and the vast commercial structure in the United States, it is 
easy to see why a better transportation system is necessary,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins is a London-based holding company that reported 1998  
revenues of $24.6 million.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A stuntman suffered a fatal heart attack while  
filming an episode of ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' medical examiners 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	William Charles Skeen, 49, had suffered from hardening of the  
arteries and had undergone heart surgery several years ago, 
relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeen, a veteran actor and stuntman, stopped breathing after the  
GMC Suburban in which he was riding slammed into the ground during 
a car chase scene that involved a 140-foot launch from a ramp. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the car was hospitalized for treatment of back and  
neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeen went to work as a stuntman in Hollywood during the 1970s  
and four years ago moved to Texas to join the ``Walker'' crew.

<HEADLINE> Prostitution Ring List Made Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON WOODS, Mich. (AP) -- The computerized little black  
book of the ``Huntington Woods Madam'' -- 7,000 names kept by a 
prostitution ring in an area filled with Detroit's movers and 
shakers -- went public Wednesday, possibly confirming the worst 
fears of suspicious spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	The list was released on CD-ROM after the Detroit Free Press and  
The Detroit News sued to see whether any public officials were on 
it. An initial review of the list by The Associated Press turned up 
addresses from as far away as Europe and Korea but no well-known 
names in the Detroit area. 
</P>
<P>
	Since authorities seized the files of Marci Devernay, police  
have been besieged with calls from curious wives and men offering 
excuses for why their names might be in the records. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not in the process of divorce and you find that your  
husband is on the list, you might be in the process,'' said Michael 
Eberth, a local divorce attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland County is home to many of the Detroit area's elite.  
Huntington Woods, about 15 miles north of Detroit, is an almost 
entirely residential community of 6,400 people, with a mean 
household income of more than $74,000. Stately trees line well-kept 
streets, and homes are neatly landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all anxious to see the list. There are all kinds of  
rumors who's on it,'' said Joe Zaleski, who has lived in Huntington 
Woods since 1963. ``I want to see the politicians. That's who I'm 
interested in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities allege that Ms. Devernay, 33, employed at least 25  
male and female prostitutes and cloaked the operation with names 
such as Secret Rendezvous, Tangos, Men to Men and Continental 
Limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	She pleaded guilty to racketeering last month as part of a plea  
bargain. Investigators raided her houses in Huntington Woods and 
Berkley and found handwritten notes, computer disks and a Rolodex 
containing clients' and employees' names, telephone numbers, 
meeting spots, and credit card and driver's license numbers. Ms. 
Devernay faces up to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington Woods police released 7,000 names Wednesday and said  
there were another 7,000 on Ms. Devernay's Rolodex and about 6,000 
more in paper files that would be released later. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca and others opposed  
releasing the names, saying they were concerned about families' 
privacy and the possibility that the list could include innocent 
people. Police noted as the list was released that people on it had 
not been individually investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostitution rings often put prominent names on such lists in  
hopes that will keep the information private, Gorcyca said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these individuals may not be clients of Devernay's,  
and they may not have participated,'' he said. ``And how do they 
regain their reputation once their names have been published?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Leigh Hutton, managing editor of the Detroit Free Press,  
said that whether the newspaper would publish any names would 
``depend on what we find.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We never would publish a name just because it's on the list,''  
she said. ``We would always go to the person, ask them to explain 
why they're on there, what they thought. For all we know, it could 
just be a wish list.''

	Mark Silverman, publisher and editor of The Detroit News, said  
his paper was not planning to publish the names. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is a convicted felon accusing 20,000 people  
of a crime,'' Silverman said. ``To name them would violate the 
fundamentals of basic journalism ethics that should govern all 
media outlets.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Executes Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A man convicted of kidnapping, raping and  
killing a woman in 1981 by shoving her off a cliff and then bashing 
her head with rocks was executed by injection Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jess James Gillies, 38, offered no last words.  
</P>
<P>
	No members of Gillies' family or the victim's family attended  
the execution, though Corrections officials said relatives visited 
with Gillies before the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillies and friend Mike Logan were convicted of abducting,  
raping and murdering Suzanne Rossetti, 26. She had bought them a 
six-pack of beer and given them a ride as a reward for opening her 
car after she locked the keys inside at a Phoenix convenience store 
on Jan. 29, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said she was thrown off a 40-foot cliff but didn't  
die immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Rossetti begged for mercy before the men  
stoned her and buried her under boulders and rocks. A coroner said 
she probably was still alive when she was buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan, now 45, cooperated with prosecutors and was sentenced to  
life in prison with a chance for parole after 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillies was the 13th execution since Arizona reinstated the  
death penalty in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a former truck driver who killed a police officer  
during a drug deal 15 years ago was scheduled to be executed later 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Sharpe Apologizes for Marino Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After being admonished by his coach and  
77-year-old grandmother, Shannon Sharpe admitted he misspoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, Denver's loquacious tight end, offered a public apology  
Wednesday to Miami quarterback Dan Marino, whom he labeled as ``a 
loser'' following the Broncos' 38-3 victory over the Dolphins in 
last week's AFC playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan, if I offended you, your family, your wife, your kids,  
your mother, your father, your brothers and sisters, I stand before 
you and I sincerely, sincerely apologize,'' Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you feel about me as a player, I can understand.  
Whether you like or dislike me, I can live with that. But I would 
never want you to dislike me or disrespect me as a person. ... I'm 
sure you will get this message as you have all the other messages 
that I have sent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The animosity between Sharpe and Marino began last summer when  
Sharpe was asked to compare Marino with Broncos quarterback and 
1983 NFL Draft classmate John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe suggested Marino's best days are behind him by saying  
Elway ``doesn't want to be like another quarterback I won't name, 
but he's a guy who plays in the southern part of the United States 
who is no longer the player that he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino shot back in September, referring to Sharpe as  
``Stanley,'' and said Elway is the main reason Sharpe has been 
selected to seven Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Things remained quiet until last Saturday when Denver eliminated  
the Dolphins from the AFC playoffs. After the game, Sharpe walked 
into a group of reporters and declared: ``Don't ask me about Marino 
because I don't talk about losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe's comment drew criticism from Broncos coach Mike  
Shanahan, who said he was disappointed in his veteran tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Sharpe's grandmother, Mary Porter, who helped raise Sharpe,  
scolded him during a phone call earlier this week. She said 
Marino's feelings were probably hurt and that Sharpe should never 
say such mean things about anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't calling Dan Marino a loser,'' Sharpe explained  
Wednesday. ``I was saying I didn't want to talk about anybody that 
had lost the game, so therefore I didn't want to talk about Dan 
Marino or anybody else on that ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is the NFL's career passing leader with 58,913 yards and  
is sure to be a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee. Though he is 
still without a Super Bowl ring after 16 seasons, Marino's resume 
is hardly lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got misconstrued,'' Sharpe said, ``or the way I said it may  
have seemed that I was calling Dan Marino a loser, and in no shape, 
way or form would I ever do that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid continued concern about American 
export prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors expected rainfall in South America to prove beneficial  
to competing crops now growing there, while a steep drop in world 
financial markets also pressured prices. Weak economies likely 
would reduce already poor trade prospects around the world.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Jockey Wants To Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Click-click.  
</P>
<P>
	When a jockey hears that sound in tight quarters, it's a  
disturbing sign of impending trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never want to hear `click-click' when you're behind a  
horse,'' Linda Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the sound of 1,000-pound animals clipping hooves. And it's  
a sound Hughes will carry with her as she adjusts to life in a 
wheelchair, the result of a severe spill six weeks ago that left 
her paralyzed from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always know in the back of your mind that something like  
this could happen, but I never thought it could happen to me,'' 
Hughes said Wednesday. ``I never even had broken a bone before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks after being airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital  
with no feeling in her legs, Hughes made her first public 
appearance looking anything but discouraged by the path that lays 
in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, she even dreams of getting back on a horse in the near  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I never walk again, I'll ride again. That's for  
sure,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's always been like that,'' said Lou Ann Feinberg, Hughes'  
twin sister. ``That's Linda. That's the attitude she's always had. 
It's amazing she's not lost it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes damaged her spinal cord Dec. 1 when she was thrown from  
her mount, Exuberant Lady, who was making her second career start. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandwiched between Tricky Majestic and eventual winner Sultry  
Boldness on the outside, Exuberant Lady clipped heels with the hind 
hooves of Sultry Boldness and stumbled. Hughes was catapulted over 
Exuberant Lady's head. 
</P>
<P>
	She hit the dirt face-first before her legs pitched over the  
top. She remembers nothing of the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I remember was in the ambulance and the  
outrider said, `Helicopter to Jackson,''' she said. ``I thought, 
`Oh, no, I'm in trouble.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was diagnosed with a severely bruised spinal cord, along  
with a punctured lung, bruised ribs and injured spleen. Three days 
later, doctors performed surgery to fuse parts of her spine. 
</P>
<P>
	She must wear a back brace until March, but has adjusted well to  
the wheelchair and new skills that come with it. On Wednesday, 
therapists tested her ability to maneuver around her home and gave 
her high marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``She can do everything herself,'' therapist Maria Gomez said.  
``She can dress herself, she can get in and out of bed. She's doing 
excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, Hughes may even get to go home. Though she still will  
return for outpatient therapy, the Miami Beach apartment she shares 
with her sister is ready for use after modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a big question mark over my head -- what to do with the  
rest of my life,'' said the native of Rupert, Idaho, who moved to 
Florida after a successful run at Detroit Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes returned to the track on New Year's Day, welcomed back in  
a ceremony at Gulfstream Park. Surrounded by fellow jockeys, fans 
crowded four-deep in the winner's circle to wish her well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes in life bad things happen, but you can't let it get  
you down,'' she said. ``This wheelchair isn't going to beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's that kind of spunk that leaves others amazed. Dr. Kresimir  
Banovac, medical director of Jackson's rehabilitation center, even 
backed off his original prognosis that Hughes would remain a 
paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Wednesday if he thought she would walk again, Banovac  
said, ``Yes, I do.''

<HEADLINE> Panel To Pick 50 Greatest Actors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Undaunted by criticism of its top 100 motion  
pictures list last year, the American Film Institute is picking the 
50 greatest American film legends of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey Bogart, Jean Harlow, Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth and  
Spencer Tracy were obvious candidates on the list of 500 nominees, 
which seemed to include everyone who ever starred in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan is there, too. And Will Rogers, George Raft and  
The Three Stooges. 
</P>
<P>
	``This celebration of legends will no doubt generate a great  
deal of discussion and controversy. Someone will find fault,'' AFI 
chairman Tom Pollock said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By design, current box office stars like Tom Hanks, Meryl  
Streep, John Travolta, Harrison Ford and Susan Sarandon are missing 
from the list. 
</P>
<P>
	AFI defined ``American screen legend'' as an actor with a  
significant screen presence in American movies whose screen debut 
occurred prior to 1951 or whose debut occurred after 1950 but whose 
death marked a completed body of work. 
</P>
<P>
	That allowed inclusion of James Dean, Grace Kelly. John Belushi,  
Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen, Sal Mineo, Anthony Perkins, John 
Houseman and others, even Divine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always difficult to eliminate, but we feel very  
comfortable with this list. It really is all encompassing,'' AFI 
director and chief executive officer Jean Picker-Firstenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were asked to consider five criteria: star quality  
(charisma and presence), craft (ability to embody distinctly 
different characters), legacy (body of work left behind), 
popularity (public following over time) and historical context. 
</P>
<P>
	AFI archivists compiled the list of 250 actors and 250 actresses  
on the ballot, which were sent Tuesday and must be returned in two 
weeks. Write-ins were encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,500 film industry professionals, including  
historians, archivists and writers got ballots. As leaders of the 
nation, Pollock said, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore 
were also invited to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 top actors and 25 top actresses will be announced by 50  
movie stars during a June CBS-TV special ``AFI's 100 Years ... 100 
Stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's patterned after last summer's AFI special which named the  
best American feature films ever. ``Citizen Kane'' was No. 1, 
followed by ``Casablanca,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``Gone With the 
Wind,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and 94 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics and movie buffs jumped on the AFI for overlooking so  
many silent movies. Only four were chosen, and way down in 44th 
place was D.W. Griffith's ``The Birth of a Nation.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons To Tune Out Metrodome Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons are hoping to turn down  
the volume at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves talked with NFL officials about rules that  
prohibit teams from generating artificial noise -- music, cheers and 
other sounds -- during a play. He raised the issue after talking 
with the Arizona Cardinals, who lost to the Minnesota Vikings last 
weekend in a divisional playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We called to clarify because the Cardinals had a tremendous  
time (calling plays), saying there was amplified noise behind their 
bench,'' Reeves said Wednesday. ``We called the league to see what 
you can and can't do. Do we have to deal with noise being pumped in 
right behind us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota general manager Tim Connolly told the Minneapolis  
Star-Tribune that Reeves wasn't the first coach to complain about 
the decibel level at the Metrodome, site of Sunday's NFL 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many coaches have complained about the atmosphere, saying it's  
unfair,'' he said. ``It started with Green Bay and Mike Holmgren. 
The league is saying they've had some complaints from Dan Reeves of 
the Falcons about this and that in terms of the noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly added, ``We're not going to do anything differently  
than we've done all season. The league is not instructing us to do 
anything or to change anything. They're just reminding us what the 
rules are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said he was told by NFL officials that ``they aren't  
going to give anybody an unfair advantage. What that means, I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons' offense will try to cope with the Metrodome noise  
by using hand signals and having quarterback Chris Chandler move up 
and down the line to make sure everyone gets the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the burden will be on quarterbacks coach Jack Burns to  
make quick decisions. He calls the plays from the press box booth, 
relaying them to the field by radio headset. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where Jack Burns has to step up and get the plays in a  
lot quicker in situations where there might be an audible 
involved,'' Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns said he is up to the task. ``We always have a quick  
rhythm.''

<HEADLINE> US Cos. Sued Over Saipan Sweatshops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thousands of Asians have been lured to the  
U.S. territory of Saipan, where they are beaten and forced to live 
under guard in cramped, rat-infested quarters while making popular 
clothing tagged ``Made in the USA,'' according to sweeping lawsuits 
that seek more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50,000 people, mostly young women, have been recruited  
from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Thailand with promises 
of good wages, only to wind up in sweatshops that ``would make 
medieval conditions look good,'' plaintiffs' attorney William 
Lerach said Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Saipan, a 13-mile-long tropical isle in the Northern Marianas,  
``is America's worst sweatshop,'' plaintiffs' attorney Al Meyerhoff 
said in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits seek more than $1 billion in damages,  
disgorgement of profits and unpaid wages for conditions they claim 
have persisted for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Two class-action suits representing workers were filed in  
federal courts in Los Angeles and Saipan. The human rights groups -- 
Global Exchange, Sweatshop Watch, Asian Law Caucus and the Union of 
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees -- filed suit in 
state court in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuses in Saipan have been documented in the past. This  
represents the first legal attempt to hold U.S. retailers 
accountable for alleged mistreatment of workers by subcontractors 
under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
Act, attorneys said at news conferences in New York City and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcontractors force people to work up to 12 hours a day,  
seven days a week, and threaten them with beatings and verbal abuse 
if they refuse unpaid overtime to meet quotas set by factory 
managers, the lawsuits allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers' passports are confiscated upon arrival, they are not  
allowed to leave the factory compound and their social activities 
are strictly monitored, Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32 Saipan factories -- mostly owned by Chinese, Japanese and  
Korean subcontractors -- stamp their clothing with ``Made in the 
USA'' tags to sidestep duties, tariffs and quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 18 companies named in the lawsuits, Nordstrom, Warnaco,  
Tommy Hilfiger, J.C. Penney, Wal-Mart, Osh Kosh B'Gosh and Dayton 
Hudson Corp. insist they hire subcontractors that strictly follow 
U.S. labor laws. Other companies said they had no comment or did 
not immediately return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart said it does not even accept merchandise from factories  
in Saipan. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela Rucker, spokeswoman for the industry group National  
Retail Federation, said whether it is misleading to use a ``Made in 
the USA'' label is a matter for the Federal Trade Commission and 
truth-in-labeling laws to regulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without seeing the charges, the most that we can say is that  
retailers are understandably shocked by any such allegations made, 
and that they have codes of conduct they share with their 
suppliers, and that they only use suppliers that share the same 
commitment to moral, legal and ethical production,'' Ms. Rucker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman identified as ``Jane Doe I'' claims she was told by  
co-workers when she arrived that employees who become pregnant have 
to undergo an abortion or be deported, the Los Angeles suit says. 
Other women echoed those claims in the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers live as many as eight to a room in guarded barracks  
enclosed by barbed wire and have no access to drinking water except 
the bottled water they're forced to buy, the suits say. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits allege some women are forced to work with injuries and  
endure sexual harassment, unsafe working conditions, unhygenic food 
and severe malnutrition while relatives in home countries are 
sometimes intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
	Many allegedly pay as much as $7,000 as a ``recruitment fee'' to  
work. Some are lured by recruiters who say they will be living just 
an hour's train ride from Los Angeles, Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the job because, like millions of people, I wanted to  
come to America,'' said Carmencita Abad, a Filipino native who 
spent six years on the island working for one of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	She said quality inspectors representing The Gap visited her  
factory, but conditions did not change after they left. Many earn 
less than $500 a month, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fiscal year that ended in October, the 32 Saipan  
companies shipped an estimated $1 billion in wholesale clothing 
duty-free to the U.S. mainland, saving more than $200 million, 
Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the U.S. Labor Department and other agencies  
uncovered abuses in Saipan late last year, but attempts to impose 
reforms were met with resistance by the local bureaucrats and rich 
businessmen who virtually rule the island, Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northern Marianas, seized by U.S. troops from Japan in World  
War II, negotiated a commonwealth relationship with Washington that 
left control of immigration and minimum wages in local hands. It 
also exempted Saipan's exports from the U.S. duties and quotas that 
limit imports.

<HEADLINE> Handlers Put Muzzle on Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The question to Mike Tyson concerned whether he  
was still a hungry fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to answer that, but they put a muzzle on me,'' Tyson  
said Wednesday at a news conference. ``I can't say what I really 
want to say. There was an incident on TV with a gentleman from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you ask him some questions,'' said Tyson, referring  
to Francois Botha, his opponent for a 10-round fight Saturday night 
in the MGM Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	A few questions were directed to Botha, who said, ``This is the  
biggest moment in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident Tyson referred to occurred during a conference call  
Tuesday with radio and TV reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was asked by Russ Salzberg, a New York radio and TV  
broadcaster, if he thought he could control his rage. He replied 
with curses. When asked why he had to use profane language, he 
cursed some more. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Wednesday's news conference began, Steve Fitch, a Tyson  
second and cheerleader known as Crocodile, was shouting Tyson's 
praises and was asked by security people not to cause a 
disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you going to do, cuff me?'' Fitch asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Put your hands behind you,'' said a security man, who then  
cuffed him. He was led from the theater, but returned to join Tyson 
on the dais 13 minutes after Tyson had been introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference run by Dan Goosen of America Presents, who  
is promoting the fight instead of Don King, lasted 43 minutes. King 
doesn't even get warmed up in 43 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson and King are suing each other, with Tyson claiming King  
stole money from him. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without King, there was plenty of baloney.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's fighting for his legacy,'' Goosen said. ``He's on the  
road to defining his place in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That caused some chuckles.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mike will do his speaking for me with his fists Saturday,''  
said Shelley Finkel, who has replaced John Horne and Rory Holloway 
as Tyson's manager. Tyson also is in litigation with Horne and 
Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha said he still considered Tyson to be the world's premier  
heavyweight despite his two losses to Evander Holyfield. This will 
be Tyson's first fight since June 28, 1997, when he bit Holyfield's 
ears, leading to his disqualification and the revocation of his 
license. His license was restored Oct. 19 on a 4-1 vote by the 
Nevada State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you strive to be the best in the world at anything,  
handball, anything, there are going to be some disappointing 
moments,'' said Tyson, who next month faces sentencing in Maryland 
after pleading no contest to two misdemeanor assault charges 
stemming from a traffic accident involving his wife, Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	How that will affect his parole in Indiana, where he served  
three years on rape conviction, remains to be seen. His probation 
is scheduled to end in March.

	Clinton Not Thinking About Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of opening arguments in his Senate  
trial, President Clinton said he intends ``to spend as little time 
thinking about'' his impeachment as possible and focus instead on 
issues facing Americans. Clinton spoke for the first time about the 
crisis since his impeachment last month: ``I think the Senate has 
to deal with that. We filed our brief today. It makes our case.'' 
He added, ``They have their job to do in the Senate and I have mine 
and I intend to do it.'' In their trial brief, the presidential 
lawyers argued that there are no legal, constitutional or factual 
grounds for removal of the president. The Senate also received 
today all the public evidence in the case.

	Stocks End Down; Dow Off 125.12  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower going into the close but above  
their worst levels of the day, after Brazil's devaluation of its 
currency ignited a sharp but brief sell-off in morning trading. 
Brazil is important to U.S. markets because it is a huge importer 
of American goods, and because a bad stumble in its economy could 
send emerging markets tumbling throughout Latin America. The Dow 
industrials closed down 125.12 at 9,349.56. The Dow had been as low 
as 9,213.10. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 2,114-1,025. The 
Nasdaq fell 3.43 to 2,317.32.

	Clinton Gives Sneak Peek at Speech  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met today with a group of  
labor leaders to sound out economic themes for his State of the 
Union address and try to show he is not consumed by his impeachment 
trial. As the meeting began, Clinton told reporters he would 
discuss Social Security, public education and health care -- three 
themes he intends to address in his State of the Union message next 
week.

	Michael Jordan Retires  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan, the NBA's greatest player, made  
it official today, retiring from the Chicago Bulls after 13 seasons 
and six championships. But he left open the slightest possibility 
that he might return one day. Jordan said he was ``99.9 percent'' 
sure he would never return and added, ``You can read that for what 
it's worth. ... I'm very secure in my decision.'' The Jordan era 
included five MVP awards, 10 scoring titles and 12 All-Star 
appearances.

	France Offers Iraq Monitoring Plan  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A French proposal to lift the oil embargo  
on Iraq recommends a new monitoring system that would focus on 
preventing Baghdad from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, 
rather than accounting for what it may still have. The shift, 
outlined in a proposal released today, is significant because U.N. 
weapons inspectors have maintained Iraq still harbors the deadly 
weapons. Baghdad has said inspectors may not return to Iraq 
following the U.S.-British airstrikes Dec. 16-19. Also today, 
American warplanes patrolling the ``no-fly'' zone over Iraq 
attacked several missile installations after being targeted by 
Iraqi radar, U.S. officials said.

	Arafat Given Ultimatum on Prisoners  
</P>
<P>
	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian lawmakers, furious that  
450 of Yasser Arafat's political opponents are being held without 
trial, gave Arafat's government two weeks to either press charges 
or release the detainees. Palestinian lawmakers also demanded an 
end to political arrests and said all such prisoners should be 
released immediately. Since Arafat's Palestinian Authority was 
established in 1994, its security forces have arrested thousands of 
Palestinians accused of political activity -- most for suspected 
links to Hamas or other militant groups. But only 11 have been 
charged and successfully prosecuted, according to one legislator.

	Girl Said To Devise Faster E-mail  
</P>
<P>
	BLARNEY, Ireland (AP) -- A 16-year-old Irish schoolgirl has  
developed an e-mail code that may be 10 times faster than the 
current data protection code used. Sarah Flannery from Blarney is 
being hailed as a mathematical genius for devising a new code for 
sending electronic mail -- and is being flooded by job offers from 
computer firms, the Times of London said today. Flannery unveiled 
the code to amazed judges at the Irish Young Scientists and 
Technology Exhibition last weekend.

	IOC Rules Out Action Vs. Salt Lake  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC has ruled out sanctions against Salt Lake  
City officials in connection with the Olympics' biggest corruption 
scandal, an IOC investigator said. Jacques Rogge said the 
investigative panel had considered sanctions against Salt Lake 
officials connected with the 2002 bid but such action was ruled out 
when the organizing committee's president and vice president 
resigned. He also said the IOC was prepared to investigate charges 
of corruption in other host city election campaigns, including 
Sydney, host of the 2000 Summer Games.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Extend Police Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton planned to propose a  
five-year, $6 billion anti-crime package Thursday that would up the 
ante on his nearly fulfilled pledge to put 100,000 new cops on the 
beat nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolstered by preliminary data suggesting the number of violent  
crimes in 1998 could be a 25-year low, Clinton was scheduled to 
venture across the Potomac River to Alexandria, Va., to unveil a 
new community policing initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics midyear  
report being released Thursday projects that the total number of 
violent crimes -- incidents both reported to police and those 
unreported -- could fall below 3 million for the first time since 
1973, when the bureau started its annual interviews with crime 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The momentum is so strongly on our side that if we continue to  
hire more police, to engage the community and to give police the 
technology they need to do a better job we can continue to have 
dramatic reductions in the crime,'' Jose Cerda, a crime specialist 
on the president's Domestic Policy Council, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last October, 88,500 new police officers had been hired  
under a 1994 crime bill authorizing federal aid to local law 
enforcement agencies for putting more cops on the street. The 
target of 100,000 new officers under the so-called COPS program is 
expected to be reached this May. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's new budget would ask Congress for $1.3 billion in  
fiscal 2000 -- and a total of $6.4 billion over the next five years 
-- to extend the COPS program, Cerda said. 
</P>
<P>
	The balanced budget agreement reached by Clinton and  
congressional Republicans in 1996 planned to phase out COPS, 
allotting $300 million for fiscal 2000 and then shutting it down 
the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's proposed package would earmark $600 million in the  
budget year starting Oct. 1 for the hiring of 30,000 to 50,000 
additional officers, ``with an effort to target new police officers 
to crime hot spots,'' Cerda said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hopeful that Congress will see the wisdom of continuing  
a very successful program that has, and will continue to have, 
strong law enforcement and local-level support,'' Cerda said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an advance copy of the BJS' mid-year report, the  
2.88 million serious violent crimes projected for all of 1998 based 
on surveys conducted the first half of the year compares with 3.04 
million the bureau reported in its final data for 1997. The number 
has been steadily dropping since a high of 4.19 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey defines serious violent crimes as rape, robbery,  
aggravated assault and homicide. If simple assault is factored in, 
the 1997 total rises to 8.61 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Property crime rates for 1998 are expected to be less than half  
what they were in 1973, at 520 per 1,000 households, according to 
the BSJ preliminary report. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the money designated for hiring new police,  
Clinton's proposed $1.3-billion package for fiscal 2000 includes 
funds for several competitive grant programs: 
</P>
<P>
	--$350 million for local police agencies to tap into new  
communication, crime-solving and crime analysis technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	--$150 million for communities to hire prosecutors and  
``neighborhood DA's'' for locally tailored preventive and 
crime-solving programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--$50 million for communities to acquire technology for  
community-based prosecution programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--$125 million for innovative community programs, such as  
bringing schools and churches together in the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``This initiative is one of the few billion-dollar-plus  
increases'' that Clinton is proposing in this year's budget, Cerda 
said. ``The data from BSJ, we think, is a good indicator that it is 
working.''

<HEADLINE> IOC May Boot Some Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The IOC says it has enough evidence to  
complete its bribery investigation and will recommend expelling 
some members and changing the site-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
said the SLOC ethics panel has identified eight IOC members who 
could be implicated. IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz said as many 
as a dozen members could be ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the commission investigating bribery allegations  
in Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games is 
scheduled to be released Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission has identified improper behavior by certain IOC  
members with respect to the Salt Lake City bid,'' a committee 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC demanded explanations this week from members implicated  
in the investigation. President Juan Antonio Samaranch has said 
guilty members would be expelled or asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also will recommend changes in how Olympic host  
cities are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, speaking today on NBC's ``Today'' program, said Salt  
Lake would not loose the games because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people there have been working very hard. The venues are  
in place. Things are moving forward,'' DeFrantz said. ``The IOC is 
very satisfied with the progress in Salt Lake City. ... The 
athletes of the world deserve to have Salt Lake City as the site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the Canadian vice president heading the IOC inquiry,  
also said the 2002 Games would stay put. The next job, he said, was 
to cull the ``bad apples'' from the IOC itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake has cleaned house and the IOC is cleaning house,''  
Pound told the Toronto Globe and Mail from Barbados, where he is on 
vacation. ``The games, which were awarded on the basis of the merit 
of the candidacy, will be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler reiterated his concern  
that Salt Lake City won't be able to raise enough money to stage 
the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible for the SLOC to reduce its spending further,''  
Hodler told Swiss radio. ``If the budget isn't balanced, one could 
envisage transferring to Calgary or Lake Placid the sports for 
which installations haven't been built in Salt Lake. Maybe ski 
jumping, speedskating, cross-country skiing and the biathlon. 
That's not a proposal, but a working hypothesis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, IOC member Kevin Gosper said the committee will  
examine claims by Bruce Baird, a senior member of Sydney's 
successful bid for the 2000 Summer Games, that he was approached 
for bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's advised me of two conversations he had at the time of the  
Sydney bid, which may have been interpreted to be seeking some sort 
of opportunity,'' Gosper told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird told Gosper an IOC member and an agent offered votes for  
cash, the network reported. Baird also told ABC Television that he 
was approached by someone claiming to represent African delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--SLOC canceled its Thursday meeting because the committee's  
ethics panel isn't ready to report results of its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to pressure the ethics committee because I want  
its report to be as thorough as they want it to be,'' Garff said. 
``That's why I didn't reschedule the meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Vicki Varela, spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Leavitt, said the SLOC  
ethics panel has not confirmed accusations that female escort or 
prostitution services were provided to visiting IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers indefinitely postponed the unveiling of Salt Lake's  
official mascot. The unveiling was to have been Feb. 8. ``This is 
not the appropriate time,'' said Shelley Thomas, SLOC senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	-- David Johnson, who resigned as SLOC vice president last week,  
was accused of attacking a TV crew on his doorstep Monday. Johnson 
yelled at a reporter and cameraman from KSTU to get off his 
property. He then grabbed a microphone and camera, according to the 
station, which showed part of the struggle on tape. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pirjo Haeggman, an IOC member from Finland, denied any  
wrongdoing and said she had no intention of resigning in the wake 
of reports her ex-husband had worked for Salt Lake's bid committee. 
The New York Times reported Haeggman's former husband worked 
briefly for the bid committee on an environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
	Bjarne Haeggman denied today that he had worked for the Salt  
Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	--IOC member Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador denied wrongdoing. He said  
from Guayaquil that his stepdaughter, Nancy, worked briefly for the 
Utah state government restoring paintings, but denied she had also 
worked for and received scholarship aid from the Salt Lake 
committee. The Chicago Tribune quoted former SLOC leader Thomas 
Welch as saying he helped fund her education at a school in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chilean Olympic Committee president Sergio Santander denied  
receiving any money from Salt Lake and said he had asked SLOC's 
investigators for more information. Santander said he was ``deeply 
upset'' about reports that Welch had given $10,000 to his campaign 
for mayor of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Associated Press reported that African Olympic official  
Jean-Claude Ganga will fight any attempts to oust him from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to lay down and die,'' said an Olympic source,  
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He will only go if there is 
absolutely no other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations against Ganga include accepting a $50,000 payment  
from Welch, using committee help on a Utah land deal that netted 
$60,000 and receiving free medical services for his mother and 
himself at Utah hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	--A senior member of the Toronto 1996 Olympic bid group, who was  
not identified, told the Toronto Sun that the group was scammed by 
IOC members in schemes involving airline tickets.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Rep. Promises Quick Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The words laying out the impeachment case  
against President Clinton on Thursday will be those of a Green Bay 
Packers fan who has won an anti-tax group's ``Taxpayers' Friend 
Award'' for 18 years straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., one of 13 House members  
who will act as prosecutors during Clinton's impeachment trial, 
said he spent several days writing a statement he says will take 
less than an hour to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote some of it sitting on the floor of his home while  
watching the Packers lose to the San Francisco 49ers earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not done by staff. It is not done by a ghostwriter,''  
Sensenbrenner said Wednesday. ``What you will hear tomorrow is Jim 
Sensenbrenner and nobody else. ... Speeches written by committee 
are awful. This is me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner, 55, an attorney, represents a Wisconsin  
congressional district that includes suburban Milwaukee. The 
district is 98 percent white, 1 percent Hispanic and less than 0.5 
of a percent black, according to 1990 census figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his sometimes biting conservative rhetoric, he began  
his first term in January 1979 after serving 10 years in the 
Wisconsin Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner is a favorite of the National Taxpayers Union,  
which says he is one of few members of Congress who has won its 
Taxpayers' Friend Award every year since it began giving it in 1979 
to lawmakers who vote to reduce or hold the line on government 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 awards have not been announced yet, ``but I can't  
imagine that he would not continue this kind of fine performance,'' 
group spokesman Pete Sepp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberal American Civil Liberties Union, on the other hand,  
gave Sensenbrenner a zero rating this year for voting against its 
stands on legislation dealing with juvenile justice, abortion, flag 
burning and whether to support an Alabama judge who posted the Ten 
Commandments on his courtroom wall despite a higher court's ruling 
that it was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner was one of Clinton's sternest critics on the House  
Judiciary Committee. He immersed himself in the mountains of 
documents produced by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also known as the millionaire congressman who won $250,000  
from the District of Columbia lottery in December 1997. He said he 
carried the winning ticket around in his billfold for two weeks 
before remembering to have it checked.

<HEADLINE> Sampras To Help Pick Davis Captain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi will have a say  
into the next United States Davis Cup captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Levering, the first female president of the United States  
Tennis Association, has told America's top two players that they 
and others ``that certainly next year they will be consulted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Sampras nor Agassi played in a surprising Davis Cup loss  
to Italy last year, and neither is expected to play in America's 
first-round World Group competition against Britain in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably more troubled that the situation exists that it's  
hard for them to play,'' Levering said Wednesday during a 
conference call. ``I do want them to know that they are American 
players and we are extremely proud of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levering said she met with both Sampras and Agassi at their  
homes, but didn't ask either if they would play Davis Cup against 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reaching out trying to establish a relationship with  
them,'' she said. ``Part of the purpose of my trip was to do that. 
I gave them points to think about, but I didn't press them at that 
moment. They have their issues and they feel pretty strongly about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to work with them. I don't want the Davis Cup to  
create a wedge between the USTA and the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has repeatedly said he would consider playing in the  
international team competition if it was held every two years 
instead of annually. Agassi has clashed with the USTA over 
selection of sites of the competition and captain Tom Gullikson. 
</P>
<P>
	Levering, who assumed the USTA presidency on Jan. 1, said she  
plans on talking to Sampras and Agassi again, along with other 
players, including Todd Martin, before the team is selected for the 
tie against Britain. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Both Parties See Impeachment Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If there's one thing Republicans and Democrats  
have in common, it's fear. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan sense of dread has settled over the political  
community as the Senate decides President Clinton's fate in a trial 
fraught with risks for both parties, according to interviews 
Wednesday with GOP and Democratic activists across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in quicksand here and it could pull us all under,  
Democrats as well as Republicans,'' said Jeff Woodburn, chairman of 
the New Hampshire Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I think it's a risk for both parties,'' said GOP  
consultant Ed Gillespie. ``It's a pox on both of our houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican risks are the most obvious: A majority of Americans  
didn't want Clinton impeached, don't want him removed and have a 
low opinion of how GOP lawmakers have handled themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic are worried, too. They are defending a man who,  
in the opinion of eight out of 10 Americans, committed perjury. 
Polls also show that more than half of Clinton's countrymen believe 
he obstructed justice. And the yearlong Monica Lewinsky 
investigation has made moral values a bigger issue than before, one 
that voters trust to Republicans over Democrats, the president's 
backers concede. 
</P>
<P>
	With these and other points in mind, some Democrats say there is  
a slight but real risk that a long trial could turn the public 
against Clinton and his party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole process has a great deal of political  
fluidity and continues to be a double-edged instrument in our part 
of the country,'' said Joe Turnham, former chairman of the Alabama 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the White House and its backers on Capitol Hill must  
avoid the temptation to turn the impeachment process into a 
partisan dogfight. A Rose Garden pep rally Clinton held for 
Democrats hours after his impeachment, for example, ``might not 
have been appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While there may be some marginal (momentum) on the whole issue  
in favor of the Democrats, any attempt to turn around and try to 
drive the wedge deeper could make us snakebit,'' Turnham said. 
``Democrats can overplay their hand if we are seen as using the 
president's maladies and the Republican's inappropriate reaction to 
our advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though a conviction is not expected, Democrats say they can't  
rule it out. A vote against Clinton could do long-term harm to the 
party, beginning with the 2000 election when Vice President Al Gore 
is the party's most likely nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who is overly confident is a fool,'' Woodburn warned.  
</P>
<P>
	Even James Carville, one of the president's staunchest  
supporters, said, ``Who knows when public opinion could turn?'' And 
he said Democrats have lost ground on at least one issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken a hit as far as being the party of values,  
yes,'' Carville said, quickly adding that the GOP problems are much 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a leak here or there,'' he said. ``They have gashes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans agree, though few will speak for the record.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just being perceived as the anti-Clinton party,'' said  
Fort Wayne, Ind., Mayor Paul Helmke, a Republican. ``You see 
Republicans saying that people have a short memory. Well, people 
remember Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon. I think you could 
see the same here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tricky part is Republicans need to show they handled the  
trial responsibly --not just short-circuiting it -- but the longer it 
goes, the worse it looks for the party,'' Helmke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie, who hopes to help Rep. John Kasich of Ohio become  
president, said the controversy is making it impossible to convince 
Americans that Republicans want to create better schools, improve 
health care and lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every minute that is spent on TV talking about impeachment and  
every column inch talking about a Senate trail is time and space 
not devoted to issues that will be helpful to us in 2000,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So why are Republicans defying polls?  
</P>
<P>
	They're putting principle over politics, GOP operatives say, as  
well as catering to the party's anti-Clinton conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some Republicans did come to a conclusion that their greatest  
risk would be in opposing impeachment and antagonizing core 
conservative Republicans,'' Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Tate, director of the Christian Coalition, which pushed  
for the president's impeachment, argues that voters will reward 
Republicans in 2000 for doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term success of any party can't be built on the  
premise that perjury or obstruction of justice is acceptable,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Rumors Greet Lakers' Campbell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is he staying or going? Even Elden Campbell  
isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid rumors the Los Angeles Lakers will unload him, Campbell  
showed up for the first time Wednesday at voluntary workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-year veteran, who's never played anywhere but his  
native Los Angeles, would like to stay, but it may not be his 
decision. The Lakers have not announced plans for Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even really thinking about it. If it happens, it  
happens. I'm ready for whatever,'' he said after playing pickup 
basketball with 11 others at Los Angeles Southwest College. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Campbell's playing time dropped dramatically -- from  
32.7 minutes per game to 19.6 as he split time between power 
forward and backup center. He averaged 10.1 points and 5.6 
rebounds, which were dropoffs from his previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sometimes he feels as if we don't respect him as much  
as we do Shaquille (O'Neal),'' point guard Derek Fisher said. ``If 
he does end up staying here, we have to figure that out because he 
can really be an important part of our puzzle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about trading Campbell have circulated frequently in  
recent years. He's in the third year of a seven-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season was the first time in Campbell's career that his  
scoring average went down. He started 28 of 81 games. The Lakers 
had a 19-9 record with Campbell as a starter and a 42-12 mark when 
he came off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I should be a starter last year,'' he said. ``I  
didn't feel anybody took my spot from me last year, but it didn't 
happen like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said he would prefer to start, but his first choice is  
to remain in Los Angeles. ``It could be another situation that's 
better, but this is home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the Lakers have been fair to him, Campbell said, ``I  
think so. Just the last couple years I think it could have went a 
little differently, but that's behind. I'm not thinking about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two seasons, Campbell started 50 games at center  
when O'Neal was hurt. Campbell played impressively as the backup, 
averaging 18.1 points and 7.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all seen flashes of brilliance. When Shaquille's been  
out of the lineup, Elden has carried us at times,'' Fisher said. 
``That's a tough thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said he believes Campbell would flourish on another team  
where he could be the go-to big man. But Fisher doesn't believe the 
Lakers should write Campbell off yet, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that he can't play with Shaq, it's just that the  
coaching staff and his teammates have to figure out a way to get 
him to understand what it is we need him to do,'' Fisher said. ``We 
can't just say, `Ok, Shaq's going to get the ball every time and we 
want you to stand over there and cut every now and then.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher has watched game tapes the last few weeks and noticed how  
the Lakers repeatedly feed O'Neal the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's the way, in the long run, we can be very  
successful as far as winning the championship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great for Shaquille if some nights he could kind  
of take a rest and stand on the weak side and allow Elden to post 
up,'' Fisher said. ``That would lighten up his load and he wouldn't 
have to get whacked on every possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Eddie Jones, the subject of trade rumors last season,  
knows the uncertainty Campbell faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being in a dark room and not knowing who's going to  
walk through that door,'' he said. ``It's one of those things you 
can't control.''

<HEADLINE> No One Can Replace His Airness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Every few years, some new kid with a sweet shot,  
engaging personality and thousand-watt smile comes along and is 
immediately dubbed ``The next Michael Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the pretenders fall as quickly as they rise, and the void  
remains unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're right, there's not going to be another Michael  
Jordan,'' the original said Wednesday as he announced his 
retirement for a second time. ``And I wouldn't want those guys to 
try to be that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good thing, too, because they'd fail. Harold Miner. Penny  
Hardaway. Grant Hill. Jerry Stackhouse. Kobe Bryant. For one reason 
or another, they've all fallen short of being like Mike. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will never be another Michael Jordan, just like there  
will never be another Larry Bird or another Magic Johnson,'' 
Atlanta Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said. ``But there will 
be someone different and unique who will capture everyone's 
imagination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But who? The NBA's current crop of young stars doesn't exactly  
inspire the oohs and ahs Jordan did every time he took the floor. 
Hardaway's alter ego is more endearing than the real thing, who got 
his coach fired and then took almost the whole season off. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill's a nice guy, but his team didn't even make the playoffs  
last season. Bryant comes the closest, but he needs to lose the 
me-first attitude and start mixing up his game. Then there's Allen 
Iverson, who has the dazzling moves but a rap sheet to go along 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never going to be another Dr. J., and I knew that,''  
Jordan said. ``There was never going to be another Elgin Baylor, I 
knew that. So the kids of tomorrow, there's never going to be 
another Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be a Grant Hill, you can be an Anfernee Hardaway, you  
can be a Kobe Bryant, but Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan,'' he 
said. ``You might take bits and pieces of his game or his 
personality and somehow correlate them to yours, but either way, 
you have to develop into the person that you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For anyone who has forgotten, Jordan wasn't Jordan right away,  
either. When he arrived in the NBA in 1984, he was a brash, skinny 
kid from North Carolina who still had hair. He didn't have a 
complete game, and some players called him a ball hog. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan had something that set him apart -- a competitive fire  
that drove him to become the greatest player and refused to let him 
lose. He developed a deadly jump shot, and learned to make the most 
of his teammates' talents. Eventually, his mental ability surpassed 
his physical skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of this came six NBA championships, 10 scoring titles and  
five MVP awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got a lot of people who were not fans watching the game,''  
said Dolph Schayes, voted one of the NBA's 50 greatest players. 
``There's nobody on the horizon to take his place, not Grant Hill 
and not Kobe Bryant. He's the player of the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's magic was that he transcended basketball. Sure, he was  
unparalleled on the court with his high-flying dunks, no-look 
passes and seemingly impossible shots that turned sport into art. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his off-the-court persona that earned him millions  
and made the NBA the hippest sports league in the country. It 
didn't matter that he was worth more than many small countries or 
that his intense drive could turn him into a curmudgeon. Fans 
called him by his first name like he was their best friend, golfing 
buddy or next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	One smile, and he could sell anything, win over anyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever tried to invent Michael Jordan,'' said his agent,  
David Falk. ``We didn't try to create something in 1984, it just 
evolved. When you try to create that, the public sees through it 
and they think it's insincere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean people aren't itching to try and fill Jordan's  
shoes. And now that he's gone, the scramble is really going to be 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be fun to see another guy try to step up and be  
compared to him and to see if they can last,'' Cleveland Cavaliers 
forward Shawn Kemp said. ``Because the two guys they have said were 
going to be Michael Jordan -- Kobe and Harold Miner -- I think they 
kind of believed it, and it wears you down a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan knows better than anyone that somewhere, sometime, a  
player will come along who'll be worthy of being called his 
successor. It happened after Bill Russell. It happened after 
Baylor. It happened after Johnson and Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, he has some advice for the players he leaves behind.  
</P>
<P>
	``The love of the game is what you do on the basketball court,''  
he said. ``No matter what happens in the business of basketball, if 
you didn't get paid a dime, you still would play the game of 
basketball somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that love has to be illustrated in the way that you play  
the game and the way that you carry yourself on and off the 
court.''

<HEADLINE> Mich. Attorney General Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Frank J. Kelley has been Michigan's  
attorney general through five governors and seven presidents. He 
has shared barbs with John Kennedy, cigars with Walter Mondale and 
advice with Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't the hobnobbing with the political elite that  
shaped Kelley. He gives the credit for that to one man: his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public service was always what my father preached at the  
dinner table,'' Kelley said. ``To be a success was to do something 
for your fellow man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 37 years, Kelley followed that mantra. He served longer than  
any other attorney general in the nation's history. He has gone 
after everyone from Big Tobacco to crooked car dealers, from the 
U.S. government to the corner supermarket. He has sued Microsoft 
and searched for the missing Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 31, his 74th birthday, Kelley retired from public  
service. Five days later, he announced that he was forming a new 
law firm, a block from the Capitol in downtown Lansing. He hopes to 
try some civil cases himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``My late father, an observer of political history, told me that  
a good public man or woman leaves before they have to go, while 
they're still wanted,'' Kelley said when he announced his 
retirement in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley didn't always treasure the words of his father. Frank E.  
Kelley, a Detroit saloonkeeper who ran Wayne County's Democratic 
Party from his bar, pressured his oldest son to take up politics. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, the younger Kelley rebelled, leaving Detroit to set up  
his own law practice in the northern Michigan town of Alpena. He 
wanted to make his own name and get the trial experience he craved. 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, his father died. After the funeral, Kelley  
leaarned his father's last words: ``Tell Frank I think it's a good 
idea that he goes to Alpena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had the opportunity to show my dad what I had done,''  
Kelley said. Even as Kelley's books and papers were being packed 
away, his father's photo still gleamed in the corner of the 
attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1961, Kelley was one of five people summoned by  
Democratic Gov. John B. Swainson to interview for the attorney 
general post. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said he wasn't surprised to be considered, joking that he  
was a ``rustic slicker'' who had support in both northern Michigan 
and Detroit. But Kelley said he was surprised when Swainson offered 
him the job. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking office, Kelley pursued an agenda heavy on civil  
rights and consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all young, all Democrats. The world was our oyster,''  
he said. ``I wanted to be an activist, not just respond to 
lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his liberal bent, Kelley established a reputation for  
getting along with both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said he learned to overlook politics in Alpena, where he  
was a city attorney in a community full of Republicans. It was a 
valuable lesson: For 28 of Kelley's 37 years as attorney general, 
Michigan's governors have been Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank Kelley made it very clear that he was my lawyer and he  
would take our point of view,'' Republican Gov. John Engler said 
recently. ``He was an example to those of us who happen to still 
think that public service is a pretty noble thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Kelley, the fight was never about politics, but about  
standing up for things because they were right. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Kelley lost a case before the U.S. Supreme Court,  
which ruled that the federal government doesn't need to collect 
nuclear waste from Michigan until it builds a place to deposit the 
waste. Kelley had argued that the government was years overdue in 
collecting the waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel good about it,'' Kelley said. ``You fight the  
good fight, even though you don't always win. Even when you know 
you can't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley worries about some of the fights he has lost. He predicts  
that gambling will increase crime in the state. He growls about his 
lack of success in eliminating billboards, a cause he has 
championed since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	He also warns that state government will be in the hands of  
``lobbyists and bureaucrats'' as term limits take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had heart surgery, and I chose Beaumont Hospital (in  
Royal Oak) because those were the most experienced doctors I could 
find. Imagine if they had term limits for doctors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley admits he never expected to last so long. ``AG,'' he  
jokes, is generally short for ``aspiring governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to leave his post only once, an unsuccessful 1972 bid  
for U.S. Senate. The campaign was so hurtful to Kelley and his 
family that he decided not to run again for any office besides 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's loss was a gain for attorneys general. Last year,  
the National Association of Attorneys General changed the name of 
its highest award from the Wyman Award to the Wyman-Kelley Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley pats the award proudly as it sits on his desk. But ask  
him how he would best like to be remembered and he doesn't even 
pause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope people will say, Frank J. Kelley was his father's  
son.''

<HEADLINE> Mail-Order Plants Cut Gardening Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- If you don't have time to fuss with  
seeds, you might try ordering ready-to-go transplants by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Established plant mail outlets such as Piedmont in Georgia offer  
a greater variety of vegetable transplants than you're likely to 
get at many nurseries. And venerable seedhouses, like Burpee, are 
also pushing the business of selling transplants of vegetables as 
well as annual flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ornamental perennial plants, of course, have been available by  
mail for a long time from many outlets. One big reason for the mail 
trend in annuals is that two-career households are pressed for 
weekend leisure time. 
</P>
<P>
	Piedmont Plant Company (P.O. Box 424, Albany, Ga. 31702,  
telephone 800-541-5185) offers 19 different vegetables: tomato, 
pepper, tomatillo, cucumber, sweet potato, eggplant, broccoli, 
cabbage, kohlrabi, onion, leeks, lettuce, radicchio, Swiss chard, 
kale, collards, mustard, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower. You can 
also get basil, Alpine strawberry and chives. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 12 tomato varieties, most of them highly prized like  
Brandywine, Celebrity and Better Boy, the last described as 
probably the best-known garden tomato in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	What I like about the Piedmont catalog is that it mentions a  
plant's problems, too. For instance, it says Brandywine ``is prone 
to cracking and off-shapes and is not disease-resistant, but its 
flavor is unforgettable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plants are bundled together and shipped bare-root, except  
for very tender plants. These are wrapped in brown craft paper with 
peat moss around the roots. 
</P>
<P>
	The company claims that bare-root, field-grown plants may look  
wilted or starting to turn yellowish on arrival, but will usually 
recover within a week or so and then perform well in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
	You should plant them right away, but they'll hold out for a  
week if you keep the roots moist and the stems and leaves dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Onions and leeks are packed in bundles containing about 100  
plants. Most of the Piedmont plants come in bundles of 12 plants or 
50 plants. Tomatoes cost $8.95 for a bundle of 12 and $14.95 for a 
bundle of 50. The same for peppers. 
</P>
<P>
	An attractive vegetable offered by Piedmont is a dwarf broccoli  
called ``Small Miracle'' designed for gardeners who don't have the 
space needed to grow regular sized plants. This pee-wee grows a 
foot high and eight inches wide and is touted for high yields. They 
cost $7.95 for a bundle of 12 and $4.95 each for two or more 
bundles. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 1999 catalogs go out to gardeners nationwide, Burpee is  
making a pitch for transplants with the slogan, ``Leave the growing 
to us.'' This means, of course, just to the transplant level. 
Bringing the plant to maturity is up to you. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its wide assortment of seeds, Burpee (300 Park Avenue,  
Warminster, Pa., 18991-0001, telephone 800-888-1447) now offers 175 
varieties of flowers and vegetables to be shipped as transplants. 
They're advertised as timed to arrive for the weekend you want to 
plant them. They come in containers, not bare-root. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the range of ornamentals, from abutilon to zinnia,  
is wide. More interesting is the number of vegetables being 
offered. There are 20 varieties of tomatoes, including the 
great-tasting heirloom, Brandywine; nine varieties of hot pepper 
plants; nine of sweet pepper plants; eight kinds of eggplants; one 
each of lettuce, okra and tomatillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices range around $14.95 for six plants. A sampler box of  
24 plants -- three each of eight varieties of different vegetables -- 
costs $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on your climate zone, you are given deadline dates for  
ordering, with the promise you'll receive the shipment two months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	What's the difference, you might wonder, between ordering by  
mail and going yourself to a nursery to buy plants and thus 
eliminating shipping costs? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, one obvious difference, is that by mail you're promised  
fresher plants than those that may have been standing around for a 
couple of weeks at a nursery waiting for a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of us, of course, especially retirees with more time for  
the garden, are not abandoning growing from seed. The big plus with 
seeds is that you have a vastly larger number of varieties to pick 
from. For example, my favorite pepper is a mild chile called 
``Anaheim'' I've found only in seed catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to give you an idea of the reservoir of available seeds,  
184 non-hybrid varieties of hot peppers are listed in the latest 
Garden Inventory published by the Seed Savers organization in 
Decorah, Iowa. Other available vegetable seeds also run from scores 
to the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with seed also makes you feel you're deeper into  
gardening.

<HEADLINE> Nike Plans To Market Jordan As Icon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- The banner at Nike headquarters read:  
``Thanks Mike. Now don't be late for work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retired NBA superstar Michael Jordan was officially welcomed to  
his other job as CEO by the company that has sold $2.6 billion in 
basketball shoes with his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike named Michael Jordan chief executive officer of its Brand  
Jordan division more than a year ago in preparation for the day 
when the Chicago Bulls guard would hang up his own basketball shoes 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
	When that day arrived Wednesday, Nike chairman and founder Phil  
Knight, who hired Jordan to endorse the swoosh as an NBA rookie 
nearly 15 years ago, found a lump in his throat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really is it,'' Knight said. ``This great artistry you're  
not going to be able to see any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He denied reports that he visited Jordan last weekend in an  
attempt to talk him out of retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, I know it wouldn't do any good if I did try,''  
Knight said. ``The day was coming. If it wasn't going to be this 
year it was going to be next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trick now is to bank on the charisma Jordan built up as  
perhaps the most recognizable athlete on the planet to push his 
line of shoes and clothing with his slam-dunking silhouette logo 
rather than the swoosh. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight is certain the Jordan name will fly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' Knight said. ``It's just gone beyond a level  
than anybody could have foreseen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a level of popularity Nike hopes to spread across all its  
products as the world's largest athletic shoe company emerges from 
a year of declining profits, layoffs and budget cuts set off by the 
Asian recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything has gone horrible for them in the past year,'' said  
analyst Jennifer Black of Black &AMP; Co. in Portland. ``There's been 
nothing but negative on the horizon for Nike for such a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight sees the retirement as the beginning of Jordan the  
legend, bigger than the game, even bigger than Babe Ruth or 
Muhammad Ali, who didn't have the worldwide reach provided by 
technology such as personal satellite dishes or 24-hour sports on 
cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you're going to see anything like this for quite  
a while,'' Knight said. ``This is something very, very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Jordan has been compared to such American exports as  
Coca-Cola and Mickey Mouse, and is a huge star in places where 
basketball is barely even followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion is that Jordan is obviously one of the few athletes  
who transcends sport,'' said Josie Esquivel, an analyst with Morgan 
Stanley in New York. ``He has this appeal that makes him a great 
ambassador for sports of any kind. The corporate executives 
certainly believe that mantra, but I think you have a large number 
of people who believe that too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said Jordan will be personally involved in product  
development as CEO for a line featuring a single style of shoe that 
sold $130 million in the first year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was huge when it first arrived,'' said John Horan,  
publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, an athletic shoe industry 
newsletter in Glen Mills, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody had seen anything like it. It was a big deal then, and  
it's a big deal now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, sales reached $350 million, almost 4 percent of the  
$9.2 billion in revenue for Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you took the Jordan brand out of Nike, it would still be  
the No. 2 basketball company in the world next to Nike,'' said 
Vizhier Mooney, spokeswoman for Nike's basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Horan said the timing actually may have been for the best,  
not only for Nike, Jordan and Knight, but for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good part is that Air Jordan had gotten a little long in  
the tooth,'' he said. ``Dynasties, after a while, can be boring. It 
was kind of time from the NBA standpoint for some new blood 
there.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Johnson To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson has unexpectedly decided to resign  
Thursday as coach of the Miami Dolphins, his father said Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins were eliminated from the NFL playoffs 38-3 at  
Denver last weekend, spoiling a bid to play at home in the Super 
Bowl on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy told me he was ready to retire and wanted to start  
enjoying himself,'' C.W. Johnson said from his home in Port Arthur, 
Texas. ``He said the season wore on him. I told him I was glad and 
that was the best news I had heard in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Johnson said his son told him ``this is it for him in  
coaching. He said he was going down to his place in the Florida 
Keys and work on his house down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Johnson's third season with Miami ended Saturday with the  
dismal defeat, he talked optimistically about next season, but he 
hasn't met with the media since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent death of Johnson's mother may have been a factor in  
his decision. He also complained frequently during the past season 
about how media scrutiny and criticism were more intense than when 
he coached the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, in California to complete the  
sale of his Florida Marlins baseball team, rushed back to Miami 
Wednesday night, apparently to meet with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's resignation was first reported by Fox Sports News.  
Dolphins media relations coordinator Neal Gulkis said no news 
conference had been scheduled as of late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anything about it,'' Gulkis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox reported that Johnson would meet with his coaches at 9 a.m.  
Thursday and then with quarterback Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who led the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowl  
championships, was hired by the Dolphins in January 1996 and said 
he would have the team in the NFL title game in three years. But he 
won only one playoff game with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had a 27-21 record in three seasons with Miami and was  
1-2 in two playoff appearances. His resignation means 10 of the 31 
teams, including expansion Cleveland, have had to look for a new 
coach since the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's team made steady progress after he replaced Don Shula.  
The Dolphins went 8-8 in his first season, 9-7 in 1997 and 10-6 
this season. They made the playoffs in 1997 and earned their first 
playoff victory in four years this season, beating the Buffalo 
Bills 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said recently that he believes Miami needs only a couple  
of offensive playmakers to join the NFL's elite. Following the 
Denver game, he said he didn't consider the defeat devastating, but 
said Miami simply must earn a higher seed in next season's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our players that you need to win enough games during  
the season to get a bye, get people healthy and get ready for an 
opponent,'' Johnson said. ``We didn't win enough games during the 
season to get that advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of late-season injuries and playing at Denver were too  
much for the Dolphins to overcome. The game was the last in a 
series of poor road performances by Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson enjoyed his greatest pro success with Dallas, winning  
the 1992 and 1993 Super Bowls while compiling a 51-38 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also succeeded in college, winning a national  
championship in 1987 at Miami. He had a 52-9 record in five 
seasons. Before that, he had a 29-25 record in five seasons at 
Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson worked for Fox in 1994-95 during a hiatus from coaching.  
C.W. Johnson said his son said: ``Well, I guess I never got it out 
of my system, but I've got it out of my system now. I think this is 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hints at Speech Content </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signaled Wednesday he will  
be silent about his Senate impeachment trial and its threat to his 
presidency when he stands before Congress next week in a nationally 
broadcast State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the American people have heard about that quite  
extensively over the last year,'' Clinton said. ``My instinct is 
that I should do their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, press secretary Joe Lockhart said there were ``no plans  
that I know of'' for Clinton to address the controversy Tuesday 
night in his speech from the House chamber where he was impeached 
Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a year ago on Jan. 21 that Clinton was engulfed in  
controversy from charges he engaged in a sexual relationship with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Six days later, he 
delivered his State of the Union speech and made no mention of the 
scandal that later blossomed into the impeachment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides view Clinton's annual report to the nation as  
an ideal opportunity to project an image of leadership and concern 
for the nation's business, despite his own problems. ``The 
important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking about 
that (the impeachment trial) as possible and as much time working 
on the issues we're here to discuss as possible,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke at the opening of a Cabinet Room discussion with  
invited labor leaders about Tuesday's speech and his fiscal 2000 
budget proposal. The labor leaders pressed him to address the needs 
of working Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which included the presidents of the AFL-CIO, the  
United Steelworkers of America, the Communications Workers of 
America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees, stressed that trade policy should protect workers' 
rights. The labor leaders urged that the government should continue 
investing in worker retraining and protect the integrity of the 
Social Security system and asked for support for the rights of 
workers to organize. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a chance to put our concerns on the table, and we got,  
I thought, a very good hearing,'' said one participant, who asked 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, told Clinton not to raise taxes to  
finance new initiatives. They said proposals Clinton already 
announced to increase military readiness, improve food safety, 
expand Medicare and for other initiatives would require $28.8 
billion in new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last two years, your budget contained dozens of tax  
hikes that found no support from the American people, let alone 
Democrats and Republicans in Congress,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a letter to 
the president. ``To achieve bipartisan results, I urge you not to 
repeat these tax-hiking mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, summoned Cabinet  
secretaries for a briefing on the State of the Union and plans for 
them to fan out across the nation after the address to promote the 
president's initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have urged Clinton to postpone  
Tuesday's address, or to submit it in writing, because the Senate 
trial will be under way at the time. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, 
D-Conn., urged delay ``because of the awkwardness of it. But 
obviously that's his choice.''

<HEADLINE> Ford To Restore Clippers Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chris Ford realizes what he's up against as  
coach of the Los Angeles Clippers, perennially one of the NBA's 
worst teams. Nevertheless, he's excited about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the hand I've been dealt,'' Ford said Wednesday after  
being introduced as the 19th coach in Clippers history and the 
seventh in the 1990s. ``Why worry about anything else? I think it's 
a great opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been ridden pretty hard. Every coach would like to  
think they can come into a situation and make it better. There's 
nothing better than knocking off the king of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you win only 17 games, there's a lot of room for  
improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fired as coach of the Milwaukee Bucks last August, Ford succeeds  
Bill Fitch, who was dismissed nearly nine months ago after guiding 
the Clippers to a 17-65 record, third-worst in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers were 99-229 in four seasons under Fitch; have made  
the playoffs just three times since 1976; and have had only one 
winning season since 1979. That being the case, it's a good thing 
Ford seems to relish the underdog role. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is this is a new day, a new beginning for us,''  
Ford said. ``The players have a clean slate with me. If they're 
ready to work, there's no problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to the sunshine here and trying to build  
this team back to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who turned 50 Monday, signed a three-year contract with  
the Clippers worth nearly $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had conversations with a lot of people in this league  
about Chris Ford,'' Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor said. 
``I've heard nothing but positive reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an ex-player, I think he's very good at relating to the  
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Brewer, an assistant under Fitch for the last four seasons,  
and Jim Todd, an assistant under Ford in Milwaukee the last two 
years, will be assistants under Ford with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is to try to blend them (players) to respect each  
other, be willing to sacrifice for each other, be willing to make 
the commitment to do what's necessary to win,'' Ford said. ``You 
must pay the price. You've got to go out there and work hard. 
That's what our ethic is going to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a guy who loves the game. I think I know how it should be  
played. I think I know what it takes to win. I think I'm a guy who 
can help players become better players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford coached the Boston Celtics from 1990-95 and the Bucks from  
1996-98. He was fired with one year remaining on his contract after 
Milwaukee went 36-46 and failed to make the playoffs for the second 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks were 33-49 in Ford's first year. In seven years as an  
NBA coach, Ford's teams have a 291-283 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock, yes,'' Ford said of his being fired. ``It's  
life in the NBA. I've been fortunate enough to be part of this for 
25 years. I love the NBA, I love the competition, I do not like to 
lose. I was very fortunate this opportunity opened up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford played six seasons with Detroit and four with Boston and  
was an assistant with the Celtics for seven years before becoming 
the team's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember that he's a hard worker, he likes to win, he's a  
good coach,'' said reserve center Stojko Vrankovic, who played for 
Ford in Boston from 1990-92. ``We have a lot of young guys. I think 
we can be a lot better than last year.''

	Casey Martin would love to win enough on the Nike Tour this year

followed him just about everywhere he went last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be able to enjoy this year without so much  
controversy,'' Martin said Wednesday from the Nike Lakeland 
Classic, which starts today at the Grasslands Golf and Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	It all started a year ago this week when Martin, who has a rare  
circulatory problem in his right leg that makes it difficult for 
him to walk, was granted use of a cart pending the outcome of his 
federal lawsuit against the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin tied the tournament scoring record with a 19-under 269 to  
win the Lakeland Classic by one stroke. A month later, a judge in 
Oregon ruled in his favor, and Martin became one of the biggest 
stories in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life was changed incredibly from a year ago, due in large  
part to winning the court case,'' he said. ``Those first couple of 
months ... I can't explain it any other way than my life was 
bizarre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't win again on the Nike Tour, but he qualified for the  
U.S. Open in a playoff, then tied for 23rd at The Olympic Club, 
coming within two strokes of an automatic invitation to the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning this event and the U.S. Open were probably my two  
highlights,'' Martin said. ``At those points in my life, I couldn't 
believe what had transpired. It was a thrill and a blessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's 1999 season did not get off to an auspicious start. He  
finished at 291 last week in the Nike South Florida Classic, 16 
strokes off the lead. He also said it was a ``bad week'' for his 
leg, meaning a lot of swelling after his round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I wake and up and know it's going to be a bad day,''  
he said. ``It's just kind of there and you deal with it. It feels 
good this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also feels another difference -- not nearly as many reporters  
following his every move. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was overwhelmed by the attention of becoming the first  
player to use a cart in the U.S. Open and on the PGA Tour -- he 
missed the cut at the Greater Hartford Open. Now, he is more 
interested in talking about his game than his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's subsided now,'' he said. ``Things have gotten  
back to status quo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin says the amount of attention drained him emotionally,  
which might explain why he sank lower and lower on the Nike money 
list as the year went on. Martin had a good chance to get his PGA 
Tour card by finishing in the top 15, but took time off in the 
summer and played poorly in the Nike Tour Championship. He wound up 
29th on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laid an egg,'' he said. ``I wanted it so bad and had worked  
so hard, to play poorly there was a very big disappointment. But 
I've learned to take the good with the bad. I want to make it to 
the tour. I want to get in the top 15. I don't put that up on my 
wall and look at it every day. I just want to focus on my golf game 
and try to improve.''

<HEADLINE> Both Parties See Impeachment Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If there's one thing Republicans and Democrats  
have in common, it's fear. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan sense of dread has settled over the political  
community as the Senate decides President Clinton's fate in a trial 
fraught with risks for both parties, according to interviews 
Wednesday with GOP and Democratic activists across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in quicksand here and it could pull us all under,  
Democrats as well as Republicans,'' said Jeff Woodburn, chairman of 
the New Hampshire Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I think it's a risk for both parties,'' said GOP  
consultant Ed Gillespie. ``It's a pox on both of our houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican risks are the most obvious: A majority of Americans  
didn't want Clinton impeached, don't want him removed and have a 
low opinion of how GOP lawmakers have handled themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic are worried, too. They are defending a man who,  
in the opinion of eight out of 10 Americans, committed perjury. 
Polls also show that more than half of Clinton's countrymen believe 
he obstructed justice. And the yearlong Monica Lewinsky 
investigation has made moral values a bigger issue than before, one 
that voters trust to Republicans over Democrats, the president's 
backers concede. 
</P>
<P>
	With these and other points in mind, some Democrats say there is  
a slight but real risk that a long trial could turn the public 
against Clinton and his party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole process has a great deal of political  
fluidity and continues to be a double-edged instrument in our part 
of the country,'' said Joe Turnham, former chairman of the Alabama 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the White House and its backers on Capitol Hill must  
avoid the temptation to turn the impeachment process into a 
partisan dogfight. A Rose Garden pep rally Clinton held for 
Democrats hours after his impeachment, for example, ``might not 
have been appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While there may be some marginal (momentum) on the whole issue  
in favor of the Democrats, any attempt to turn around and try to 
drive the wedge deeper could make us snakebit,'' Turnham said. 
``Democrats can overplay their hand if we are seen as using the 
president's maladies and the Republican's inappropriate reaction to 
our advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though a conviction is not expected, Democrats say they can't  
rule it out. A vote against Clinton could do long-term harm to the 
party, beginning with the 2000 election when Vice President Al Gore 
is the party's most likely nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who is overly confident is a fool,'' Woodburn warned.  
</P>
<P>
	Even James Carville, one of the president's staunchest  
supporters, said, ``Who knows when public opinion could turn?'' And 
he said Democrats have lost ground on at least one issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken a hit as far as being the party of values,  
yes,'' Carville said, quickly adding that the GOP problems are much 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a leak here or there,'' he said. ``They have gashes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans agree, though few will speak for the record.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just being perceived as the anti-Clinton party,'' said  
Fort Wayne, Ind., Mayor Paul Helmke, a Republican. ``You see 
Republicans saying that people have a short memory. Well, people 
remember Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon. I think you could 
see the same here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tricky part is Republicans need to show they handled the  
trial responsibly --not just short-circuiting it -- but the longer it 
goes, the worse it looks for the party,'' Helmke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie, who hopes to help Rep. John Kasich of Ohio become  
president, said the controversy is making it impossible to convince 
Americans that Republicans want to create better schools, improve 
health care and lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every minute that is spent on TV talking about impeachment and  
every column inch talking about a Senate trail is time and space 
not devoted to issues that will be helpful to us in 2000,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So why are Republicans defying polls?  
</P>
<P>
	They're putting principle over politics, GOP operatives say, as  
well as catering to the party's anti-Clinton conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some Republicans did come to a conclusion that their greatest  
risk would be in opposing impeachment and antagonizing core 
conservative Republicans,'' Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Tate, director of the Christian Coalition, which pushed  
for the president's impeachment, argues that voters will reward 
Republicans in 2000 for doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term success of any party can't be built on the  
premise that perjury or obstruction of justice is acceptable,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Rights Group Protests Pork Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Capitol police rounded up 12 members of an  
animal-rights group Wednesday after they set bales of hay afire on 
the Capitol steps to protest government plans to help the pork 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pork industry is a violent and bloody industry. It should  
be outlawed, not subsidized,'' said Michael McGraw, a New 
York-based spokesman for PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol Police spokesman Dan Nichols said two of the 12 were  
arrested after the incident on the lower west terrace and charged 
with igniting an incendiary charge on the Capitol grounds, arson 
and destruction of property, all felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols said nobody was hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	After District of Columbia firefighters put out the flames, they  
shoveled up the damp hay as tourists milled about on the Capitol's 
west steps. The protest area was blocked off with yellow police 
tape, and the protesters, including a man in a 6-foot-tall pig 
costume, sat inside the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling through Iowa last week, Vice President Al Gore said  
the government would give $50 million in direct payments to pork 
producers struggling because of record low prices. An additional 
$80 million will be used to buy diseased pigs to help ease the 
industry's oversupply problem. 
</P>
<P>
	PETA considers that ``taxpayer-funded corporate welfare'' and  
wants Congress to slash spending on the industry, McGraw said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had a permit to bring the hay to the Capitol grounds  
for the protest but not for setting it on fire.

	Lewinsky Rebuffs House Prosecutors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of opening arguments in President  
Clinton's trial, House prosecutors said Monica Lewinsky recently 
rejected their request for a pretrial interview. Judiciary 
Committee Republicans had sought permission earlier in the week to 
talk with the former White House intern, but her attorneys 
``declined to make her available,'' said a committee spokesman. The 
House does not yet have permission from the Senate to call 
witnesses. Meanwhile, Clinton's legal team today turned in a formal 
trial brief arguing that neither ``fact or law'' warranted his 
removal from office. New polls suggest a majority of Americans 
agree. Almost two-thirds, according to surveys by Gallup and ABC 
News, want senators to vote against removing Clinton. 

</P>
<P>
	GOP Focuses on 'Other Work'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the immense distraction of a Senate  
impeachment trial, Republicans pledged today to push a legislative 
agenda forward and not to let President Clinton's impeachment 
paralyze Congress. Republican senators met to shape priority bills 
on such issues as improving education and cutting taxes. Senate 
Republicans insist this dual track of regular business followed by 
impeachment trial won't shortchange either one. 

</P>
<P>
	20 'Empowerment Zones' Selected  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration designated 20 poor  
communities as ``empowerment zones,'' which makes the areas 
eligible for special federal help. The communities, 15 urban and 
five rural, will share at least $55 million in federal grants and 
$2.2 billion in tax-exempt bonds to help shrink unemployment and 
aid development in communities that are struggling financially, 
Vice President Al Gore said. The communities were chosen from more 
than 270 applicants based on the quality of revitalization plans 
and private and public commitments to implement the plans. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Planes Attack Iraqi Defenses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three straight days of confrontations in Iraqi  
``no-fly'' zones are raising speculation that President Clinton 
might order a new bombing campaign to silence Iraq's defenses. 
American warplanes again attacked air defense sites in northern 
Iraq after being targeted by at least one surface-to-air missile. 
``There's a credible and robust threat of force in the region if we 
determine that that needs to be used,'' White House press secretary 
Joe Lockhart said.

	USAF Jet Crashes in Germany  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A U.S. military refueling plane  
crashed and burst into flames tonight near the Dutch border, 
killing all four crew members, a U.S. military official said. The 
KC-135 plane assigned to a NATO base near the northwestern German 
town of Geilenkirchen was making its final landing approach when it 
crashed about two miles from the base. It took more than 100 Dutch 
and German firefighters about three hours to extinguish the burning 
plane.

	Ford Mum on Possible Volvo Purchase

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s board of directors meets  
tomorrow amid growing speculation that the world's No. 2 automaker 
is poised to acquire the automotive operations of Sweden's Volvo 
AB. Ford President Jac Nasser declined to say whether Ford was 
negotiating with Volvo. But he said Ford was open to tapping its 
more than $20 billion cash reserve to expand the company's global 
reach. Fiat of Italy and Germany's Volkswagen AG also have been 
named as possible suitors of Volvo.

session. On Wednesday in New York, stocks partly recovered from a 
fierce selloff sparked by the devaluation of Brazil's currency. The

125.12 at 9,349.26.

today that an investigative panel was prepared to look into 
allegations by an Australian official that he was approached for 
bribes during Sydney's successful bid for the 2000 games. The 
official, who was on Sydney's bid committee, claimed that one IOC 
member and an intermediary sought cash in exchange for votes. 
Meanwhile, Rogge announced that IOC has ruled out sanctions against 
Salt Lake City officials in the scandal affecting the host city of 
the 2002 games.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Down; Dow Off 125.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower going into the close but above  
their worst levels of the day, after Brazil's devaluation of its 
currency ignited a sharp but brief sell-off in morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 125.12 at 9,349.56.  
It had been as low as 9,213.10, down 261.58, in the first hour of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume was heavy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composites both opened  
lower and sank in early trading, moved up into positive territory 
this afternoon, but sank back near the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes recovered along with Internet-related stocks,  
which continued to show some resiliency. Yahoo!, Amazon.com and 
America Online all pared their losses. In Nasdaq trading, Intel and 
Microsoft were higher on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 2.72 to 1,236.79. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 3.43 to 2,317.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,025 up, 2,114 down and 434 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 929.94 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
789.45 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 3.87 to 590.72, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.26 to 699.39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.51 to 424.85.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks tumbled at the open after the head of the Brazilian  
central bank, Gustavo Franco, resigned. His replacement, Francisco 
Lopes, immediately allowed the Brazilian currency, the real, to 
fall 8 percent against world currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is important to U.S. markets because it is a huge  
importer of U.S. goods, and because a bad stumble in its economy 
could send emerging markets tumbling throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil is a big part of the Latin American economy, and the  
economy in Latin America is pretty important to companies in the 
United States,'' said Bill Meehan, market strategist at Canter 
Fitzgerald in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's stock market opened in a free fall, with the Bovespa  
index dropping 10 percent, triggering a circuit breaker that halted 
trading temporarily. The index was down 3.9 percent in late 
afternoon. In Mexico, the IPC index was down 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. market was technically poised to fall, after the Dow  
gained a scintillating 5 percent in the first week of trading this 
year, said Greg Nie, a technical analyst at Everen Securities in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a market that's vulnerable to news. The kind of  
action that we've seen collectively late last week and early this 
week, continues to protray a market where the bulls must come after 
it with outstanding, broad-based, big-time momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's new sent worldwide stock markets falling. The jitters  
spread to markets throughout Europe and Latin America. London's 
main stock index closed down 3 percent, while Paris fell 3.3 
percent and Frankfurt slid 4.1 percent. o

<HEADLINE> Brister Finds Success in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It was one of those disastrous seasons that can  
kill a career, and nearly did. 
</P>
<P>
	But after enduring a purgatorial year with the New York Jets in  
1995, and then being out of football the following year, Bubby 
Brister has found peace and success in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing sparingly for the Broncos in 1997, Brister emerged  
as a competent backup to John Elway when the latter suffered 
hamstring, back and rib injuries this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, 36, started four games this season -- all victories. In  
another, he engineered a 34-17 comeback victory over Oakland in 
relief of Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been here, it's like I've died and gone to football  
heaven,'' Brister said Wednesday as he and the Broncos prepared for 
Sunday's AFC championship game against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, who played seven years in Pittsburgh and two in  
Philadelphia, signed a free-agent contract with the Jets prior to 
the 1995 season -- a season he finds unforgettable, but for all the 
wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``As bad as it gets,'' he said in describing the 3-13 campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	He started four games in the middle of the season with modest  
results, sharing quarterback duties with Boomer Esiason and Glenn 
Foley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty frustrating at the time, thinking free agency  
was coming into play and (coach Rich) Kotite was moving to New York 
and I knew the system and we had the money to get players, and then 
we didn't,'' Brister said. ``It's frustrating when you're back 
there holding the ball and you know you really don't have the 
players to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt sorry for Esiason that year, he got killed. And Foley  
got killed. I was just happy I could run a little bit or I probably 
would have gotten killed, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a lot of discipline on the team. Things got out  
of hand there for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets went 1-3 in the four games Brister started, and in his  
last start, chaos erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Jets trailing 3-0, Brister was benched in favor of  
Foley, who then injured a shoulder. Kotite told Brister to re-enter 
the game, but he declined. Brister said Esiason also declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Kotite, `You benched me, I'm in the back of the  
line,''' Brister said. ``If he's stupid enough to bench me when 
it's 3-0, I'm stupid enough to say I'm not going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident, and the season, could have been a career-killer,  
and, indeed, Brister found no demand for his services in 1996. 
Brister spent the year at home, even as the Jets limped to a 1-15 
record and surely could have used him. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Bill Parcells in 1997, and the Jets' revival began.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got some friends on that team like Mo Lewis and Marvin  
Jones,'' Brister said, ``and I'm happy to see that they've rebuilt 
their program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister rebuilt his own career, thanks to a recommendation to  
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan from linebacker Bill Romanowski, who 
had played with the quarterback in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought my career might be over,'' he said. ``When you're  
out of the game like I was, I think you appreciate it more. I felt 
like I could still run and throw and could help somebody win. I 
wanted to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to play anywhere but here, really. I talked to a  
couple of teams. I talked to the Bears, and thank God that didn't 
work out. But I knew Romanowski and I knew John, and when I came 
here to work out, Kube (offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak) seemed 
like a really great guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a feeling they had a chance to win a Super Bowl. I was  
really hoping I'd get to land here, and it worked out.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Takes Final Bow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan headed to midcourt at the United  
Center, the building where he won championships, stirred fans and 
created unforgettable memories. 
</P>
<P>
	His shaven head gleamed, his trademark smile flashed. Cameras,  
even more than usual, recorded his every move. Every eye was upon 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	This time he wasn't on his way to the other end for a soaring  
dunk -- even though the orange baskets looked inviting as they hung 
from the standards -- or a last-second jumper to bring the Chicago 
Bulls another victory, another title. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on his way to a new life: retirement No. 2.  
</P>
<P>
	His wife joined him on the stage Wednesday, as did Bulls owner  
Jerry Reinsdorf and NBA commissioner David Stern. This was Jordan's 
day to reflect, to watch a spotlight shine on his retired No. 23, 
seconds after it was displayed for the second time in a little more 
than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The banner, sandwiched between Jerry Sloan's No. 4 and Bob  
Love's No. 10, will have to be updated as will the bronze statue 
outside the United Center showing Jordan rising above a helpless 
defender. The years on both -- 1984-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed impeccably as always, a bandage on his injured finger  
from a cigar cutting accident, a large ring dangling from his left 
ear, the world's greatest basketball player said he was at peace 
with retirement this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He earned a retirement,'' said longtime Bulls assistant Tex  
Winter, who joined the Bulls in Jordan's second season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been with Michael as a coach longer than anyone he's had,  
including Dean Smith. I don't know what influence I had, certainly 
not as much as Dean had apparently. But there have been so many 
good memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former and current teammates were on hand, as were about 500  
media members. Many sat on the floor on a court blocked off by a 
red curtain bearing a red Bulls insignia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty years from now, as time goes on, his legend will grow  
because of the way he did it,'' said John Paxson, known for his 
game-winning 3-pointer against Phoenix that brought the Bulls their 
third title in 1993, just months before Jordan's first retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael came to work every day and did his job better than  
everybody else,'' Paxson added. ``But he never settled for just 
being the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toni Kukoc, emotionally upset when Jordan retired the first time  
because he didn't think he'd have a chance to play with him, was 
there Wednesday. So were Randy Brown, Bill Wennington, Keith Booth 
and former North Carolina roommate Buzz Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Other former teammates like Steve Kerr and Luc Longley stayed  
behind at the Berto Center to work out, saying they would prefer to 
speak or talk to Jordan privately. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bittersweet day. He opened a lot of doors for a lot of  
people,'' said Brown, one of just four Bulls under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the game,'' Wennington said. ``It will be tough for  
basketball to replace Michael Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Jackson, the Zen-espousing ex-Hippie who won Jordan over as  
his coach and converted him to the share-the-ball principles of the 
triangle offense, didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who quit the Bulls himself last summer after  
championship No. 6, was traveling, said his agent Todd Musburger. 
But Jackson did issue a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``For our own selfish reasons we never wanted to see Michael  
Jordan retire,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented our personal flight of fantasy about what great  
things an individual can do and he made it look so easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's usual entrance into the United Center was from an  
underground parking garage where he could get out of his vehicle of 
choice and take a short walk to the locker room without much 
hassle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he entered through a mid-level concourse opening,  
an entourage surrounding him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired, wanting to spend more time with his family, Jordan said  
it was time to go out when he was still able to play the game at 
its highest level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think mentally it's been over for a while, but physically I  
think he could go right here and do something,'' said Peterson, one 
of his closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
	''He's Michael.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Coach Loses Nemesis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pat Riley's relationship with Michael Jordan was  
marked more by testiness than testimonials. In the end, though, the 
Miami Heat coach knew there was no better subject for the 
motivational circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When winning and losing was on the line, there was nobody  
better,'' Riley said Wednesday, the day of Jordan's formal 
announcement that he is retiring from basketball for the second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was Riley's constant nemesis as he tried to lead the New  
York Knicks, and later the Heat, to NBA titles. Four times Jordan 
and the Chicago Bulls stood as Riley's playoff obstacle; four times 
Riley went on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I lay my head down on the pillow at night, I'll know  
there was one guy I never had a chance to beat,'' Riley said. ``It 
doesn't look like I'll get another chance. That bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley himself owns five championship rings -- one fewer than  
Jordan -- but those came coaching the Los Angeles Lakers, just 
before Jordan rose to greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks did reach the NBA Finals in 1994, but that was the  
year Jordan was playing baseball. Preparing to face Jordan on the 
court brought only frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a nightmare to play against, but he brought you a sense  
of urgency, a feeling of being totally alive,'' Riley said. ``I 
always looked forward to preparing against his team, hoping to find 
a way to beat him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playoff intensity occasionally led Riley to call Jordan ``His  
Highness,'' and the coach once ripped Jordan for refusing to shake 
Alonzo Mourning's hand before Game 5 of the 1997 Eastern Conference 
finals. Jordan had taken offense to Mourning elbowing Scottie 
Pippen the previous game. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bulls eliminated Miami in that series, Jordan swung an  
imaginary golf club as a sendoff into Riley's offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great team around him, had a great coach in Phil  
Jackson,'' Riley said. ``But when it came down to deciding a game, 
you pretty much knew it would come down to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley paid his nemesis a powerful tribute this past summer when  
he chose Jordan's final 17 seconds as an NBA player -- his steal and 
jumper that beat Utah in Game 6 of last year's NBA Finals -- to be 
the centerpiece of the motivational speeches he gives to business 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan sneaked up behind Karl Malone, swatted the ball away and  
dribbled upcourt. He pulled up near the top of the key, faked Bryon 
Russell to the floor and swished a 17-foot jumper with 5.2 seconds 
left for an 87-86 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	For 30 minutes Riley would dissect those moments, using Jordan  
to discuss the essence of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a statue in the NBA offices today of that  
follow-through on that last shot,'' Riley said. ``You could write a 
book on that alone.''

<HEADLINE> Hyperbole and Many Uses of Facts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barely under way, the Senate impeachment trial  
is already flooded with understatements, overstatements and 
selective use of the facts, courtesy of two excellent sets of 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	To President Clinton's team, the ``stability of our  
constitutional government'' may hang in the balance. To House 
prosecutors, ``the honor and integrity of the United States'' is at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluminous filings that landed in the Senate this week on  
the Monica Lewinsky sex and cover-up scandal are the work of legal 
teams operating in overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final analysis, the House is asking the Senate to  
remove the president because he had a wrongful relationship and 
sought to keep the existence of that relationship private,'' 
Clinton's lawyers wrote in defense of a client accused of perjury 
and obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the White House is ignoring the alleged perjury and  
obstruction. Instead, it is trying to obliterate the two articles 
of impeachment in a 71-page brief so all-encompassing that it even 
touches on the original Whitewater allegations against the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Whitewater probe, which the president's lawyers dismissively  
refer to as an ``investigative dead-end,'' resulted in the 
conviction of the Clintons' business partners on 22 felony charges. 
Recently, prosecutor Kenneth Starr revealed he seriously considered 
referring Whitewater-related evidence against Clinton to the House 
for a possible impeachment inquiry late last year. The five-year 
Whitewater probe is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In their filing with the Senate, the Clinton team delves deeply  
into the grand jury testimony in the Lewinsky probe, a tactic that 
a legal scholar says could undercut calls from Clinton supporters 
for a trial with no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In rebutting the obstruction charge, Clinton's lawyers highlight  
the testimony of presidential secretary Betty Currie that she 
didn't feel any pressure ``whatsoever'' when Clinton asked 
questions like ``I was never really alone with Monica, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers didn't bother to mention another section of  
Mrs. Currie's grand jury testimony: The part in which she said she 
felt as though Clinton wanted her to agree with his statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting that the White House is relying on the  
detailed accounts of witnesses, because it raises questions of 
witness credibility,'' said St. Johns University law professor John 
Barrett. ``If the White House is right that Currie is a credible 
witness for them, the way for the Senate to deal with that is not 
to read the cold transcript but to question her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers aren't the only ones making selective use of  
grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers are trying to link Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit  
denying a sexual relationship with Clinton to the efforts of 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan to line up a job for her. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers are making much of the fact that Jordan called  
the chairman of MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes in New York when Ms. Lewinsky 
told Jordan her job interview at the firm had gone ``very poorly.'' 
Jordan made the call the day after Ms. Lewinsky signed her 
affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	What the House managers didn't mention is that the company  
executive who scheduled a subsequent interview with Ms. Lewinsky 
says he never even knew about Jordan's call. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denying a sexual relationship is  
problematic for Clinton because he is the one who raised with her 
the possibility of filing it as a way of avoiding testifying in the 
Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	The president asserted in his grand jury testimony Aug. 17 that  
he thought Ms. Lewinsky would be able to file a truthful affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky plainly was under no obligation to volunteer to  
the Jones lawyers every last detail about her relationship with the 
president -- and the failure of the president to instruct her to do 
so is neither wrong nor an obstruction of justice,'' his legal team 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the ``details'' in Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit  
consisted of statements such as ``in the course of my employment at 
the White House I met President Clinton several times. ... I have 
the utmost respect for the president, who has always behaved 
appropriately in my presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton legal team also came up with a rebuttal for a  
cellular phone record that House managers are using to suggest 
Clinton engaged in obstruction. Showing that Mrs. Currie telephoned 
Ms. Lewinsky, prosecutors are touting it as proof the president 
dispatched his secretary to retrieve gifts he'd given to the former 
White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	What the House managers didn't focus on was the fact that the  
call came late in the day and that it lasted at most just one 
minute, which the White House suggests bolsters Mrs. Currie's 
testimony that it was Ms. Lewinsky who initiated the gift exchange. 
Clinton says he knows nothing about the transfer of gifts.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Likes France's Iraq Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A French proposal to lift the oil embargo  
on Iraq recommends a new monitoring system that would focus on 
preventing Baghdad from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, 
rather than accounting for what it may still have. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift, outlined in a proposal released today, is significant  
because U.N. weapons inspectors have maintained Iraq still harbors 
the deadly weapons, despite Baghdad's claims that it has been 
disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baghdad government has said inspectors may not return to  
Iraq following the U.S.-British airstrikes Dec. 16-19. The French 
proposal, if accepted by Iraq and the Security Council, would allow 
for some oversight but not under the inspectors' original mandate. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal says the oil embargo could be lifted as long as  
Iraq is not allowed to use money from oil sales to rebuild its 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia today welcomed the ``general thrust'' of the French plan,  
which also was presented to China, Britain and the United States -- 
the other permanent members of the Security Council -- on Tuesday 
and was expected to be distributed to the other 10 council members 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has consistently said the embargo could only  
be lifted once Iraq is declared to be entirely disarmed of its 
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and the long-range 
missiles to deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Clinton administration reacted cautiously. James P.  
Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said ``we have a number of 
questions and concerns'' about the French approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has always been skeptical and perhaps others  
are not as skeptical as we are'' of Iraq's intentions, Rubin said. 
But he also said there were some ``positive aspects'' to the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baghdad, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said the French  
initiative ``does not match our point of view'' but he did not 
categorically reject it. Ramadan added, however, that ``any 
resolution which is not discussed or negotiated with Iraq ... will 
be rejected and we will not implement it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary-General Kofi Annan sees the French plan as a first  
step toward resuming disarmament work in Iraq, spokesman Fred 
Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan feels ``that it's important that the council come to grips  
with these morning-after questions that he's been posing for some 
time of how to get on with the disarmament of Iraq after there's 
been bombing,'' Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so he welcomes the French proposal as the first concrete  
step in that direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The French plan says the airstrikes on Iraq in December created  
a new situation ``which renders further investigations on the past 
programs almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``France considers it is high time for the Security Council to  
recognize that no additional progress on disarmament work can be 
reached by an -- illusory -- resumption of unchanged previous 
methods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French Ambassador Alain Dejammet recommended a long-term  
monitoring and prevention system of any effort aimed at developing 
again weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The control would no longer be retrospective but would become  
preventative,'' the French proposal says. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal recommends the U.N. Special Commission responsible  
for carrying out weapons inspections in Iraq be renewed as a 
``control commission,'' made more independent, professional and 
autonomous. 
</P>
<P>
	That apparently was a reference to Iraqi allegations that the  
commission, known as UNSCOM, acts as a puppet of the United States. 
Those allegations gained momentum with recent reports that 
Washington used UNSCOM information for its own intelligence goals 
in Iraq -- reports UNSCOM and Washington denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Today in northern Iraq, meanwhile, American warplanes patrolling  
the ``no-fly'' zone attacked several surface-to-air missile 
installations after being targeted by Iraqi radar, U.S. officials 
said. Iraqis fired at least one missile but missed the U.S. planes, 
the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents underscored an increasingly aggressive challenge  
by Saddam Hussein to the ``no-fly'' zones enforced by American and 
British planes in northern and southern Iraq.	   France is especially eager to lift the oil embargo that has been 
in place since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 so that French companies 
can develop the nation's vast oil potential. Russia and China also 
want to lift the embargo and restructure UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Henry Approved As Marlins Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- John Henry's $150 million purchase of  
the Florida Marlins was unanimously approved by baseball owners 
Wednesday, ending H. Wayne Huizenga's topsy turvy reign. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, a 49-year-old commodities trader from Boca Raton, Fla.,  
formally takes over after the deal closes next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six years since the Huizenga family brought baseball  
to South Florida,'' said Huizenga, who has not attended many 
owners' meetings during the past five years. ``We did not want to 
sell our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga founded the Marlins, obtaining the franchise in July  
1991. The expansion team started play two years later, saw 
attendance plummet after the 1994-95 strike, then won a surprising 
World Series title in 1997 after doubling its payroll from $25.3 
million to $52.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Huizenga, a billionaire who also owns the NFL's Miami  
Dolphins and heads the public company that owns the NHL's Florida 
Panthers, became disenchanted when Florida and Miami officials 
failed to fund a stadium with a retractable roof. He became 
convinced the government wouldn't finance a ballpark for a 
billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks after the Marlins beat Cleveland in Game 7, he  
ordered an unprecedented payroll purge that saw the Marlins go from 
fifth-highest to No. 27 at $19.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida finished 54-108, the worst record ever for a defending  
champion and the poorest record in the National League since 1969. 
Just four players remain from the World Series roster: Antonio 
Alfonseca, Craig Counsell, Cliff Floyd and Livan Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking about what to do to return winning baseball  
to South Florida. It's a big challenge,'' Henry said, adding he 
would reveal more details next week after he officially becomes the 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Henry's first tasks is convincing Florida and Miami  
officials to fund a ballpark. While he says he would pay for a 
stadium if the government doesn't fund one, he also says that would 
condemn the Marlins to low payrolls and perennial mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to pay for players or pay for a ballpark,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Henry also is hampered by an ongoing relationship with Huizenga,  
who also owns Pro Player Stadium and SportsChannel Florida, which 
has the local television rights to Marlins' games. Huizenga 
originally agreed to a deal between the Marlins and the TV network 
that extended for the next 25 years; as part of his negotiations 
with Henry, the TV deal will end after 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry immediately joined the ranks of baseball owners calling  
for economic change. NBA players agreed last week to the first-ever 
limit on individual salaries among the four major North American 
professional sports. Some baseball owners want that too when it 
comes time to renegotiate their collective bargaining agreement, 
probably after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced the current leadership of baseball will bring  
about change,'' Henry said at a news conference as commissioner Bud 
Selig looked on. ``I think Florida baseball would be in a sad state 
of affairs without change. ... I firmly believe this commissioner 
will make his mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga, who was the wealthiest individual owner in baseball,  
gave a goodbye speech during the 2-hour major league meeting, then 
introduced Henry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an emotional moment for everybody,'' Marlins general  
manager Dave Dombrowski said.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Rejects Interview Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bracing for opening arguments in his  
impeachment trial, President Clinton said Wednesday he will tend 
studiously to ``the business of the people'' while his fate is 
settled in historic Senate proceedings. House prosecutors said 
Monica Lewinsky had recently rejected their request for a voluntary 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first formal presentation of evidence set for Thursday,  
Judiciary Committee Republicans said they had sought permission 
earlier in the week to talk with the woman at the center of the 
sex-and-cover-up scandal. Her attorneys ``declined to make her 
available,'' said a committee spokesman, Paul J. McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed  
that a similar request was made to at least one other potential 
witness, Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Clinton's remarks Wednesday, his legal team  
dispatched a formal trial brief to the Senate arguing that neither 
``fact or law'' warranted his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote the American people rendered ... is hanging in the  
balance,'' the brief said in a reference to Clinton's election. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have their job to do in the Senate, and I have mine,''  
the president told reporters in his first public utterance in three 
weeks on an issue that has tarnished his presidency for posterity. 
``I trust that the right thing will be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in  
the first presidential impeachment trial since Andrew Johnson was 
acquitted in 1868. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to 
convict him and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is to resume at 1 p.m. EST Thursday, with Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist presiding and the House impeachment team 
-- Republican lawmakers all -- starting to present their case. 
</P>
<P>
	The House does not yet have permission from the Senate to call  
witnesses in the trial. Spokesman McNulty explained the overture to 
Ms. Lewinsky by saying the committee was ``duty-bound to gather all 
relevant evidence and be thoroughly prepared for the trial. 
Implicit in the House's right to request witnesses is the 
responsibility to determine who the House will call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Ms. Lewinsky's attorneys, Plato Cacheris, declined to  
respond to McNulty's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty declined to confirm the approach to Ms. Willey, although  
legal sources said two members of the committee, Reps. Lindsey 
Graham of South Carolina and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, had 
recently met with her and her attorney. She alleged Clinton made an 
uninvited sexual pass in the White House, but the incident is not 
cited in either of the two articles of impeachment approved by the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	One legal source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
conversation touched on the alleged sexual advance, but mostly was 
about any possible intimidation to get Willey to change her story. 
Some House managers and investigators have been interested in 
calling her if they can obtain evidence on the intimidation issue -- 
a matter under investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, officials said Democrats had suggested canceling  
next Tuesday's scheduled trial session to avoid an awkward 
appearance on the day of Clinton's scheduled State of the Union 
address. Senate Republicans discussed the issue at a closed-door 
meeting during the day. Most were opposed, according to sources 
familiar with the discussion, since Clinton had declined to 
reschedule his speech, but no final decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the House prosecutors, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of  
Wisconsin, visited the Senate chamber during the day to prepare. He 
said his opening statement of 45 minutes to an hour would focus on 
``laying out the case and showing very clearly that the president 
committed an impeachable offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's legal team argued otherwise in their long legal brief  
filed with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations ``do not begin to satisfy the stringent showing  
required by our Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected president 
from office, either as a matter of fact or law,'' they wrote. They 
even ``fall far short of what a prudent prosecutor would require 
before presenting a case to a judge or jury,'' the brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor in the case  
against the president, insisted that the matter had to be pressed 
forward, regardless of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the senators ``decide is perfectly acceptable to me. I  
won't lose sleep over either ... verdict. But I will lose sleep if 
we lay down on the job and didn't do our level best,'' Hyde said on 
ABC's ``Nightline'' Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if we had turned our back on these facts and this  
circumstance, simply because the polling figures were not 
favorable, we would betray our duty,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Hyde also said threats have been made against  
his life. 
</P>
<P>
	With public polls showing strong voter support for Clinton,  
Senate Republicans labored conspicuously on non-impeachment 
matters. For the second straight day, they met in closed-door 
session to review a legislative agenda for the year that includes 
tax cuts, education, defense and other issues. Sen. Connie Mack of 
Florida said he and his GOP colleagues were determined ``to see 
that the work of the American people is moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sought to project the same image.  
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, asked by reporters about his trial, he said,  
``The important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking 
about that as possible and as much time working on the issues we're 
here to discuss as possible. .... I need to work on the business of 
the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House officials sent the Senate all public evidence in the case,  
including material from Starr and documents from the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment lawsuit. Also included are audio tapes that Linda 
Tripp made of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by private attorneys and the staff of the White House  
counsel's office, Clinton's pleadings argued that the impeachment 
standard of high crimes and misdemeanors refers to actions that are 
attempts to subvert the Constitution. They said that just as 
Republicans and Democrats agreed in 1974 that President Nixon's 
filing of an allegedly false income tax return fell short of that 
standard, so did the allegations against Clinton, even if proven. 
</P>
<P>
	They also methodically sought to rebut each allegation -- that  
Clinton lied in grand jury testimony, for example, or conspired to 
hide gifts that Ms. Lewinsky had given him. 
</P>
<P>
	They acknowledged that the accounts of Clinton and the former  
intern differ on some matters, such as the number of their 
encounters, the date of their first intimate contact and what they 
did together. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the lawyers wrote, ``these squabbles are utterly  
immaterial'' and are ``precisely the kind of disagreement that the 
law does not intend to capture as perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under ground rules adopted last week, the House has 24 hours --  
spread over three days, for example-- to make its case, and the 
White House will have 24 hours for its defense. The Senate will 
then be permitted to pose questions to the two sides. Afterward, 
the White House is expected to seek dismissal of the charges, and 
the House is expected to seek permission to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In their brief, the White House lawyers said the president would  
face a ``critical need for the discovery of evidence useful to his 
defense -- evidence which would routinely be available to any civil 
litigant involved in a garden-variety automobile accident case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the prosecutors call even one witness, Clinton lawyers would  
need a delay of weeks to go through that process before they could 
fairly cross-examine any House witness, said one lawyer, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be up to the Senate to decide on requests for delays.  
The White House assertion that a lengthy pause in the trial would 
be needed appeared to be an effort to lay the groundwork for 
charging the GOP-controlled Senate with being unfair to the 
president.

<HEADLINE> Poet of 200 Years Ago Still Beloved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- He's an unlikely national hero -- a poet  
known for the difficulty of both his verse and his personality, 
ambivalent in his politics and unobservant in his religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Mirza Mohammad Asadullah Khan is being celebrated in his  
bicentennial year in India with an enthusiasm befitting the 
one-word pen name with which he crowned himself: Ghalib, or ``the 
lustrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a star- and politician-studded commemoration in the weeks  
leading up to Ghalib's birthday on Dec. 27, Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee said Ghalib, who wrote in both courtly Persian and 
the Urdu of the markets and brothels of 19th-century Delhi, spoke 
to the common man. The nation issued a new postage stamp honoring 
the poet, and a December international conference in New Delhi drew 
scholars who have translated him into French, German and Czech. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian cultural historian Pavan Varma said he grew up hearing  
Ghalib quoted at the dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a Ghalib couplet to reinforce every argument or  
illustrate a point or counter an argument, because his canvas was 
so broad,'' Varma said in an interview. ``He wrote poetry that 
penetrated the human condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghalib excelled at the exacting ghazal, a form composed of a  
series of short couplets that can be independent of each other in 
subject and spirit, but are linked by rhythm and rhyme. He infused 
his ghazals with sophisticated puns and allusions, discoursing on 
philosophy, literature or history in a gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians revel in the wit, economy and musicality of Ghalib's  
ghazals, and despair at being unable to fully explain them to those 
who speak neither Urdu nor classical Persian. Translators like the 
American poet Adrienne Rich working with Urdu scholar Aijaz Ahmad 
have created compelling verse based on Ghalib's work. 
</P>
<P>
	The most quotable Ghalib, Varma said, has been passed down by  
word of mouth. That process was accelerated a decade ago by a 
popular film and then a television series on his life in which 
Ghalib's verses were set to music and sung by some of the country's 
most beloved musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Popular drama also popularized the image of Ghalib as bearded  
and soulful-eyed under the tower of a brimless hat still seen on 
older men shuffling through the narrow alleys of New Delhi's Muslim 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	For a new documentary on Delhi's past, filmmaker Sanjay Roy  
chose Ghalib's familiar figure to guide viewers through the 
transition from the order of the Mughals who once ruled from the 
red sandstone fort at the heart of Delhi's old quarter, to the 
ascension of British colonists. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghalib lived through those often violent, decadent times. He  
found rich material to lampoon, but also lamented a world fading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inside the fort a few princes get together and recite their  
verses. Once in a while I attend these gatherings. Contemporary 
society is about to vanish. Who knows when the poets will meet next 
or meet again at all?'' he wrote a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a romantic figure -- tall, handsome. And he wore his  
attitude,'' filmmaker Roy said, recounting the story of the 
perennially cash-strapped poet refusing a college teaching 
appointment because the British director did not pay him the 
respect of meeting his carriage when Ghalib arrived for the job 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	If he looked on the British with disdain, he sometimes chafed at  
the Persian Muslim mores that were the heritage he shared with the 
Mughals. He adored wine and women, and rarely prayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Qurratulain Hyder, one of India's best-known contemporary Urdu  
writers, said Ghalib would not have been surprised at the attention 
surrounding his bicentennial, which ends on the 201st anniversary 
of his birth Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very much sure of his own genius,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Born in the northern city of Agra, he moved to Delhi while still  
a teen prodigy. His steady rise through a competitive, lively 
literary world was reached its peak in 1854 when he was named 
poetry master to Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, himself an 
accomplished poet. 
</P>
<P>
	The grave of Ghalib, who died Feb. 15, 1869, still receives  
scores of visitors every day. Staff at the Ghalib Academy next door 
are accustomed to unlocking the gate of the iron fence surrounding 
his tomb, although not always with much enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	The tomb is simple -- a white marble block in a small pavilion of  
the same marble, and a Persian inscription declaring ``the treasure 
of knowledge lies buried in the dust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wide, scrupulously swept courtyard around the tomb is paved  
in red sandstone and is luxurious in a neighborhood of cramped 
alleys where everyone seems to know the way to Ghalib's tomb, not 
least the burly owner of the nearby Ghalib Kebab Stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people come,'' said R.K. Ahmet, receptionist at the  
academy devoted to the study of Ghalib. Four hawkers sitting next 
to baskets heaped with blood-red roses for pilgrims to place on the 
shrine were proof the site attracts enough visitors to be a good 
place to do business. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 30 years ago, Urdu scholar and poet Aijaz Ahmad embarked  
on an interpretation experiment, bringing seven American poets into 
contact with India's beloved Ghalib. Working with Ahmad's literal 
translations and notes, the Americans created not so much 
translations as new poems based on Ghalib. Following are excerpts 
from ``Ghazals of Ghalib: Versions From the Urdu'' edited by Ahmad 
and recently reissued by Oxford University Press. 

</P>
<P>
	``Nothing comes very easy to you, human creature --  
</P>
<P>
	least of all the skill to live humanely.  
</P>
<P>
	Time after time ahead of time, you fool,  
</P>
<P>
	standing in panic at the meeting-place.  
</P>
<P>
	The molecules of the mirror, if she appear,  
</P>
<P>
	longing to open like eyelids and take her in.  
</P>
<P>
	My body in the grave, scarred with its disappointments,  
</P>
<P>
	and yours, alive as the rainbow glistening in the orchard.  
</P>
<P>
	Killing me off she sobs: `I never meant to hurt you!'  
</P>
<P>
	Tears of repentance, wept three seconds too late.''  
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
	Gone is the pleasure of looking at beautiful things!  
</P>
<P>
	It seems like a dream of another life.  
</P>
<P>
	Gone are those youthful turns of thought!  
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the tears of blood that used to come easy!  
</P>
<P>
	The heart is weak; the world cannot be trusted.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Gone is any justice in the scheme of things.''

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Michael Jordan: An Appreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The real wonder of Michael Jordan was this: He always kept  
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Not just in his head, not just on a basketball court, and not  
just some nights, but every minute of every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The first week Jordan played for the Bulls, official scorer Bob  
Rosenberg looked up to find him studying the scorebook every time 
he reported to the table to re-enter the game. It didn't take long 
to figure out why. By knowing everybody's point and rebound totals, 
Jordan knew how the newspaper stories the next day would begin. 
Then he took the floor and made sure they always began the same 
way: ``Michael Jordan ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen years later, the playing and promoting had not dulled  
his competitive edge. Even in the last days of what Bulls 
coach-turned-medicine-man Phil Jackson called ``The Last Dance,'' 
Jordan could turn the walk from the hotel lobby to a waiting bus 
into an event. What people who saw him sweep by in an elegant suit 
didn't know was that Jordan practiced for even those few seconds, 
trying on his clothes the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that obsession, his father once said, that made his son  
special even as a child. From the moment he started playing games, 
Michael had to win, and just as important, there had to be 
something riding on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	One unseasonably cool spring afternoon five years ago, James  
Jordan braved a steady drizzle outside the Chicago Bulls practice 
gym and told those stories to explain how deep his son's 
competitive streak ran. 
</P>
<P>
	A few nights earlier, Jordan, his father and some friends had  
made a whirlwind tour of the casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., and 
now the Bulls trailed the New York Knicks two games to one in the 
best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals. A year earlier, Jordan's 
checks had turned up in the pockets of a cocaine trafficker and 
assorted con men and he admitted running up huge gambling debts 
playing poker and golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have a gambling problem,'' James Jordan said. ``He  
wouldn't be doing that if he couldn't afford it. He isn't that 
stupid. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he does have is a competition problem. He was born with  
that. And if he didn't have a competition problem,'' his father 
paused, fixing the handful of questioners, ``you guys wouldn't be 
writing about him. The person he tries to outdo most of the time is 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 4 the next night, Michael replied in his own way. He  
torched the Knicks for 54 points and the Bulls won easily, getting 
back on track toward their third NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	He is restless in a way the rest of us are not.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has traveled everywhere and anywhere for a competitive  
fix, a modern-day Ulysses roaming the world in sneakers and baggy 
shorts, Atlas holding up a globe with seams stretched across it. 
</P>
<P>
	His journey started in his own front yard, against an older  
brother on a makeshift court of caked dirt. It detoured through the 
University of North Carolina, where he won a national championship 
... through Barcelona, Spain, where he won a second Olympic gold 
medal ... through minor-league ballparks in the South, where he ran 
from the ghost of a murdered father ... and through corporate 
boardrooms, where he helped sell more of everything -- hot dogs and 
hamburgers, Wheaties, sunglasses, calling cards, underwear and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended last June in Salt Lake City, where the drama of  
Jordan's sixth NBA championship came down to one last 
heart-stopping jump shot swishing through the net and sucking every 
last bit of air out of the state of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, as everyone else struggled to catch their breath, he  
said: ``Hopefully, I've put enough memories out there for everybody 
to at least have some thoughts about what Michael Jordan did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was never bigger, never better, even at 35, nor was there a  
more perfect time for him to take his leave. His statue already 
stands guard outside the United Center, where thousands come to 
have their picture taken each year -- in the shadow of the $175 
Million House That Jordan Built. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The first time he walked away from basketball, in the fall of  
1993, Jordan said the thrill of playing was not so much gone as 
sated. Besides, living like Elvis had him positively spooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that's weird about Michael,'' good friend  
Charles Barkley said at the time, ``is that whenever we're 
together, we're in a hotel room, because he doesn't ever go out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going out wasn't high on Jordan's list. He said he wanted to see  
his kids more. What he really wanted, though, was time to grieve, 
time off from basketball, time away from the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NBA had no provisions for sabbaticals, and the media  
didn't issue waivers. So Jordan took the easy way out. The man who 
could fly was grounding himself. He was 30 years old, in the prime 
of a brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'll ever have a normal life. But if I can  
lessen it even a little bit,'' Jordan said, ``it will be better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was -- for a little while.  
</P>
<P>
	In September, 1994, he played in teammate Scottie Pippen's  
charity basketball game; only, Jordan said, to pay his respects to 
Chicago Stadium before the 65-year-old building fell to the 
wrecking ball. He wound up scoring 52 points. And Gen-X kids like 
Anfernee Hardaway and Isaiah Rider, who knew him only by 
reputation, were stunned to find out Jordan was even better in 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game ended, he walked to the center jump circle, knelt  
and kissed the hardwood bull in the middle goodbye, then left. But 
something inside him stirred. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, after playing as much golf as he wanted and  
then playing as much baseball as pride would allow, after one 
entire basketball season passed and a second was nearly complete, 
the competition problem his father talked about surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of his return was faxed from his agent's office  
to newspapers and television outlets across the United States. Like 
any man who would alter the course of sports history, he had no 
time for small talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm back,'' was all he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	There was no way to say who was happiest -- NBA commissioner  
David Stern or Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf or Jordan's agent, David 
Falk. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, it could have been any or all of the CEOs at Nike,  
NBC, Coke, General Mills, Wilson, McDonald's, Sara Lee, Upper Deck, 
WorldCom, Oakley and Rayovac. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is that all of them, Jordan included, had reason to  
celebrate. And with each passing day, there was reason to celebrate 
more. Last year, between his salary and endorsements, between 
selling to the suits and hanging on as a hero with the Hip Hop 
Nation, Jordan earned more than $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Impressive as that sounds, he's made 100 times that amount for  
other people. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Fortune magazine totaled what it called ``The Jordan  
Effect.'' It put his impact on the economy, since joining the NBA 
in 1984, at $10 billion. If that number seemed high, consider that 
even a bad movie like ``Space Jam'' -- in which Jordan played 
himself saving the earth from evil cartoon characters -- grossed 
$230 million worldwide. Just because he was in it. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Fortune's other calculations:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jordan sold an extra $165 million in tickets for the NBA by  
himself. His televised games delivered an extra $366 million in 
revenues to league coffers. Sales of licensed merchandise was $44 
million annually when he arrived; today, that figure is $3.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nike has sold $2.6 billion in Jordan-related products. As the  
embodiment of the image the company seeks to promote, his worth 
might be twice actual sales. There is little reason to doubt the 
figure since his sneakers, priced at $150 a pair, routinely sell 
out in 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was like the rising tide,'' Stephen Greyser, professor of  
marketing at Harvard Business School, told the magazine, ``raising 
all boats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan didn't just raise Reinsdorf's boat, he turned it into  
a yacht. 
</P>
<P>
	When Michael first set foot inside Chicago Stadium, the Bulls  
averaged 6,365 fans per game. Attendance increased 90 percent in 
his first season. By the third, they sold out nightly. At last 
count, the string had reached 542 consecutive nights, despite 
Jordan's retirement and even after moving into the bigger United 
Center in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan always worried about going out on top, like Jim Brown and  
Sandy Koufax. In his most private moments, he told friends watching 
Willie Mays stagger under fly balls long after his skills were gone 
made him sadder than just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his career, Jordan's repertoire consisted mostly of  
dunks, finger rolls, half-gaining, full-twisting layups and the 
like, shots so short and so spectacular he could see his reflection 
clearly in the glass each time he climbed into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing better defined the acrobat he had once been than the  
chest-heaving, earth-leaving, through-the-air-weaving slam he threw 
down in front of the home fans to win the 1987 NBA Slam Dunk 
competition. But that silhouette defined him less and less in 
recent seasons. More and more, Jordan became a jump shooter, trying 
to minimize the wear and tear on his body. 
</P>
<P>
	What made him dangerous was that on any given night, he could  
take back as many of those seasons as he needed. 
</P>
<P>
	He did it in Game 5 last year, the first time the Bulls beat  
Utah in the NBA Finals, fighting the flu, dizziness and 
dehydration. He did it against Utah again this year, this time in 
clinching Game 6. What made it all the more compelling was that 
this one came on the heels of a long and wearying playoff series 
against the Indiana Pacers and old nemesis Larry Bird, a stretch of 
games during which Jordan had never looked more mortal. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about coming full circle: At the end of his second season  
in Chicago, Jordan scored 63 points against the Boston Celtics in a 
playoff game and Bird, who was The Man at that moment, said 
watching the kid play was like watching ``God in short pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen years later, Bird was coaching the Pacers and he had a  
courtside seat facing Jordan. He watched Jordan cost the Bulls one 
game with a slip at a crucial moment and another by dribbling the 
ball off his foot at the end. Afterward, he listened to Jordan 
complain about the referees and essentially called him a whiner. 
</P>
<P>
	There was something to that, to be sure. For a dozen seasons at  
least, the refs had treated Jordan like a Picasso -- look but don't 
touch. Yet, the deeper he went into the playoffs last season, the 
more it became apparent that Jordan's aura, if not gone, certainly 
was fading. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, he needed his teammates more. A younger, more  
principled Jordan never would have put up with Dennis Rodman and 
the circus swirling around him. A tired, much older Jordan was 
grateful for every rebound and every distraction Rodman brought to 
the mix; it meant less work for him. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, watching him struggle, Bird probably assumed what had  
happened to him was happening to Michael: His age and the grind 
were wearing him out. What that explanation failed to take into 
account was that the depth of Jordan's desire hadn't changed since 
he was a kid, that the outcome still mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people need money to provide a spark. Some need the  
motivation of a championship stage. What separates Jordan, now as 
then, is that he never needed a reason to play. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meaningless game last spring, Jordan dropped 41 points on  
the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 107-93 win. Most people assumed 
with Shaquille O'Neal scoring 50 the night before and beginning to 
make a run at the regular-season scoring title, Jordan was simply 
trying to hold his place. That was only the half of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time the Bulls had played Minnesota at home, on New  
Year's Eve, a crank called the arena and claimed Deloris Jordan, 
his mother, had been rushed to a hospital back home in North 
Carolina. Someone relayed the message to the Bulls' locker room at 
halftime without checking its veracity. Michael, unable to reach 
his mother and still clearly shaken, went out and missed his first 
five shots of the third period and five of his next nine. The Bulls 
coughed up a 9-point lead and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Jordan learned the story was a hoax. He was mad  
about the call, but even madder at the Timberwolves for passing on 
the message without checking it out. He waited four months to even 
the score. 
</P>
<P>
	He did.  
</P>
<P>
	He always does.

<HEADLINE> Jon Stewart Takes Over `Daily Show' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a sight no man or woman alive had ever  
seen. It was instant history, and as we watched it unfolding on TV 
-- hear ye, hear ye -- we knew this was something we would never 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, this was unimpeachably Jon Stewart, in charge for the first  
time ever Monday as the host of Comedy Central's ``Daily Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Happily, it was no trial to watch. In Stewart's hands, ``The  
Daily Show'' was about as funny and fast-paced as before. But his 
swearing-in, if you choose to call it that, was a signal event for 
the 2 1/2-year-old parody newscast that bills itself as ``the most 
important television program ... ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And for its viewers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know change can be painful,'' Stewart told us with mock  
sincerity. ``But from change comes growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henceforth, Stewart will, uh, steward that growth from the  
anchor chair recently vacated by tall Craig Kilborn, who soon takes 
his high-altitude attitude to CBS' ``Late Late Show,'' replacing 
Tom Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``The Daily Show'' brings Stewart back to TV on a regular,  
ongoing basis: Sunday through Thursday at 11 p.m. EST -- and repeats 
Monday through Friday at 8:30 a.m., 1 p.m., 7 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., 
and Saturdays at noon and 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a welcome return. In recent years, Stewart (no attitude;  
not tall) has been on TV with tantalizing infrequency. He filled in 
for Snyder and played a recurring role on HBO's talk-show parody 
``The Larry Sanders Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also appeared in films (such as his current ``The Faculty''  
and upcoming ``Playing By Heart'') and wrote a book of loopy 
essays, ``Naked Pictures of Famous People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has done all that since 1995, when his late-night, syndicated  
``Jon Stewart Show'' was canceled after a single season. Now -- hear 
ye -- he's got another TV series! He's back! 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Stewart gently reminds a reporter that during all  
that time he himself never suffered from his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was oddly NOT gone,'' said Stewart, wearing a  
mischievous smile. ``Being a TV host is very much the same as not 
being on TV, except there's no camera and I didn't get to talk to 
the guys from `Wings.' Besides, I was working straight through, so 
I didn't even do the David Hartman thing and go out to Montana for 
fly-fishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Stewart spoke in his small, sparse office, he was still a  
couple of weeks away from his ``Daily Show'' debut. A baseball bat 
and a tennis racket lay within reach behind his desk. A few days' 
stubble peppered his face. All in all, he seemed ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
	And, even with his chain smoking, he seemed carefree. ``Oh, I  
have psychoses,'' he argued, ``but they're about other things. 
Like, I want to buy a biosuit so the Super Bug can't get me. It's 
that sort of thing that keeps me awake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to doing the show, to that feeling of  
daily reinforcement. You get up and you know that whatever stupid 
idea you have that morning you're going to get to put out that 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a tailor-made series in his past, Stewart doesn't  
believe that accepting the hand-me-down ``Daily Show'' amounts to 
professional backsliding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like what they're doing with the show. I like the idea of  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a kid, I never thought, `I want to be a talk-show host,'''  
said the 36-year-old New Jersey native. ``Some people growing up 
gazed into the sky and every cloud looked like Johnny Carson. I 
just wanted to be a good comic. And that was only after I got out 
of school: `Well, what do I do now? I like to sleep late and I 
don't like working.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are, Stewart won't get to sleep late and will have to  
work hard on ``The Daily Show.'' Stuff has to be current, and each 
night's half-hour is taped at 6 p.m. Not much time each day to 
process the world, then play it for laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, Stewart has always liked to stay on top of what's  
happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to watch the early local news,'' he said, ``but not at  
11, because I don't like to go to bed with that sort of chaos and 
pain in my head: `This building collapsed today, and here is the 
little boy who lost his mother.' It's a lot to sit through just to 
get to the (gosh-darn) Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also watch CNN,'' he added, ``and I watch a lot of  
newsmagazines, because I DO want to know what's in that 
cheeseburger I'm eating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like keeping up with the news, even though I think it's  
gotten so out of control. But that's what I like about `The Daily 
Show': It's like checks and balances. This show seems to be a nice 
sort of pin in the balloon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's inside the balloon? Hear ye, hear ye, find out on ``The  
Daily Show,'' on pain of missing laughs. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Motorola Earnings Sliced in Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at Motorola Inc.  
were sliced in half from the year-ago period as the company 
continued to suffer from weak computer chip sales and Asian 
economic woes. Motorola beat Wall Street expecations, however. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Dec. 31, Motorola earned $159  
million, or 26 cents a share, compared to $321 million, or 53 cents 
a share, in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
23 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the fourth-quarter increased slightly to $8.34  
billion, up from $8.28 billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schaumburg-based communications equipment manufacturer said  
cost-cutting measures, including a work force reduction of 17,000 
employees, are starting to pay off and that strong digital 
telephone sales also are helping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We moved decisively in 1998 to confront and fix the  
performance issues that were within our control,'' CEO Christopher 
B. Galvin said. ``We made significant changes and are ahead of 
schedule on many of our programs to improve profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move forward, factors beyond our control, such as  
uncertain economic conditions in Asia and parts of Latin America, 
may continue to affect our worldwide businesses,'' Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter semiconductor sales decreased 9 percent to $1.9  
billion compared to the year-ago period, while orders dropped 5 
percent. But both sales and orders increased 7 percent compared to 
the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer chip orders were higher in Asia, except for Japan, and  
lower in other regions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Motorola lost $962 million, or $1.61 a diluted  
share on revenue of $29.4 billion. In 1997 Motorola earned $1.1 
billion on revenue of $29.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report was released after markets had closed  
Wednesday. Shares of Motorola rose $3.37 1/2, or 5 percent, to $70.87 1/2 
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Court Kills Suit on Seized Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police don't have to tell people how to get  
back their property when it is seized under a search warrant, the 
Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	People can find that out on their own from public sources, the  
court said. The justices unanimously threw out a California 
couple's lawsuit over the difficulty they had recovering cash taken 
by police during a search of their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that when  
police seize property under a search warrant, due process requires 
them to give notice that the property was taken. Otherwise, the 
property's owner might not know who took it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennedy added, ``Once the property owner is informed that  
his property has been seized, he can turn to ... public sources to 
learn about the remedial procedures'' for recovering the property 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city need not take other steps to inform him of his  
options,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters:  
</P>
<P>
	--Most of the justices appeared skeptical as a lawyer for  
California urged them during an oral argument to let the state pay 
lower welfare benefits to newcomers than are provided to longtime 
state residents. 
</P>
<P>
	--The court made it easier to sue hospitals for ``dumping''  
patients who need emergency care onto other facilities. The court 
unanimously revived a Kentucky woman's lawsuit and said such claims 
do not have to show a hospital had an improper motive in 
transferring a patient. 
</P>
<P>
	In the police search case, Lawrence and Clara Perkins' home was  
searched by police in West Covina, Calif., in May 1993. The couple 
had rented a room to a man linked to a shooting death elsewhere in 
the town. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items seized from the house was $2,469 in cash  
belonging to the Perkinses. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was at home when the house was searched, but police left  
a note saying they conducted the search under a court warrant. The 
note included a list of the items seized and contained a phone 
number to obtain further information. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Perkins called the number and was told he needed a  
court order to get the money returned. Later, he was told there was 
nothing at the municipal courthouse under his name and that he 
needed a case number or search warrant number. No city employee 
told him how to find those numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Perkinses sued the city in 1993, saying the search violated  
their constitutional rights. The city returned the cash in 
mid-1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled for the city, but the 9th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals said the city violated Perkins' constitutional 
rights by giving inadequate notice on how to recover the cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	To uphold the 9th Circuit court's ruling, ``we would be required  
to find that due process requires notice that not one state or the 
federal government has seen fit to require,'' Kennedy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter, 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for himself and Justice Antonin  
Scalia, agreed with the result. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Smith, the Los Angeles lawyer who represented the  
Perkinses, called the decision disappointing. He said he now hopes 
all cities, including West Covina, ``will start giving such notice, 
not because it's constitutionally required but because it's the 
right thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Movie-Making Grows in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- In the upcoming science-fiction  
thriller ``The Matrix,'' Keanu Reeves' character comes to believe 
the city in which he lives has been generated by evil computers. 
The backdrop is Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's ``Dark City,'' which starred William Hurt and  
Kiefer Sutherland, a section of Sydney's oldest district formed 
part of the grim location of the title, where aliens created a 
metropolis floating in space to conduct bizarre experiments on 
human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the scene is generic, anonymous: It could be  
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relative anonymity of Sydney, and Australia more  
generally, as a film location may be about to change as a rash of 
new major production facilities and movie deals with big Hollywood 
studios push Australia out of the wings and push it to prominence 
as an international filmmaking center. 
</P>
<P>
	Already known as a source of celebrated independent films such  
as the Academy Award-winning ``Shine'' and ``Strictly Ballroom,'' 
Australia is increasingly a place where Hollywood blockbusters are 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent announcement by ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas  
that the next two chapters in his six-part space epic will be made 
in Australia, each with a budget of around $120 million, has 
confirmed Sydney's future as a filmmaking center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most competitive screen-making capitals in  
the world,'' said Rick McCallum, producer of the ``Star Wars'' 
prequel trilogy. ``It's not about the exchange rate, it is about 
the talent that we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCallum spent more than a year negotiating with executives of  
Fox Studios Australia, a 50-50 joint venture between media magnate 
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and property development company Lend 
Lease Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio, with six sound stages and comprehensive post  
production services, is largely responsible for the surge in 
Australian film production. 
</P>
<P>
	It officially opened only this year, but already the two biggest  
films made in Australia to date -- the $60 million ``Matrix'' and 
the $57 million sequel to the 1996 hit ``Babe'' -- have been made 
there. (``Babe: Pig in the City'' proved to be one of the biggest 
box-office disappointments of the year.) 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the multimillion-dollar TV series ``Farscape'' is being  
made by the Jim Henson Co. Negotiations are reportedly under way 
for a sequel to ``Mission: Impossible'' starring Tom Cruise, and 
another film version of Ray Bradbury's science fiction novel 
``Fahrenheit 451'' by Australian-born star Mel Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Warner Bros. Roadshow Movieworld studio and theme park  
complex in Queensland state, major U.S.-backed movie productions 
have included Terrence Malick's World War II epic, ``The Thin Red 
Line,'' starring Sean Penn, and the science fiction feature ``Pitch 
Black,'' directed by David Twohy. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO movies and TV series are also being produced at the  
Queensland studios. 
</P>
<P>
	In Victoria state, Viacom Inc., owner of Paramount Pictures, is  
part of a consortium spending $220 million on an entertainment 
complex that will include film and television studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Studios' deal with Lucasfilm Ltd. to produce Episodes II and  
III in the ``Star Wars'' trilogy is expected to push production 
film levels in Australia past the record set in financial year 
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' the first of the  
planned prequels, was filmed in Britain in 1997 and is due for 
release in the United States in May 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing the Fox deal in Sydney, Lucas likened the Australian  
industry now to that of Britain in the 1970s, which was 
significantly boosted when Lucas shifted his production team there 
for the original ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I could go anywhere in the world and shoot and we could use  
any warehouse for a studio,'' Lucas said. ``In the end it is the 
talent that is here. I go where the talent is. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very keen to help bring in (to Australia) and update  
some of the more esoteric crafts that are necessary for large stage 
productions and to expand that part of the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S productions overshadow a busy local industry, which  
continues to produce internationally acclaimed independent releases 
despite declining government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 115 Australian feature films were picked for screening at  
international festivals in 1997-98, including Cannes, Sundance and 
Berlin. Thirty-three features won awards, according to the 
Australian Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``Matrix,'' a Warner Bros./Village  
Roadshow Pictures, pushed the value of film and television 
production in Australia to an all-time high in the financial year 
of $265 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Babe'' sequel, which was counted as a local production  
despite being financed by Universal Pictures, was chiefly 
responsible for a record high for local feature films of $105 
million, up from $82 million in 1996-97 and just $27 million three 
years ago, according the annual national production survey of the 
Australian Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost $315 million was spent on production and post-production  
services for the fiscal year ending in June, up from $258 million 
in 1996-97 and $236 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom in production follows an influx of Australians into  
mainstream filmmaking -- most obviously the Oscars won by ``Shine'' 
star Geoffrey Rush and ``Babe'' director George Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian faces such as those of actors Rush, Russell Crow and  
Cate Blanchett and directors Miller, Philip Noyce and Peter Weir 
are no longer strangers to Hollywood. Newcomers like Baz Luhrmann, 
director of ``William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet,'' and Alex 
Proyas of ``Dark City'' may be seen as a second wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Some local filmmakers, however, fear greater numbers of big  
overseas productions will shut out local producers by pushing up 
costs and draining the talent pool of local crews.

<HEADLINE> Kids Die in Fires in N.Y., N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Fires swept through homes in two of New  
Jersey's largest cities early today, killing three children and 
critically burning 6-year-old twins. Three other people were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Newark, 19-month-old Jasmine Crowell and her 7-year-old  
brother, William Crowell III, died in an apartment fire at about 3 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, William Anthony Crowell Jr., was critically burned  
trying to save his children, police Sgt. Derek Glenn said. After 
being rescued by firefighters from a third-floor window, Crowell 
was hospitalized with third-degree burns over 40 percent of his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire in the wood-frame apartment building was  
not immediately determined, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trenton, an apartment fire killed 2-year-old Fijon Davis and  
critically burned 6-year-old twins. Fijon's father was treated for 
burns and a broken ankle, and his mother also suffered burns and 
smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	Security bars on the apartment windows hampered rescuers, said  
Trenton Battalion Fire Chief Richard Laird. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brentwood, N.Y., early Tuesday, a house fire killed two boys  
while their mother cried outside clutching their baby sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in the Long Island community said the fire that killed  
4-year-old John Paul Lomangino and his 3-year-old brother, Joshua, 
may have been started as the boys played with matches.

<HEADLINE> Browns Stadium to Get $5M Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The new Cleveland Browns Stadium, already 70  
percent complete, will get $5 million in modifications to limit the 
exposure of fans to the fabled cold wind off Lake Erie in winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White announced the alterations on Wednesday  
and said they will raise the cost of the stadium to $282.5 million. 
The stadium will become the home of the expansion Browns next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The modifications call for installing 35,000 square feet of  
metal panels and steel support, including the closing of a small 
opening at the northwest corner between the end zone and sideline 
seats and adding screening along portions of the upper concourse. 
</P>
<P>
	With the changes, all areas of the stadium will meet guidelines  
that specify that 55 mph winds can affect a fan's balance, White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind research consultant RWDI studied wind patterns  
alongside Lake Erie and did wind-tunnel tests to mimic stadium 
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Dole Tied in Early N.H. Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has a 2-1 lead over  
former Red Cross director Elizabeth Dole in a national poll on the 
Republican presidential nomination. But in New Hampshire, they're 
in a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither is an announced candidate for president.  
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't keep pollsters and the media from being curious  
about who might have an advantage for 2000 in the state with the 
nation's first presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was done by RKM Research and Communications of  
Portsmouth, N.H., for CNN and WMUR-TV of Manchester, N.H. The poll 
of 576 Republicans taken Friday through Monday had an error margin 
of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole had 31 percent and Bush had 30 percent, while the rest of  
the field was in single digits. Arizona Sen. John McCain had 7 
percent, financier Steve Forbes had 5 percent and New Hampshire 
Sen. Bob Smith had 4 percent. They were followed by former Vice 
President Dan Quayle, commentator Pat Buchanan, former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander, Ohio Rep. John Kasich and religious activist 
Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican State  
Committee, said polls taken this early are ``all over the map.'' 
But Bush has consistently been at or near the top in various polls, 
Duprey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Elizabeth Dole and Governor Bush are well known in New  
Hampshire'' because of their involvement in earlier presidential 
campaigns -- of Elizabeth Dole's husband, Bob, and Bush's father, 
former President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken Friday through Sunday of  
410 Republicans nationwide, Bush had 42 percent to Dole's 22 
percent. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Study: Calif. TV Ignored Gov.'s Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A governor's race that made millions  
for California TV stations that aired its political ads earned only 
a tiny amount of coverage from those stations' news departments, a 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Stations in the state's biggest media markets devoted about  
one-third of 1 percent of their news programs to the race, 
according to the study by the University of Southern California 
Annenberg School for Communication. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the coverage tended to focus on political strategy  
and insider maneuvering rather than issues, said Matthew Hale, a 
research associate on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of this minuscule percentage of news coverage ... about  
two-thirds was strategy, one-third issue-based,'' Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Minuscule' is putting it charitably,'' said Michael Reese, a  
California coordinator of the Alliance for Better Campaigns, which 
seeks to increase and improve televised political coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we've been saying about California campaigns is  
anecdotal, but this quantified it in ways that were startling to 
even those of us who suspected the worst,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale and lead researcher Martin Kaplan of Annenberg employed an  
outside service that monitored 8,664 hours of local news in Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Bakersfield, San Diego and Sacramento 
between Aug. 10 and Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that local coverage of the race between Republican  
Dan Lungren and Democrat Gray Davis amounted to 26 hours and 57 
minutes, or .31 of 1 percent of all local news. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplan and Hale said that even if they struck sports, weather  
and advertisements from the category of total programming, the 
proportion of political coverage would still be very low. 
</P>
<P>
	Between them, Davis and Lungren raised $60 million for their  
campaigns, most of which was spent on television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could do more coverage of politics and in particular of the  
gubernatorial race,'' said Ed Chapuis, news director at KCRA-TV in 
Sacramento. ``But it's a two-way street -- we need to have more 
access to the politicians.''

<HEADLINE>  Sharpe Apologizes for Marino Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Shannon Sharpe's taunting tongue started getting  
him in trouble in elementary school. Twenty years later, it is 
still causing Denver's loquacious tight end to learn life's lessons 
the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
	After being admonished by his coach and 77-year-old grandmother,  
Sharpe offered a public apology Wednesday to Miami quarterback Dan 
Marino, whom he labeled as ``a loser'' following the Broncos' 38-3 
victory over the Dolphins in last week's AFC playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan, if I offended you, your family, your wife, your kids,  
your mother, your father, your brothers and sisters, I stand before 
you and I sincerely, sincerely apologize,'' Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you feel about me as a player, I can understand.  
Whether you like or dislike me, I can live with that. But I would 
never want you to dislike me or disrespect me as a person. ... I'm 
sure you will get this message as you have all the other messages 
that I have sent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The animosity between Sharpe and Marino began last summer when  
Sharpe was asked to compare Marino with Broncos quarterback and 
1983 NFL draft classmate John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe suggested Marino's best days are behind him by saying  
Elway ``doesn't want to be like another quarterback I won't name, 
but he's a guy who plays in the southern part of the United States 
who is no longer the player that he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino shot back in September, referring to Sharpe as  
``Stanley,'' and said Elway is the main reason Sharpe has been 
selected to seven Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Things remained quiet until last Saturday when Denver eliminated  
the Dolphins from the AFC playoffs. After the game, Sharpe walked 
into a group of reporters and declared: ``Don't ask me about Marino 
because I don't talk about losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe's comment drew criticism from Broncos coach Mike  
Shanahan, who said he was disappointed in his veteran tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Sharpe's grandmother, Mary Porter, who helped raise Sharpe,  
scolded him during a phone call earlier this week. She said 
Marino's feelings were probably hurt and that Sharpe should never 
say such mean things about anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't calling Dan Marino a loser,'' Sharpe explained  
Wednesday. ``I was saying I didn't want to talk about anybody that 
had lost the game, so therefore I didn't want to talk about Dan 
Marino or anybody else on that ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is the NFL's career passing leader with 58,913 yards and  
is sure to be a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee. Though he is 
still without a Super Bowl ring after 16 seasons, Marino's resume 
is hardly lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got misconstrued,'' Sharpe said, ``or the way I said it may  
have seemed that I was calling Dan Marino a loser, and in no shape, 
way or form would I ever do that.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Thinking About Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of opening arguments in his trial,  
President Clinton said today he intends ``to spend as little time 
thinking about'' his impeachment as possible and focus instead on 
issues facing Americans. ``I trust that the right thing will be 
done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton's lawyers told senators in a legal brief that  
they had an ``obligation to turn away an unwise and unwarranted'' 
House impeachment that threatens the American democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote the American people rendered ... is hanging in the  
balance,'' the presidential lawyers said in their trial brief, 
arguing that there are no legal, constitutional or factual grounds 
for removal of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is strong agreement among constitutional and legal  
scholars and historians that the substance of the articles does not 
amount to impeachable offenses,'' the attorneys wrote. They said 
the allegations ``do not begin to satisfy the stringent showing 
required by our Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected president 
from office, either as a matter of fact or law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke for the first time about the crisis since his  
impeachment last month: ``I think the Senate has to deal with that. 
We filed our brief today. It makes our case. The important thing 
for me is to spend as little time thinking about that as possible 
and as much time working on the issues we are here to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have their job to do in the Senate and I have mine and I  
intend to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president indicated he has no plans to address the  
impeachment matter in his State of the Union speech Jan. 19. ``I 
think the American people have heard about that quite extensively 
and my understanding is that I should do their business,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., suggested today that Clinton  
should delay his State of the Union speech ``because of the 
awkwardness'' of the timing. A number of Republicans also have 
asked him to postpone the speech, but White House officials have 
said repeatedly it will go on as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The House filed papers today that contested the White House's  
legal assertions but did not make any expansive arguments. The 
papers contended the articles of impeachment ``properly state 
impeachable offenses,'' warrant Clinton's removal from office and 
disqualification from further office and are not 
``unconstitutionally vague'' as presidential lawyers argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sent to the Senate: all the public evidence in the case,  
including prosecutor Kenneth Starr's referral, votes of the House 
Judiciary Committee in executive session, all the materials from 
the Paula Jones case, transcripts of two telephone conversations 
between Linda Tripp and her friend Lucianne Goldberg, a government 
report on Starr's expenditures, audio tapes of Tripp's recordings 
of her conversations with Monica Lewinsky and material on the House 
impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House brief acknowledged that the testimony of Clinton  
and Ms. Lewinsky differed on some matters, such as the number of 
their encounters, the date of their first intimate contact and how 
the relationship was conducted. But the brief said, ``These 
squabbles are utterly immaterial ... precisely the kind of 
disagreement that the law does not intend to capture as perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House officials indicate the impeachment case will be prosecuted  
like a conspiracy, alleging that the president schemed to keep Ms. 
Lewinsky from revealing their extramarital affair and ultimately 
plotted to ruin her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts will move from written pages to the Senate chamber  
Thursday when the House opens its presentation. There, television 
cameras will show Americans their first live presidential 
impeachment trial and record the proceedings for history. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the jurors, Lieberman, said that his colleagues can't  
ignore public opinion polls showing widespread opposition to 
Clinton's removal even as they try to judge the case impartially. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously no senator should be controlled in his or her  
decision in this trial by the public opinion polls. But I do think 
it's appropriate to take notice of them,'' Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 130-page White House brief offered a preview of the case  
that Clinton's attorneys will present in defending him against 
perjury and obstruction of justice charges in the Senate 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has an obligation to turn away an unwise and  
unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of impeachment,'' the 
president's lawyers said in their brief today. ``If the Senate 
removes this president for a wrongful relationship he hoped to keep 
private, for what will the House ask the Senate to remove the next 
president and the next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brief said that removing Clinton on the basis of the  
allegations facing him would ``substantially alter the delicate 
constitutional balance'' of power among the branches of government 
and ``move us closer to a quasi-parliamentary system in which the 
president is elected to office by the choice of the people but 
continues in office only at the pleasure of Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not simply the president -- but the vote the American  
people rendered in schools, church halls and other civic centers 
all across the land 26 months ago -- that is hanging in the 
balance,'' the lawyers said 
</P>
<P>
	The brief did not present new evidence. Instead, White House  
officials described it as the most comprehensive and detailed 
presentation to date about Clinton's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers argued that the articles of impeachment against  
Clinton ``fall far short of what the American people demand be 
shown and proven before their democratic choice is reversed.'' And 
in a slap at Starr and the House impeachment team, the brief said 
the charges ``fall far short of what a prudent prosecutor would 
require before presenting a case to a judge or jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to show a scheme to conceal the relationship and  
eventually destroy Ms. Lewinsky's reputation and credibility, the 
prosecutors plan to weave together conduct including: searching for 
a job for the former intern, hiding gifts she exchanged with 
Clinton, having her sign a false affidavit in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case against the president, possibly coaching 
presidential secretary Betty Currie and the president's making 
comments to aides that portrayed Ms. Lewinsky as the aggressor.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Polling Records Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associate Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police say confidential records were taken in  
a burglary of a prominent Democratic polling firm that is advising 
Ehud Barak, a candidate for prime minister of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Joe Gentile, a police department spokesman, said someone  
broke into the Capitol Hill offices of Greenberg Quinlan Research 
Inc. through a vent on the roof Monday night or Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will confirm that confidential records, materials and  
various items such as petty cash were taken,'' Gentile said. The 
Federal Bureau of Investigation is helping the Metropolitan Police 
Department look into the break-in. 
</P>
<P>
	People associated with the firm called it a sophisticated  
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The office had not completed an inventory Tuesday night, but  
Jeremy Rosner, vice president of the firm, said ``it does appear 
our international work was targeted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are investigating the possibility that certain records were  
targeted,'' Gentile confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gentile said police advised the FBI because of the possibly  
sensitive nature of the case. ``They are going to help us gather 
and analyze evidence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to make sure the evidence was collected as  
effectively as possible,'' FBI spokeswoman Susan Lloyd said. She 
added, however, that District of Columbia police would be leading 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Greenberg, a partner in the firm, was recently hired by  
Barak, head of Israel's opposition Labor Party and a leading 
challenger to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. James Carville, 
President Clinton's former campaign manager, also is working on the 
Barak campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, said any attempt to  
connect the prime minister's Likud party to the burglary ``is an 
absolute obscenity. There's no more basis for that than there was 
for the journalistic canard that Netanyahu is a CIA agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli elections are scheduled for May 17.  
</P>
<P>
	Barak's campaign team in Israel had no comment on the break-in  
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg was a key pollster for President Clinton during the  
1992 presidential campaign and served as a White House pollster 
until 1994. He also has worked for South African President Nelson 
Mandela and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville speculated the break-in was not the work of amateurs.  
``It wasn't some kids, but how could they be so dumb? It strikes me 
as awfully dumb but somebody did it,'' he said in a telephone 
interview today from Argentina.

<HEADLINE>  Tenn. Women's Hoops Team Still Tops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Halfway through the season, women's basketball has come full  
circle. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning, everybody was chasing Tennessee, which went  
unbeaten last year in winning its third straight national 
championship. And now? 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd still have to say people are chasing them,'' Texas Tech  
coach Marsha Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee re-established itself as the nation's premier team  
with its 92-81 victory at Connecticut last Sunday. That game moved 
the Lady Vols back to No. 1 in The Associated Press poll and again 
demonstrated how coach Pat Summitt gets her team to play its best 
in big games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tennessee's loss at Purdue in November showed the Lady Vols  
aren't perfect and gave rise to the notion that maybe, just maybe, 
someone else could win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think they're the team, but I do think they're  
vulnerable,'' television analyst Ann Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee lost this season despite returning most of the cast  
that went 39-0 a year ago, led by national player of the year 
Chamique Holdsclaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Lady Vols are a different team. Freshmen Shalon Pillow  
and Michelle Snow have come on board and three reserves from last 
season are gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you have everybody back, doesn't mean it's the  
same,'' Meyers said. ``The chemistry changes, the roles are 
different, players take on different egos. I think Pat is very much 
in control, but obviously Purdue was able to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen or so teams have shown they're good enough to win  
the national championship should Tennessee stumble in the NCAA 
tournament, which hasn't happened since the Lady Vols lost to 
Connecticut in the 1995 title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, with its talented freshmen and the inspirational  
leadership of Shea Ralph, certainly has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue isn't flashy, but in Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari  
Figgs, the Boilermakers have two savvy players to handle 
Tennessee's pressure. They also have defeated Louisiana Tech and 
their only loss was a one-pointer at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech, which lost to Tennessee in last year's  
championship game, has improved its outside shooting with the 
addition of junior-college transfer Betty Lennox and is still 
strong inside with Amanda Wilson and Arkansas transfer Shaka 
Massey. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina is undersized but still has the quickness that  
enabled the Tar Heels to nearly upset Tennessee in the regional 
finals last season. And Georgia has emerged as a national contender 
with its 14-0 record after a mediocre season a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia, led by twins Kelly and Coco Miller, will have a chance  
to find out how far it has come when it plays at Tennessee on 
Thursday night. Tennessee beat Georgia by 59 in Knoxville last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would certainly hope by year's end we will be competitive  
and make a run at the Final Four,'' Georgia coach Andy Landers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Landers feels UCLA also has a good chance to find its way to San  
Jose for the Final Four. The Bruins have four losses, but they were 
to Connecticut, at No. 9 Notre Dame, at Tennessee and to No. 12 
Duke. UCLA has won 12 of its last 14, including an 18-point victory 
over North Carolina in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think UCLA has as much talent or more talent in the front  
line than any team in the country,'' Landers said. ``If they're 
playing well at year's end, they could make a run at the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And don't forget Duke. The Blue Devils were fourth in the  
preseason poll, then tumbled after losing three of their first four 
while some key players were recovering from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've won 12 of their last 13 -- the loss was to Tennessee  
-- and shot at least 52 percent in seven straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teams that usually aren't among the elite are having big  
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15-0, Virginia Tech owns the longest Division I winning  
streak in the country. The Hokies don't face a lot of Top 25 
competition, but they have beaten Duke and Virginia and won at 
George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 8 Colorado State is 17-1 with victories over Oregon,  
Florida, Rutgers and Utah. The Rams won't see a Top 25 opponent the 
rest of the way, however, so they won't arrive at the NCAA 
tournament as well tested as some of the other highly ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Tennessee, the Lady Vols aren't where they need to be  
yet, Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has a lot of room for improvement,'' she said.  
``Certainly, we have not handled the basketball as well this year 
as we did a year ago. We have not rebounded the basketball the way 
I think we're capable of. It's been in spurts and we've played in 
spurts, so certainly we can get better.''

line than any team in the country,'' Landers said. ``If they're 
playing well at year's end, they could make a run at the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And don't forget Duke. The Blue Devils were fourth in the  
preseason poll, then tumbled after losing three of their first four 
while some key players were recovering from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've won 12 of their last 13 -- the loss was to Tennessee  
-- and shot at least 52 percent in seven straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teams that usually aren't among the elite are having big  
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15-0, Virginia Tech owns the longest Division I winning  
streak in the country. The Hokies don't face a lot of Top 25 
competition, but they have beaten Duke and Virginia and won at 
George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 8 Colorado State is 17-1 with victories over Oregon,  
Florida, Rutgers and Utah. The Rams won't see a Top 25 opponent the 
rest of the way, however, so they won't arrive at the NCAA 
tournament as well tested as some of the other highly ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Tennessee, the Lady Vols aren't where they need to be  
yet, Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has a lot of room for improvement,'' she said.  
``Certainly, we have not handled the basketball as well this year 
as we did a year ago. We have not rebounded the basketball the way 
I think we're capable of. It's been in spurts and we've played in 
spurts, so certainly we can get better.''

<HEADLINE> Missing `Doctor Who' Episode Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- A missing episode of the British  
cult TV show Doctor Who has been found in New Zealand -- and one fan 
says there may be more episodes lying around undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been one of 110 -- now 109 -- episodes of the long-running  
science-fiction classic that have been unaccounted for since the 
show was canceled by the BBC in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	In total, about 470 episodes were made about the time-traveler  
known only as Doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the New Zealand Doctor Who Fan Club, Paul Scoones,  
said Wednesday that the find -- the first reported in seven years -- 
was ``the ultimate dream of any Doctor Who fan. It's been like 
having a book with missing chapters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The black-and-white 16mm footage features the first Doctor,  
William Hartnell, and was the first in a series of four titled 
``The Crusade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film surfaced last week after Scoones and a fellow fan, Neil  
Lambess, heard rumors about it and tracked it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Grenville had bought the film at a collectors' fair about  
six months ago and had been showing it as part of his mobile movie 
screening-business, Sedang Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	Scoones said archives showed that the film was sent to The New  
Zealand Broadcasting Corp. in 1967. Where it had been since was a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means there could be more in New Zealand and people are  
completely unaware of what they have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is now with the BBC in London where it will be  
restored, copied and released on video. The BBC has sought to get 
all episodes back since the advent of video. 
</P>
<P>
	Grenville gets to keep the original print, which he hopes to  
screen in Auckland before selling it at auction.

<HEADLINE> Disney, Infoseek Launch Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With fireworks, throbbing music and an  
aggressive use of confetti, entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. and 
Internet search engine Infoseek launched the new Go Network, 
ratcheting up the competition with Yahoo!, Excite and other popular 
Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney chairman Michael Eisner and Jake Winebaum, chairman of  
Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group, said Tuesday that the features 
of Go.com and the high-profile brand names would make the site a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hellbent on not being in a railroad car as jets fly  
over us,'' said Eisner before he and Harry Motro, president of 
Infoseek pushed two oversized ``G'' and ``O'' computer keys to 
officially launch the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Go.com is an Internet ``portal,'' offering personalized news,  
entertainment and services. Using Infoseek's search technology, 
visitors will be able to search the Net as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Comprehensive Internet sites have emerged as one of the biggest  
draws for visitors to the World Wide Web. That pleases advertisers 
-- the portals' main revenue stream -- as millions of viewers 
clicking on a Web site also see the ad pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts question how Disney's new site will stand out in an  
already-crowded field. 
</P>
<P>
	David Card, a senior analyst at Jupiter Communications, an  
Internet research firm in New York, said the Go Network ``has at 
least as good a chance as anybody else'' of succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's going to take more than Disney's marketing muscle to  
survive an anticipated shakeout among the portals this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go is going to have to succeed on its own merits,'' he said.  
``If Go doesn't deliver on what people need, it won't succeed. The 
marketing won't help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Go feature is unique. So-called ``follow-me tabs'' allow  
users to quickly jump between, say, ESPN.com stories about the San 
Francisco 49ers, find Web sites about the team or chat with other 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the other guys let us have that (feature) for a couple  
of years,'' Eisner said in an interview, referring to the practice 
among Web companies of copying each other's popular features. ``But 
they won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winebaum said all of Disney's properties would pitch in to plug  
the Go Network, including mentions at the end of ABC's World News 
Tonight, ESPN's shows and games and on Disney movie posters. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney officials declined to estimate the value of free ad  
exposure the company planned to give Go, but Infoseek has agreed to 
pay Disney $165 million over five years to promote the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney last spring paid $70 million plus its interest in a Web  
development company for a 43 percent stake in Infoseek Corp., the 
nation's seventh-largest search and directory service.

	Dow Drops 200; Nasdaq Plunges 100  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than  
200 points in the first half-hour of trading today and the Nasdaq 
Composite index plunged more than 100. The Nasdaq lost 4 1/2 percent 
in less than a half-hour. Investors are struggling with storm 
clouds looming over Brazil's economy. The president of the 
country's central bank has resigned, and the Brazilian currency has 
slumped amid what appears to be a de-facto devaluation. NYSE 
decliners led advancers 10-1. The S&AMP;P 500 Index was down 12. 

</P>
<P>
	Brazil Central Bank President Resigns  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The president of Brazil's central  
bank resigned today, one day after the country's president sought 
to calm investors by pledging the nation would honor all its 
foreign debt obligations. Citing personal and professional reasons, 
the president of the country's Central Bank, Gustavo Franco, said 
he was leaving his post in a speech today in Brasilia, the capital. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Push Plan for Disabled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing a new $2  
billion, five-year budget package meant to help tens of thousands 
of disabled Americans return to work. The plan involves a 
combination of health coverage, tax credits and better 
rehabilitation services. Advocates say that health coverage -- the 
largest piece of the package -- is the No. 1 barrier that prevents 
people with disabilities from returning to the workplace. 

</P>
<P>
	Stage Set for Impeachment Drama  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial will be  
prosecuted like a conspiracy, alleging that he schemed to keep 
Monica Lewinsky from revealing their affair and ultimately plotted 
to ruin her reputation, according to legal papers and House 
officials. After the White House files its brief today, the 
strategies will move from written pages to the Senate chamber 
tomorrow when the House opens its presentation. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Pays Paula Jones $850,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paula Jones is awaiting the arrival of an  
$850,000 check from President Clinton, bringing an official end to 
the four-year saga spurred by her allegations of sexual harassment. 
Clinton mailed the settlement check to Mrs. Jones yesterday, even 
as he braced for the heaviest fallout yet from her harassment suit 
-- an impeachment trial in the Senate. To finance the settlement, 
the president drew about $375,000 from personal funds and got the 
rest, about $475,000, from an insurance policy, a White House 
official told The Associated Press.

	U.S. Planes Attack Iraq Defenses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American warplanes patrolling the ``no-fly''  
zone over northern Iraq attacked surface-to-air missile 
installations today after being targeted by Iraqi radar, U.S. 
officials said. Initial reports said at least one Iraqi missile was 
fired but missed the U.S. planes. The incident underscored an 
increasingly aggressive Iraqi challenge to the ``no-fly'' zones 
enforced by American and British planes in northern and southern 
Iraq.

	Infant's Car Death Under Investigation  
</P>
<P>
	BEAUFORT, S.C. (AP) -- A 2-month-old baby who had been missing  
for more than a week was found dead in a car pulled from a creek. 
Authorities continued looking for the girl's father and a fellow 
Marine. Quinniah Jones, her father Marine Lance Cpl. Marlon T. 
Jones and Lance Cpl. Patrick Monroe were reported missing Jan. 3 by 
family members. The baby's death appeared accidental, though 
authorities were investigating for foul play. The two marines are 
still missing.

	Gay Rights Group Criticizes Vatican  
</P>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- A gay rights group sharply criticized the  
Vatican's teachings on homosexuality today as it commemorated the 
death of a gay man who set himself on fire in St. Peter's Square a 
year ago. Arcigay, Italy's leading gay association laid a laurel 
wreath near the place where Alfredo Ormando, a 40-year-old from 
Palermo, Sicily, set himself on fire Jan. 13, 1998, to protest 
society's treatment of gays.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Eyes Global Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Global expansion, Internet growth and  
employment gains are the main goals of MCI WorldCom Inc. this year, 
the company's top executive said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The one factor that will remain constant, said Bernard J.  
Ebbers, MCI Worldcom's president and CEO, is his company's 
association with sports great Michael Jordan, who retired from pro 
basketball Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew he would not be playing basketball for 10 years when  
we entered into the agreement with him,'' said Ebbers. ``We stick 
with Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers spoke Wednesday at an economic symposium in Jackson,  
Miss., where his company is based. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international market is larger and growing faster than the  
U.S. market,'' Ebbers said. ``The greatest potential for growth is 
out of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom plans to meet the needs of its international  
customers by building a 2,000-mile fiber-optic network throughout 
Europe, Ebbers said. 
</P>
<P>
	WorldCom closed one of the nation's biggest telecommunications  
mergers by joining with MCI Communications Corp. last September. 
The merger created a colossus that provides a variety of 
telecommunications services to 22 million customers worldwide. MCI 
WorldCom is the nation's second-largest long-distance provider 
behind AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to expand the capability of our network,''  
Ebbers said. ``We are very excited about the Internet 
capabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most mergers usually result in layoffs, that will not  
be the case with MCI WorldCom, Ebbers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expect a net increase growth of 8,000 people per year over the  
next several years,'' Ebbers said.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Not Intimidated by Vikings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Ray Buchanan is sleeping just fine this  
week. No, he hasn't suffered any nightmares about the prospect of 
lining up across from Randy Moss in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take a butter knife out on the field,'' Buchanan,  
the Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl cornerback, said Wednesday. ``If I 
cut him and he bleeds, that let's you know this man is human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Buchanan was being facetious. No knives will be  
allowed Sunday at the Metrodome, though it might be the only 
effective way to halt the seemingly unstoppable Minnesota offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings set an NFL record with 556 points during the regular  
season, then blew out Arizona 41-21 in a divisional playoff game 
last week. They have an endless supply of weapons that only begin 
with Moss, the NFC's rookie of the year with 69 receptions for 
1,313 yards and 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	There's NFC offensive player of the year Randall Cunningham, who  
threw for 3,704 yards and 34 TDs in a remarkable comeback season. 
There's Cris Carter, who had a team-high 78 receptions for 1,011 
yards and 12 scores. There's Robert Smith, who rushed for 1,187 
yards. There's an offensive line that features Pro Bowlers Todd 
Steussie, Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy. There's return 
specialist David Palmer, who lines up all over the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we're going to stop them,'' Falcons coach Dan  
Reeves said. ``What we're hoping to do is contain them, come up 
with a key play here and there to slow them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if there was ever a team capable of beating the Vikings,  
it's the Falcons. They have a punishing runner in Jamal Anderson 
and a close-to-the-vest offense that led the league in time of 
possession. They don't make many mistakes, either, also leading the 
NFL in turnover margin with a plus-20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest factor is going out there and letting them  
know they're not going to be throwing the ball all over the 
place,'' said Michael Booker, the other cornerback. ``They're not 
going to have that much time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Vikings averaged nearly 35 points per game, no team  
scored that many in even one game against the Falcons. They allowed 
just 18 points per game -- fourth-lowest in the NFL -- and ranked 
second in run defense and eighth in fewest yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the history of Atlanta, the defense has always been kind of  
the stepchild,'' end Lester Archambeau said. ``This is a different 
year. Our defense is respected now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, safety Eugene Robinson and linebacker Jessie Tuggle  
were voted to the Pro Bowl, and someone from the defensive line 
probably should have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great players and great defenses love great challenges,'' said  
Archambeau, who led the team with a career-high 10 sacks. 
``Everybody is excited about going up there and showing Minnesota 
and the rest of the country what kind of defense we really are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who had a team-high seven interceptions, spent most of  
the season lining up against the other teams' top receivers. But 
the Falcons aren't saying how they plan to stop Moss, Carter, 
Cunningham and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Buchanan lines up one-on-one against Moss. Or, more  
likely, the Falcons assign Booker and safety Eugene Robinson to 
double Moss and let Buchanan work solo against Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray can hold his own with anyone, so whoever Ray's on, we  
won't have to double,'' Booker said. ``If I'm on Moss, we'll 
probably double Moss and let Ray go over and freestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though seven inches shorter than Moss, the 5-foot-9 Buchanan  
clearly wants a chance to defend him at least a few times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm licking my chops a little bit. This is the opportunity of  
a lifetime,'' he said. ``Everybody has put this guy on a high 
pedestal. I don't want to take anything away from him. He's done 
something that's been great for the NFL. But for a defensive back, 
to get a chance to compete against somebody like this, you want to 
seize the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's coverage skills have allowed the Falcons to diversify  
their defense, providing greater latitude for blitzes and multiple 
coverage schemes involving the other defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't be where we are without Ray,'' Reeves said. ``He's  
done a great job against some great receivers. A lot of times, the 
size has definitely not been in his favor. He goes against guys who 
are a lot bigger. He battles them and comes up with some big 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan and the rest of the defense will need to come up with a  
few more Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Gold As an Investment?! / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gold is probably the last choice that  
performance-minded investors would consider these days. It keeps 
going nowhere, as they say, while some Internet stocks zoom 50 
times in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the idea of buying gold is scorned by new-age investors  
as a cultural lag from a more primitive time, a relic in a world 
that has outgrown its fear of the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	But quietly, and with little of the commotion and promotion that  
accompanies high-tech stocks, investors with more prudent 
aspirations have been loading up on gold bullion coins, and making 
money doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the 1998 Collectors Universe, which monitors  
prices, a $1,000 investment in a basket of generic or common gold 
coins in 1970 would now have an average market value of close to 
$22,500. 
</P>
<P>
	While that doesn't approach the two-year gains of Internet  
stocks such as Amazon.com -- which soared from $2.62 1/2 a share in 
1997 to $185 recently -- it represents a 15 percent annual return 
versus a 60-year average 11 percent for stocks in general. 
</P>
<P>
	More recent buyers of selected gold items have been doing even  
better, as quiet, insistent demand pushes up prices. Most of that 
demand is from small, savvy investors who doubt the staying power 
of the high-flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Obscuring the phenomenon is that widely published prices for  
what might be called industrial gold show only limited movement. 
The action is mainly in rare, mint state, collectible legal tender 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Rarity and mint state, or quality, have enormous impact, enough  
to raise the market value of that 1970 investment to nearly 
$87,000. And still another vital factor is exemption from possible 
confiscation. 
</P>
<P>
	Most U.S. legal tender gold coins minted after 1986 may be  
seized by the government in a national emergency. However, 
post-1986 gold and silver proof (top quality), coins cannot be 
confiscated, and thus are especially attractive for Individual 
Retirement Accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	While gold is the star, silver too has taken on a shine. A bag  
of pre-1964 junk silver coins with a face value of $1,000 could be 
purchased for $3,600 six months ago. It might cost $5,100 today. 
</P>
<P>
	There are literally hundreds of numismatic dealers in every  
state of the country, some very large, such as Blanchard &AMP; Co., New 
Orleans; Investment Rarities, Minneapolis; and Lear Financial, 
Santa Monica, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The business can be an intricate one, however, and investors  
shouldn't jump into the market as uninformed stock market investors 
have been doing. Almost any library has a good book or two on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent of them, ``The Bulls, the Bear and the Bust,''  
by Kevin DeMerit, Lear Financial's president, provides details on 
what to buy, how to store it, how to fit it into an IRA, and how to 
sell. He offers it free. 
</P>
<P>
	The beauty of gold, silver and other precious metals, he and  
others in the trade sometimes point out, is that the supply is 
limited by Mother Nature and may become more so when stressed 
economies quit selling. 
</P>
<P>
	You really can't say that about stocks. Why, you can't even say  
that about dollar bills so long as the printing presses remain 
oiled. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rose Thursday morning as a  
weaker Japanese currency boosted confidence in stocks. The dollar 
was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 172.16 points, or 1.28 percent,  
to 13,575.76 points at the end of the morning session. On 
Wednesday, the index gained 42.63 points, or 0.32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.58 yen in late morning, up 2.03 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher from its level of 113.33 
yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, dollar gains against the yen helped restore  
confidence in the performance of export-oriented companies, pushing 
their share prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in large exporters had taken a beating in recent days as  
the value of the yen soared. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive  
abroad and cuts into profits earned overseas. Lower earnings by 
exporters could hamper efforts to jump-start Japan's 
recession-plagued economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japan's central bank jumped into markets to support the  
dollar on Tuesday, driving the yen back down. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, after sliding from a high of more than 147 yen in  
August to a 28-month low on Monday, rose more than 4 yen on the 
back of the surprise intervention.

	Traders said a drop on Wall Street amid news that Brazil would  
widen the trading band for its currency had little effect on Tokyo 
markets.

	``The currency markets are stable, and Japanese share prices are  
already at low levels,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager in 
the stock division at Chuo Securities. ``The direct impact of the 
Brazil move is not great.''

<HEADLINE> Nortel To Lay Off As Many As 8,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Northern Telecom, Canada's largest high-tech  
company, said Wednesday it will close plants and eliminate up to 
8,000 jobs in the next three years as it restructures to focus on 
Internet-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has 80,000 employees worldwide, said it is  
shifting its focus from standard telephone equipment to 
cutting-edge voice and data networks using Internet technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive John Roth said Nortel, which now makes most of  
its own products, will become a so-called systems house, bringing 
together customers with more outside contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	He said consolidating operations and farming out more duties to  
outside suppliers would giving its own engineers more time to focus 
on developing software. 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel has six plants in Canada and 18 others in the United  
States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of some plants, retraining and attrition ``will  
minimize employee impact,'' the company said. However, Roth made it 
clear that an undetermined number of employees will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``All 24 plants are under study, but we know we'll need less  
than 24, for sure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization is expected to save the company up to $300  
million over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel has enjoyed significant growth in its wireless division,  
owing mainly to its decision to invest heavily in the digital 
cellular phone market. Last year, it acquired California-based Bay 
Networks for $7.1 billion, the first merger joining major producers 
of voice and data network technology in a single company. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Telecom had 1997 revenues of $15.5 billion. Bay  
Networks, its wholly owned subsidiary, had revenues of $2.4 billion 
during its most recent fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Republican Sums Up Impeachment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican given the task of summing up  
the House's case against President Clinton today spent hours 
digesting the mountains of documents produced by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr and has a commanding grasp of the material. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Rep. James Sensenbrenner also is a space enthusiast, a  
Green Bay Packers fan and a winner of the National Taxpayer's Union 
Taxpayers' Friend Award for 18 years straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner, one of 13 House members acting as prosecutors  
during Clinton's impeachment trial, said he spent several days 
writing his statement. He wrote some of it while sitting on the 
floor of his home watching the Packers lose to the San Francisco 
49ers earlier this month in a National Football League playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not done by staff. It is not done by a ghost writer,''  
Sensenbrenner said. ``Speeches written by committee are awful. This 
is me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner, 55, an attorney, represents a Wisconsin  
congressional district that includes suburban Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his sometimes biting conservative rhetoric, he began  
his first term in January 1979 after serving 10 years in the 
Wisconsin Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner is a favorite of the National Taxpayers Union,  
which says he is one of the few members of Congress who have won 
its Taxpayers' Friend Award every year since it began awarding it 
in 1979 to lawmakers who vote to reduce or hold the line on 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 awards have not been announced yet, ``but I can't  
imagine that he would not continue this kind of fine performance,'' 
group spokesman Pete Sepp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberal American Civil Liberties Union, on the other hand,  
gave Sensenbrenner a zero rating this year for voting against its 
stands on legislation dealing with juvenile justice, abortion, flag 
burning and whether to support an Alabama judge who posted the Ten 
Commandments on his courtroom wall despite a higher court's ruling 
that it was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also known as the millionaire congressman who won a  
$250,000 jackpot from the District of Columbia lottery in December 
1997. He said he carried the winning ticket around in his billfold 
for two weeks before remembering to have it checked. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner was one of Clinton's sternest critics on the House  
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the House Science Committee, he called on the  
Clinton administration and NASA last year to more swiftly repair 
problems with the ever more costly international space station 
before support for it erodes in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Riley Could Never Beat Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pat Riley spent nearly a decade as coach, first in  
New York and then in Miami, trying to dethrone Michael Jordan. He 
never succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan retiring Wednesday, Riley said it will gnaw at him  
knowing he never could beat the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I lay my head down on the pillow at night, I'll know  
there was one guy I never had a chance to beat,'' Riley said 
outside the Heat's practice facility. ``It doesn't look like I'll 
get another chance. That bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley himself owns five championship rings -- one fewer than  
Jordan -- but those came coaching the Los Angeles Lakers, just 
before Jordan rose to greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	Since moving to the Eastern Conference in 1991, Riley's teams  
have been eliminated by the Bulls four times -- twice with New York 
and twice with the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks did reach the NBA Finals in 1994, but that was the  
year Jordan was playing baseball. Preparing to face Jordan on the 
court brought only frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``When winning and losing was on the line, there was nobody  
better,'' Riley said. ``He had a great team around him, had a great 
coach in Phil Jackson. But when it came down to deciding a game, 
you pretty much knew it would come down to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Jordan's final 17 seconds as an NBA player -- his steal  
and jumper that beat Utah in Game 6 of last year's NBA Finals -- 
became the centerpiece of the motivational speeches Riley gives to 
business executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a statue in the NBA offices today of that  
follow-through on that last shot,'' Riley said. ``You could write a 
book on that alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's relationship with Jordan through the years often was  
strained. The coach occasionally referred to Jordan as ``His 
Highness'' and once ripped Jordan for refusing to shake Alonzo 
Mourning's hand before Game 5 of the 1997 Eastern Conference 
finals. Jordan had taken offense to Mourning elbowing Scottie 
Pippen the previous game. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bulls eliminated Miami in that series, Jordan swung an  
imaginary golf club as a sendoff into Riley's offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, however, there was only admiration from Riley.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was a nightmare to play against, but he brought you a sense  
of urgency, a feeling of being totally alive,'' Riley said. ``I 
always looked forward to preparing against his team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said someone eventually would come along to inherit  
Jordan's legacy. He wasn't sure, though, just how long that would 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the laws of being a leader is to find somebody to  
succeed him,'' Riley said. ``I'm not sure that's the case with 
Michael. I don't know if anybody can succeed him.''

<HEADLINE> Experts Chime In on Medicare Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising Medicare's eligibility age to 67 would  
increase the number of Americans without health insurance by at 
least 800,000, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Implausibly large increases in employment would be needed to  
offset the expected declines in coverage,'' said Columbia 
University researchers Sherry Glied and Mark Stabile in a study 
published in the public policy journal, Health Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly raising Medicare's eligibility age from 65 to 67 is one  
option being seriously considered by a bipartisan commission 
looking at Medicare reforms. That would be the same as an 
incremental increase in the eligibility age for Social Security 
benefits that is already set to affect people now younger than 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents say that older Americans are healthier than ever  
before and raising the bar for retirement benefits would encourage 
them to work longer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the study, based on Census data, projected that if  
recent declines in health benefits offered by companies to older 
workers and retirees continue, increases in the ranks of the 
uninsured would be virtually unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if 50 percent more people aged 65 to 67 keep working full  
time -- ``an implausibly high figure,'' the researchers said -- 
800,000 people who would otherwise have been covered by Medicare 
would be left without health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is expected this year to revive a proposal to  
let people as young as 55 pay $300 to $400 a month to buy insurance 
from Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the study predicts that many of the new uninsured will  
be Americans who work in low-income jobs without benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group is unlikely to be able to pay actuarially fair  
premiums for Medicare coverage,'' said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a group of private experts say lawmakers are partly  
to blame for Medicare's problems because they have not provided 
enough money to run the health insurance program for the elderly 
efficiently and without fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the difficulties that threaten to cripple (Medicare)  
stem from an unwillingness of both Congress and the Clinton 
administration to provide the agency the resources and 
administrative flexibility necessary to carry out its mammoth 
assignment,'' 14 experts wrote in a letter to Congress and Clinton, 
also published in Health Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Signatories included John Rother, public policy director for the  
American Association of Retired Persons; one of Medicare's public 
trustees, Marilyn Moon; and Gail Wilensky, chairman of a panel of 
private experts who advise Congress on Medicare payment rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has included $154 million more for Medicare  
administration in its latest budget, and has also provided 
additional money to fight fraud in recent years. Still, just 1 
percent to 2 percent of the program's $200 billion annual budget is 
provided for management. 
</P>
<P>
	``No private health insurer ... would ever attempt to manage  
such a large and complex insurance program with so small an 
administrative budget,'' the experts wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare's reserves got an unexpected $1.6 billion boost last  
year, Treasury Department reports show. But much of that surplus 
has already been spent, and the program is still expected to use up 
its reserves and face cash shortages as the nation's huge baby boom 
generation retires.

<HEADLINE> GOP Ties Larry Flynt to White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An outspoken House impeachment manager  
targeted by Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt says the 
investigation into his 1986 divorce is just an attempt to divert 
attention from the Senate trial of President Clinton that begins 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who was the first member of the House to  
advocate Clinton's impeachment, said in a CNN interview Tuesday 
night that he has no intention of resigning or withdrawing from the 
impeachment case in the wake of Flynt's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do the honorable thing and present the case that  
I've been elected to present in the Senate,'' said Barr, who is one 
of 13 so-called managers who will prosecute Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt on Monday released an affidavit from Barr's former wife --  
the publisher admits he paid her for the affidavit -- in which she 
said she believed he was having an affair in the mid-1980s with a 
woman who is now his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Vogel Barr, who was divorced from the congressman in 1986,  
based the allegation largely on sworn statements Barr and his 
present wife gave during the divorce proceedings in which both 
refused to answer questions about their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr's ex-wife also said in the affidavit that Barr did not try  
to discourage her from having an abortion in 1983. Barr, who 
switched his views from abortion rights to anti-abortion during an 
unsuccessful 1992 campaign for the Senate, said in a statement he 
``never suggested, urged, forced or encouraged anyone to have an 
abortion.'' He also said he had never perjured himself in a court 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very clearly an effort to take old documents, old  
matters 12 years old, and try and derail to some extent, or divert 
attention to some extent from the trial in the Senate,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in his  
efforts to hide his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former 
White House intern. Barr said he and Clinton faced the same three 
options in their depositions: tell the truth, assert a privilege 
under law or lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``One difference between Bill Clinton and I is that he chose  
that last one; he lied,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr and other Republicans suggested Tuesday that the White  
House was a party to Flynt's attempt to paint Barr as a hypocrite, 
but they offered no proof and both the White House and Flynt denied 
any connection. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson, who is chairman of the Republican National  
Committee, said James Carville, one of President Clinton's longtime 
supporters, may be the link between Flynt and the White House. 
Carville had a small acting part in a recent movie about Flynt. 
</P>
<P>
	``When General Carville declared war on the president's enemies,  
private Flynt enlisted,'' said Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville denied any involvement with Flynt and said he hasn't  
spoken to him in over a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything to do with it,'' he said. ``I think it's  
stupid to look into people's sex lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called Nicholson's suggestion  
``an absolutely baseless charge'' and Republicans should produce 
evidence to back their charges ``or knock it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point,'' said Lockhart, ``there ought to be a price to  
pay for making baseless charges and practicing the politics of 
innuendo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton repeatedly has denounced the ``politics of  
personal destruction.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Continues Mideast Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTNIEL, West Bank (AP) -- One Palestinian was killed and another  
wounded in a shootout that also left two Israelis injured, one 
seriously, near the West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli media and 
hospital officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel radio said three Palestinians fired on a group of  
Israelis who returned fire. In the exchange, one Palestinian was 
killed, one wounded and the third fled. Both Israelis were 
evacuated by military helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Batia Korash, a spokeswoman at Soroka hospital in the southern  
city of Beersheba, said a 24-year-old Israeli was in very serious 
condition and 29-year-old was being treated for hand wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli army did not release any details of the incident.  
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of soldiers and security personnel swarmed the area  
shortly after the shooting and blocked it off. Shots could be heard 
in the forest around the intersection where Israeli soldiers were 
reportedly chasing the third Palestinian. Soldiers also took up 
positions along the highway. Israeli army helicopters with search 
lights combed the area from above. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian police also set up roadblocks and were searching  
vehicles at one end of the highway, which leads into Palestinian 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, dozens of Palestinians who had gathered for late  
night prayers as part of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan attacked 
Israeli police with stones in the walled Old City of Jerusalem. 
Police said 21 were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's shooting, which occurred around 10:00 p.m.  
Wednesday, came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was continuing 
efforts to push the U.S.-brokered Wye peace memorandum forward. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday, Ross 
planned to talk with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and 
Mohammed Dahlan, the head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip, 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also scheduled to talk with Israeli President Ezer  
Weizman. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations are at a low point. The  
Wye land-for-security deal brokered by the United States in October 
was frozen by Israel, who accused Yasser Arafat's Palestinian 
Authority of violating the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's shooting happened at Otniel junction, which leads to  
the Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron, army radio said. The 
Jewish settlement of Otniel is a mile east of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, two Israeli soldiers were ambushed at the same  
location, apparently by Palestinian assailants who then fled to 
Palestinian-controlled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, gunmen fired two dozen bullets at a passing  
Israeli van in the tensely divided city of Hebron, wounding two 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Netanyahu told Ross that the Palestinian Authority's  
conduct was the reason for the lack of progress in the peace 
accords. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu has backed down from a promised troop withdrawal from  
the West Bank, arguing that the Palestinians violated the accord by 
failing to contain -- and in some cases, inciting -- anti-Israel 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians deny the charges and say that Netanyahu has  
frozen the process because he faces a tough campaign for 
re-election on May 17th, and wishes to appease hawkish voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel presented Ross yesterday with a list of 13 points that  
need to be fulfilled by the Palestinians, senior Netanyahu aide 
David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israel can't and will not withdraw according to the Wye  
agreement until these demands are properly fulfilled.'' Bar-Illan 
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Machine' Crafted Out of DNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have used strands of DNA to build a moving part, a  
step toward tiny ``machines'' that could someday be used to 
construct computer circuits and clear clogged blood vessels in the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The bending, hinge-like part is just four-ten-thousandths of the  
width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time scientists have turned chemical  
compounds into moving parts, but previous examples have been 
hampered by their floppiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA device is particularly rigid, lead researcher Nadrian  
Seeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The device was made by joining two double-stranded DNA spirals  
with a bridge of DNA. When it's exposed to a particular chemical 
solution, part of the structure bends. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were reported in today's issue of the journal  
Nature by Seeman and colleagues at New York University. The team 
hopes to eventually build other moving parts using DNA, including 
``arms'' and ``fingers'' that someday could be mounted on a 
micro-robot. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is the latest twist in the fledgling field of  
nanotechnology, or technology at an atomic scale. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very beautiful demonstration of construction at that  
scale of a device that's actually functioning,'' said Daniel 
Colbert of Rice University's Center for Nanoscale Science and 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Colbert said scientists are still decades away from  
creating any useful machines in nanotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of in the children's playtime toddler era of doing  
this. We've been thrown some blocks and Legos and Tinker Toys,'' he 
said. ``We're just kind of picking them up and trying to assemble 
things out of them that can perform something useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	K. Eric Drexler of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing in  
Los Altos, Calif., agreed that Seeman's device is too cumbersome to 
be useful. But he said further development may lead to a practical 
device.

<HEADLINE> Winter Precautions for Older People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Winter is a time of spare beauty. But poetic  
snowfalls, frozen landscapes and icy conditions are also health 
hazards, especially for older people. 
</P>
<P>
	By taking certain precautions, you can diminish winter health  
risks and greatly enjoy the serenity of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bone fractures caused by falls are one of the most common  
wintertime health risks for the elderly. Slippery conditions and 
heavy, awkward clothing cause many spills in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bone fragility associated with aging can turn a minor tumble  
into a serious fracture. The most common fractures among the 
elderly are the wrist fractures caused when a hand is used to break 
a fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hip fractures also may occur and can lead to long-term  
difficulty walking and to reduced independence. 
</P>
<P>
	To prevent wintertime falls, wear flat shoes with good treads.  
Also, remember that bulky clothing makes walking more difficult and 
the loss of balance more likely. Dress as comfortably as possible 
to maximize mobility. 
</P>
<P>
	The best precaution against falls is to avoid going out in nasty  
weather, especially during and following storms. Keep extra food 
and supplies at home. 
</P>
<P>
	If an outing is necessary, ask someone to help and do not carry  
heavy bags or packages. Use great caution when driving and beware 
of ``black ice,'' thin sheets of ice that are not easily visible 
and that often collect on roads after rains and snow plowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart attack caused by lifting heavy objects such as snow-filled  
shovels is another wintertime health risk. Older people with heart 
disease should absolutely avoid snow shoveling and other strenuous 
acts such as pushing a neighbor's car out of a snow drift. 
</P>
<P>
	If you venture out in chilly weather, wear a hat and gloves.  
Body heat loss is greatest at the head and hands because blood flow 
is greatest in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, be aware that the elderly have a decreased sensitivity  
toward the cold. Prolonged periods of exposure to the cold can 
cause older people to lose too much body heat, develop hypothermia 
and go into cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, keep the house or apartment nice and warm to avoid any  
risk of hypothermia. If heating bills are a concern, contact the 
local utility about possible special rates for older people. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, exercise common sense during wintertime. Watching a  
snowfall through a window may provide as much pleasure as taking a 
walk through the flakes.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Strategies Emerge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In emerging impeachment trial strategies,  
House prosecutors will allege the president schemed to keep Monica 
Lewinsky from revealing their affair while the White House will 
contend the managers built their case by intentionally 
mischaracterizing the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides use the same grand jury testimony and other  
evidence to reach their opposite conclusions. That result is 
possible because witnesses often gave testimony that was 
contradictory or, at best, fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some of the key points and counterpoints of the  
arguments: 
</P>
<P>
 *THE JOB SEARCH 
</P>
<P>
	THE HOUSE: The attempt by Clinton friend Vernon Jordan, with the  
president's blessing, to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York went 
nowhere until after Dec. 5, 1997, when she was named as a potential 
witness in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by the witness list, and a Dec. 11 order by the Jones  
trial judge that could subject Ms. Lewinsky to a deposition, Jordan 
met with her that day and suddenly began calling corporate 
executives and obtaining interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	THE WHITE HOUSE: The search began long before Ms. Lewinsky's  
involvement in the Jones case, and the testimony of all involved 
revealed no connection between the job assistance and the Jones 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 11 meeting between Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan was arranged  
only after presidential secretary Betty Currie and Ms. Lewinsky 
called him about the job efforts. The president had nothing to do 
with the Lewinsky-Jordan meeting, and it had already taken place by 
the time of the court order. 
</P>
<P>
 *THE GIFTS 
</P>
<P>
	THE HOUSE: Ms. Lewinsky recalled Clinton telling her Dec. 28,  
1997, to let him ``think about'' what should be done with the gifts 
they exchanged, which were under subpoena in the Jones case. Later 
that day, Ms. Lewinsky recalled, Mrs. Currie telephoned her to ask 
whether Ms. Lewinsky had ``something to give me.'' The secretary 
later arrived at Ms. Lewinsky's apartment to pick up the items. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Currie's cell phone record corroborates Ms. Lewinsky,''  
the House brief said, concluding the only logical scenario was that 
the president asked his secretary to retrieve the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	THE WHITE HOUSE: Ms. Lewinsky made the statement at one point  
that Clinton wanted to think about the gifts. But the House side 
ignored numerous other occasions when she testified that Clinton 
had no reaction to her question of what should be done with the 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also ignored Mrs. Currie's testimony that it was Ms.  
Lewinsky who called her about the gifts, not the other way around. 
Also, Ms. Lewinsky said she turned over the gifts to Mrs. Currie 
about 2 p.m. Dec. 28, 1 1/2 hours before records show a 
Currie-to-Lewinsky cell phone call from Mrs. Currie's phone. 
</P>
<P>
 *THE FALSE AFFIDAVIT 
</P>
<P>
	THE HOUSE: On Jan. 8, 1998, the day after Ms. Lewinsky signed an  
affidavit denying an affair, she had an interview with 
MacAndrews&AMP;Forbes Holdings Inc. in New York arranged by Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ms. Lewinsky told Jordan the interview went poorly, the  
president's friend called the company's chairman, Ronald Perelman. 
More interviews were conducted and Ms. Lewinsky was offered a job 
with the company's Revlon subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Perelman testified that Jordan ``had never called him before  
about a job recommendation.'' Jordan contended he had done so, to 
recommend hiring a former mayor of New York, a ``very talented'' 
attorney, a Harvard business school graduate and Ms. Lewinsky. Her 
``qualifications do not compare'' with the three others, the House 
brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	THE WHITE HOUSE: The president never suggested to Ms. Lewinsky  
she should file a false affidavit and never told her what to say. 
Ms. Lewinsky said on several occasions the president never asked 
her to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ms. Lewinsky and the president testified that they believed  
a truthful, limited affidavit might establish that Ms. Lewinsky had 
nothing relevant to offer to the Jones lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 *THE TALK WITH MRS. CURRIE 
</P>
<P>
	THE HOUSE: The president tried to coach Mrs. Currie when he  
called her into work Sunday, Jan. 18 -- the day after his Jones 
deposition. He asked questions that made it appear he wanted her to 
agree with him, such as: ``You were always there when Monica was 
there, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	THE WHITE HOUSE: Coach her for what testimony? Mrs. Currie was  
not scheduled at the time to be a witness in the Jones case. She 
did become a witness before prosecutor Kenneth Starr's grand jury, 
but Clinton could not have known yet that Starr would be 
investigating the Lewinsky affair. Also, Mrs. Currie testified she 
did not perceive any pressure to agree with the president's 
statements.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Last Shot a Memorable One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He held his follow-through for an extra second or two after the  
ball swished through the basket, as if relishing what he knew would 
be his final shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan's championship-winning bucket against the Utah  
Jazz in Game 6 last season was one of his most memorable shots in a 
13-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last 17 seconds as an NBA player, Jordan stole the show.  
</P>
<P>
	Utah was ahead 86-85 and Karl Malone had the ball as he tried to  
back up toward the basket against Dennis Rodman. But Jordan sneaked 
up behind Malone and swatted the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan grabbed it and dribbled upcourt as Bryon Russell shadowed  
him. Jordan faked a drive, sending Russell to the floor, and pulled 
up near the top of the key for the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-footer swished through with 5.2 seconds left, giving  
Chicago an 87-86 lead and Jordan an opportunity for a classic pose. 
Except Jordan says he really wasn't posing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting tired and I guess the lessons that you learn  
over the years is stick with that shot a little longer, make sure 
you get that extra little bit,'' Jordan said Wednesday at the news 
conference to announce his retirement. ``And that was my thinking, 
was to make sure that I extend and do the necessary fundamentals to 
get the ball to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out to look as if I was posing for all the  
photographers, but that was not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Jordan's basket, John Stockton's desperation shot at the  
buzzer bounced off the rim. The Bulls had their sixth title and 
Jordan could leave the game the way he played it -- as a champion.

<HEADLINE> Brister Makes Most of Second Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The feel-good story of the 1998 NFL season has  
been the aging, washed-up quarterbacks who scramble off the scrap 
heap, dust off the cobwebs and reinvent themselves as stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Cunningham, Vinny Testaverde, Doug Flutie and Bubby  
Brister all helped their teams reach the playoffs. Three of them 
are still in the race for the Super Bowl, and two of them -- 
Testaverde and Brister -- will be on opposite sidelines when the New 
York Jets meet the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in Chris Chandler, a vagabond who played for five teams in  
nine seasons before finding a home in Atlanta in 1997, and it has 
been a good year to be reborn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we're like fine wine, we get better with age,'' said  
Brister, the Broncos' backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The careers of Brister and Minnesota's Cunningham fell so far  
that both were out of football completely in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've been gone from the game, I think you appreciate it  
more,'' Brister said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he, Cunningham and Testaverde have all benefited  
enormously from landing with quality teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found ourselves in great systems with great players around  
us,'' he Brister said. ``If we had come back to play for the Saints 
or somebody else that's not having such a great year, we might not 
have been so good. I'm just glad I got a chance to experience this 
before my day is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After playing sparingly for the Broncos in 1997, Brister emerged  
as a competent backup to John Elway when the latter suffered 
hamstring, back and rib injuries this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, 36, started four games this season -- all victories. In  
another, he engineered a 34-17 comeback win over Oakland in relief 
of Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been here, it's like I've died and gone to football  
heaven,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister has seen the dark side, too. That happened in 1995 when  
he played for the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``As bad as it gets,'' he said in describing the 3-13 campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	Brister started four games in the middle of the season, with  
modest results, sharing quarterback duties with Boomer Esiason and 
Glenn Foley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty frustrating at the time, thinking free agency  
was coming into play and (coach Rich) Kotite was moving to New York 
and I knew the system and we had the money to get players, and then 
we didn't,'' Brister said. ``It's frustrating when you're back 
there holding the ball and you know you really don't have the 
players to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt sorry for Esiason that year. He got killed. And Foley  
got killed. I was just happy I could run a little bit or I probably 
would have gotten killed, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a lot of discipline on the team. Things got out  
of hand there for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets went 1-3 in the four games Brister started, and in his  
last start, chaos erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Jets trailing 3-0, Brister was benched in favor of  
Foley, who then injured a shoulder. Kotite told Brister to re-enter 
the game, but he declined. Brister said Esiason also declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Kotite, `You benched me, I'm in the back of the  
line,''' Brister said. ``If he's stupid enough to bench me when 
it's 3-0, I'm stupid enough to say I'm not going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident, and the season, could have been a career-killer,  
and, indeed, Brister found no demand for his services in 1996. 
Brister spent the year at home, even as the Jets limped to a 1-15 
record and surely could have used him. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Bill Parcells in 1997, and the Jets' revival began.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got some friends on that team like Mo Lewis and Marvin  
Jones,'' Brister said, ``and I'm happy to see that they've rebuilt 
their program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister rebuilt his own career, thanks to a recommendation to  
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan from linebacker Bill Romanowski, who 
had played with the quarterback in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought my career might be over,'' he said. ``But I felt  
like I could still run and throw and could help somebody win. I 
wanted to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to play anywhere but here, really. I had a  
feeling they had a chance to win a Super Bowl. I was really hoping 
I'd get to land here, and it worked out.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Says Goodbye Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan couldn't say goodbye without one  
last tiny, tantalizing tidbit of hope for everyone who thought it 
was a little too early for the greatest athlete in the world to 
call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	Declaring himself ``99.9 percent'' retired, Jordan bid farewell  
Wednesday to the Chicago Bulls, the NBA and the game that made him 
the quintessential superstar and a millionaire many times over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never say never, but it's 95, 99.9 percent,'' Jordan said.  
``I'm very secure with my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's just not 100 percent sure that this retirement, his second,  
will be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's hedge was about the only unexpected event to transpire  
at his retirement press conference, which was held at center court 
of the arena where his No. 23 was once again raised to the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan sat alongside his wife, Juanita, with commissioner David  
Stern and Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf flanking him, and kept his 
poise and composure except for the brief moment when his eyes got 
watery watching his number being re-retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was coming, so I'm happy that I chose to walk away  
knowing I can still play the game,'' Jordan said. ``And that's 
exactly how I've always wanted my career to end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he is content with his accomplishments and his place in  
the game and is looking forward to a new life, Jordan noted that 
the NBA will go on without him -- even though he knows there will 
never be another one like him. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took a few parting shots at many of his rivals, saying  
the likes of Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Karl Malone will 
never have the satisfaction of saying they won a championship while 
Jordan was playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I was so glad that Magic (Johnson) played and  
(Larry) Bird played when I won my titles, because I had to go 
through Boston and L.A.,'' he said. ``They won't be able to live 
with themselves because they never beat Michael Jordan, and I will 
always hold that in high regard when I see those guys socially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the younger generation, he said none of them could match  
what he accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	And he wasn't only talking about the six championships, five MVP  
awards, 10 scoring titles and the endless accolades. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be a Grant Hill, you can be an Anfernee Hardaway, you  
can be a Kobe Bryant, but Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan looked dapper as always, wearing a dark blue suit and a  
gold earring dangling from his left lobe. The only thing that 
looked out of place was the bandage wrapped around his right index 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he severed a tendon while cutting a cigar, an injury  
that needs surgery and would have sidelined him for the first two 
months of the season had he not retired. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury had no bearing on his decision, which he said he made  
several months ago, but waited to announce until the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, I'm exhausted. I don't feel I have a challenge.  
Physically, I feel great,'' the 35-year-old Jordan said. ``This is 
a perfect time for me to walk away from the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there was any chance at all that he might one day  
change his mind, Jordan couldn't completely turn his back on the 
game that turned him into a worldwide icon and made him a 
millionaire many times over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-nine point-nine is as you read it. It's not really 100  
percent, but it's close. So that's where I stand. I'm not going to 
say `never, never.' I'll say 99.9. Take it for what it's worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed on why he wouldn't say 100 percent, Jordan shot back:  
``Because it's my 1 percent and not yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who has three children, said he looked forward to being  
a parent and would ``live vicariously through my kids,'' whether or 
not they played basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life will take a change,'' said Jordan, adding that he also  
will tend to his many business interests. He made an estimated $45 
million a year from endorsements as a player, although that number 
could shrink if he stays away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	He prefaced his retirement remarks with words of condolence for  
the family of a Chicago police officer who was killed in the line 
of duty, then went on to thank Stern and Reinsdorf for the chance 
to play a game he so loved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about saying two words -- `I'm gone' -- but I owe the  
fans and the media more than that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough. I'm doing a good job of trying to hold back the  
emotions because it's like taking away something that I truly have 
loved. I started when I was 12 years old, I'm 36 next month, so for 
24 years I've been playing the game. It's sad that I'm leaving the 
game, but it's happy because my life is starting to go into a whole 
other stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added his wife: ``I see Michael doing a lot more carpooling.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan became emotional as his No. 23 banner -- the same one that  
was hung in the United Center during his first retirement -- was 
raised, forcing a smile to keep the tears that welled in his eyes 
from rolling down his cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well this a day that I think I hoped would never come,''  
Reinsdorf said. ``It has to be the toughest day in the history of 
the Chicago Bulls. It's a tough day for Chicago, it's a tough day 
for the NBA, it's a tough day for basketball fans all over the 
world and for Michael Jordan fans all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But is it really the end?  
</P>
<P>
	Why did he say 99.9 percent?  
</P>
<P>
	``Get off of it,'' Stern said. ``He's not coming back.''  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	But combine Jordan with the tiniest bit of wiggle room, and --  
just like countless opponents have learned through the years -- one 
never knows.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rehnquist Demands Preparation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment lawyers can stay on Chief Justice  
William H. Rehnquist's good side by following a few rules: Be 
prepared. Speak plainly. And for heaven's sake, get his title 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take care not to waste anyone's time,'' advised Charles  
Cooper, a former law clerk to Rehnquist who has frequently argued 
before the Supreme Court. ``Keep the matter focused because the 
chief has a real knack for not letting a proceeding meander into 
irrelevant details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice often sharply rebukes lawyers who misstep  
during Supreme Court arguments. Even Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr drew a verbal slap when, as the Justice Department's top 
courtroom lawyer, he argued a case in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me share with you a bit of the record in the case,'' Starr  
began, and within seconds Rehnquist cut in: ``Why don't you just 
tell us about the record, rather than share it with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton's impeachment trial is new territory and  
it's unknown whether Rehnquist, as presiding officer, will be as 
strict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we don't have any conventions,'' said Northwestern  
University law professor Tom Merrill. ``He might be much more 
forgiving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, impeachment trial lawyers will have much more  
than the standard half-hour for each side in a Supreme Court 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	When lawyers' time runs out at the court, Rehnquist doesn't  
hesitate to cut them off in mid-sentence. With 24 hours allowed in 
the Senate for each side to initially lay out their case, the chief 
justice might have less reason to move things along. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Rehnquist's impeachment trial duties is to rule on which  
evidence can be admitted. But there are few standards to guide him. 
He can rule evidence irrelevant or repetitive, and he can bar 
leading questions -- and then the senators can overrule him with a 
simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it's the senators, not Rehnquist, who will decide  
whether Clinton is convicted of perjury or obstruction of justice 
and removed from office. When it's time to vote, Rehnquist's job is 
to ask each senator for his or her judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist might not let a lawyer get away with evading a  
difficult question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very smart and he knows when somebody is answering a  
question or not answering a question,'' said Carter Phillips, a 
frequent advocate before the highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice, a trim 6-foot-2-inches tall, might stand up  
now and then during trial proceedings to stretch his back. He 
underwent back surgery in 1995, and at the Supreme Court he 
occasionally goes behind the curtain in back of the bench, where he 
can still hear the arguments over loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he can seem stern on the bench, Rehnquist isn't stuffy.  
Friends know him as a regular but bad poker player who enjoys small 
bets on sports or even on how deep the snow outside is. When Warren 
Burger was chief justice, then-Justice Rehnquist surprised him with 
an elaborate April Fool's Day joke by arranging for a street 
photographer to stand outside the court with a life-size cutout of 
Burger, offering tourists the chance to pose with it for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate chamber, Rehnquist is expected to be more  
restrained than he usually is when hearing arguments at the Supreme 
Court and to try to avoid having a major effect on the trial's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``One great mystery is why the chief justice is there'' at all,  
since the senators control the significant decisions, said 
Georgetown law professor David Cole, suggesting one reason might be 
that ``his presence underscores the solemnity of the process and 
puts everyone on their best behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said  
Rehnquist's job is an easy one in a way because ``he's got a role 
without authority, without power.'' He could step in, however, if 
it appeared senators were bent on railroading the president, 
Gillers added. 
</P>
<P>
	And what should Rehnquist's title be? At the court, he is ``Mr.  
Chief Justice,'' and attorneys who call him ``Justice Rehnquist'' 
are likely to be corrected.	   After some confusion in the Senate -- Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., once called him ``Mr. Presiding Officer'' during last 
week's swearing-in session -- it was decided that ``in accord with 
precedent,'' Rehnquist will be known as ``Mr. Chief Justice.''

<HEADLINE> Martin Wants To Succeed on PGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Casey Martin hasn't decided whether he will look for a sponsor's  
exemption to take his game and his cart to the PGA Tour, although 
his goal for the year is crystal clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make it to the tour,'' Martin said Wednesday from  
the Nike Lakeland Classic, where he is the defending champion at 
the Grasslands Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago this week, Martin put the wheels in motion for a year  
that shook the golf establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	He sued the PGA Tour for the right to use a cart in competition  
because of a rare circulatory disease in his right leg that makes 
it difficult for him to walk. Granted the use of a cart pending the 
outcome of the federal lawsuit, Martin tied a tournament scoring 
record with a 19-under 269 to win the Lakeland Classic by one 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, a judge in Oregon ruled in his favor, and Martin  
became one of the biggest stories in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't win again on the Nike Tour, but he qualified for the  
U.S. Open in a playoff, then tied for 23rd at The Olympic Club, 
coming within two strokes of an automatic invitation to the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning this event and the U.S. Open were probably my two  
highlights,'' Martin said. ``At those points in my life, I couldn't 
believe what had transpired. It was a thrill and a blessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's 1999 season did not get off an auspicious start. He  
finished at 291 last week in the Nike South Florida Classic, 16 
strokes off the lead. He also said it was a ``bad week'' for his 
leg, meaning a lot of swelling after his round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I wake and up and know it's going to be a bad day,''  
he said. ``It's just kind of there and you deal with it. It feels 
good this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also feels another difference -- not nearly as many reporters  
following his every move. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was overwhelmed by the attention of becoming the first  
player to use a cart in the U.S. Open and on the PGA Tour -- he 
missed the cut at the Greater Hartford Open. Now, he is more 
interested in talking about his game than his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life was changed incredibly from a year ago, due in large  
part to winning the court case,'' he said. ``Those first couple of 
months ... I can't explain it any other way than my life was 
bizarre. But I think that's subsided now. Things have gotten back 
to status quo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin says the amount of attention drained him emotionally,  
which might explain why he sank lower and lower on the Nike money 
list as the year went on. Martin had a good chance to get his PGA 
Tour by finishing in the top 15, but took time off in the summer 
and played poorly in the Nike Tour Championship. He wound up 29th 
on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laid an egg,'' he said. ``I wanted it so bad and had worked  
so hard, to play poorly there was a very big disappointment. But 
I've learned to take the good with the bad. I want to get in the 
top 15. I don't put that up on my wall and look at it every day. I 
just want to focus on my golf game and try to improve.''

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kasich Tests Campaign Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, the House Budget Committee  
chairman from Ohio, is the latest entry in the Republican 
presidential sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, 46, just beginning his ninth House term, was forming an  
exploratory committee today with the secretary of state's office in 
Columbus, Ohio, allowing him to raise and spend money while he 
tests the waters, an official involved with the effort said 
Tuesday. He will announce this step Feb. 15 in Ohio, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich confidants say the lawmaker is almost certain to become a  
full-fledged candidate, but that announcement probably would come 
in the spring. His action today forms a corporation called ``Kasich 
2000'' that will function like a traditional exploratory committee. 
He will form an exploratory committee with the Federal Election 
Commission later this year, a second official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another likely Republican candidate, former Vice President Dan  
Quayle, said Tuesday that national security should be a critical 
issue in the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``No presidential candidate should be taken seriously unless he  
or she understands the importance of foreign policy,'' Quayle told 
the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side of the 2000 equation, former Sen. Bill  
Bradley of New Jersey formally became a presidential candidate 
Tuesday. Bradley, who formed an exploratory committee in December, 
quietly established the Bill Bradley for President Campaign with 
the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're encouraged by the campaign's first efforts in fund  
raising,'' Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said. His boss will soon 
visit early primary states New Hampshire and Iowa for the first 
time since he decided to explore the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley plans to formally announce his challenge to Vice  
President Al Gore in the spring. Gore, who formed his campaign Jan. 
1, hopes to benefit from President Clinton's support. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Gore selected Johnny Hayes, a director of the  
Tennessee Valley Authority, to be the finance director of his 
campaign. Hayes held the same post in Gore's 1988 bid for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich joins a number of GOP presidential hopefuls, including  
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who formed an exploratory 
committee Friday and plans to run again. Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire had already declared 
themselves candidates with the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other Republicans are almost certain to get into the  
race, including Quayle, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes and 
conservative activist Gary Bauer. Texas Gov. George W. Bush is 
likely to run, but confidants caution that his candidacy is not 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it's a two-man Democratic field.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota  
bypassed uphill challenges to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt is tempted to remain in the  
House and help Democrats try to recapture the chamber in 2000, but 
he has not made a final decision. The Missouri Democrat, who would 
pose a severe threat to Gore, could announce his intentions as 
early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and civil rights activist Jesse  
Jackson are determining whether to run. Kerry met with advisers in 
Boston on Tuesday to discuss a possible candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Program Targets Children, Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new grant program is taking another crack at  
enrolling uninsured children into state health care programs, 
hoping to avoid problems that states have seen with Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The grants being announced Thursday total $17.5 million for 20  
states. The money is to be used both to help enroll eligible 
children into the new children's health insurance program aimed at 
the working poor and to get other children into the Medicaid 
program, which serves poorer families. 
</P>
<P>
	Its goals are to work with states to simplify the enrollment  
process and to reach out to families that may be eligible for the 
health insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which is financing the  
program, plans to spend $47 million -- enough to pay for programs in 
every state and the District of Columbia. But only 20 states thus 
far have met requirements, said Sarah Shuptrine, director of the 
program's national office. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Medicaid side, many policy makers are worried that as  
welfare changes take hold, families that leave the rolls may not 
realize their children often remain eligible for Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies suggest anywhere from 3 million to 4.5 million  
Medicaid-eligible children are not enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	Often the problems include complicated state applications and  
restrictive policies that, for instance, require families to come 
into offices during certain hours to apply. The grants urge 
communities to work with states to change those rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can either teach families and community organizations to  
jump through a bunch of hoops or you can remove some of those 
hoops,'' said Shuptrine. 
</P>
<P>
	The other program targeted is the new children's health  
insurance program, signed into law in 1997. The grants hope to help 
this program avoid the pitfalls Medicaid has seen. 
</P>
<P>
	It has some advantages from the outset, Shuptrine said: There is  
no history of restrictive rules and it doesn't suffer from the same 
stigma Medicaid does as a welfare program. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, that could change if states aren't careful.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you apply for one of these nice-named programs and you're  
treated poorly and it's tough to apply, you'll build a stigma,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	States getting the first round of grants are:  
</P>
<P>
	Alaska, $1 million; Arizona, $999,163; Arkansas, $643,417;  
Colorado, $1 million; Connecticut, $644,479; Georgia, $855,547; 
Illinois, $1 million; Kentucky, $812,718; Maine, $598,943; 
Massachusetts, $972,019; Montana, $1 million; New Mexico, $1 
million; New York, $993,773; North Carolina, $997,992; Oklahoma, 
$726,670; Pennsylvania, $1 million; Tennessee, $991,648; Texas, 
$994,503; Washington, $671,858; West Virginia, $592,776.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 175.33; Nasdaq Down 17.99 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower at midday but trimming their  
losses, after President Clinton said he hoped the crisis in Brazil 
would be ``resolved in a satisfactory way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency devaluation this morning sparked a sharp  
sell-off at the open. But the selling was short-lived, and by 10:15 
the major indexes were cutting their losses. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 175.33 at at 9,299.35. The Dow got as low as 9,213.10, down 
261.58, in the first hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also trimming their losses. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which had been down 111 
points at 10 a.m, was down only 17.99 at 2,302.76. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 composite was down 11.25 at 1,228.26, and cutting a loss 
of 22 points at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes were recovering along with Internet-related  
stocks, which continued to show some resiliency. Yahoo! shares, 
which dropped as low as 332 in the first hour, were trading at 394, 
down 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by a nearly 10 to 3 on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a heavy 464.45, up from 
Tuesday's pace of 340 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks tumbled at the open after the head of the Brazilian  
central bank, Gustavo Franco, resigned. His replacement, Francisco 
Lopes, immediately allowed the Brazilian currency, the real, to 
fall 8 percent against world currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is important to U.S. markets because it is a huge  
importer of U.S. goods, and because a bad stumble in its economy 
could send emerging markets tumbling throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil is a big part of the Latin American economy, and the  
economy in Latin America is pretty important to companies in the 
United States,'' said Bill Meehan, market strategist at Canter 
Fitzgerald in Stamford. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's stock market opened in a free fall, with the Bovespa  
index dropping 10 percent, triggering a circuit breaker that halted 
trading temporarily. Brazil stocks resumed trading shortly before 
10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
      	Brazil's action prompted a sharp selloff in Latin American and 	
world stock markets.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. market was technically poised to fall, after the Dow  
gained a scintillating 5 percent in the first week of trading this 
year, said Greg Nie, a technical analyst at Everen Securities in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a market that's vulnerable to news. The kind of  
action that we've seen collectively late last week and early this 
week, continues to protray a market where the bulls must come after 
it with outstanding, broad-based, big-time momentum.''

<HEADLINE> IOC's Rogge Would Welcome Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
will examine claims by a senior member of Sydney's successful bid 
for the 2000 Games that he was approached to offer bribes, an IOC 
member said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian IOC member Kevan Gosper said he spoke to Bruce Baird,  
a former New South Wales state Olympics minister and now member of 
federal parliament, about the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's advised me of two conversations he had at the time of the  
Sydney bid, which may have been interpreted to be seeking some sort 
of opportunity,'' Gosper told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've asked him to set that down on paper and I'll use that as  
part of the process we're going to have when I get back to Lausanne 
next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC member Jacques Rogge said earlier today he would welcome any  
evidence of bribery allegations surrounding the winning bid by Salt 
Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird says he is prepared to name people who sought bribes from  
him while claiming to represent IOC members, but that he was 
surprised the IOC has not jumped on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird said Wednesday he has given a statement to Gosper claiming  
that one IOC member and an intermediary made approaches seeking 
cash in exchange for votes for Sydney's bid, the ABC reported.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Still Can't Shut the Door </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- He still can't shut the door.  
</P>
<P>
	Sitting on a stage at the middle of the same basketball court  
where he spun so much magic, Michael Jordan promised one final 
illusion. He was going to make himself disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It the perfect time to walk away from the game,'' he said.  
``I'm at peace with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contentment, though, is apparently not the same thing as a  
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the question-and-answer portion of the program was under  
way, someone asked Jordan if he was sure he would never don an NBA 
uniform again. He grinned, started at 95 percent, then bumped it to 
99.9 percent, then once more to ``never.'' A few minutes later, he 
was challenged to clean up the decimal point, to make the number a 
neat 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	He balked.  
</P>
<P>
	Why?  
</P>
<P>
	``Because it's my 1 percent,'' Jordan said, defiant to the end.  
``Not yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The correct answer would have been one-tenth of 1 percent, but  
why quibble over the math on this day? He is gone. For now. And at 
the very least, his leave-taking was so much more satisfying this 
time than last. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, he was haunted by the ghost of a murdered  
father. His body was worn out from too many postseasons and the 
carnival atmosphere that surrounded the Dream Team. His nerves were 
worn thin from the constant demands of celebrity. He felt like he 
was living the movie of Elvis' final days. 
</P>
<P>
	On this dreary winter Wednesday, there was the sense that very  
little in Jordan's life was in need of repair. His health, his 
fortune and his family were intact. His legacy had never been more 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1993, Jordan said he would have no problem facing the  
day when a better man came along. ``That's not one of my fears,'' 
he said. The ink on those words was barely dry by the time he set 
out to prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	The following September, Jordan played in teammate Scottie  
Pippen's charity basketball game at the old Chicago Stadium. The 
lineups were packed with kids contending to become that better man. 
It turned out to be an exercise in futility. Jordan soared over, 
under and around Generation X to score 52, every one an exclamation 
point. One comeback and a three-peat later, he leaves again, 
without question, as The Man. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, when he says there is nothing else to prove, it is  
easier to take him at his word. He doesn't seem quite as restless. 
The competitive fire that made him punish teammates and opponents 
alike doesn't burn nearly as bright. What remains are embers, and 
those only smolder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The desire is always going to be there,'' Jordan said,  
``because if the desire is not there, that means the love wasn't 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is not fooling himself this time. He knows much of the  
romance is about to go out of his life. Jordan said he is prepared 
for that, too, that filling up the hours won't be the dilemma that 
some of us think. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I can go into seclusion and certainly I can't  
solve the world's problems,'' Jordan said. ``There's a lot of 
things out there, there's a lot of things I can lend my support 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than raising his kids, most of Jordan's causes remain  
mercenary ones. He has an empire to look after, endorsement 
contracts to honor and a line of shoes and athletic wear -- called 
``Brand Jordan,'' appropriately enough -- to push. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would be willing to help the Bulls and the NBA made  
the adjustment to life without him -- but only so far. One reason 
Jordan gave for coming back last time was to school ``the 
knuckleheads,'' to teach the youngsters who would take his place 
the proper respect for the game and the paying public. This time he 
leaves believing the kids will be all right. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have to be very patient with them and apply more  
guidance, teach them to enjoy the game and play with a lot of 
energy. One of the more fortunate things me and some of the other 
players before me have brought more into focus is the financial 
aspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's going to have to dissipate a little bit and get  
back more to the love of the game. The love of the game,'' he said, 
``is what you do on the basketball court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one ever loved it more dearly, or had a tougher time letting  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why, as Jordan headed for the exit, dozens of the people  
stayed behind on a basketball court, his basketball court, and 
strained to hear the ``click'' of the door. 
</P>
<P>
	It never came. Perhaps because he couldn't bring himself to slam  
it shut.

guidance, teach them to enjoy the game and play with a lot of 
energy. One of the more fortunate things me and some of the other 
players before me have brought more into focus is the financial 
aspects.

	``I think that's going to have to dissipate a little bit and get  
back more to the love of the game. The love of the game,'' he said, 
``is what you do on the basketball court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one ever loved it more dearly, or had a tougher time letting  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why, as Jordan headed for the exit, dozens of the people  
stayed behind on a basketball court, his basketball court, and 
strained to hear the ``click'' of the door. 
</P>
<P>
	It never came. Perhaps because he couldn't bring himself to slam  
it shut.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Redskins Coach Ball Dies at 88 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Herman Ball, head coach of the Washington  
Redskins from 1949 through part of the 1951 season, died Tuesday 
from heart ailment complications at a hospital in Paoli, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, who lived in King of Prussia, Pa., was 88.  
</P>
<P>
	Ball spent eight years on the Redskins' staff, winning promotion  
from line coach to head coach midway through the 1949 season. The 
Redskins finished that year with a 4-7-1 record and won three out 
of 12 games the following year. Ball was replaced as head coach 
after a winless streak in the 1951 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He later was a Redskins scout. In 1955 he joined the Pittsburgh  
Steelers as an assistant coach. He also was on the coaching staffs 
of the Baltimore Colts and the Philadelphia Eagles before retiring 
in 1968.

<HEADLINE> Lucent To Buy Ascend for $18.7B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc. is buying Ascend  
Communications Inc. in an $18.7 billion stock deal that reflects 
the growing influence of the Internet on the telecommunications 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	As the lines blur between telephone, cable and the Internet, the  
companies that make equipment for these industries are quickly 
pairing up. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which had been widely expected, was announced  
Wednesday and followed Lucent's $1.5 billion agreement earlier this 
week to purchase Kenan Systems Corp., which makes software for 
billing and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent is the world's No. 1 phone equipment maker. Ascend is a  
major supplier of computer networking gear, and is expected to 
provide the expertise in Internet-style communications technology 
Lucent needs to better compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real thing that's happened is the emergence of the  
Internet and data transmission,'' said John Zahurancik, vice 
president of international telecommunications for Strategis, a 
consulting firm in Washington. The Lucent-Ascend deal signals ``how 
important data networking is to the world of telecommunications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring that point, Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd., the  
world's second-largest maker of phone equipment, announced 
separately Wednesday that it would eliminate 8,000 jobs and sell 
plants over the next three years to focus its business on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While most U.S. consumers take for granted that they can pick up  
a phone and easily call anywhere in the world, soon it will be just 
as effortless for a business to send e-mail, files or video. 
</P>
<P>
	The market is lucrative and growing.  
</P>
<P>
	The $400 billion networking communications industry is expected  
to expand to $650 billion by 2001, said Rich McGinn, Lucent's 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying Ascend fills gaps in Lucent's product line with the  
addition of Ascend's equipment designed to help telecommuters hook 
up to their headquarters, and to assist businesses create their own 
computer and telephone networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent and Ascend also are working on equipment that allows  
consumers and businesses to make local and long-distance phone 
calls over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very strategic fit,'' said Liza Henderson, director of  
consulting for TeliChoice Inc., a telecom consulting firm in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk, however, as with many mergers, is that Ascend's  
employees will defect to competitors or start their own firms. 
Ascend, which is based in Alameda, Calif., had its own problem with 
fleet-footed employees when it bought Cascade Communications Corp. 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a war for talent around the world,'' acknowledged Dan  
Stanzione, chief operating officer of Lucent. But, he said, ``We're 
getting our fair share and then some. ... They want to work for 
market leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mory Ejabat, 48, Ascend's president and chief executive officer,  
will stay on for a six- to 12- month transition period, and then 
leave the company. The acquisition is expected to close in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent plans to create a new Broadband Networks Group, which  
will include Ascend's operations, Kenan Systems, as well as 
Lucent's data, optical, and communications software groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of Lucent's acquisition of Ascend had been circulating  
for several days, but top-level negotiations started last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced Wednesday, each share of Ascend will be  
exchanged for 0.825 shares of Lucent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's stock fell $3.62 1/2 to $104.25 on the New York Stock  
Exchange in a market that was unsettled by Brazil's financial 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	That values each Ascend share at $86, or 14.8 percent more than  
Ascend's closing price of $74.93 3/4 a share Tuesday, before the deal 
was announced. Ascend's shares rose $5.37 1/2 Wednesday to $80.31 1/4 on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Tampa Bay Touchy Subject for Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Everyone wants to talk about Tampa  
Bay this week, specifically how Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott 
shredded the Minnesota Vikings' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's a touchy subject.  
</P>
<P>
	``Next question, man,'' nose tackle Jerry Ball said, clearly  
irritated at the mention of Minnesota's only loss. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a good question with Jamal Anderson bringing 1,800-plus  
yards and a wicked stiff-arm to town this Sunday for the NFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Vikings are vulnerable, it's against a rugged rushing  
attack. Tampa Bay proved that Nov. 1, when it ran for a team-record 
246 yards and didn't punt once during a 27-24 win over the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings know they might be unbeaten if they had stopped the  
Bucs just once that day. Knowing they couldn't, and that they 
simply were outmuscled, still stings 2 1/2 months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play like that and what (Tampa Bay) did, naturally you're  
embarrassed, you're insulted,'' defensive coordinator Foge Fazio 
said. ``It's not very nice. You don't want those things to happen 
again, so they want to guard against that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings (16-1) have done just that.  
</P>
<P>
	Since Dunn and Alstott left skid marks on them, the Vikings have  
been outstanding against the run. They have given up over 100 yards 
just twice in nine games since Tampa Bay, allowing fewer than 77 
yards a game in that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the course of a full season, that would have ranked third  
in the NFL. During that time, Minnesota's worst performance against 
the run -- 138 yards allowed -- came in a 50-10 win over 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	That's called learning from your mistakes. And while the Vikings  
defenders don't mind being overshadowed by their prolific teammates 
on offense, they know they cannot be overrun by Anderson and the 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a team that can play good defense can win in the  
playoffs,'' coach Dennis Green said. ``Offensively, there have been 
a lot of teams that have been high-flying offenses that didn't get 
a chance to start well because they couldn't stop people. You must, 
in my opinion, be able to stop the run. That's where it starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's where so many of Minnesota's recent seasons have  
unraveled. The Vikings declined precipitously in that category 
after leading the NFL in 1994, bottoming out last season when they 
ranked 23rd and allowed more than 123 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	In their divisional-round playoff loss at San Francisco, the  
49ers burned Minnesota for 175 yards rushing on 41 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what the Falcons hope to do. Their plan, as it has been  
all season, will be to pound Anderson. That not only opens up 
passing lanes for Chris Chandler to find Terance Mathis and Tony 
Martin, but it takes the fuse out of Minnesota's explosive offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson set an NFL record with 410 carries during the regular  
season, nearly 26 a game. He had 29 for 113 yards and two TDs in 
last weekend's win over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're probably looking at having 25 to 30 carries  
for sure,'' Anderson said. ``Hopefully not 40. But I'll do whatever 
it takes to give us a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings' defenders are showing Anderson plenty of respect  
this week. Ball, who tied middle linebacker Ed McDaniel for the 
team and NFL lead with 15 tackles for losses during the regular 
season, said Anderson has the power of Natrone Means and the 
quickness of Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a big challenge for us to get behind the line of  
scrimmage and gang tackle,'' said McDaniel, a Pro Bowl backup. 
``When he cuts back, he has good balance. He has good vision where 
the hole is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's defense finished 13th in the NFL this season, 11th  
against the run, a tremendous improvement from 1997. The unit 
clearly has benefited from the offense's ability to jump out to 
quick leads and force teams away from their game plan, but the 
defense also has made a habit out of playing its best early in 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings' defense has allowed zero first-quarter points in 10  
games this season and no more than a field goal three other times. 
Meanwhile, the offense has been shut out in the first quarter just 
three times, all victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, how we play defense has not been totally  
understood,'' Green said. ``How we play offense has probably been 
somewhat overblown. If you look at the first quarter and take the 
average score, see how many times the opponent did not score in the 
first quarter. If you don't give up points in the first quarter, 
then you're well on your way to having a chance to win the ball 
game.''

<HEADLINE> Canada, US Argue Over Magazine Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The dispute over U.S. access to Canadian magazine  
advertising revenues has become by far the most heated ongoing 
trade conflict between the world's largest trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, U.S. trade officials signaled their readiness to  
penalize Canadian exports ranging from steel to textiles unless 
Canada abandons a pending bill that would bar Canadian companies 
from advertising in so-called split-run magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Split-run magazines are Canadian editions of American  
publications that rely mostly on content from the main U.S. edition 
but sell ad space to Canadian companies. Canadian publishers say 
split-runs provide unfair competition, enabling the U.S. publishers 
to sell ad space at cheap rates while incurring minimal extra 
editorial costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half the magazines sold in Canada are American magazines, and  
now they're trying to get the rest,'' said Francois de Gaspe 
Beaubien, chairman of the political committee of the Canadian 
Magazine Publishers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every time the Americans threaten, Canada backs down -- even  
when Canada is in the right -- then Canada is no longer a sovereign 
country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade officials say they have not made a final decision on  
how they would respond if the Canadian bill -- Bill C-55 -- is 
adopted by Parliament next month, as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior U.S. trade official briefed Canada's ambassador to  
Washington, Raymond Chretien, about possible retaliation Monday, 
reportedly citing steel, textiles, plastics and wood as potential 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States contends that the proposed ban violates the  
North American Free Trade Agreement and would entitle Washington to 
retaliate with measures causing comparable economic harm to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian officials say they are willing to discuss the dispute  
with the United States, but the government insists it will press 
ahead with Bill C-55 and will fight any U.S. retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The most outspoken proponent of Bill C-55 is Sheila Copps, whose  
Heritage Ministry oversees all of Canada's cultural industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a handful of split-runs -- including Time and Readers  
Digest -- have been allowed to publish in Canada for many years, 
Copps believes an influx of additional split-runs could cripple 
Canada's own magazine industry and make it harder for Canadians to 
read about their own society. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian edition of Hustler magazine, in its February issue,  
targets Copps by running her photo next to some vulgar photographs 
and inviting readers to send letters describing sexual fantasies 
involving her. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 convenience stores in Ontario pulled Hustler from  
their shelves following complaints about the Copps display, which 
her spokesman, Jacques Lefebvre, described as ``filth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More so than in most U.S.-Canada trade disputes, the United  
States has gone on the offensive in Canada about the split-run 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. trade official briefed Canadian journalists on the U.S.  
stance Tuesday on condition he not be identified. He contended Bill 
C-55 had nothing to do with Canadian culture and was an attempt to 
protect two big companies, Rogers Communications and Telemedia 
Communications, that now collect about 60 percent of magazine ad 
revenues in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous attempts at protective measures -- including punitive  
excise taxes on split-run magazines -- were struck down last year by 
the World Trade Organization after the United States lodged a 
complaint.

<HEADLINE> Owners Approve Sale of Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Baseball owners unanimously approved the  
$150 million sale of the Florida Marlins from H. Wayne Huizenga to 
John Henry on Wednesday, then appointed a new panel to reexamine 
the sport's economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Amidst outcry from some owners that the most recent salary  
escalation created more than a dozen non-competitive teams, 
commissioner Bud Selig chose former Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, Yale 
president Richard Levin and television commentator George Will for 
a ``Blue Ribbon Task Force on Baseball Economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this time, frankly, I wanted to find some people  
outside the game who could bring a fresh approach, an insightful 
approach, whose credentials are impeccable,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyeing the salary ceiling NBA owners got their players to agree  
to last week, some baseball owners have called for massive economic 
change -- which could lead to another confrontation with players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced the current leadership of baseball will bring  
about change,'' Henry said at a news conference as Selig looked on. 
``I think Florida baseball would be in a sad state of affairs 
without change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volcker was head of the independent study panel appointed  
jointly by owners and the union following the 1990 spring training 
lockout. Mitchell, currently heading a panel investigating alleged 
bribes involving the awarding of the 2002 Winter Olympics to Salt 
Lake City, was mentioned as a possible candidate for commissioner 
several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Will is on the boards of the Baltimore Orioles and the San Diego  
Padres. Levin did economic study work for owners during the last 
round of collective bargaining. Fourteen club officials also were 
picked for panel, which will be chaired by Boston's John Harrington 
and Colorado's Jerry McMorris. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the union won't be involved but will be invited to  
attend some meetings. Union head Donald Fehr, reached at his home, 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't stand here and tell you we don't have a disparity  
problem. You know that we do and I know we do,'' Selig said. ``The 
thing we can't ignore is the economic realities we confront. We 
need to address them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners' desires to change the system of free agency and salary  
arbitration led to the 232-day strike in 1994-95 that wiped out the 
World Series for the first time in 90 years. It was baseball's 
eighth work stoppage since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Dodgers' $105 million, seven-year contract with  
Kevin Brown -- baseball's first $100 million deal -- has prompted 
several teams to call for an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	``The player compensation system we have is a Rube Goldberg  
contraption. It is completely out of whack,'' San Diego Padres 
president Larry Lucchino said. ``It is one thing to have the first 
million dollar player, it is another thing when you have the first 
hundred million player.''

<P>
	Baseball's collective bargaining agreement runs through the 2000  
season, but the players association is expected to exercise its 
option to extend it for an additional year. If that happens, the 
earliest a confrontation could occur would be in spring training 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga, a billionaire who also owns the NFL's Miami Dolphins  
and heads the public company that owns the NHL's Florida Panthers, 
founded the Marlins, who started play in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He became disenchanted in 1997 when Florida failed to fund a  
publicly financed ballpark with a retractable roof. He became 
convinced the government wouldn't finance a ballpark for a 
billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six years since the Huizenga family brought baseball  
to South Florida,'' he said. ``We did not want to sell our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team Henry takes over is a shell of the club that won the  
World Series in 1997. After the Marlins beat Cleveland to win the 
World Series in their fifth year of existence, Huizenga began a 
payroll purge. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's payroll dropped from $52.5 million to $19.1 million,  
and the Marlins went 54-108, the worst record ever for a defending 
champion and the poorest record in the National League since 1969. 
Just four players remain from the World Series roster: Antonio 
Alfonseca, Craig Counsell, Cliff Floyd and Livan Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, who formally takes over after the deal closes next  
Tuesday, has said he would pay for a stadium if the government 
doesn't fund one. But he said that route would condemn the Marlins 
to low payrolls and perennial mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to pay for players or pay for a ballpark,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other business, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner  
was replaced on baseball's executive council by Seattle Mariners 
chairman John Ellis. In the NL, Houston owner Drayton McLane and 
Atlanta chairman Bill Bartholomay replaced Selig and New York Mets 
owner Fred Wilpon. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, owners cut the period for waiver claims from three  
business days to two and reset the claiming deadline from 2 p.m. 
Eastern to 1 p.m. Eastern. They also tightened a rule that allowed 
teams to use a player on the 60-day disabled list to make an 
additional player eligible for postseason play and expanded teams' 
coaching staffs from five to six.

<HEADLINE> Report: Dolphins' Johnson To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson was prepared to resign as coach of  
the Miami Dolphins on Thursday, Fox Sports News reported Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, citing sources ``close to Johnson'' but otherwise  
unnamed, said Johnson would resign during a news conference 
Thursday at 11 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins owner H. Wayne Huizenga, in California to complete the  
sale of his Florida Marlins baseball team, rushed back to Miami 
Wednesday night, apparently to meet with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN-SI reported that Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino was  
informed and told to be at the team headquarters Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The network cited sources ``close to Johnson'' but otherwise  
unnamed. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the network report, Johnson, 55, ``wants to move on  
and he's got other things to do in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was 10-6 this season, then beat Buffalo 24-17 before being  
eliminated 38-3 by Denver last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had a 27-21 record in three seasons with Miami and was  
1-2 in two playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson enjoyed his greatest pro success with Dallas, winning  
the 1992 and 1993 Super Bowls while compiling a 51-38 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also succeeded in college, winning a national  
championship in 1987 at Miami. He had a 52-9 record in five 
seasons. Before that, he had a 29-25 record in five seasons at 
Oklahoma State.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes shored up their defense  
Wednesday, acquiring J.J. Daigneault from the Nashville Predators 
on Wednesday for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gerald Diduck sidelined 4-to-6 weeks with a partially torn  
ligament, the Coyotes were in need of a defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Daigneault was a first-round pick of the Vancouver Canucks in  
the 1984 NHL entry draft. He also played with Philadelphia, 
Montreal, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Anaheim, the New York Islanders 
and Nashville during his 14-year career. He was a member of 
Montreal's 1993 Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators claimed him in the 1988 expansion draft, and  
Daigneault had two goals, two assists and 38 penalty minutes in 35 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	He will join the Coyotes in Nashville, where the Coyotes meet  
the Predators on Friday.

	Dow Drops 169; Nasdaq Plunges 105  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged in early trading today as the  
abrupt resignation of Brazil's central bank chief and the 
subsequent devaluation of its currency intensified worries that 
Latin America's biggest economy would drag the region into a severe 
economic slump. The Dow industrials were off 169.45 at 9,305.53 
after having been down more than 250 points in earlier trading. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 105.29 to 2,215.46. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index was off 25.34 at 1,214.17.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The president of Brazil's central  
bank resigned today, one day after the country's president sought 
to calm investors by pledging the nation would honor all its 
foreign debt obligations. Citing personal and professional reasons,

	Clinton To Push Plan for Disabled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing a new $2  
billion, five-year budget package meant to help tens of thousands 
of disabled Americans return to work. The plan involves a 
combination of health coverage, tax credits and better 
rehabilitation services. Advocates say that health coverage -- the 
largest piece of the package -- is the No. 1 barrier that prevents 
people with disabilities from returning to the workplace.

	White House: No Impeachable Offense  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House sent the Senate a legal brief  
today vigorously arguing that there are no legal, constitutional or 
factual grounds for the removal of President Clinton. The 130-page 
brief offered a preview of the case that Clinton's attorneys will 
present in defending him against perjury and obstruction of justice 
charges in the Senate impeachment trial, which begins tomorrow.

installations today after being targeted by Iraqi radar, U.S. 
officials said. Initial reports said at least one Iraqi missile was 
fired but missed the U.S. planes. The incident underscored an

Authorities continued looking for the girl's father and a fellow 
Marine. Quinniah Jones, her father Marine Lance Cpl. Marlon T.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Proposes Plan for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed $2 billion in tax  
credits, health benefits and other services Wednesday to make it 
easier for disabled Americans to hold jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House ceremony, Clinton endorsed legislation being  
introduced next week by Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass., that would expand federal health coverage for 
disabled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should never have to choose between the dignity of  
work and the health care they need,'' Clinton said. ``With this 
initiative, they'll have a ticket to work, not an impossible 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on  
Education and the Workforce, praised Clinton's move. But he said 
the president should go further and endorse a GOP plan to allow 
small businesses and self-employed people to band together in 
buying group health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important patient protection is access to affordable  
health care,'' Goodling said. ``President Clinton should embrace 
Republican commonsense reforms ... to help make health coverage 
affordable for all Americans, regardless of where they live and 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the House passed, 410-1, a proposal similar to the  
one Clinton announced Wednesday. Called the Ticket to Work and 
Self-Sufficiency Act, introduced by then-Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., 
that bill would have established a voucher-like ticket that 
disabled people could use for health coverage, transportation help, 
rehabilitation and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the disabled said Clinton's proposal would help  
encourage more disabled people to seek work because they no longer 
have to fear losing their Medicaid coverage when they get jobs that 
pay more than current income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospect of losing Medicaid after earning a mere $550 a  
month frightens people from even trying to enter the labor market. 
People with disabilities will finally be free to pursue the jobs 
they are capable of doing, without risking their health and 
security in the process,'' said Hank Cheney, president of WORK 
Inc., a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that provides 
employment and residential services to disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he plans to provide in his budget proposal  
sufficient money to finance an initiative called the Work 
Incentives Improvement Act, which would extend Medicaid coverage to 
disabled people who return to the work force. It also establishes a 
$1,000 tax credit to help defray costs of employing disabled 
workers, such as transportation or making work sites more 
accessible for those in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The health insurance plan is expected to cost $1.2 billion, the  
tax credit $700 million over five years.

<HEADLINE> Evel Knievel Awaiting Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Evel Knievel, the motorcycle daredevil who  
thrilled crowds with his stunts, is recovering from dehydration as 
he waits in a hospital bed for a liver transplant, his doctor said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel's condition has improved significantly since he was  
admitted to Tampa General Hospital last Thursday, Dr. Hector C. 
Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a tough guy,'' Ramos said. ``He wants to leave. But he's  
too sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel was listed in fair condition Wednesday afternoon. He has  
hepatitis C, which he believes he contracted from one of the many 
blood transfusions he needed following spectacular crashes on the 
daredevil circuit in the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced his need for a transplant in August and made public  
appearances urging people to sign organ and tissue donor cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel was hospitalized after Ramos determined he was  
dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on a lot of medicines to get fluids out of his body,''  
Ramos said. ``It's a fine line that you're walking. You have to 
give him the medicines. But the medicines can make you 
dehydrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 60, lives a short drive from the hospital in  
Clearwater. His hepatitis C has caused cirrhosis of the liver, and 
the condition is likely to worsen until he receives a liver 
transplant, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His condition in general is life-threatening, but not  
immediately life-threatening,'' Ramos said. Any other patients with 
greater medical need for a liver transplant will be considered 
before Knievel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His celebrity status hasn't actually increased his chances of  
getting an organ,'' Ramos said. ``He's waited like any other 
patient.''

<HEADLINE> Police: Man Kills Ex-Wife, Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- A man killed his ex-wife,  
mother-in-law, another woman and himself this morning in a home in 
an upscale neighborhood, and a 12-year-old boy escaped and was 
standing in the front yard when police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	A shotgun was found in the house. The man and one woman died at  
the scene; the two other women died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy who had been inside the house was not injured. ``He  
heard what sounded like a gunshot,'' police Sgt. Steve Upchurch 
said. ``Because he was scared, he climbed out of a window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities identified the victims as Jeannette Jeffers, 43, of  
Richardson; her mother, Margaret Compton, 67, of Midland; and her 
friend, Mary Roland, 63, also of Midland. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was identified as Ms. Jeffers' ex-husband,  
48-year-old Alan Dale Price of Gorman. The two had been divorced 
about 15 years, police Lt. Michael Hauver said. The boy was Ms. 
Jeffers' son by her current husband, who was out of town on 
business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police weren't certain of a motive for the killings but believe  
it may have been related to recent legal action, possibly involving 
child support for the couple's college-age daughter, who was not at 
the house, Hauver said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the nation's second quadruple killing case in less than a  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, 53-year-old Terry M. Jones shot his wife and two  
children late Tuesday before calling police and taking his own 
life, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' wife, Jennifer, 34, and the couple's 4-year-old daughter,  
Tessa, were pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting at their 
home near Frankton, a town of 1,700 people about 30 miles northeast 
of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones died later at Community Hospital in Anderson, and the  
couple's 8-year-old son, Jesse, died early today at Methodist 
Hospital in Indianapolis, said Sheriff Terry Richwine. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said Jones had a conversation with 911 dispatchers,  
but he would not disclose what was said.

<HEADLINE> Sources: Gingrich May Run for Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, out of  
public office less than two weeks, already is musing about a 
possible race for governor of Georgia in 2002, according to 
Republican officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday  
that Gingrich has discussed the possibility with associates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a possibility, sure it is,'' said one official. ``Has he  
thought about it, yes, but not in an overwhelming way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have not elected a governor of Georgia since  
Reconstruction -- and Gingrich was the first GOP speaker of the 
House in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich flirted with running for the White House in 1996, and  
had been mentioned as a potential contender for 2000. But the GOP 
election setbacks in November and his decision to retire from the 
House have squelched that talk, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	At 55, Gingrich is close to Ronald Reagan's age when he was  
first elected governor of California in 1966. Reagan went on to 
serve eight years as governor, then two terms in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Gingrich is organizing his political and business  
affairs, having resigned from Congress rather than take the oath of 
office for the term that began last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He will give lectures for five-figure fees, and has also agreed  
to serve on the board of Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. In addition, he is 
likely to attend this winter's meeting of the World Economic Forum, 
a gathering of prominent figures from the world of government, 
business and academia. 
</P>
<P>
	He will maintain one business office in the Atlanta area and  
another in the Washington area. He has a federal political action 
committee, as well as one registered in Georgia, and retains a 
small staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich served 20 years in Congress, representing the region  
around Atlanta. He retired as one of the best-known political 
figures in America -- and one of the most divisive, to judge by the 
polls -- and has never run statewide at home in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Barnes, a Democrat, was elected governor in November for a  
four-year term, the latest in a line of Democrats to hold the post 
stretching back to the middle of the 19th century.

<HEADLINE> Falcons CBs Not Scared by Vikings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Next on the firing line: Ray Buchanan and  
Michael Booker. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Atlanta cornerbacks stare across the line Sunday in the  
NFC championship game, they'll see Minnesota receivers Randy Moss 
and Cris Carter, two of the most frightening cogs in the 
highest-scoring offense in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	That's enough to give anyone a few nightmares. Or is it?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not losing any sleep over it,'' said Buchanan, the  
Falcons' Pro Bowl corner. ``I'm actually licking my chops a little 
bit. When you've got a game like this, it's the opportunity of a 
lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, both Buchanan and Booker are speaking with the bravado  
required at one of the NFL's loneliest positions. They're convinced 
they can't be beat -- even by a tandem like Moss and Carter (not to 
mention Jake Reed, the Vikings' third receiver). 
</P>
<P>
	``Their offense is very powerful, but we've got a powerful  
defense,'' Buchanan said. ``I think we match up well against these 
guys. I'm not intimidated whatsoever. We respect them, and I hope 
they respect us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booker, a first-round draft pick last season who moved into the  
starting lineup because of injuries to Ronnie Bradford, followed 
Buchanan's lead in showing no fear against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Booker has declared the Falcons are going to be ``the  
team of the millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of pressure, but I play under pressure 16 games  
out of the year,'' he said. ``We're going to go out there and take 
care of business like we always do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booker is convinced that the Falcons front four will put enough  
pressure on quarterback Randall Cunningham to prevent the Vikings 
from unveiling their full arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest factor is going out there and letting them  
know they're not going to be throwing the ball all over the 
place,'' Booker said. ``Chuck Smith is going to be coming off the 
corner, so they're not going to have time to make a highlight 
reel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings set an NFL record with 556 points during the regular  
season, then blew out Arizona 41-21 in a divisional playoff game 
last week. They have a seemingly endless supply of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss was the NFL's rookie of the year with 69 receptions for  
1,313 yards and 17 touchdowns, while Carter had 78 receptions for 
1,011 yards and 12 scores. 
</P>
<P>
	But Minnesota also has Cunningham, who threw for 3,704 yards and  
34 TDs in a remarkable comeback season. And Robert Smith, who 
rushed for 1,187 yards. And David Palmer, who lines up all over the 
field. And an offensive line that features Pro Bowlers Todd 
Steussie, Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, the Falcons can't afford to focus all of their  
attention on Moss and Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Moss was not on that team and they had Oliver Shagnasty out  
there at receiver, you'd double Carter all the time, but you can't 
do that,'' defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason they have the point record is they have people at  
all the skilled positions who are as good as there is. You can 
argue about who the best receiver is, who the best tandem of 
receivers is, who the best running back is, but you're going to 
have to put the Vikings' skill-position players in that argument at 
every position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if there was ever a team capable of beating the Vikings,  
it's the Falcons. They have a punishing runner in Jamal Anderson 
and a close-to-the-vest offense that led the league in time of 
possession. They don't make many mistakes, either, also leading the 
NFL in turnover margin with a plus-20. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Vikings averaged nearly 35 points per game, no team  
scored that many in even one game against the Falcons. They allowed 
just 18 points per game -- fourth-lowest in the NFL -- and ranked 
second in run defense and eighth in fewest yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who had a team-high seven interceptions, spent most of  
the season lining up against the other teams' top receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Vikings, he might line up one-on-one against Moss.  
Or, more likely, the Falcons might assign Booker and safety Eugene 
Robinson to double Moss and let Buchanan work solo against Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray can hold his own with anyone, so whoever Ray's on, we  
won't have to double,'' Booker said. ``If I'm on Moss, we'll 
probably double Moss and let Ray go over and freestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though seven inches shorter than Moss, the 5-foot-9 Buchanan  
clearly wants a chance to defend the Vikings phenom at least a few 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take a butter knife out on the field,'' Buchanan  
said facetiously. ``If I cut him and he bleeds, that let's you know 
this man is human.''

<HEADLINE> Compensation Pushed in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A German official said Tuesday he would press  
the U.S. government to pay $60 million in compensation to families 
of the 20 Europeans killed when a Marine jet severed an Italian ski 
gondola cable almost a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lothar Naumann, mayor of Burgstadt, Germany, where seven of the  
victims lived, said U.S. government officials promised their 
families they would do all they could to help them. He said he 
would enlist German diplomats to make his case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to remind them about their promises. If I get the  
opportunity to talk to politicians or the president I will,'' 
Naumann said at a news conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped the new session of Congress will find ways to  
compensate the families just as it provided $20 million for the 
repair of the cable car to the Italian ski resort of Cavalese. 
</P>
<P>
	John A. Eaves Jr., a lawyer from Jackson, Miss., who represents  
families of the German and Polish victims of the accident, said an 
attempt to get compensation payments for the victims included in 
the appropriation for the cable car repair failed to get approval 
in Senate-House negotiations last year on a 1999 defense spending 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfair and unbecoming of the U.S. government to treat  
these families any different from the gondola company,'' said 
Eaves, who was also at the news conference. ``We have almost been 
ignored as far as these claims are concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has urged the U.S. government to waive its immunity so  
relatives of all 20 victims can collect U.S. compensation instead 
of waiting for Italian authorities , as required by an agreement 
under NATO, for which the jet was on assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaves said cumbersome Italian judicial procedures, such as  
translations of information about the victims and U.S. military 
records, could result in the families waiting up to 10 years for 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government had exerted pressure on the United States  
to get the cable car repaired but had not taken any steps to speed 
up the compensation procedure, Naumann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian officials are supposed to handle all compensation claims  
from the accident under a 1951 NATO Status of Forces Agreement 
between Italy and the United States. But the families' attorneys 
say the U.S. government should pay now., 
</P>
<P>
	The gondola, containing 19 European skiers on vacation and the  
Italian driver, plunged 350 feet when the Marine EA-6B Prowler 
sliced through its cable during a daytime training mission in the 
Alps. The jet was flying 370 feet off the ground, say 
investigators, despite a 2,000-foot minimum altitude requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two Poles, two  
Austrians and one Dutch person died in the accident. Lawyers are 
seeking $3 million to $6 million in compensation for each family 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Naumann also said relatives or representatives of the German  
victims will travel to Cavalese for a Feb. 3 anniversary memorial 
service and then to the United States to attend the trial next 
month of the two Marine aviators who flew the jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P.  
Schweitzer, the navigator, are to be tried on charges of 
manslaughter and negligent homicide and, if convicted, could spend 
the rest of their lives in prison.

<HEADLINE> Ford Mum on Possible Volvo Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s board of directors meets  
Thursday amid growing speculation that the world's No. 2 automaker 
is poised to acquire the automotive operations of Sweden's Volvo 
AB. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a report last week that Volvo had hired a Wall Street  
investment bank to explore a possible sale, the merger speculation 
that's been rife throughout the industry for months has focused on 
a possible Volvo-Ford linkup. Fiat of Italy and Germany's 
Volkswagen AG also have been named as possible suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Volvo thing probably's going to break pretty soon,''  
analyst Stephen Girsky of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will hold its regularly scheduled quarterly board meeting  
in Dearborn, the Detroit suburb where Ford is based. Chief 
spokesman Vaughn Koshkarian declined to comment on the agenda or 
the Volvo rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not adverse to acquisitions in the future if they add to  
our shareholder value,'' Koshkarian said. ``That would be the 
criteria we'd be looking at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Jac Nasser, speaking at an industry conference Tuesday  
night, also declined to say whether Ford was negotiating with 
Volvo. But Nasser again said Ford was open to tapping its more than 
$20 billion cash reserve to expand the company's global reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the right price, we're always prepared to sit down and talk  
to anyone,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's acquisition of Chrysler Corp. by Daimler-Benz AG led  
to a flurry of talks among automakers looking to strengthen their 
position in an industry beset with too much production capacity 
worldwide. The conventional wisdom is that smaller automakers will 
be ill-equipped to compete in the 21st century as the industry 
becomes dominated by several international automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo, one of the world's smaller automakers, produces less than  
500,000 vehicles annually. Last year it sold 100,227 cars in the 
United States, one of its largest markets. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that Volvo wants to sell off its car  
business only and retain its commercial truck and bus divisions. 
Ford, which just shed its commercial truck division in 1997, 
probably would be reluctant to get back into that business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford reportedly has been courting debt-laden Nissan Motor Corp.  
as well, and turned down an offer last month for a 20 percent share 
in the Japanese automaker. Ford also lost in bidding late last year 
for financially troubled Kia Motors Corp. of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in any hurry to swap our hard-earned cash for  
someone else's hard-earned debt,'' Nasser said.

<HEADLINE> US Calls China Abuses 'Disturbing' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the first U.S.-China human rights dialogue  
since 1995, the Clinton administration criticized a ``disturbing 
and counterproductive'' crackdown by China on pro-democracy 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Koh, an assistant secretary of state who briefed  
reporters Wednesday on two days of talks with a Chinese delegation, 
said U.S. officials stated their firm conviction that China must 
end repression and improve its people's human rights situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We forcefully raised our concerns about the current human  
rights situation in China, including the recent arrests, trials and 
sentencing of democratic activists for peaceful expression of their 
political beliefs,'' said Koh, newly installed assistant secretary 
for democracy, human rights and labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang Guangya, China's assistant secretary for human rights,  
acknowledged that China's human rights record isn't perfect, but he 
said the U.S. record isn't either. ``Every country must improve its 
human rights record. China needs to do so, and so does America,'' 
he told reporters at the Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang said the two sides exchanged views during the talks and  
agreed to continue the dialogue. ``Now both sides have a better 
understanding of each other,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a reception Tuesday night at the Chinese Embassy, Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright offered a frank appraisal of the 
situation in China. 
</P>
<P>
	She stressed the belief of the United States that ``organized  
and peaceful political expression is not a crime or a threat; it is 
a right that is universally recognized and fundamental to the 
freedom and dignity of every human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Accordingly,'' she said, ``we are profoundly distressed by the  
unjustified prison sentences recently imposed upon a number of 
Chinese who tried to exercise that right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wang called Albright's remarks regrettable. He said the  
differences between the two countries on human rights are 
``natural, given the different cultures, histories and economic and 
political situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koh raised the possibility of proposing a resolution to censure  
China at this year's meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in 
Geneva. The administration decided against such a move last year, 
drawing powerful rebukes from both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The main target of the Chinese crackdown have been organizers of  
an attempt to create a democratic political party. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six members have been imprisoned, and another five are  
in police custody or under house arrest. The group's most 
influential activists -- Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai -- 
were sentenced to at least 11 years in jail for subversion. 
</P>
<P>
	The crackdown is described as the most ambitious effort to curb  
dissent in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	In several recent speeches, Chinese President Jiang Zemin  
pledged to eliminate challenges to the Communist Party-led system. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang said the crackdown is a matter for Chin's judicial system.  
``It would be inappropriate for the Chinese government to make 
comments about the judiciary,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said the arrested party organizers violated  
Chinese law by trying to undermine the government. He said they are 
criminals, not dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Renewal of the U.S.-China human rights dialogue was agreed to  
during President Clinton's trip to China last year and was 
considered a significant achievement of that visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Koh said he and his delegation outlined U.S. concerns in the  
context of China's decision last October to sign the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which remains unratified, states that all people  
have the right of self-determination. It prohibits torture and 
cruel or degrading punishment and provides for freedom of movement, 
thought, religion and expression, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team urged the Chinese to ratify the covenant quickly,  
then to apply its principles ``consistently and universally,'' Koh 
said.

<HEADLINE> US Lawmaker Wants Freer China Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A U.S. congressman pushing for liberalized  
aviation and maritime trade says Chinese officials claim their 
nation is too undeveloped to support freer markets. 
</P>
<P>
	James Oberstar, a member of the House of Representatives'  
transportation committee, came to China to lobby for freer trade 
practices ahead of U.S.-China talks in February on an air services 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Oberstar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said he also pushed for  
freer maritime trade and for a renegotiation of a maritime 
agreement that lapsed last year. Negotiations on a new pact are 
expected in a few weeks, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	But in discussions Wednesday on maritime services, officials  
from China's Communications Ministry balked, Oberstar said. 
</P>
<P>
	China fears that increased foreign competition from freer trade  
could damage or destroy Chinese industries at a time of mounting 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``China tends to look at itself as a developing country and to  
therefore be very protective of its market place rather than to 
open the market up,'' Oberstar said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said China seems most prepared to loosen restrictions on  
aviation trade, and Chinese airline companies hope to form 
alliances with U.S. carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been pushing for increased passenger and  
cargo services, both direct and through third countries, and 
ticketing agreements between airlines.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Jimmie Rodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- Jimmie Rodgers is shaking hands and posing  
for pictures, just doing what a performer does after a show in 
Branson, when he hears: ``I thought you was dead!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers just laughs, and so does everybody else. After assuring  
the elderly woman who said it that he's not, they chat amiably for 
a moment, then it's on to meet other folks. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he laughs again when the subject of his death is raised.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do get that quite a bit,'' the 65-year-old Rodgers says,  
smiling, in a dressing room interview at the Country Tonite 
Theatre, where he has just appeared in a nostalgia-filled 
song-and-dance show called ``Golden Girls U.S.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gets it quite a bit because he almost did die once, on a San  
Fernando Valley street in California a few days before Christmas 
1967 -- when the handsome pop star with the signature song 
``Honeycomb'' and the honey-smooth voice to go with it became a 
victim of ``road rage'' before it had a name. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers had pulled his car to the side of the road, thinking it  
was a friend following him home from a party and flashing his 
lights at him. It turned out to be an off-duty policeman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently I'd made him mad, cut him off or something, and he  
hit me,'' Rodgers says. 
</P>
<P>
	After he recovered, he filed a lawsuit, and after five years of  
litigation the Los Angeles Police Department settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a pretty good sum of money,'' Rodgers says now. ``And I  
went on with my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the attack, Rodgers was hit with a blunt instrument that  
caved in the right side of his skull. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the brightest careers in popular music was bludgeoned as  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers defined overnight success when ``Honeycomb,'' the first  
song he ever recorded, reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts in 
1957. Seventeen gold records and four gold albums followed over the 
next 10 years. He got his own TV show on NBC. and he succeeded as a 
country-pop crossover star, with such songs as ``Kisses Sweeter 
Than Wine'' and ``Oh-Oh, I'm Falling In Love Again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a while after the attack, it looked like he might resume his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months of undergoing brain surgery, and having taught  
himself to walk and talk again, he was back in the studio, 
recording the hit album ``The Windmills of Your Mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he tried to do too much too soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had a seizure on stage in Seattle in 1969 and another in San  
Francisco,'' he says now. ``And then the business quit calling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Years of slow, often painful rehabilitation followed. He finally  
made a more or less full recovery, also learning to fly, taking up 
skydiving and becoming a physical fitness fanatic who ran as much 
as 13 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
	And, from time to time, he tried to revive his music career, but  
with little success. 
</P>
<P>
	To this day Rodgers has constant physical reminders of the  
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	He still has the pompadour he had when he became famous in the  
'50s, but the full head of hair that hides the huge metal plate in 
his head has turned to gray. 
</P>
<P>
	He can chuckle about being unable to pass through an airport  
metal detector unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
	Less funny, though, is the spasmodic dysphonia, a vocal  
affliction he believes stems from his brain injury, that began to 
affect him in the early '80s. Twice-a-year medical treatments help 
control it, but it has robbed him of some of his range. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I really feel sad about,'' he says, ``is that I  
feel now I'm a better performer than I ever was before. Now I know 
how to handle an audience, how to deliver a song. Now is the time 
in my life I'd like to be able to really sing well. And I just 
can't do that. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Being able to grab onto a song and really do it, I can still  
do that,'' Rodgers explains. ``But being able to add certain 
understated features to the melody -- I just don't have the voice 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on the whole he says he couldn't be happier with the way  
things are going. Long after giving up any thoughts of returning to 
the stage, he stumbled into the ``Golden Girls'' show two years ago 
after his wife, Mary, became one of its featured singer-dancers. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour he does to close the first set was so much fun  
this past season that he's looking into doing his own show at a 
small Branson theater starting next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he's 140 pages into an autobiography, and there's  
talk of making his life story into a movie. Rodgers says he has 
never been keen on dredging up the details of the attack for a 
film, although he may reconsider when he finishes the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever he decides, he says, he is well beyond any anger over  
the blow life dealt him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I got mad at God, I got mad at everybody at times,'' he  
says. ``But bad things happen to all of us, and if you dwell on 
these things you're in trouble. So I don't dwell on it.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Blues Player Wickenheiser Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Doug Wickenheiser, whose dramatic overtime  
playoff goal in 1986 is fondly remembered by St. Louis Blues fans 
as the Monday Night Miracle, died after a lengthy battle with 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser had not played hockey professionally since 1994,  
when a malignant cyst was removed from his left wrist. The cancer 
returned in October of 1997, when a tumor was found in his right 
lung. He had been hospitalized since late summer and died Tuesday 
at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aside from being one of the most exciting hockey players, he  
was a truly great person and had a great family,'' said Susie 
Mathieu, the Blues' publicity director when Wickenheiser was with 
the team. ``He embodied it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser was with the Blues for all or parts of four seasons  
from 1983-1987. He had 51 goals and 67 assists in 230 games with 
St. Louis, and the team used the former center's No. 14 as 
inspiration for his battle with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two seasons, several Blues players and front office  
personnel, as well as fans, wore T-shirts emblazoned with the No. 
14 atop a burning candle to symbolize hope in Wickenheiser's 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser's goal completed the Blues' rally from a 5-2  
deficit to beat the Calgary Flames 6-5 in Game 6 of the Campbell 
Conference final May 12, 1986. The Blues trailed by three goals 
with 11:52 to go but scored three goals to force overtime, and 
Wickenheiser got the game-winner at 7:30 of the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Bernie Federko, the franchise's career leading scorer,  
assisted on the goal that he'll never forget. He'll never forget 
Wickenheiser's expression, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the pumping of his fists,'' said Federko, now a  
radio analyst with the team. ``I can see it right now, and the 
smile on his face. That's what we remember him by, not the last few 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory by the Blues, who were only three games above .500  
in the regular season, forced Game 7, which Calgary won 2-1 to 
advance to the Stanley Cup final. To many Blues fans, the comeback 
is the crowning glory for a franchise that hasn't made it past the 
second round of the playoffs since. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the young fans especially, those that don't remember the  
Blues going to the finals in their first two seasons, that's 
certainly the special moment,'' Federko said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser, selected first overall by Montreal in the 1980  
draft, had 111 goals and 156 assists in 556 games in his 10-year 
career with the Canadiens, Blues, Vancouver, the New York Rangers 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug was such a great guy,'' Todd Strueby, a teammate of  
Wickenheiser's with Canada's national hockey team during the 
1988-89 season, told the Regina (Saskatchewan) Leader-Post on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone who knew him was praying for him and his family. He  
was quite a guy. He always had fun. I don't think he had an 
enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending.  
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser, his wife Dianne and three daughters settled in St.  
Louis after his retirement.

	Commissioner Jim Ritts said Wednesday that the LPGA Tour has  
signed a five-year deal with the Futures Tour to make it the 
official developmental tour of the LPGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the growing number of women worldwide entering the game,  
it was evident to me there was a growing chasm between amateur or 
collegiate golf and the LPGA Tour,'' Ritts said. ``This continues 
to ensure that potential stars are not being lost in that chasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the top three on the Futures money list  
will earn their LPGA cards for the next season, and the next seven 
will automatically get into the final round of qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will help us solidify our place in women's  
golf,'' said Futures spokeswoman Tracy Kerdyk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Futures Tour will be similar to the Nike Tour, which has  
produced players like Lehman, David Duval, Jim Furyk and John Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he became the British Open champion and PGA player of the  
year in 1996, Lehman was bouncing around mini-tours in California 
and other tours around the world. He was on the verge of giving up 
the game to become a golf coach in Minnesota when he used the Nike 
Tour -- then known as the Hogan Tour -- as his road back to the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much less rich would the golf world be without Tom  
Lehman?'' Ritts said. ``He's probably selling skis without the 
Hogan tour. I know there's a need for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts and his staff have been working on a developmental tour  
for the past four years, trying to decide whether to start their 
own or sign up an existing tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Futures has been around for 19 years and now has 19  
tournaments from coast to coast, playing for a total purse of $1 
million. The agreement with the LPGA now offers its players a 
direct link to the LPGA and its $36 million in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relationship will be a catalyst to take women's golf to  
the next level,'' said Zayra Calderon, chief executive officer of 
the Futures Tour. ``We are thrilled that it has evolved into a 
national tour with recognized players and is a natural stepping 
stone to the LPGA Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 160 alumni of Futures events are Tammie Green, Meg  
Mallon and Donna Andrews. Karrie Webb of Australia played the 
Futures Tour in 1995, a year before she became the first rookie to 
win over $1 million on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this alliance is a positive situation for  
everyone,'' Ritts said. ``Potential stars will have a vehicle to 
hone their skills and an additional avenue to qualify for the LPGA, 
and the official relationship ensures the growth and depth of 
talent over the long term for women's golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that it has signed up as the official developmental tour for  
the LPGA, the Futures Tour is trying to find a corporate title 
sponsor, which would help increase purses and make it even more 
attractive to players who did not qualify for the LPGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to open up new markets for them, simply because  
it automatically opens a door to the LPGA,'' Ritts said.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Trade Talks Taper Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- All is quiet on the Roger Clemens front.  
</P>
<P>
	Toronto general manager Gord Ash said Wednesday he's had no  
trade talks involving the five-time Cy Young Award winner since the 
Christmas-New Year break. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll unfold as it should unfold, I guess,'' Ash said when  
asked when talks would resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, exercising a clause in a side agreement between himself  
and the Blue Jays, demanded a trade on Nov. 27, then withdrew the 
demand Dec. 22, criticizing Houston Astros general manager Gerry 
Hunsicker for blasting his request for a $27.4 million, one-year 
contract extension, which would have left the Astros owing him 
$43.5 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, was negotiating with Astros  
owner Drayton McLane even as Hunsicker was criticizing the proposed 
trade and contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said Wednesday he remained interested if the right deal  
with Toronto could be worked out and said he assumed the team's 
relationship with Hendricks had been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't talked to him, but time heals everything,'' McLane  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after Clemens withdrew the formal trade demand, Ash said he  
would still attempt to deal Clemens, who won Cy Young Awards during 
his first two seasons with the Blue Jays. Clemens agreed to a 
$24.75 million, three-year contract with Toronto prior to the 1997 
season, a deal that contains an option for 2000 that already has 
become guaranteed, making the deal worth $31.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Research Ship To Study Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. research ship Ronald H. Brown sets  
off Thursday on a 10-month cruise to study the weather around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	During the effort scientists from several countries will study  
various climate topics, ranging from the way storms interact with 
the ocean to microscopic atmospheric particles that can cool the 
Earth's surface by reflecting sunlight back into space. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration's NOAA Corps, is departing from Norfolk, Va., with 
its first stop scheduled in Cape Town, South Africa. The cruise is 
expected to end in November in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``With its Doppler radar and state-of-the-art capability to  
sample both the ocean and atmosphere simultaneously, Ronald H. 
Brown is the best-equipped ship in the world to handle the 
complexities of the projects that will be carried out during this 
world cruise,'' said Rear Admiral William Stubblefield, director of 
the Office of NOAA Corps Operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The first project during the cruise will involve measuring  
atmospheric particles and gases over the Atlantic and Indian 
Oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data we collect will be used to produce more accurate  
estimates of the cooling due to atmospheric particles,'' said Chief 
Scientist Tim Bates of NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental 
Laboratory in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this information is essential in the study of changes in  
the chemistry of the atmosphere and how those changes affect global 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Other planned projects include:  
</P>
<P>
	--INDOEX, or Indian Ocean Experiment, organized by Paul J.  
Crutzen, director of the Max-Planck Institute for Chemistry in 
Germany and a 1995 Nobel Laureate in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	--Use of the ship's Doppler radar and atmospheric and  
near-surface ocean sensors to investigate how storms and their 
associated strong winds, sun-blocking clouds, and rainfall interact 
with the ocean to modify the sea surface temperature and surface 
current structures. 
</P>
<P>
	--Joint operations with the Japanese research ship Mirai,  
allowing scientists to make measurements with two Doppler radars to 
get a clear picture of vertical motion in storms.

<HEADLINE> GOP Focuses on 'Other Work' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the immense distraction of a Senate  
impeachment trial, Republicans pledged Wednesday to push a 
legislative agenda forward and not to let the spectacle paralyze 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators met through the afternoon to shape priority  
bills on such issues as improving education and cutting taxes. 
Committee chairmen in the House and Senate laid plans for 
high-profile hearings even as the historic trial takes place. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said GOP lawmakers want to prove to  
people -- opinion polls show impeachment is highly unpopular with 
most Americans -- that ``we are continuing to work on their 
interests here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As long as the trial continues, Senate leaders plan to conduct  
regular business in the mornings and hear the case during the 
afternoon. While little real legislative action will occur on the 
floor, normal so early in the year, committees can begin work on 
the budget, nominations and major bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to use every minute that we're not in the  
impeachment trial preparing for our legislative agenda,'' said Sen. 
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted  
Stevens, R-Alaska, called a news conference to declare that the 
spending limits, or caps, for this budget year are $30 billion 
below actual spending levels for fiscal 1999. That means they will 
probably have to be raised to adequately pay for government, 
including more for the military and education, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., circulated a letter Wednesday urging  
colleagues to support legislation he plans to introduce next week 
that could create new ``personal retirement accounts'' using some 
of the projected budget surplus while Congress mulls how to ensure 
Social Security remains solvent. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also is planning  
hearings during the trial on major issues such as Social Security 
overhaul, fast-track trade-negotiating authority for the president 
and the nation's economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans insist this dual track of regular business  
followed by impeachment trial won't shortchange either one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can focus on two things at once,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns,  
R-Mont. ``We're hired for all day, not just part of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats aren't so sure. Minority Leader Tom Daschle,  
D-S.D., supports having committee meetings and bill introductions 
on the floor while the trial continues but not floor debate and 
votes on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think an impeachment trial should be a part-time  
proposition,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``There is nothing on 
the agenda that's more important than this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House, meanwhile, is already finished with impeachment  
except for the 13 managers presenting the case against President 
Clinton in the Senate. Rep. J.C. Watts, the No. 4 Republican in the 
House, said attention on that side of the Capitol is squarely on 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time for us to give Americans weary of bickering,  
fighting and innuendoes the hope they need and the results that 
they deserve,'' Watts, R-Okla, said in a National Press Club 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the House Ways and Means Committee plans next week a  
hearing with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on the 
economic outlook and a session on Social Security with the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson and former Rep. Jack Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have important work to do, and we will hit the ground  
running,'' said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin  
Meehan, D-Mass., promised to push a major campaign finance reform 
measure early in the congressional session.

<HEADLINE> State Planes Used in 2002 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic boosters used state airplanes to  
ferry International Olympic Committee members and others to scenic 
spots during the hunt for the 2002 Winter Games, a state executive 
confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee, a private group of Olympic boosters that  
spearheaded Salt Lake's effort, reimbursed the state $9,561 -- the 
going rate for state agencies -- for eight flights in 1994-95, said 
Tom Warne, executive director of the Utah Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deseret News first reported the story on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Bid Committee used state planes to shuttle IOC  
delegates, sports federation officials and games organizers to 
Page, Ariz., on the shores of Lake Powell, and to Moab, 265 and 195 
miles south of Salt Lake, respectively, and to Jackson, Wyo., 200 
miles north. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight records indicate all eight flights were day trips of no  
longer than three hours each. They began in June 1994 and ended in 
May 1995, a month before the IOC picked Salt Lake City to host the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Two top executives of the Salt Lake Olympic organization have  
resigned and the IOC is calling up to a dozen members to account 
for cash payments, lavish gifts and free medical care Salt Lake 
organizers gave them during the bid. Four investigations, including 
one by the Justice Department, also are under way. 
</P>
<P>
	State employees who arranged the flights at the request of  
Olympic bid officials ``saw the committee as an extension of the 
Department of Economic Development,'' Warne said. ``It was not seen 
as unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt declined Wednesday to say whether it was a  
smart decision for those employees to make, although he noted the 
airplanes are used at times to foster economic development. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airplanes are to be used for interests that further the  
state purposes. ... I assume whoever made the decision decided this 
furthered state purposes,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warne said it's difficult to determine from the records who gave  
the OK to treat the bid committee as a state agency, but it would 
have been within the purview of the transportation department's 
aeronautics division. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate paid by the bid committee was $375 per hour, including  
a pilot, for the King Air B200 twin-engine plane, which made all 
eight flights, Warne said. A second, smaller plane was used on one 
trip in April 1995, at a rate of $180 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	A commercial charter service would have cost the bid committee  
hundreds of dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the IOC members listed in the UDOT flight records are  
Anton Geesink of the Netherlands, Alexandru Siperio of Romania, 
Walther Troeger of Germany and Jim Easton of the United States. 
Family members were along on the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The records also indicate that Vladimir Cernusak of Slovakia and  
David Sikhulumi Sibandze of Swaziland, or family members of each, 
may have been on the trips. It's not clear because the first names 
are spelled differently on the flight records. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Salt Lake bid officials and their spouses, as well as  
officials from Salt Lake City, the Utah Sports Authority and 
various sports federations officials also participated, records 
indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	The state planes typically are used by the governor and state  
agency directors to attend meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Warne said a Federal Aviation Administration rule that took  
effect in 1996 would forbid use of a state's planes by non-state 
employees or those not working directly on state business. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he knew of no other instance of a state  
department lending help to the bid committee.

<HEADLINE> Upcoming Celebrity Birthdays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Steve Earle, Nashville's bad boy  
</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* ``I got me a fearless heart,'' singer-songwriter Steve  
Earle has boasted. ``Strong enough to get you through the scary 
parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Born Stephen Fain Earle on Jan. 17, 1955, in  
Fort Monroe, Va., Earle grew up near San Antonio, Texas. A 
proficient guitarist, he was a veteran of the Texas coffeehouse 
circuit by the time he moved to Nashville, Tenn., in 1974. For the 
next five years, he worked the clubs and shopped for a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1986 debut album, ``Guitar Town,'' coincided with the surge  
of ``New Country'' spearheaded by Randy Travis and Dwight Yoakam. 
The album hit No. 1 on the country charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Earle's fearless rock streak -- combined with graceful lyrics  
about displaced small-town youth -- prompted frequent comparisons to 
Bruce Springsteen. (``Real country and real rock are so close to 
being the same that sometimes they are exactly the same thing,'' 
Earle says.) 
</P>
<P>
	From the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Earle made few inroads  
onto the country charts. And he didn't succeed in the pop sector 
because he wasn't considered an all-out rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	His outspoken ways and wild lifestyle also took their toll. ``I  
did things to make things hard on myself,'' he says. But after his 
release from a drug rehabilitation program in 1995, Earle began to 
fight his way back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music business has left Earle for dead so many times that  
no one really expects him to bounce back anymore,'' said an article 
in Newsweek in 1995. ``So in his utmost ornery fashion, that's 
exactly what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Update:* While still in his teens, Earle was hanging around  
legendary Texas singer/songwriters Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark, 
and his songs have continued to feed Nashville. Emmylou Harris and 
Patty Loveless are among those who have recorded his songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earle was named No. 1 country artist in Rolling Stone magazine's  
recent critics' poll. And his album, ``El Corazon,'' was nominated 
for a 1999 Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote:* ``All my albums are about the same thing. Me. It's just  
the way I see things and you see things different at 40 than you 
did at 31, especially if you get to be 40 the way I did.''

<HEADLINE> Denny's Sued for Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The Denny's chain launched a $2 million  
anti-racism campaign on the same day employees at one of its 
restaurants were accused of racial discrimination in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Tuesday in Superior Court accuses employees at a  
San Jose Denny's of making a group of 17 people, all but one of 
whom is Hispanic, wait as other patrons were seated, refusing them 
service and summoning the police to have them ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages for the April  
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Denny's announced that it would run three racial  
diversity ads on broadcast networks and cable television. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do through all the lessons we have  
learned -- obviously difficult lessons -- is to get people to talk 
about race,'' said Jim Adamson, chief executive of South 
Carolina-based Advantica Restaurant Group Inc., Denny's parent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Denny's has been haunted by charges of racism for years. In  
1994, the chain paid $45.7 million to settle a discrimination 
lawsuit by black customers. Denny's employees now are required to 
undergo anti-discrimination sensitivity training. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims the group watched as non-Hispanic customers  
who arrived later were seated before them. Denny's has not received 
a copy of the lawsuit, spokeswoman Karen Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Planes Attack Iraqi Defenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the third straight day, American warplanes  
attacked air defense sites in northern Iraq on Wednesday, and the 
Clinton administration said military pressure would continue as 
long as Iraq kept threatening U.S. pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The string of confrontations in Iraq, which began after a  
mid-December bombing campaign by British and American forces and 
has accelerated this week, is raising speculation that President 
Clinton might order a new bombing campaign to silence Iraq's air 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters the  
administration intended to continue its policy of applying economic 
and military pressure, but he said there were other options. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a credible and robust threat of force in the region if  
we determine that that needs to be used,'' Lockhart said, referring 
to U.S. land- and sea-based air power in the Persian Gulf area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said eight more F-16 attack planes and four KC-135  
refueling planes will arrive in the area this week to beef up 
Operation Northern Watch, the ``no-fly'' zone enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart indicated the administration believes that with his  
defiance, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is losing a battle of 
attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a policy of containing Saddam Hussein since the end  
of the Gulf War, and that policy is based on crippling economic 
sanctions that have cost him $120 billion, at least, since the end 
of the war; degrading his ability to threaten his neighbors and to 
reconstitute or deliver weapons of mass destruction,'' Lockhart 
said. ``And that's the policy we're going to continue to pursue 
until we see some positive change and some indication that Saddam 
Hussein is willing to disarm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's incident, Iraq fired at least one surface-to-air  
missile at a flight of four U.S. Air Force F-15E and other American 
planes patrolling the ``no-fly'' zone over northern Iraq, but 
missed, according to U.S. officials. Iraq's air defense command 
claimed the missile hit an ``enemy'' plane. It has made similar 
claims in previous incidents which proved to be untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the confrontation near the city of Mosul, F-15s fired two  
AGM-130 precision-guided missiles at the air defense site, and U.S. 
officials said the missiles scored ``direct hits.'' Iraq claimed 
four American missiles struck a house in a civilian area. It made 
no mention of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, F-16CJ attack planes and Marine Corps EA-6B  
electronic warfare planes fired three HARM missiles, which travel 
at supersonic speed and are designed to destroy radars. U.S. 
officials did not say whether the HARM missiles reached their 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The American planes returned safely to their base in Turkey,  
U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents underscored an increasingly aggressive Iraqi  
challenge to the ``no-fly'' zones enforced by American and British 
planes. Iraq has nearly doubled the number of surface-to-air 
missile batteries in the restricted flight zones and has been using 
them with increasing frequency to threaten allied pilots, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said two Iraqi aircraft violated the southern  
``no-fly'' zone on Wednesday and two in the northern zone. There 
were no U.S. or allied planes nearby to respond, they said.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Predicts Reform Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying there are no ``quick answers'' for what  
ails the global economy, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin predicted 
a prolonged period in which policy makers will have to struggle to 
implement necessary reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging interview, Rubin listed Brazil as among the  
chief concerns at the moment while also pointing to the economic 
mess in Russia and Japan's continuing struggles to right its own 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Global markets, which had gone through a period of relative calm  
following a tumultuous fall, were rocked again today when the head 
of Brazil's central bank abruptly resigned and his replacement 
effectively devalued the country's currency by 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 250 points  
in the first half-hour of trading as investors worried that events 
in Brazil could trigger another round of turbulence in emerging 
markets around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who met with reporters Tuesday before the latest crisis  
in Brazil, said that a lot of hard work remained to be done to 
reform the global financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have looked for magic wands and quick answers and there  
are no magic wands and there are no quick answers,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about Brazil on Tuesday, he refused to discuss what the  
United States and other rich nations would do if the $41.5 billion 
rescue package put together by the International Monetary Fund last 
November begins to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
	The international support was provided to Brazil under IMF terms  
that required Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to 
impose an economic austerity program, something he has had trouble 
winning political backing to implement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brazil program should work,'' Rubin said. ``Politics is  
obviously the key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As other potential trouble spots, Rubin listed Russia's economic  
travails, Thailand's efforts to deal with debt-laden corporations, 
Indonesia and the open question of whether Japan will be able to 
put together an economic pump-priming program that will pull it out 
of its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the stock market turbulence, the U.S. economy so far  
has been able to weather the foreign storms, with a rising trade 
deficit the only blot on an economic expansion that in December 
became the longest period of uninterrupted peacetime growth in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, Rubin said he held the same view as private economists  
that the economy may slow a bit but still turn in a healthy 
performance with low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin ducked a question about whether he was concerned that  
foreigners could become spooked by a lengthy impeachment trial and 
start pulling their investments out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of worrying about that, Rubin said it was important for  
the administration to continue pursuing sound economic policies, 
including reforming Social Security and protecting the budget 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ``has been enormously focused'' on preparing  
the new budget, Social Security reform and the international 
economy, Rubin said. These are the types of issues that will have a 
big role in determining ``the confidence of foreign investors in 
our economy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Rubin, the 26-year Wall Street veteran, has stayed  
around to guide Clinton's economic policy, has also been seen as a 
key to the rebound on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his plans in 1999, Rubin indicated he was staying  
put. ``I am focused on the issues in front of me and that has been 
my focus,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said it was far too soon to declare that the economic  
crisis that began in Thailand in July 1997 has finally bottomed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a crystal ball and I don't have a lot of  
confidence in other people's crystal balls,'' he said. ``What you 
can do is identify the issues you need to work on and just keep 
working at the problems that lie ahead. That is what we have been 
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Stocks Recover From Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet stocks quickly rebounded from a sharp  
selloff this morning as bargain hunters took the sudden discounts 
as an opportunity to capitalize on the stunning rally in the 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	With market-wide worries about new financial turmoil in Brazil  
overshadowing another strong profit report from Yahoo!, today's 
volatile swings demonstrated just how vulnerable Internet stocks 
are to any sudden mood change among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online fell as much as $23.62 1/2 to $130 and Yahoo! fell  
as much as $66.87 1/2 to $335.50, leading a broad market retreat that 
initially sliced more than 200 points off the Dow Jones industrial 
average and more than 100 points off the technology-dominated 
Nasdaq composite index. By late morning, AOL had recovered to about 
$148 and Yahoo! had bounced back to about $400. 
</P>
<P>
	The early selling came despite late Tuesday's impressive  
fourth-quarter report from Yahoo! in which the Internet site 
operator revealed that fourth-quarter sales had nearly tripled to 
$76.4 million compared with the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the day's lows, the losses were rather marginal compared  
with the huge gains racked up by Internet-related shares in recent 
months. Having more than tripled in share price since early 
October, Yahoo!'s market value is more a reflection of a presumably 
rosy future on the World Wide Web than the company's performance 
toward the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Empowered by easy clicks, tiny trading costs and passionate  
feelings about the Web's potential for everything, online investors 
have helped fuel the buying frenzy, which most professionals call 
perilous. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual funds and other big investors, which are usually  
responsible for driving the market, have largely kept to the 
sidelines during this rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fear that a downturn such as today's may snowball into  
something worse, especially if lesser-known Internet players can't 
post fourth-quarter results as pleasing as Yahoo!'s in the coming 
days and weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of these companies don't even have profits, and will only  
need to show higher sales or even declining losses in order to 
spark even more buying of their shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the slightest disappointment could cause a major reversal.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the chief reasons why individual investors are venturing  
into waters that the professionals are avoiding is that the 
Internet itself has made it so easy for people to move in and out 
of stocks every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have firms advertising that they can set up people as day  
traders. Give them `X' amount of money, and they'll give you the 
software and the machinery,'' said Barry Berman, head trader at 
Robert W. Baird, a Milwaukee-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Most eye-catching in this high-stakes game have been the daily  
moonshots fueled by Internet-related announcements from online 
newcomers and older companies trying to reinvent themselves. Last 
November, for instance, book store operator Books-A-Million 
announced the revamping of its Web site and saw its shares triple 
in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	On any given day, and for no apparent reason, an industry  
``veteran'' such as Yahoo! can soar 20 percent from levels that 
already represent a 1,000 percent gain in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since professional money managers must report their performance  
to clients once a month, they have a strong incentive to stick with 
companies that have more dependable profits and stable share 
prices. Surprisingly, the investors who do seem willing to take 
chances are those with far less experience and much shallower 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, you don't see institutions paying the kind of  
(prices) you've got on those kinds of stocks,'' said Berman. He 
noted that a large amount of trading in Internet-related companies 
is being conducted in 200- or 300-share blocks rather than the 
thousands often bought and sold in each trade by major portfolio 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the few mutual funds that bill themselves as cyber-minded  
rarely stray beyond the big names like AOL and Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	The Robertson Stephens Information Age Fund, which normally  
devotes about 65 percent of its portfolio to the information 
technology industry, counted America Online, Amazon.com and Yahoo! 
among its top ten holdings at the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	But those three stocks accounted for only about 13 percent of  
the fund's holdings, while about a third of its assets were tied up 
in plain old hardware and software giants such as Intel, Microsoft 
and Compaq Computer.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Advance Mastectomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The increasingly common practice of removing both breasts while  
they are still healthy is an effective, if radical, way of 
preventing breast cancer in women at high risk of the disease, a 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were first reported by The Associated Press in 1997  
when they were released at a medical conference in San Diego. They 
are now being published in Thursday's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said they consider prophylactic mastectomy, as  
it is called, to be at least 90 percent effective in reducing 
breast cancer. It's not totally effective because the disease may 
already have silently spread before the breasts are removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lynn C. Hartmann and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic  
reviewed the cases of 639 women who had both breasts removed 
because of their family history of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 425 considered to be at moderate risk, 37 cases of  
breast cancer would have been expected after 14 years of follow-up. 
Only four actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors also followed the sisters of the 214 considered at  
high risk. None of these sisters got prophylactic mastectomies, and 
39 percent developed breast cancer. By comparison, just over 1 
percent of the high-risk women getting mastectomies later had 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can only be viewed as good news for women who are  
considering this option and even better news for women who have 
already undergone the procedure,'' Drs. Andrea Eisen and Barbara L. 
Weber wrote in an accompanying editorial.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Cut Losses; Dow Down 88.02 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A growing financial crisis in Brazil rattled  
investors today, but an early stock market plunge was largely 
erased after President Clinton said the United States and its 
allies were working to keep Latin America's economy from becoming 
the world's latest trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was off 88.02 at 9,385.86 in  
late afternoon trading, but had regained most of its lost ground 
after falling as far as 261.58 points earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more dramatic was the swing in the technology-heavy Nasdaq  
composite index, which was up 22.79 at 2,343.54, recovering from a 
plunge of nearly 5 percent, or 114.56 points, in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was heavy, with about 938 million shares changing hands  
on the New York Stock Exchange by late afternoon -- well above 
Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop came after the head of Brazil's central bank, Gustavo  
Franco, resigned and his replacement effectively devalued the 
country's battered currency in hopes of stemming its financial 
crisis. Investors feared that the tumult in Latin America's biggest 
economy would infect the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton helped soothe some worries by saying that U.S.  
officials had discussed the turmoil with key officials in Brazil, 
the G-7 organization of wealthy industrial nations, other countries 
and the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States had worked hard to keep the  
financial crisis in Asia from spreading to Brazil, which is the 
fastest-growing market for American goods and services. ``We're 
working to that end and we'll continue to do so,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Brazil's new top central banker, Francisco Lopes,  
allowed the country's currency, the real, to trade in a wider band 
against the U.S. dollar and its value fell 8 percent against the 
U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, opened in  
a free fall and dropped 10 percent before rebounding. The index was 
down 3.9 percent in late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The jitters spread to markets throughout Europe and Latin  
America. London's main stock index closed down 3 percent, while 
Paris fell 3.3 percent and Frankfurt slid 4.1 percent. Mexico's 
main stock index was down 3.7 percent in late afternoon and other 
Latin American markets followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	As foreign markets tumbled, the U.S. bond market rallied. The  
yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the 
opposite direction of price, fell to 5.16 percent from 5.21 percent 
late Tuesday. Bonds are often seen as a safe haven in times of 
international economic unrest.

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Decline in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices charged by producers such as factories,  
food-processing plants and oil refineries edged down 0.1 percent in 
1998, declining for a record second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices plunged 1.2 percent in 1997, the steepest drop in 11  
years, and slipped further in 1998 as the world economic slump 
depressed demand for oil, manufactured goods and farm commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	The two years marked the first back-to-back drops in the Labor  
Department's Producer Price Index since the department began 
compiling it in 1947. However, the brief era of deflation may be 
drawing to a close. Economists are predicting a modest increase 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices will firm in 1999 as the world economy stabilizes, but  
I don't think they'll rise to any significant degree,'' said 
economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West 
Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, producer prices for finished goods jumped a  
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent, the most in 15 months, driven up 
by a stunning 30.7 percent jump in prices charged by cigarette 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tobacco prices are soaring to pay for the settlement with  
attorneys general in many states,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak 
of Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released late Tuesday, was not scheduled for release  
until today. However, it was inadvertently posted early Tuesday 
afternoon for about an hour on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 
Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second such early release of market-sensitive data  
via the Internet. The last was in November, with job-growth 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement today, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said she was  
``deeply troubled and dismayed'' by the latest slip. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics Commissioner Katharine G. Abraham said it was the 
result of ``a computer programming error.'' She said 40 to 50 saw 
the report during trading hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Her special assistant, William Parks, said, ``We don't believe  
there was any market impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the year, including December, falling or flat energy  
and food prices have helped offset modest inflation in other goods. 
But in December, that wasn't enough to offset the tobacco rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices fell 2.3 percent in December and food prices  
slipped 0.1 percent. But goods other than food and energy, 
so-called core prices, jumped 1 percent, the most in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, a 1 percent increase in core prices would be enough to  
raise concern at the Federal Reserve and spark market speculation 
over the prospect for an interest-rate increase. But, excluding 
cigarettes, core prices actually fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's largely tobacco prices and that was something we knew  
about. I don't think there's any news here,'' Fed Vice Chairwoman 
Alice Rivlin said on CNN's ``Moneyline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, energy prices plunged 12.1 percent -- including a 34.1  
percent drop for gasoline. Food prices edged 0.1 percent lower for 
the year. Wholesale pork prices fell 26.9 percent and fruit and 
vegetables fell 20.9 percent, offsetting a 10.8 percent increase 
for dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for goods other than food and energy rose 2.4 percent  
last year after showing no change the year before. Sharp currency 
devaluations, primarily in Asia, lowered the prices on imported 
manufactured goods. That, in turn, forced domestic producers to 
match price cuts. Computer prices fell 25.9 percent; home 
electronic equipment, 1.8 percent, and toys, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a shift in the value of the dollar, from an eight-year  
high of 147 yen in August to a 28-month low of 108 yen on Monday, 
may keep prices of imports from falling further. 
</P>
<P>
	A Labor Department report on prices paid by consumers for both  
goods and services in December is scheduled for release Thursday. 
They rose at a 12-year low annual rate of 1.6 percent through the 
first 11 months of the year.

<HEADLINE> IOC Rules Out Action Vs. Salt Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC has ruled out sanctions against Salt Lake  
City officials in connection with the Olympics' biggest corruption 
scandal, an IOC investigator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission will not recommend any action against Salt Lake  
City,'' said Jacques Rogge, a member of the IOC panel looking into 
allegations of bribery in the city's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. ``There is no action to be taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge confirmed that up to 12 International Olympic Committee  
members have been implicated in the inquiry but rejected calls for 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch's resignation as 
``ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the IOC was prepared to investigate charges of  
corruption in other host city election campaigns, including claims 
that Sydney officials were approached for bribes during their 
successful bid for the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, a Belgian member of the IOC's executive board, said the  
six-man investigative panel had considered sanctions against Salt 
Lake officials connected with the 2002 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said such action was ruled out when the organizing  
committee's two top officials, president Frank Joklik and vice 
president Dave Johnson, resigned last week amid four investigations 
of cash payments, lavish gifts and scholarships from Salt Lake 
bidders to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who were in the bid are no more,'' Rogge said in a  
telephone interview. ``They took the actions they thought were 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
board, said he had been assured Salt Lake would not be punished if 
it took action to root out bid officials responsible for lavish 
gifts and payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we been sinister, hiding and not acted swiftly in  
separating ourselves from the bid committee, somebody could have 
asked for something different,'' Garff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the bid committee, Tom Welch, also is no longer  
associated with the games. He resigned as president of the 
organizing committee last year after being charged with spouse 
abuse, and Joklik said the organizing committee would end Welch's 
pension and $10,000-a-month consulting contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only action we could have discussed was against the people  
in the bid committee who were still on the organizing committee,'' 
Rogge said. ``As they have resigned, there is definitely no need 
for action. This does not imply any judgment on their behavior at 
this stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he understood that ``around a dozen'' IOC members had  
been implicated in the investigation of Salt Lake. Letters were 
sent to those members this week demanding an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC panel meets Jan. 23 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to  
conclude its findings, and will make recommendations to the full 
executive board the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said that any members found guilty of corruption  
will be ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the board cannot expel members and can only recommend  
expulsion to the full IOC assembly, which next meets in June. But 
he said members would be free to resign before that. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the executive board could also recommend sanctions  
short of expulsion, such as censure or fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is open,'' he said. ``I rule out nothing.''  
</P>
<P>
	While the executive board will propose possible changes in the  
selection process for host cities, any decision will need approval 
of the full IOC, he said. Samaranch has proposed stripping the 
assembly of the vote and leaving the decision to the executive 
board or other small group. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rogge said the board can take ``provisional measures,'' such  
as banning visits of IOC members to the six cities bidding for the 
2006 Winter Olympics. Those games will be awarded next June. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, Rogge said the IOC was prepared to look  
into allegations by an Australian official that he was approached 
for bribes during Sydney's 2000 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Baird, a former New South Wales state Olympics minister  
who was on Sydney's bid committee, claimed that one IOC member and 
an intermediary sought cash in exchange for votes. One approach had 
come from someone claiming to represent African delegates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird said he had provided several pages of information to Kevan  
Gosper, an Australian member of the IOC executive board. Gosper 
said he would bring it to the rest of the board's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, who is chairman of the IOC's oversight commission for the  
Sydney Games, said the IOC would welcome any concrete evidence that 
Baird or others have to offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a mandate to look into any possible form of  
corruption,'' he said. ``It is not limited to Salt Lake City. What 
we need is documented evidence, declarations, recollections. If 
someone says, `I have to spoken to so-and-so,' this is not grounds 
for bringing charges against people. This is a trial. You need 
evidence. Without evidence, we can't do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry panel could be reconvened if hard evidence on other  
bids is presented in the future, Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird urged Samaranch to resign over the Olympic scandal,  
joining calls from Ken Bullock, a member of Salt Lake's organizing 
committee, and Robert Helmick, a former U.S. member of the IOC who 
resigned in an ethics scandal in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said there was no reason for Samaranch to step down.  
</P>
<P>
	``Samaranch is not voting and he is not a corrupt man,  
absolutely not,'' he said. ``Why should someone resign at a moment 
of crisis? We need leadership. We do not need resignations. ... It 
would be ridiculous. The leader of the Olympic movement has the 
responsibility to solve the problem, not to go away.'

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Kelly McGillis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In her new film, ``At First Sight,'' Kelly  
McGillis plays a woman who is devoted to her blind brother. Her 
character struggles with her brother's decision to have 
experimental surgery that could give him sight. 
</P>
<P>
	The brother is played by Val Kilmer, whose quiet life is  
disrupted when he meets Mira Sorvino, a stressed-out Manhattan 
architect who falls in love with him. Sorvino wants Kilmer to know 
the world outside the limits of his small town. McGillis worries 
about what might happen if Kilmer leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``At First Sight,'' directed by Irwin Winkler, is based on a  
true story, documented by Dr. Oliver Sacks in ``An Anthropologist 
on Mars.'' Although based on fact, the film is not a medical 
documentary; it is a story of love and family relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting contrast,'' says Winkler, ``is that here is a  
blind man who you would think is so afflicted that he wouldn't be 
happy, who is very, very happy. And here is a woman who is very 
attractive and lives in New York and has a very successful career, 
who you think would be happy, but who isn't satisfied with her own 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there is the sister, played by McGillis, who cooks  
her brother's meals and checks to make sure that everything in his 
house is in order. Enter Sorvino, who changes everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Change, for many people, is a frightening and scary thing,''  
said McGillis. She's seated at a small breakfast table in a 
Manhattan hotel room. She is tall and slender, and her 
brownish-blond hair is clipped in short curls that frame her face. 
Her intellect impresses, and her laughter warms the room on a cold 
winter day. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really attracted me to the part is that change doesn't  
necessarily have to be a frightening, terrifying thing. That we 
should all be able to embrace change on some kind of level, even 
though sometimes it's painful, but sometimes that pain is something 
that one has to go through to get to the next level in life,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	McGillis, 41, has played many different roles since her film  
debut opposite Tom Conti in ``Reuben, Reuben'' in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the gentle young Amish beauty in ``Witness,'' a tough  
public prosecutor in ``The Accused'' and Tom Cruise's flight 
instructor in ``Top Gun.'' (Kilmer also appeared in ``Top Gun.'') 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of New York's prestigious Juilliard School, she has  
performed regularly with The Shakespeare Company in Washington, 
D.C., including ``Twelfth Night,'' ``Mourning Becomes Electra'' and 
``The Merchant of Venice.'' Other roles include the TV miniseries, 
``The Third Twin,'' and the films, ``The House on Carroll Street'' 
with Jeff Daniels and ``Made in Heaven,'' opposite Timothy Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
	She is married to businessman Fred Tillman. They have two  
daughters, ages 8 and 5, and they run their own restaurant in Key 
West, Fla., where the family lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Her upcoming films include ``The Settlement'' with John C.  
Reilly and ``Morgan's Ferry'' opposite Billy Zane. 
</P>
<P>
	McGillis described her character in ``Morgan's Ferry'' as a  
lonely farm woman of the 1950s who ``has kind of checked out of the 
world and is influenced by three escaped prisoners who greatly 
affect her life and open her eyes to living again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what about ``The Settlement''?  
</P>
<P>
	``I play kind of buffed-up trailer trash,'' she said. ``Big  
hair, lots of fake gold jewelry. Big high shoes and trashy mouth 
you would not believe!'' And yes, she laughs, she's not going to 
let her daughters see this film until they're much older. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Was there anything in particular that attracted you to ``At  
First Sight''? 
</P>
<P>
	McGillis: The story. The cast. The director. The part. Pretty  
much the whole package. I liked the fact that for me what it had to 
say is that everybody is kind of blinded by their own limitations 
and the limitations that other people put on them. Whether or not 
you have sight or not. And I rather liked that, and that everybody 
in the film was affected by the event in some way or other. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What was the most challenging aspect of your role?  
</P>
<P>
	McGillis: Playing somebody who is overly protective and not  
being mean about it. Having to create some kind of sympathy, to 
allow people to know why someone is that way, that it's not just a 
blanket statement that you're overprotective and thereby you are 
intolerant and tough and all those things, but that the character 
had some kind of vulnerability about her and the reasons why she 
was that way. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Was there a sister in real life?  
</P>
<P>
	McGillis: I know it was based on a true story. But I just took  
it from what I was given because if I'd read something and did find 
out that there wasn't a sister or that this was a made-up character 
or that she was somebody really real, then I would have felt 
compelled to be her. And I wanted it to be more based on the 
relationship that we were creating at the time. I think it's hard 
when you do something like this. Unless you're doing something 
really biographical, I think there's a danger in trying to create 
the real person because this is a story for a film, you know, it's 
not a book, and thereby you're taking artistic licenses anyway, I 
think, in terms of telling the story. You're not giving the full 
detail and sometimes you can muddle your mind with that. I mean, if 
I were doing Mary Queen of Scots, yes, then that would be a 
different thing, you know, somebody who is literally a historical 
figure that everyone is somewhat familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
	3 1/2. Is Mary Queen of Scots someone you'd like to do?  
</P>
<P>
	McGillis (laughing): Oh yes, someday I guess.  
</P>
<P>
	4. You've appeared onstage and in films. Do you have a  
preference? 
</P>
<P>
	McGillis: No. It's all acting. Acting is acting, no matter what  
medium you're doing it in. Whether it be a play, a film, a TV show. 
... I just like acting. I don't have an attitude about what medium 
I do it in. I just feel fortunate to be able to work. ... I've been 
very busy the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Which is more challenging? Your work as an actress or being a  
mom? 
</P>
<P>
	McGillis: I love acting but I also love being a mom. ... It's  
always a challenge to try to balance the two. I think that's true 
of any working mom. But I don't know anybody in my circle of 
friends who can afford to be a stay-at-home mom anymore. It's 
always a tough thing of balancing that guilt. It's also a two-way 
street. My kids get to travel a lot, they get a lot of different 
experiences, they get to see great Shakespeare plays. They get to 
know it's work what I do, it's not all fun and games, that it's 
hard work, that there's a commitment to what I do.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Property To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson's Heisman Trophy, his No. 32  
football jerseys, carpets, paintings and Tiffany-style lamps will 
go on the auction block Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fairly small auction but a very high-profile one,''  
Levi Morgan, spokesman for Butterfield and Butterfield, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	High profile does not mean highly profitable. Half the items  
consist of memorabilia, and dealers in sports collectibles say 
nobody wants Simpson items anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction will come nowhere close to satisfying a $33.5  
million judgment owed to the estate of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and the family of Ronald Goldman. The judgment comes from 
a civil wrongful death suit in which a jury found Simpson liable 
for the killings of Ms. Simpson and Goldman. Simpson was acquitted 
of murder in an earlier criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction will have 80 lots of property for sale, with some of  
the smaller pieces grouped together in one number. 
</P>
<P>
	The most valuable piece is the Heisman Trophy awarded to Simpson  
in 1968 as college football's best player. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers in sports memorabilia said there will be a market for  
the Heisman Trophy because it is so unique. Other items would be 
hard to move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back at our records, we've had no inquiries or sales  
of Simpson stuff,'' said Brooke Tabak of Champion Sports 
Collectibles. ``We have some of his rookie cards and autographed 
lithos and photos, but nobody's calling for any of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson continues to live in Los Angeles with his two young  
children. He has appealed the civil trial verdict, but lawyers have 
said this doesn't prevent the auction from going forward.

<HEADLINE> Snow, Ice Pile Up in North States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Driving through slush and dodging other drivers  
during a three-hour commute that normally takes only 20 minutes, 
Richard Heavenrich let out a piercing scream. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have to apologize for his rush-hour outburst along his  
trek from suburban Troy to his home in Huntington Woods. After all, 
Heavenrich is a clinical psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew no one could hear me,'' he recalled Tuesday, laughing.  
``People often don't know how to let out tension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michiganians who pride themselves on toughing it out during  
winter's worst are facing one of their biggest challenges in years. 
</P>
<P>
	A fierce storm rivaling the Jan. 2 blizzard battered the eastern  
Lower Peninsula overnight, dropping a foot of snow in less than 24 
hours in the southeast town of Lexington. Up to 5 inches fell in 
the Detroit area, bringing its total to more than 22.3 inches so 
far this winter, compared with the 23 inches for all of last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Upper Peninsula, Sault Ste. Marie has a seasonal total of  
63.4 inches, with 25.1 of that falling just this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow and ice also piled up elsewhere around the Great Lakes  
states today. Milwaukee got 4.5 inches for a total this season of 
26 inches and Indiana police closed an icy 36-mile stretch of 
Interstate 70 east of Indianapolis because it was littered with 
accidents. Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon today asked President 
Clinton for federal aid to help local governments pay for removing 
snow and ice that have accumulated since New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got off (work) this morning I could barely get my door  
open there was so much ice,'' Nona Nesvold said as she gassed up 
her vehicle on the way home to Waynetown, Ind., after working an 
overnight shift. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of Michigan's public and private schools were closed  
today and many more were closed in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for people who don't have to drive or otherwise venture  
outside, the constantly cloudy sky and short daylight hours are 
stressful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call it the hibernation syndrome. You get the feeling that  
you want to curl up and don't want to move,'' said Heavenrich, an 
associate vice president for behavioral services for Henry Ford 
Health System in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred miles east, residents of Buffalo, N.Y., needed  
National Guardsmen to help weary plow drivers with that city's 
ever-growing piles of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's constant,'' said cafe owner Colleen Tomczak. ``Every day  
you open the window and look out and there it is again. When's it 
going to end?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good question. Since the beginning of winter on Dec. 22, there  
have been only three days without snow in Buffalo: Dec. 27, 28 and 
Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, as of today Buffalo has had its snowiest two-week  
period on record, with 51.5 inches. An additional 1 to 3 inches was 
forecast today, with flurries continuing through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are coming in who are affected by a combination of  
unrelenting snow and the end of the holidays,'' said Robin 
Harrison, a clinical psychologist from Orchard Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, you'll get a few days break before the next weather  
system sets up,'' National Weather Service forecaster Mike Pukajlo 
said of the Buffalo area. ``Here, it's been just one right after 
another.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Realignment Put Off Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Baseball's grand realignment plan has  
been put off for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams will stay in the same divisions for the 2000 season, the  
owner in charge of the sport's realignment and scheduling committee 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig, who two years ago pushed for a radical  
realignment plan in which more than a dozen teams would have 
switched divisions or leagues, had hoped for more realignment in 
2000, the first year Arizona and Tampa Bay can be shifted without 
their approval. 
</P>
<P>
	But a draft schedule must be given to the players' association  
by the end of June and committee head John Harrington, the chief 
executive officer of the Boston Red Sox, said he had instructed 
American and National League officials to draw up a 2000 schedule 
with the current alignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're waiting to see what happens with these franchises in  
flux: Montreal, Minnesota, Oakland,'' Harrington said. ``If they 
move, there would have to be some sort of realignment. But we can't 
forecast that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos, Twins and Athletics all are seeking new ballparks.  
The Twins had discussions about a possible move to Charlotte, N.C., 
but those talks fell through and Minnesota extended its lease at 
the Metrodome through the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland periodically has talked about moving to San Jose but  
last month agreed to stay at the Oakland Coliseum for at least 
three more seasons. Montreal has talking about a possible move if 
it doesn't get a new ballpark and the team's current owners are 
seeking to sell the franchise to local buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig and some other owners are in favor of realigning leagues  
and divisions geographically. But some teams don't want to change 
leagues and be in the same divisions as intracity rivals. For 
instance, the New York Mets objected to being in the same division 
as the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington said he hopes grand realignment will happen but  
doesn't know when. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not giving up on it,'' he said. ``It's one of those  
long-term things.''

<HEADLINE> Southwest Airlines Jet Diverted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A Southwest Airlines flight bound for San  
Jose landed in Burbank to remove a man who threatened the crew and 
other passengers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Mendez, 34, ``threatened bodily harm to our flight crew,''  
said Ginger Hardage, a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based airline. 
She would not elaborate and did not know what prompted the outburst 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wanted to be taken to Hollywood,'' said Burbank  
airport spokesman Sean McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 74 passengers or five crew members was injured, and  
the plane continued on to San Jose after a 30-minute delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Mendez was booked for investigation of alleged violations of  
federal aircraft piracy and flight crew interference codes. Bail 
was not immediately set.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Legal Briefs -2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky had very much in her mind that she would do what  
she could to conceal the relationship -- a modus operandi she 
herself acknowledged well predated the Jones litigation. That she 
took such steps does not mean that the president knew of or 
participated in them. Indeed, it appears that the entire 
gift-concealment plan arose not from any plan suggested by the 
president -- which the Committee Report so desperately struggles to 
maintain -- but rather more innocently from the actions of a young 
woman taking steps she thought were best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky have testified under oath that  
there was no causal connection between the job search and the 
affidavit. The only person to draw (or, actually, recommend) any 
such linkage was Ms. Tripp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``First, there is simply no direct evidence to support the  
job-for-silence obstruction theory. From her initial proffer to the 
last minutes of her grand jury appearance, the testimony of Ms. 
Lewinsky has been clear and consistent: She was never asked or 
encouraged to lie or promised a job for her silence or for a 
favorable affidavit. Mr. Jordan has been equally unequivocal on 
this point. Second, the `chain of events' circumstantial case upon 
which this obstruction allegation must rest falls apart after 
inspection of the full evidentiary record. Ms. Lewinsky's job 
search began on her own volition and long before she was ever a 
witness in the Jones case. Mr. Jordan's assistance originated with 
a request from Ms. Currie, which had no connection to events in the 
Jones litigation. No pressure was applied to anyone at any time. 
And Ms. Lewinsky's ultimate hiring had absolutely no connection to 
her signing of the affidavit in the Jones case. Viewed on this 
unambiguous record, the job-search allegations are plainly 
unsupportable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The law, of course, imposes no obligation on a client to  
monitor every statement and representation made by his or her 
lawyer. Particularly in the confines of an ongoing civil 
deposition, where clients are routinely counseled to focus on the 
questions posed of them and their responses and ignore all 
distractions, it is totally inappropriate to try to remove a 
president from office because of a statement by his attorney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as the president could not have intended to influence the  
testimony of `witness' Betty Currie because she was neither an 
actual nor a prospective witness, so too is it equally clear that 
the president never pressured Ms. Currie to alter her recollection. 
Such lack of real or perceived pressure also fatally undercuts this 
charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This article asserts that the president should be impeached  
and removed from office because he failed to be candid with his 
friends and aides about the nature of his relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky. These allegedly impeachable denials took place in the 
immediate aftermath of the Lewinsky publicity -- at the very time 
the president was denying any improper relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky in nearly identical terms on national television. Having 
made this announcement to the whole country on television, it is 
simply absurd to believe that he was somehow attempting corruptly 
to influence the testimony of aides when he told them virtually the 
same thing at the same time. Rather, the evidence demonstrates that 
the president spoke with these individuals regarding the 
allegations because of the long-standing professional and personal 
relationships he shared with them and the corresponding 
responsibility he felt to address their concerns once the 
allegations were aired. The managers point to no evidence -- for 
there is none -- that the president spoke to these individuals for 
any other reason, and certainly not that he spoke with them 
intending to obstruct any proceeding. They simply assert that since 
he knew there was an investigation, his intent had to be that they 
relate his remarks to the investigators and grand jurors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------

	``However, there is no allegation that the president attempted  
to influence these aides' testimony about their own personal 
knowledge or observations. Nor is there any evidence that the 
president knew any of these aides would ultimately be witnesses in 
the grand jury when he spoke with them. None was under subpoena at 
the time the denials took place and none had any independent 
knowledge of any sexual activity between the president and Ms. 
Lewinsky. Indeed, the only evidence these witnesses could offer on 
this score was the hearsay repetition of the same public denials 
that the members of the grand jury likely heard on their home 
television sets. Under the strained theory of this article, every 
person who heard the president's public denial could have been 
called to the grand jury to create still additional obstructions of 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``First, by charging multiple wrongs in one article, the House  
of Representatives has made it impossible for the Senate to comply 
with the Constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the 
concurrence of two-thirds of the members. Since Senate rules 
require that an entire article be voted as a unit, sixty-seven 
Senators could conceivably vote to convict while in wide 
disagreement as to the alleged wrong committed -- for example, they 
could completely disagree on what statement they believe is false -- 
in direct violation of the Constitutional requirements of 
`concurrence' and due process. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, by charging perjury without identifying a single  
allegedly perjurious statement, and charging obstruction of justice 
without identifying a single allegedly obstructive action by the 
president, the House of Representatives has failed to inform the 
Senate either of the statements it agreed were perjurious (if it 
agreed) or of the actual conduct by the president that it agreed 
constituted obstruction of justice (again, if it agreed). The 
result is that the president does not have the most basic notice of 
the charges against him required by due process and fundamental 
fairness. He is not in a position to defend against anything other 
than a moving target. The guesswork involved even in identifying 
the charges to be addressed in this Trial Memorandum highlights 
just how flawed the articles are.''

<HEADLINE> Chris Ford Hired As Clippers Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chris Ford, clearly relishing the underdog  
role, was introduced as coach of the Los Angeles Clippers on 
Wednesday and spoke of quickly guiding the team back to 
respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	Fired as coach of the Milwaukee Bucks last August, Ford succeeds  
Bill Fitch, who was fired nearly nine months ago after guiding the 
Clippers to a 17-65 record, third-worst in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had conversations with a lot of people in this league  
about Chris Ford,'' Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor said 
during a Los Angeles Convention Center news conference. ``I've 
heard nothing but positive reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an ex-player, I think he's very good at relating to the  
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who turned 50 Monday, signed a three-year contract worth  
nearly $3 million to become the 19th coach in franchise history and 
the seventh in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Brewer, an assistant under Fitch for the last four seasons,  
and Jim Todd, an assistant under Ford in Milwaukee the last two 
years, will be assistants under Ford with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is to try to blend them (players) to respect each  
other, be willing to sacrifice for each other, be willing to make 
the commitment to do what's necessary to win,'' Ford said. ``You 
must pay the price. You've got to go out there and work hard. 
That's what our ethic is going to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a guy who loves the game. I think I know how it should be  
played. I think I know what it takes to win. I think I'm a guy who 
can help players become better players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are that's what the Clippers are going to need.  
Traditionally one of the NBA's weaker teams, they were 99-229 in 
four seasons under Fitch and have made the playoffs just three 
times since 1976 and have had only one winning season since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is this is a new day, a new beginning for us,''  
Ford said. ``The players have a clean slate with me. If they're 
ready to work, there's no problem. I'm looking forward to the 
sunshine here and trying to build this team back to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of an underdog is not bad. I think it's a great  
opportunity. They (the Clippers) have been ridden pretty hard. 
Every coach would like to think they can come into a situation and 
make it better. There's nothing better than knocking off the king 
of the hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford coached the Boston Celtics from 1990-95 and the Bucks  
1996-98. He was fired with one year remaining on his contract after 
Milwaukee went 36-46 and failed to make the playoffs for the second 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks were 33-49 in Ford's first year. In seven years as an  
NBA coach, Ford's teams have a 291-283 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock, yes,'' Ford said of his being fired. ``It's  
life in the NBA. I've been fortunate enough to be part of this for 
25 years. I love the NBA, I love the competition, I do not like to 
lose. I was very fortunate this opportunity opened up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford played six seasons with Detroit and four with Boston and  
was an assistant with the Celtics for seven years before becoming 
the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember that he's a hard worker, he likes to win, he's a  
good coach,'' said reserve center Stojko Vrankovic, who played for 
Ford in 1990-92. ``We have a lot of young guys. I think we can be a 
lot better than last year.''

<HEADLINE> 'Machine' Crafted Out of DNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have made a moving part out of a few strands of DNA,  
a step toward building incredibly tiny ``machines'' that could 
someday perform intricate jobs like building computer circuits and 
clearing clogged blood vessels in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The hinge-like part, which bends on cue, is just  
four-ten-thousandths of the width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work isn't the first time scientists have turned  
chemical compounds into moving parts. But previous examples have 
been hampered by their floppy nature. The DNA device, however, is 
particularly rigid and executes motions 10 times bigger, lead 
researcher Nadrian C. Seeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The device was made by joining two double-stranded DNA spirals  
with a bridge of DNA. When it's exposed to a particular chemical 
solution, part of the structure bends. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were reported in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature by Seeman and colleagues at New York University. The team 
hopes to eventually build other moving parts using DNA, including 
``arms'' and ``fingers'' that someday could be mounted on a 
micro-robot. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is the latest twist in the fledgling field of  
nanotechnology, or technology at an atomic scale. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very beautiful demonstration of construction at that  
scale of a device that's actually functioning,'' said Daniel T. 
Colbert of Rice University's Center for Nanoscale Science and 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Colbert said scientists are still decades away from  
creating any useful machines in nanotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of in the children's playtime toddler era of doing  
this. We've been thrown some blocks and Legos and Tinker Toys,'' he 
said. ``We're just kind of picking them up and trying to assemble 
things out of them that can perform something useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	K. Eric Drexler of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing in  
Los Altos, Calif., agreed that Seeman's device is too cumbersome to 
be useful. But he said further development may lead to a practical 
device.

<HEADLINE> Prozac Case Rulings Boost Eli Lilly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A judge's rulings have boosted Eli Lilly and  
Co.'s chances of protecting patents on the best-selling 
antidepressant Prozac, analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker ruled Tuesday that Barr  
Laboratories, which wants to market a generic version of Prozac, 
could not present part of its case against Lilly in a patent 
infringement trial later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the rulings Wednesday helped send Lilly stock up $4.18 3/4  
to $80.68 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was highly improbable Lilly would lose, and we  
think it's even more so based on Judge Barker's rulings,'' said 
analyst Neil Sweig of Southeast Research Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker left in place two other claims against the Prozac  
patents, and her courtroom will serve as the setting for the highly 
anticipated case due to go to trial Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake for Lilly is its U.S. monopoly on the Prozac market.  
The drug, the top-selling antidepressant in the world, is Lilly's 
biggest moneymaker, bringing in an estimated $2.86 billion last 
year, mostly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker's rulings will make a big difference, taking from Barr  
half of its ``ammunition'' in the case, said independent drug 
analyst Hemant K. Shah. However, he said the generic company still 
could prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's over yet. Both Lilly and Barr are equally  
competent as far as legal issues are concerned,'' Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Barr claims that Barker left standing challenges  
whether Lilly fraudulently withheld information on two key Prozac 
patents or disclosed misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
	The other claim challenges whether Lilly's patent on how Prozac  
works disclosed enough information. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr said it had not decided whether or not to appeal the  
ruling.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Johnson To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson is expected to resign Thursday as  
coach of the Miami Dolphins, a source close to Johnson told The 
Associated Press Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who coached three seasons at Miami after leading Dallas  
to two Super Bowl championships, has been disappointed with the 
performance of his team, the source said. The Dolphins were 
eliminated from the NFL playoffs 38-3 by Denver last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins owner H. Wayne Huizenga, in California to complete the  
sale of his Florida Marlins baseball team, rushed back to Miami 
Wednesday night, apparently to meet with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was 10-6 this season, then beat Buffalo 24-17 before being  
eliminated by Denver last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had a 27-21 record in three seasons with Miami and was  
1-2 in two playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson enjoyed his greatest pro success with Dallas, winning  
the 1992 and 1993 Super Bowls while compiling a 51-38 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also succeeded in college, winning a national  
championship in 1987 at Miami. He had a 52-9 record in five 
seasons. Before that, he had a 29-25 record in five seasons at 
Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Dolphins' season ended Saturday with the dismal loss  
at Denver, Johnson talked optimistically about next season, but he 
hasn't met with the media since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent death of Johnson's mother may have been a factor in  
his decision. He also complained frequently during the past season 
about how media scrutiny was more intense than when he coached the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's resignation was first reported by Fox Sports. Dolphins  
media relations coordinator Neal Gulkis said no news conference had 
been scheduled as of late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anything about it,'' Gulkis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's team made steady progress after he replaced Don Shula  
in January 1996. The Dolphins went 8-8 in his first season, 9-7 in 
1997 and 10-6 this season. They made the playoffs in 1997 and 
earned their first playoff victory in four years this season, 
beating Buffalo 24-17.

<HEADLINE> Senators: 9-Game Unbeaten Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The way the Ottawa Senators are playing right now, they might  
turn into one of the NHL's biggest surprises when the playoffs 
begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the same team which eliminated the top-seeded New Jersey  
Devils in the opening round of the Eastern Conference playoffs last 
year, and it is playing even better now, riding a franchise-record 
nine game (7-0-2) unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working at becoming an elite team in this league,''  
coach Jacques Martin said after the Senators beat the Devils for 
the second time in nine days Monday night. ``We are extremely 
young, and hopefully every lesson we learn in the first part of the 
season will help us to be better in the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the youngest team in the league with an average age of  
26.2 years, the Senators combine the skill of players like Alexei 
Yashin and Daniel Alfredsson with a defense-first style of play 
that clogs up the neutral zone. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this team a threat is its speed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of young, fast guys on this team and that's what  
the NHL is about these days,'' defenseman Jason York said after the 
game in East Rutherford, N.J. ``Speed kills. Teams with speed are 
the teams that are winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils have discovered that against Ottawa the past two  
weeks, being outscored 10-2. Most of the goals have come when 
Ottawa forces a turnover and then turns on the jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you turn the puck over they can turn it up ice pretty  
quick,'' Devils forward Brian Rolston said. ``There is no question 
they have speed. They have a lot of speed, but they are disciplined 
as well. If they don't have an opportunity to forecheck, they stay 
back and clog up the neutral zone. They're smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators have outscored opponents 34-15 in their streak,  
giving up two goals or less in seven games. And they used comebacks 
either to win or tie four games. 
</P>
<P>
	The run has the Senators challenging Buffalo and Toronto for  
first place in the Northeast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this is going Toronto is winning, Buffalo and  
Pittsburgh, everybody around us is winning,'' Alfredsson said. ``It 
puts the pressure on us too, and it's inspired us to come out every 
night and be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Damien Rhodes, who has combined with Ron Tugnutt to  
give Ottawa a 2.25 goals against average, said in past years that 
the team never seemed to be able to take the next step once it got 
a couple of games over the .500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't played in a lot of games lately, but just watching  
them play makes me glad I'm not a goalie on the other team,'' 
Rhodes said. ``We're been throwing four solid lines out and it 
seems at least once a shift we have been in the offensive zone. 
We're getting a lot of chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin has led the offense with 18 goals and 31 assists, tied  
for fifth in the league scoring race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think we are a good team,'' he said. ``It's great when  
you are getting wins, but it's only half the season. We still have 
a long way to go and we have to keep our focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators play the Devils in Ottawa on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Korda Challenges Drug Test Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Australian Open champion Petr Korda  
has lodged a legal challenge to the International Tennis 
Federation's planned appeal against his penalty for testing 
positive to steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda's lawyers began proceedings in the High Court in England  
in a bid to stop the ITF from appealing its independent panel's 
decision not to impose a one-year ban. The ITF is in the process of 
appealing the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 
Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's completely in the hands of my lawyers,'' Korda said today  
at the Colonial Classic, a warmup event for the Australian Open. 
``We are asking the court if the ITF can appeal its own decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda said he had been instructed not to discuss the appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to play tennis at this time, I am not concentrating on  
what's happening over there,'' the Czech star said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know your chances in your life, you can't predict  
it. When we go on court we can't say for sure we are going to win. 
It's in the hands of my lawyers and I will follow them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF appeals board ruled that because of ``exceptional  
circumstances'' it would not impose a one-year ban on Korda. 
Instead, he was fined his Wimbledon prize money and the points 
earned from the event.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Anti-Abortion Defendant Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An anti-abortion activist conceded that he  
has advocated the use of lethal force to halt abortions, but denied 
direct links to a Web site plaintiffs say amounts to a hit list. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Burnett testified Tuesday in a federal trial to determine  
whether fliers made to look like wanted posters and the Web site 
that lists the names, addresses and phone numbers of abortion 
doctors is constitutionally protected free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my information, all the information in those files can be  
legally obtained,'' said Burnett, publisher of Life Advocate 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	His testimony is key because the plaintiffs' lawyers claim his  
refusal to condemn slayings of abortion doctors added to the 
threatening nature of the ``Deadly Dozen'' fliers and the Web site 
called ``The Nuremberg Files,'' even though they contained no 
explicit threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Several doctors have testified they began wearing bulletproof  
vests and disguises after their names appeared on the Web site as 
``baby butchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said their fear intensified in October, when the name of  
Dr. Barnett Slepian was crossed off the list shortly after he was 
killed by a sniper at his suburban Buffalo, N.Y., home. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett said he had no direct involvement in putting together  
the site, and said he never personally used violence against 
abortion clinics or doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his group has published pictures of, and picketed,  
abortion doctors and their homes to put pressure on those doctors 
to stop their practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a perfectly legal thing to do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Burnett was asked whether he signed a petition distributed by  
Paul Hill, who was later convicted in the 1994 murder of an 
abortion doctor in Pensacola, Fla. The petition read in part: ``The 
use of lethal force is justified if it is carried out for the 
purpose or protecting the lives of unborn children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave permission for my name to be used,'' Burnett replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Burnett is one of 14 individual defendants in the lawsuit. The  
defense claims the fliers and the Web site are a form of political 
protest protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, including abortion doctors and clinics, contend  
the materials violate a 1994 federal law that bars activists from 
inciting violence against abortion doctors and their patients.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Campaign Finance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican leadership in the House can  
fulfill its promise of a new bipartisan spirit by agreeing to quick 
consideration of a major campaign finance bill, the authors of the 
bill said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass.,  
said they would reintroduce their bill next week with the goal of 
getting it passed by the House and sent to the Senate by this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shays-Meehan bill, which would bring about the most  
important changes in campaign finance laws in a quarter-century, 
overcame strong opposition from the GOP leadership to pass the 
House last August by 252-179. A majority of 52 senators supported 
it, but backers were unable to get the 60 votes needed to bring it 
to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the litmus test,'' Meehan said at a briefing for  
congressional staff and reporters. ``This will be the test as to 
whether or not this Congress can work in a bipartisan way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., took office this month  
with a pledge to reduce partisanship and work with Democrats. Shays 
said he hasn't yet discussed campaign finance with Hastert, who 
voted against the bill last year and has not mentioned it as one of 
his legislative priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays said he would tell Hastert that ``one way or another it's  
going to come up, and it would make sense to have it done as 
quickly as possible and hopefully as harmoniously as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Shays-Meehan bill would ban federal ``soft money'' --  
unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties -- restrict 
issue ads that seek to influence elections under the guise of 
educating voters and expand disclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The two lawmakers said it was essential to act this year so the  
new law can be in place for the year 2000 presidential election. 
Shays said there was some $260 million in soft money donations from 
corporations and labor unions in 1996, and without legislation that 
figure could top $500 million in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do really believe that we are in a meltdown,'' Shays said.  
He urged staff members to ``appeal to your bosses' higher angel on 
this issue. ... If not now, when?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become a national disgrace,'' Meehan said. The limitless  
flow of soft money gives the appearance of corruption and 
``undermines the credibility of the decisions we make day in and 
day out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said he was coordinating strategy with the sponsors of  
parallel legislation in the Senate, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and 
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., and was assured that they would renew 
their fight for passage.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Women's Hoops Team Still Tops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Halfway through the season, women's basketball has come full  
circle. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning, everybody was chasing Tennessee, which went  
unbeaten last year in winning its third straight national 
championship. And now? 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd still have to say people are chasing them,'' Texas Tech  
coach Marsha Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee re-established itself as the nation's premier team  
with its 92-81 victory at Connecticut last Sunday. That game moved 
the Lady Vols back to No. 1 in The Associated Press poll and again 
demonstrated how coach Pat Summitt gets her team to play its best 
in big games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tennessee's loss at Purdue in November showed the Lady Vols  
aren't perfect and gave rise to the notion that maybe, just maybe, 
someone else could win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think they're the team, but I do think they're  
vulnerable,'' television analyst Ann Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee lost this season despite returning most of the cast  
that went 39-0 a year ago, led by national player of the year 
Chamique Holdsclaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Lady Vols are a different team. Freshmen Shalon Pillow  
and Michelle Snow have come on board and three reserves from last 
season are gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you have everybody back, doesn't mean it's the  
same,'' Meyers said. ``The chemistry changes, the roles are 
different, players take on different egos. I think Pat is very much 
in control, but obviously Purdue was able to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen or so teams have shown they're good enough to win  
the national championship should Tennessee stumble in the NCAA 
tournament, which hasn't happened since the Lady Vols lost to 
Connecticut in the 1995 title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, with its talented freshmen and the inspirational  
leadership of Shea Ralph, certainly has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue isn't flashy, but in Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari  
Figgs, the Boilermakers have two savvy players to handle 
Tennessee's pressure. They also have defeated Louisiana Tech and 
their only loss was a one-pointer at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech, which lost to Tennessee in last year's  
championship game, has improved its outside shooting with the 
addition of junior-college transfer Betty Lennox and is still 
strong inside with Amanda Wilson and Arkansas transfer Shaka 
Massey. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina is undersized but still has the quickness that  
enabled the Tar Heels to nearly upset Tennessee in the regional 
finals last season. And Georgia has emerged as a national contender 
with its 14-0 record after a mediocre season a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia, led by twins Kelly and Coco Miller, will have a chance  
to find out how far it has come when it plays at Tennessee on 
Thursday night. Tennessee beat Georgia by 59 in Knoxville last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would certainly hope by year's end we will be competitive  
and make a run at the Final Four,'' Georgia coach Andy Landers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Landers feels UCLA also has a good chance to find its way to San  
Jose for the Final Four. The Bruins have four losses, but they were 
to Connecticut, at No. 9 Notre Dame, at Tennessee and to No. 12 
Duke. UCLA has won 12 of its last 14, including an 18-point victory 
over North Carolina in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think UCLA has as much talent or more talent in the front  
line than any team in the country,'' Landers said. ``If they're 
playing well at year's end, they could make a run at the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And don't forget Duke. The Blue Devils were fourth in the  
preseason poll, then tumbled after losing three of their first four 
while some key players were recovering from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've won 12 of their last 13 -- the loss was to Tennessee  
-- and shot at least 52 percent in seven straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teams that usually aren't among the elite are having big  
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15-0, Virginia Tech owns the longest Division I winning  
streak in the country. The Hokies don't face a lot of Top 25 
competition, but they have beaten Duke and Virginia and won at 
George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 8 Colorado State is 17-1 with victories over Oregon,  
Florida, Rutgers and Utah. The Rams won't see a Top 25 opponent the 
rest of the way, however, so they won't arrive at the NCAA 
tournament as well tested as some of the other highly ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Tennessee, the Lady Vols aren't where they need to be  
yet, Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has a lot of room for improvement,'' she said.  
``Certainly, we have not handled the basketball as well this year 
as we did a year ago. We have not rebounded the basketball the way 
I think we're capable of. It's been in spurts and we've played in 
spurts, so certainly we can get better.''

	House Prosecutors Contact Lewinsky  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of opening arguments in President  
Clinton's trial, House prosecutors said Monica Lewinsky had 
recently rejected their request for a pretrial interview. Judiciary 
Committee Republicans said they had sought permission earlier in 
the week to talk with the former White House intern. Her attorneys 
``declined to make her available,'' said a committee spokesman. 
Legal sources disclosed that a similar request was made to at least 
one other potential witness, Kathleen Willey. Meanwhile, Clinton's 
legal team today dispatched a formal trial brief to the Senate 
arguing that neither ``fact or law'' warranted his removal from 
office. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Won't Speak of Impeachment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signaled he will be silent  
about his Senate impeachment trial when he delivers his State of 
the Union address on Jan. 19. ``I think the American people have 
heard about that quite extensively over the last year,'' Clinton 
said. ``My instinct is that I should do their business.'' White 
House aides view Clinton's annual report to the nation as an ideal 
opportunity to project an image of leadership. But some members of 
Congress have urged Clinton to postpone the address, or to submit 
it in writing. 

</P>
<P>
	Bush, Dole Tied in Early N.H. Poll  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has a 2-1 lead over  
Elizabeth Dole in a national poll on the GOP presidential 
nomination, but the two are in a dead heat in New Hampshire, the 
state with the first presidential primary. Neither has yet 
announced a candidacy for president. The poll was done by RKM 
Research and Communications of Portsmouth, N.H., for CNN and 
WMUR-TV of Manchester, N.H. Dole had 31 percent and Bush had 30 
percent. Also Arizona Sen. John McCain had 7 percent, financier 
Steve Forbes had 5 percent and New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith had 4 
percent.

	U.S. Jet Crashes Near Dutch Border  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A U.S. military refueling plane  
crashed and burst into flames tonight near the Dutch border, 
killing four people on board, a U.S. military official said. The 
KC-135 plane, assigned to a NATO base near the northwestern town of 
Geilenkirchen, went down in forests two miles from the base, police 
said. It was one of two planes and three crews sent to 
Geilenkirchen on Jan. 3 to support refueling missions of NATO 
reconnaissance planes, a base spokesman said. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Planes Attack Iraqi Defenses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American warplanes attacked defense sites in  
Iraq for the third straight day as the Clinton administration said 
military pressure would continue as long as Iraq kept threatening 
U.S. pilots enforcing ``no-fly'' zones. The string of 
confrontations in Iraq is raising speculation that President 
Clinton might order a new bombing campaign. White House spokesman 
Joe Lockhart said the administration intended to continue applying 
economic and military pressure, but he said there were other 
options.

	Stocks End Down; Dow Off 125.12  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fierce selloff hit Wall Street early today  
following Brazil's dramatic currency devaluation, but stocks 
bottomed out quickly and partly recovered. The moves demonstrated 
that even serious economic problems with an important trading 
partner like Brazil were not enough to completely undo a stunning 
rally in U.S. stocks that last week sent the Dow industrials up 5 
percent. The Dow today closed down 125.12 at 9,349.26. On the NYSE, 
losers led gainers 2,114-1,025. The Nasdaq was fell 3.43 to 
2,317.32.

	Gov't Concludes Microsoft Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government concluded its antitrust case  
against Microsoft Corp. today after more than 10 weeks at trial. 
Microsoft's first witness, an economist, testified that the company 
can't be considered to wield monopoly power because it faces 
upstart competitors making rival computer operating systems. 
Microsoft also plans to call top company executives as witnesses -- 
but not chairman Bill Gates. The trial is likely to last into 
March.

	Apple's Quarterly Profit Triples  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc., buoyed by sales of its  
hot new iMac computer, reported its quarterly profit more than 
tripled in the company's fifth straight money-making quarter. Apple 
said it earned $152 million, or 95 cents a share on a diluted 
basis, in the three months ended Dec. 26, 1998. Revenues grew 8 
percent to $1.71 billion. The company has sold 519,000 iMacs since 
they went on sale last August.

	Michael Jordan Retires  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan, the NBA's greatest player, made  
it official today, retiring from the Chicago Bulls after 13 seasons 
and six championships. Jordan said he was ``99.9 percent'' sure he 
would never return. The Jordan era included five MVP awards, 10 
scoring titles and 12 All-Star appearances.

<HEADLINE> Denny's To Televise Anti-Racism Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Denny's restaurant chain plans to spend $2 million on  
commercials that might not get people in to buy breakfast but, the 
company hopes, get them talking about racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the lessons we've learned, we want to help get people  
talking more about race,'' said Jim Adamson, chief executive of 
Denny's parent company, Spartanburg, S.C.-based Advantica 
Restaurant Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Denny's has worked to repair its tarnished image since paying  
$45.7 million five years ago to settle a discrimination suit by 
black customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some people who never notice another person's color.  
But most of us do,'' says a black youth in one of the three ads, 
which will run on broadcast and cable networks. ``And that's OK. 
Don't feel guilty. Noticing a person's color doesn't make you 
racist. Acting like it matters does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Diversity, it's about all of us,'' an announcer says at the  
end as the Denny's logo appears. 
</P>
<P>
	David Margulies, a Dallas-based consultant who helps companies  
handle crisis communications, said the ads are aimed more at 
Denny's 50,000 workers than bringing in new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's $2.99 grand slam breakfasts that bring people into  
Denny's,'' he said. ``They want to make sure the people in their 
organization understand the organization has changed. It's to say 
to this huge, diverse work force that things have changed and if 
you haven't changed, you don't need to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He warned the company is taking a risk in running the ads if  
there are similar problems in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would be surprised how many people, including minority  
customers, have never heard about this and you don't want to bring 
the issue up again,'' he said. ``If they have some unconverted 
people on the staff and they do what they did before again, then 
they look disingenuous by running these ads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To help settle the allegations against Denny's, its parent  
company -- then known as Flagstar Cos. -- entered into an agreement 
with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 
to increase the number of minority-owned restaurants. It later 
reached a similar agreement with the Hispanic Association on 
Corporate Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Now minorities make up 48 percent of Advantica's work force and  
33 percent of its management. Only one Denny's was owned by a black 
franchisee in 1993; now 123 are black-owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the NAACP awarded Denny's its annual minority  
business development award for its efforts to provider broader 
opportunities for minorities.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Public With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public opinion remains solidly in President  
Clinton's corner as the Senate prepares to decide whether to remove 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	With opening arguments in Clinton's impeachment trial starting  
Thursday, a majority of the public says a full trial is unnecessary 
and wants the proceedings to be both quick and fair, several polls 
released this week suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of Americans in a CBS News poll released Wednesday  
want the president to proceed with plans to give the State of the 
Union speech Jan. 19 and don't think it's necessary for him to 
mention the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	And about two-thirds of Americans in several polls approve of  
the job he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's public appeal is based on more than just the  
robust economy and is unlikely to waver immediately even if the 
economy sours, said Thomas E. Mann, a Brookings Institution scholar 
on Congress and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a style of governance, of seeming to connect with the  
concerns of ordinary people in this country that is also a source 
of the presidential strength, together with his very effective 
counterpunching in dealing with the majority Republicans in 
Congress,'' Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken over the weekend showed the  
impeachment trial was far down the list of top priorities the 
public wants Clinton and Congress to tackle this year. Education, 
health care and Social Security were the top three; the impeachment 
trial was No. 10, with 16 percent saying the trial should be a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been hurt politically by their role in the  
impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by Gallup showed more than half disapproved of Senate  
Republicans' handling of the impeachment proceedings, while just 
over a third approved. Those results were reversed for Senate 
Democrats, with more than half approving of their conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two-thirds of Americans in polls by Gallup and ABC News  
say they want senators to vote against removing the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Early efforts by the full Senate to hold the trial in a  
bipartisan fashion appear to have paid off. Forty-six percent 
approve of the Senate's handling of the impeachment trial and 41 
percent disapprove in the CBS poll taken Sunday and Monday. Six out 
of 10 in that poll say it's not necessary to hold a full trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, a majority of Americans disapproved in September of  
the sharply divided way the matter was handled by the House 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS poll of 1,182 adults was taken Sunday and Monday, and  
the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 1,1014 adults was taken Friday 
through Sunday. Both had margins of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. The ABC poll of 923 adults taken Saturday 
through Monday had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every elected official must be deeply concerned about the  
views of the people he or she represents,'' said Mike Collins, 
spokesman for the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the role of a juror in a Senate impeachment trial is to do  
'impartial justice,''' he said, referring to the wording of the 
sworn oath taken by the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic  
National Committee, said Democrats' strong showing in the November 
elections was a reflection of voters' preference for issues over 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Republicans haven't gotten the message yet,'' Romer said,  
noting the public may have a long memory on impeachment. ``When 
this will hit is when they start calling witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have agreed to defer the decision on whether the  
Senate will call witnesses during the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican pollster said the trial's timing is crucial.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no place where public opinion will be felt for a  
couple of years since there is no election,'' said Bob Teeter, a 
pollster based in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``It's different from last fall 
when voters got mad at Republicans because of the way they handled 
the investigation and then took it out on them in the elections.''

<HEADLINE> Drink Milk, Keep Your Colon Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Drink milk, keep your colon healthy.  
</P>
<P>
	It may never catch on as a slogan, but adding calcium to the  
diet can keep you from getting tumors in your large intestine. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect was moderate but significant, Dr. J.A. Baron of the  
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H., wrote in 
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 832 people who underwent surgery for  
colorectal adenomas -- benign tumors -- at six hospitals around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	About half got calcium supplements and half got placebos.  
Doctors looked to see whether they developed another adenoma over 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 percent were taking their pills at least 90 percent  
of the time during the fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second through fourth years of the study -- the main risk  
period -- 127 of the 409 people taking calcium had developed at 
least one adenoma, compared with 159 of the 423 taking placebos. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, there were more tumors per patient in the placebo  
group: 0.73 compared with 0.55. 
</P>
<P>
	The study seems to back up a theory that bile acids may be part  
of the reason that a diet rich in vegetables and fruits carries a 
lower risk of intestinal growths than one high in red meat and fat. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory held that calcium binds bile acids traveling through  
the bowel, reducing their opportunity to cause growths.

<HEADLINE> Friends Tape Heroin Addict Who Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Luis Torres' friends figured they could  
get him off heroin if he could only see himself on drugs, so they 
videotaped him as he was coming down from a high. 
</P>
<P>
	For six or seven minutes, they recorded him as he went through  
body-wracking seizures and struggled to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	But Torres never got to see the tape. He died a few hours later,  
apparently of an overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point was to show him how stupid he looked,'' his  
friend Michael Shipman, 34, said Wednesday. ``I didn't think 
anything was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police seized the tape to investigate whether Shipman and the  
undetermined number of other friends who were there should face 
charges for not getting medical help for Torres sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Terrence Hull said no charges will be filed. He  
said an investigation showed that those who videotaped Torres were 
trying to help him and didn't realize he was dying. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape was made at Shipman's apartment on Jan. 6. Torres, 32,  
a carpet installer from Union City, had arrived at the apartment 
early that morning with a drug buddy after snorting some heroin. He 
was already high when he got there. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipman, who had known Torres for about six months after Torres  
starting coming regularly to the bar where Shipman worked, said he 
was always trying to get Torres to kick his habit. 
</P>
<P>
	When the taping started, Shipman said, he asked the man Torres  
was with if the breathing difficulty and seizures were anything to 
be concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't do drugs, and I don't have any experience with it,''  
Shipman said. ``This guy said he'll be all right. Like an 
(expletive), I believed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shipman said he went to bed after checking that Torres was still  
breathing, and woke up about 2:30 p.m. His roommate came home, and 
around 3:30 p.m. asked, ``Does he always sleep with his mouth and 
eyes open?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shipman said he called 911 and tried to give Torres  
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it was too late. Torres was taken 
to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for the drugs, the kid was perfect,'' a  
teary-eyed Shipman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``You don't know how much it hurts to lose one of your  
best friends. Going to the bar every day and not seeing him I wish 
I would have called the ambulance a lot sooner.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Has Many Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- What to do now that Michael Jordan's a retiree  
for the second time? 
</P>
<P>
	Let's see, he could direct his imposing business empire,  
including a new athletic apparel company. He could keep up his 
string of endorsements that earn an estimated $45 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	He can play golf on the course of his choice. Better believe  
baseball is out of the question this time. Coaching isn't in his 
future, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I can go into seclusion and certainly I can't  
solve the world's problems,'' Jordan said Wednesday as he announced 
his second retirement in less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
	`There are a lot of things out there, a lot of things I can lend  
my support to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one, his family.  
</P>
<P>
	After 13 NBA seasons, the game's greatest player said he'd like  
to sample a normal life or at least be a doting dad to his three 
children. His two boys are already basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy taking my kids to school. I normally enjoy picking my  
kids up from school, which I look forward to doing,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And watching my kids play. My wife and I have a fun time  
watching our kids play one-on-one, which is very entertaining. So 
those are things that seem so simple in a lot of people's lives and 
never really been enjoyed by me because of my schedule and because 
of the things that I've done over the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure there's a lot of business opportunities there, and that  
won't consume me, but that certainly will take away some of the 
competitive juices that will be left over from not playing 
basketball. For the most part, I'm just going to enjoy life and do 
some of the things that I've never done before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juanita Jordan, his wife, doesn't see things changing  
drastically, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life won't change at all,'' Juanita said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can see Michael doing more carpooling. That's about it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Agent David Falk said Jordan's immediate business interest is an  
athletic apparel company, ``Brand Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a lot of corporate affiliations. He has to decide what  
the next challenges are, what the next mental challenges are and 
how much of his time he wants to devote to corporate activities and 
how much he wants to devote to private activities,'' Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect to hear Coach Jordan. He has no plans, a la Larry  
Bird, to return to the game and be on the bench drawing up plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never say never,'' Jordan said. ``But I want to get  
away from basketball a little bit and look at it from afar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the only coaching I can do is at home, and I'm  
having a tough time doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are those who are think Jordan's competitiveness will  
eventually lead back to the game, maybe even as a player again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-teammate Craig Hodges knows Jordan will keep playing  
somewhere, even if it's in the driveway or his own gym 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he'll play basketball. It's not like he'll never pick  
up a basketball again. It's just there won't be 20,000 people 
watching him when he goes to work out,'' Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael has so many things going on, he'll have plenty to  
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His other teammates -- all now former ones -- will have to go on  
without him, some to other teams if the Bulls decide to rebuild now 
that he's left. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fires Kill 10 Kids in Three States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Five young children were killed in a house fire in northern  
Louisiana this morning, and three others died as blazes swept 
through homes in two of New Jersey's largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's deadly fires followed a blaze that killed two children  
in Brentwood, N.Y., early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bernice, La., a fire at about 1:45 a.m. destroyed a  
wood-frame house, killing five children, ages 3 to 10. Their mother 
and a sister escaped without serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look like there is foul play or any indications of  
arson or foul play,'' said Rick Combs, chief deputy with arson 
investigation unit of the state fire marshal's office. ``About all 
I can tell you is that it is an accidental fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Newark, N.J., 19-month-old Jasmine Crowell and her 7-year-old  
brother, William Crowell III, died in an apartment fire at about 3 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, William Anthony Crowell Jr., was critically burned  
trying to save his children, police Sgt. Derek Glenn said. He had 
to be rescued himself from a third-floor window by firefighters and 
was hospitalized with third-degree burns over 40 percent of his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire in the wood-frame apartment building was  
not immediately determined, said James Langenbach, chief of the 
Newark Fire Department's arson squad. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trenton, N.J., a 3 a.m. house fire killed a child and  
critically burned at least one other. An adult also was taken to a 
hospital, but other details were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brentwood, N.Y., house fire killed two boys while their  
mother cried outside clutching their baby sister. Police in the 
Long Island community said the fire that killed 4-year-old John 
Paul Lomangino and his 3-year-old brother, Joshua, may have been 
started as the boys played with matches.

	ALDAMA, Mexico (AP) -- Dozens of rebel sympathizers blocked 450  
soldiers and police from entering their village in southern Chiapas 
state, exchanging blows and insults with them for more than an hour 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported in the scuffles that started before  
dawn on a remote rural road. The security forces were on their way 
to destroy nearby marijuana fields when a large group of men, women 
and children stopped the 20-vehicle military convoy outside Aldama. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the leftist Zapatista rebels runs high in Aldama,  
about 44 miles north of San Cristobal de las Casas. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters threw rocks and military police fought back with  
police batons and at one time threatened to fire tear gas canisters 
into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Aldama residents said they were afraid that if they allowed the  
army in, the soldiers would set up a base there to fight the 
Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
	After a lengthy argument, the protesters allowed the task force  
access to the fields in surrounding hills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in January, 1994,  
demanding greater democracy and Indian rights. Peace talks between 
the rebels and the government have been stalled since 1996.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Angry onlookers shouted ``thief''  
Wednesday when one of the leading figures in a banking scandal was 
brought before a judge after four years on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	Former banker Orlando Castro, 73, was extradited from New York  
City to Venezuela late Tuesday. His lawyers requested that he be 
granted house arrest because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban-born Castro is accused in Venezuela of misusing $229  
million of emergency funds provided by the government in 1994 to 
save his Banco Progreso. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 40 percent of Venezuela's financial system went under  
during the crisis and had to be taken over in an $8 billion 
bailout. Castro fled to the United States shortly after Banco 
Progreso was taken over in December 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He had become one of the symbols of the crisis. Just weeks  
before he fled the country, he handed out buttons with his bank's 
name that said, ``Here we are, here we stay.''

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Teach-In Goes Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Some teachers vow to go ahead with a  
controversial lesson plan focusing on a man convicted of killing a 
Philadelphia policeman even as a funeral is held for a slain 
Oakland officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teach-in will go on,'' Sheila Quintana, president of the  
Oakland Education Association, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, planned since October, was to focus on the case of  
Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black activist and radio journalist on death row 
for killing a Philadelphia policeman in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents said using a current event would engage students'  
attention and force them to think critically. Critics called it a 
politically charged waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
	School district officials agreed that it would be insensitive to  
hold the event on Thursday, the day services are planned for 
Oakland police Officer James Williams, who was killed by a sniper 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Carole Quan said Monday night she was canceling  
the event, despite an earlier vote by teachers to hold it. 
</P>
<P>
	Now some teachers say they want to hold the teach-in, at least  
in modified form, arguing they are obliged to defend academic 
freedom. Officials said they did not know how many teachers would 
focus on the case in their classes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics called the teachers' plan a mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	``It creates added tensions and it just does not do well for the  
city's image and the people of Oakland, let alone the students in 
the classroom,'' said Shannon Reeves, head of the Oakland chapter 
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those arguing for the teach-in was Castlemont High School  
sophomore Candis White. She said she doesn't see a connection 
between the teach-in and the officer's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking somebody in a whole different time, in a whole  
different place,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers who support the event ``are just trying to teach us  
about the justice system,'' she said. ``It shouldn't matter which 
day it is.''

<HEADLINE> Source: House Contacts Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bracing for opening arguments in his  
impeachment trial, President Clinton said Wednesday he will tend 
studiously to ``the business of the people'' while his fate is 
settled in historic Senate proceedings. House prosecutors said 
Monica Lewinsky had recently rejected their request for a pretrial 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first formal presentation of evidence set for Thursday,  
Judiciary Committee Republicans said they had sought permission 
earlier in the week to talk with the woman at the center of the 
sex-and-cover-up scandal. Her attorneys ``declined to make her 
available,'' said a committee spokesman, Paul J. McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed  
that a similar request was made to at least one other potential 
witness, Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Clinton's remarks Wednesday, his legal team  
dispatched a formal trial brief to the Senate arguing that neither 
``fact or law'' warranted his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote the American people rendered ... is hanging in the  
balance,'' the brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have their job to do in the Senate, and I have mine,''  
the president told reporters in his first public utterance in three 
weeks on an issue that has tarnished his presidency for posterity. 
``I trust that the right thing will be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in  
the first presidential impeachment trial since Andrew Johnson was 
acquitted in 1868. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to 
convict him and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is to resume at 1 p.m. EST, with Chief Justice William  
Rehnquist presiding and the House impeachment team -- Republican 
lawmakers all -- starting to present their case. 
</P>
<P>
	The House does not yet have permission from the Senate to call  
witnesses in the trial. Spokesman McNulty explained the overture to 
Ms. Lewinsky by saying the committee was ``duty bound to gather all 
relevant evidence and be thoroughly prepared for the trial. 
Implicit in the House's right to request witnesses is the 
responsibility to determine who the House will call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman declined to confirm the approach to Ms. Willey.  
She alleged Clinton made an uninvited sexual pass in the White 
House, but the incident is not cited in either of the two articles 
of impeachment approved by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the House prosecutors, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of  
Wisconsin, visited the Senate chamber during the day to prepare. He 
said his opening statement of 45 minutes to an hour would focus on 
``laying out the case and showing very clearly that the president 
committed an impeachable offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's legal team argued otherwise in their long legal brief  
filed with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations ``do not begin to satisfy the stringent showing  
required by our Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected president 
from office, either as a matter of fact or law,'' they wrote. They 
even ``fall far short of what a prudent prosecutor would require 
before presenting a case to a judge or jury,'' the brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	With public polls showing strong voter support for Clinton,  
Senate Republicans labored conspicuously on non-impeachment 
matters. For the second straight day, they met in closed-door 
session to review a legislative agenda for the year that includes 
tax cuts, education, defense and other issues. Connie Mack of 
Florida said he and his GOP colleagues were determined ``to see 
that the work of the American people is moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sought to project the same image.  
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, asked by reporters about his trial, he said,  
``The important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking 
about that as possible and as much time working on the issues we're 
here to discuss as possible. .... I need to work on the business of 
the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House officials sent the Senate all public evidence in the case,  
including material from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and 
documents from the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. Also 
included are audio tapes that Linda Tripp made of her 
consversations with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by private attorneys and the staff of the White House  
counsel's office, Clinton's pleadings argued that the impeachment 
standard of high crimes and misdemeanors refers to actions that are 
attempts to subvert the Constitution. They said that just as 
Republicans and Democrats agreed in 1974 that President Nixon's 
filing of an allegedly false income tax return fell short of that 
standard, do did the allegations against Clinton, even if proven. 
</P>
<P>
	They also methodically sought to rebut each allegation -- that  
Clinton lied in grand jury testimony, for example, or conspired to 
hide gifts that Ms. Lewinsky had given him. 
</P>
<P>
	They acknowledged that the accounts of Clinton and the former  
intern differ on some matters, such as the number of their 
encounters, the date of their first intimate contact and what they 
did together. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the lawyers wrote, ``these squabbles are utterly  
immaterial'' and are ``precisely the kind of disagreement that the 
law does not intend to capture as perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under ground rules adopted last week, the House has 24 hours --  
spread over three days, for example-- to make its case, and the 
White House will have 24 hours for its defense. The Senate will 
then be permitted to pose questions to the two sides. Afterward, 
the White House is expected to seek dismissal of the charges, and 
the House is expected to seek permission to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In their brief, the White House lawyers said the president would  
face a ``critical need for the discovery of evidence useful to his 
defense -- evidence which would routinely be available to any civil 
litigant involved in a garden-variety automobile accident case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the prosecutors call even one witness, Clinton lawyers would  
need a delay of weeks to go through that process before they could 
fairly cross examine any House witness, said one lawyer, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be up to the Senate to decide on requests for delays.  
The White House assertion that a lengthy pause in the trial would 
be needed appeared to be an effort to lay the groundwork for 
charging the GOP-controlled Senate with being unfair to the 
president.

<HEADLINE> Flynt's Obscenity Trial Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A judge reluctantly agreed today to postpone  
Larry Flynt's obscenity trial scheduled for next week so the 
Hustler publisher can have urological surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Patrick Dinkelacker wants proof that Flynt has the  
surgery. ``You all be prepared to go to trial Tuesday if he does 
not have surgery,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt's attorneys had filed a motion Monday saying he needs  
surgery to correct a urological problem common among paraplegics. 
Flynt has been in a wheelchair since he was shot in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	If Flynt has the procedure, the trial will be rescheduled for  
April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 55, and his brother, Jimmy, 49, are accused of obscenity  
and other charges for selling sexually explicit videos at their 
Hustler Magazine &AMP; Gifts store. They were charged after a 
14-year-old boy said he bought a video at the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt argues that Ohio's obscenity law goes beyond the legal  
test established in a landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, each could get 24 years in prison and $65,000 in  
fines. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Flynt was convicted of obscenity for selling Hustler in  
Cincinnati. The conviction was overturned on appeal.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Pierce Has Rough Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Paul Pierce's NBA life has been one  
frustrating wait after another. 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped all the way to the 10th pick in last year's draft.  
His first pro season was delayed more than three months by the 
lockout. And he apparently will be waiting forever to fulfill his 
wish of playing against Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Celtics, though, might not have to wait very long  
before Pierce, a small forward from Kansas, fits into their uptempo 
offense and pressing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played with him during the summer when I went out to  
California and I saw what potential he has,'' said Ron Mercer, one 
of Boston's first-round picks in 1997. ``This system is definitely 
made for Paul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce is eager to learn it. He showed up last Monday for  
workouts, the first day players could use team facilities after the 
lockout. And next Monday, he's scheduled to participate in his 
first practice run by Boston's demanding coach, Rick Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little frustrating,'' Pierce said. ``You wonder if  
there's going to be a season, but I'm happy it's here and I'm ready 
to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce could join the starting lineup with previous  
first-rounders, Antoine Walker and Mercer. With experienced point 
guard Kenny Anderson directing the offense, an abbreviated 50-game 
season and Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan having retired, the 
Celtics have an improved chance of making the playoffs for the 
first time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the near future, we're going to be a team to be reckoned  
with in the East,'' Pierce said. But he won't get a chance to test 
himself against Jordan, who announced his retirement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always watched this guy growing up and always wanted to play  
against him,'' Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he's upset about being drafted 10th, he need only check the  
1984 draft when Jordan wasn't taken until the No. 3 spot behind 
Hakeem Olajuwon, who went to Houston, and Sam Bowie, taken by 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just look at it as a blessing in disguise,'' Pierce said.  
``This is probably the best place for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would have liked to have arrived sooner, but the lockout  
prevented that. He wondered if he made the right decision in 
leaving Kansas after his junior season. He even considered playing 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very frustrating,'' Pierce said. ``At times I felt like  
I wasn't even in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did play during the lockout in California with several pros,  
including Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been hanging out, getting a feel for each other,''  
Pierce said. ``He's our starting guard so I have to spend as much 
time with him as I possibly can so he can pass me the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce is a well-rounded player who can shoot, run and rebound.  
He worked on his ballhandling during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of confidence. He's not afraid,'' Anderson  
said. ``He's going to be a great player. He's very explosive. He 
can rebound. He can do it all. Hopefully, once he gets into the 
flow of the system, he'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very athletic. He can shoot the ball,'' Celtics guard  
Dana Barros said, but ``it all depends on how fast he adjusts to 
the things that we're doing and try to find his role on the team. 
He has all the tools. It's just a matter of fitting in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his long waits to be drafted and for the lockout to end,  
he'd prefer to do that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like this,'' Pierce said. ``I never  
thought the NBA would lose this many games or even have something 
like this ever happen, and it has to happen the year I come out. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I'm a little frustrated at that but I'm happy it's  
starting. Now I can go on and fulfill my dream.''

<HEADLINE>  Michael Jordan Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The NBA's greatest player made it official today.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls after 13 seasons,  
six championships and countless soaring dunks. But he left open the 
slightest possibility that he might return one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, I'm exhausted. I don't feel I have a challenge,''  
Jordan said at a news conference at the United Center, where a 
bronze statue of him stands outside. ``Physically, I feel great. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect time for me to walk away from the game. I'm  
at peace with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he was ``99.9 percent'' sure he would never return  
and added, ``You can read that for what it's worth. ... I'm very 
secure in my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed why he wouldn't say he was 100 percent certain,  
Jordan said: ``Because it's my 1 percent and not yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Jordan's retirement broke late Monday, but he had  
refused to comment until today. After leading the Bulls to their 
sixth championship in June, Jordan said he would make an 
announcement on his future only once the NBA lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The players and owners reached a deal last week to save what's  
left of the season, and everyone's next question was whether Jordan 
would return. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan era included five MVP awards, 10 scoring titles, 12  
All-Star appearances and many magic moments, from last-second shots 
to phenomenal scoring outbursts. More important, Jordan had charm 
and a nice-guy image that earned him multimillion-dollar 
sponsorship deals and reached even non-sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to be the best basketball player I could be,'' said  
Jordan, who was joined by his wife, Juanita, Bulls chairman Jerry 
Reinsdorf and NBA commissioner David Stern. ``I've had a great 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan alluded to his first retirement in 1993, when he briefly  
pursued a professional baseball career before returning late in the 
1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we do this again, a second time,'' he said to open the  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Bulls unveiled a banner in the rafters from  
Jordan's first retirement. It said ``Jordan 1984-1993'' -- but it 
will now have to be updated. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had lost his desire to play, he said: ``The desire  
is always going to be there.'' But he said he wanted to make sure 
that the desire was there ``not one-fourth of the time I step onto 
the court, but every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who had a bandage on his right index finger, said he  
severed a tendon while trying to cut a cigar and would need 
surgery. But he said he had already decided to retire before the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to enjoy life and do things I've never done  
before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he looked forward to being a parent and would ``live  
vicariously through my kids,'' whether or not they played 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life will take a change,'' said Jordan, adding that he also  
will tend to his many business interests. He makes an estimated $45 
million a year from endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Added his wife: ``I see Michael doing a lot more carpooling.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf called Jordan's announcement ``a tough day for  
basketball fans all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day I hoped would never come,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Countered Stern: ``I disagree with Jerry. This is a great day.  
The greatest basketball player in the history of the game is 
getting the opportunity to retire with the grace that described his 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked after the news conference how the league would survive  
after the nasty six-month lockout and Jordan's retirement, Stern 
said: ``We're going to be in fine shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House today, President Clinton said Jordan had ``a  
remarkable set of qualities of mind, body and spirit ... who always 
expected to do whatever it was he tried to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's appropriate that the sports fans around America  
take a day or two to `Ooh' and `Ahh' and hold their breath again 
and be glad again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, 35, said he hoped the Bulls would re-sign teammate  
Scottie Pippen but added that was only his opinion and that he 
didn't know what decisions the team would make. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set high standards around here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan met with a few teammates at his home Monday and told them  
the thought of playing an abbreviated, 50-game season wasn't enough 
of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jordan goes out as he always wanted -- on top. His  
last-second shot -- the last one he ever took -- gave the Bulls a 
victory over the Utah Jazz and their sixth title.

Jordan's and a teammate on Chicago's first three NBA championship 
teams.

<HEADLINE> Rare Civil War-era Flag Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Authorities have recovered a rare American  
flag that represented a black regiment during the Civil War and 
arrested a man suspected of stealing the artifact and then trying 
to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag represented the 12th Regiment Corps d'Afrique, one of  
the Union army's first units with black soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Wilhite of Overland Park, Kan., was arrested Monday  
after meeting with an undercover agent at a hotel. He is charged 
with interstate transportation of stolen property and theft of 
major artwork, and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 
fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhite had no comment on the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	The flag had been missing from the Army's collection for at  
least 22 years after it was stolen while being taken to Fort 
Jackson, S.C., from Fort McNair near Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag, unveiled by the FBI Tuesday, shows signs of age --  
white splotches have faded some of the flag's blue background and 
lettering sewn in across one of the red stripes is barely visible 
from afar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The significance of the flag is that it is one of the only  
U.S. Colored troop flags in existence,'' said Steven Wright, 
curator of collections at The Civil War Library &AMP; Museum in 
Philadelphia. ``These are unbelievably rare, and absolutely 
priceless historically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were tipped to the case by a Civil War relic dealer  
who said that Wilhite was trying to sell the flag, Special Agent 
Linda Vizi said. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI agent posing as a buyer contacted Wilhite last month, and  
he tried to sell the flag for $28,000 plus expenses at the hotel 
Monday, Vizi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said the silk flag could fetch a six-figure sum if in  
good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	In Civil War history, there were only about 17 flags made to  
represent black regiments, said David Cole, a curator at the U.S. 
Army Center of Military History in Washington. Only five, including 
the one recovered this week, are known to be in existence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12th Regiment of Corps d'Afrique was formed in the Port  
Hudson, La., area in 1863 by Gen. Nathaniel Banks. It was 
eventually incorporated into the 50th regiment of the U.S. Colored 
Troops when the USCT was formed in 1864.

<HEADLINE> More Tax-Cutting Proposals Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Flush with the largest surpluses in history, states are opening  
their new legislative sessions with talk of cutting taxes on 
everything from clothing to corporate income, marriage to medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make 1999 the sixth consecutive year of tax cuts --  
the longest series of net decreases in the last quarter-century, 
according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four states say they expect to cut taxes this year.  
</P>
<P>
	After several years of wrongly predicting that states would back  
away from tax cuts for fear of the collapse of the stock market, 
experts now say all bets are off. On the table are tax cuts both 
big and small, permanent and one-time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some economists are surprised by the fact that some  
states are making tax cuts and it's supposed to have an impact on 
revenues -- they're supposed to come down -- but they're not,'' said 
Arturo Perez, a fiscal adviser for the Denver-based NCSL. ``Things 
just keep running and running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among proposed places to trim: Hawaii's corporate income tax,  
Idaho's marriage tax, Massachusetts' personal income tax, New 
Jersey's school tax, a sales tax in Oklahoma on groceries and one 
in Texas on over-the-counter medicines, diapers, first-aid items, 
access to the Internet and back-to-school clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In some states, including Arizona, Kansas, Maryland, New Mexico  
and Wisconsin, governors were reelected in part based on promises 
they made last fall to cut taxes. Newly elected governors made 
those promises in Illinois, Iowa and Ohio, according to the Nelson 
A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of 
New York in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be a tax cut. Until I see otherwise, I believe  
what I campaigned on is real, and it makes sense,'' said Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, a Republican who has promised voters he'll seek 
another $2 billion in property and sales tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, 16 states predicted they would cut taxes; 35  
ultimately did. 
</P>
<P>
	A time flush with surplus isn't exactly conducive to selling tax  
increases, but some are still planning to try. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendenning and  
lawmakers in Illinois are proposing gas tax hikes to pay for 
transportation projects, though Glendenning says he may wait until 
next year. He is also proposing a $1-per-pack tax increase on 
cigarettes to discourage youth smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators are also expected to sift through dozens of  
education reform proposals, hoping to boost American students' 
ability to compete with their overseas counterparts. Watch for laws 
mandating smaller classes, standards for teachers and students, 
school safety and school choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are more into setting goals and measuring,''  
said Elaine Stuart with The Council of State Governments in 
Lexington, Ky. ``The particulars differ, but a lot of this is aimed 
at making people meet a standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six states have to decide how to spend billions of dollars  
from settlements reached with the tobacco industry. At least six 
states have already passed tobacco-related legislation, earmarking 
some of the money or dealing with the settlement's impact on 
tobacco farmers, for example. But most states were waiting for 
state courts to finalize the deals over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists predict the main labor issue of 1999 will be so-called  
``equal pay,'' which is aimed at increasing women's wages. The 
measures would require employers to reassess the value of jobs and 
adjust their pay scales accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is that women-dominated jobs are underpaid because  
it's considered women's work,'' said Karen Nussbaum, head of the 
working women's department at the AFL-CIO in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor activists predict they'll get equal pay legislation  
introduced in at least 25 states; legislators in Illinois, Indiana 
and New York have already signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	California Gov. Gray Davis is expected to make restoration of  
the eight-hour day a major priority after the state labor movement 
spent about $11.5 million to put him in office. A state commission 
decided a year ago to drop overtime pay for more than eight hours 
of work a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart said other hot topics for 1999 will be states' efforts to  
curb urban sprawl, provide health care to poor children and fight 
the use of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCSL predicts secondhand smoke, continued welfare reform,  
dealing with the Y2K bug and deregulating the electricity industry 
will also be common themes.

<HEADLINE>  Michael Jordan Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The NBA's greatest player made it official today.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls after 13 seasons,  
six championships and countless soaring dunks. But he left open the 
slightest possibility that he might return one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, I'm exhausted. I don't feel I have a challenge,''  
Jordan said at a news conference at the United Center, where a 
bronze statue of him stands outside. ``Physically, I feel great. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect time for me to walk away from the game. I'm  
at peace with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he was ``99.9 percent'' sure he would never return  
and added, ``You can read that for what it's worth. ... I'm very 
secure in my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed why he wouldn't say he was 100 percent certain,  
Jordan said: ``Because it's my 1 percent and not yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Jordan's retirement broke late Monday, but he had  
refused to comment until today. After leading the Bulls to their 
sixth championship in June, Jordan said he would make an 
announcement on his future only once the NBA lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The players and owners reached a deal last week to save what's  
left of the season, and everyone's next question was whether Jordan 
would return. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan era included five MVP awards, 10 scoring titles, 12  
All-Star appearances and many magic moments, from last-second shots 
to phenomenal scoring outbursts. More important, Jordan had charm 
and a nice-guy image that earned him multimillion-dollar 
sponsorship deals and reached even non-sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to be the best basketball player I could be,'' said  
Jordan, who was joined by his wife, Juanita, Bulls chairman Jerry 
Reinsdorf and NBA commissioner David Stern. ``I've had a great 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan alluded to his first retirement in 1993, when he briefly  
pursued a professional baseball career before returning late in the 
1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we do this again, a second time,'' he said to open the  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Bulls unveiled a banner in the rafters from  
Jordan's first retirement. It said ``Jordan 1984-1993'' -- but it 
will now have to be updated. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had lost his desire to play, he said: ``The desire  
is always going to be there.'' But he said he wanted to make sure 
that the desire was there ``not one-fourth of the time I step onto 
the court, but every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who had a bandage on his right index finger, said he  
severed a tendon while trying to cut a cigar and would need 
surgery. But he said he had already decided to retire before the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to enjoy life and do things I've never done  
before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he looked forward to being a parent and would ``live  
vicariously through my kids,'' whether or not they played 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life will take a change,'' said Jordan, adding that he also  
will tend to his many business interests. He makes an estimated $45 
million a year from endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Added his wife: ``I see Michael doing a lot more carpooling.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf called Jordan's announcement ``a tough day for  
basketball fans all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day I hoped would never come,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Countered Stern: ``I disagree with Jerry. This is a great day.  
The greatest basketball player in the history of the game is 
getting the opportunity to retire with the grace that described his 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked after the news conference how the league would survive  
after the nasty six-month lockout and Jordan's retirement, Stern 
said: ``We're going to be in fine shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House today, President Clinton said Jordan had ``a  
remarkable set of qualities of mind, body and spirit ... who always 
expected to do whatever it was he tried to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's appropriate that the sports fans around America  
take a day or two to `Ooh' and `Ahh' and hold their breath again 
and be glad again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, 35, said he hoped the Bulls would re-sign teammate  
Scottie Pippen but added that was only his opinion and that he 
didn't know what decisions the team would make. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set high standards around here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan met with a few teammates at his home Monday and told them  
the thought of playing an abbreviated, 50-game season wasn't enough 
of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jordan goes out as he always wanted -- on top. His  
last-second shot -- the last one he ever took -- gave the Bulls a 
victory over the Utah Jazz and their sixth title. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a way to go out as an athlete, and that's the way to  
go out,'' said B.J. Armstrong, one of about a dozen players working 
out Tuesday at the Berto Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who now plays with Charlotte, is a good friend of  
Jordan's and a teammate on Chicago's first three NBA championship 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out on top, he made the last shot, he made all the  
right plays. He's had a fabulous career and everything you could 
ever ask as an athlete, he's done. He had a chance to leave and 
this was the chance,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Bach, an assistant coach on three of the Bulls'  
championship teams, praised Jordan for not only his skill, but for 
the joy he brought to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never looked like he'd been sentenced by a judge to play  
basketball,'' Bach said. ``I've seen too many athletes not go out 
at the right time. They stay and struggle and lose some of the 
dignity they are entitled to.''

	Lewinsky Rebuffs House Prosecutors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bracing for opening arguments in his  
impeachment trial, President Clinton said Wednesday he will tend 
studiously to ``the business of the people'' while his fate is 
settled in historic Senate proceedings. House prosecutors said 
Monica Lewinsky had rejected their request for a voluntary 
interview. Judiciary Committee Republicans had sought permission to 
talk with the former White House intern, but her attorneys 
``declined to make her available,'' said a committee spokesman. 
Legal sources disclosed that a similar request was made to at least 
one other potential witness, Kathleen Willey. The House does not 
yet have permission from the Senate to call witnesses in the trial. 

</P>
<P>
	Polls Find Support for Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Polls show that public opinion remains solidly  
in President Clinton's corner as the Senate prepares to decide 
whether to remove him from office. A majority of the public says a 
full trial is unnecessary and wants the proceedings to be both 
quick and fair, several new polls suggest. Almost two-thirds of 
Americans in polls by Gallup and ABC News say they want senators to 
vote against removing the president. And about two-thirds approve 
of the job Clinton is doing, the polls show. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Extend Police Subsidies  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to offer a five-year,  
$6 billion package to up the ante on his nearly fulfilled pledge to 
put 100,000 new cops on the beat nationwide. As of last October, 
88,500 new police officers had been hired under a 1994 crime bill. 
The Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics midyear 
report being released tomorrow projects that the total number of 
violent crimes -- incidents both reported to police and those 
unreported -- could fall below 3 million for the first time since 
1973. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Planes Attack Iraqi Defenses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three straight days of confrontations in Iraqi  
``no-fly'' zones are raising speculation that President Clinton 
might order a new bombing campaign to silence Iraq's defenses. 
American warplanes again attacked air defense sites in northern 
Iraq after being targeted by at least one surface-to-air missile. 
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the administration 
intended to continue its policy of applying economic and military 
pressure, but he said there were other options. ``There's a 
credible and robust threat of force in the region if we determine 
that that needs to be used,'' Lockhart said.

	USAF Jet Crashes in Germany  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A U.S. military refueling plane  
crashed and burst into flames tonight near the Dutch border, 
killing all four crew members, a U.S. military official said. The 
KC-135 plane, assigned to a NATO base near the northwestern German 
town of Geilenkirchen was making its final landing approach when it 
crashed about two miles from the base. It took more than 100 Dutch 
and German firefighters about three hours to extinguish the burning 
plane.

	Ford Mum on Possible Volvo Purchase  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s board of directors meets  
tomorrow amid growing speculation that the world's No. 2 automaker 
is poised to acquire the automotive operations of Sweden's Volvo 
AB. Ford President Jac Nasser declined to say whether Ford was 
negotiating with Volvo. But he said Ford was open to tapping its 
more than $20 billion cash reserve to expand the company's global 
reach. Fiat of Italy and Germany's Volkswagen AG also have been 
named as possible suitors of Volvo.

Nikkei Stock Average gained 58.60 points to 13,462.20 in early 
trading. On Wednesday in New York, stocks partly recovered from a 
fierce selloff sparked by the resignation of Brazil's central bank 
chief and the devaluation of that nation's currency. The Dow 
industrials, which had fallen 261 at one point, closed down 125.12

<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke's second-ranked Blue Devils  
needed a strong finish defensively and 26 points from Trajan 
Langdon tonight for an 82-72 victory over Wake Forest. William 
Avery added 19 points and Chris Carrawell had 11 as the Blue Devils 
won their 11th consecutive game. But the Demon Deacons held Duke 14 
points below its Division I-leading average of 96 points.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 165; Nasdaq Down 31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped today as the abrupt resignation  
of Brazil's central bank chief and the subsequent devaluation of 
its currency intensified worries that Latin America's biggest 
economy would drag the region into a severe economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrials were off 165.29 at 9,309.39 in late  
morning trading, regaining ground after falling as far as 261.58 
points earlier. Bond prices rallied as investors sought safer 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 31.05 at  
2,289.70, mostly erasing an earlier drop that sent the index down 
114.56 points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index was off 14.40 
at 1,225.11. About 434 million shares traded hands on the New York 
Stock Exchange by late morning, much heavier volume than 
duringTuesday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop came after the head of Brazil's central bank, Gustavo  
Franco, resigned and his replacement effectively devalued the 
country's battered currency in hopes of stemming its financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency, the real, was allowed to trade in a wider band  
against the U.S. dollar by new Central Bank chief Francisco Lopes, 
and its value fell 8 percent against the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, opened in  
a free fall and was down 9.8 percent in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The jitters spread to markets throughout Europe and Latin  
America. London's main stock index down 4.2 percent in midday 
trading, while Paris was down 5.7 percent and Frankfurt slid 5.6 
percent. Mexico's main stock index was down 3.7 percent and other 
Latin American markets followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said the United States has  
consulted with its allies about the turmoil in Brazil -- the 
fastest-growing market for American goods and services -- and he 
hopes the problem is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are monitoring developments closely,'' the president said,  
adding that U.S. officials have talked with key officials in 
Brazil, the G-7 organization of wealthy industrial nations, other 
countries and the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally in the U.S. bond market pushed the yield on the  
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite 
direction of price, down to 5.09 percent in early trading from 5.21 
percent late Tuesday. Bonds are often seen as a safe haven in times 
of international economic unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The worries about Brazil caused a second straight day of  
declines on Wall Street, where cautious investors on Tuesday were 
taking profits, especially in high-tech stocks, run up in the new 
year's bull market. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq dropped 63.84 to 
2,320.75, while the Dow fell 145.21 to 9,474.68.

<HEADLINE> Internet Co. Gambles on Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A tiny company that posts job openings on the  
Internet has committed 43 percent of its revenue to running a 
half-minute commercial on this month's Super Bowl telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	As if more pressure were needed, the company, HotJobs.com Ltd.,  
has never advertised on TV, its original commercial concept was 
rejected by the network as inappropriate and its ad agency quit in 
the scramble for a new ad idea. 
</P>
<P>
	And to top it all off, one of its chief rivals, The  
Monsterboard, owned by TMP Worldwide, has bought twice as much 
commercial time. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't worry about HotJobs. Its $2 million gamble is already  
showing returns as it has been mentioned in numerous published 
accounts of who is advertising on the Super Bowl. The Fox network's 
rejection of the initial ad idea drew more free news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	HotJobs' tale illustrates how attractive the Super Bowl is for  
advertisers and why little-known companies are willing to take such 
big risks in going against the heavy hitters like Anheuser-Busch 
and PepsiCo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl typically attracts the year's biggest TV audience  
averaging 90 million viewers for the game and 64.8 million for the 
postgame show. By comparison, the next-most watched show last year 
was the Academy Awards with 55.3 million viewers, according to 
Nielsen Media Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is getting an average $1.6 million for a 30-second  
commercial slot on the Super Bowl, up 23 percent from a year ago, 
and more than triple the price for the highest-rated weekly 
programs in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 58 spots were still available early this week for the  
Jan. 31 telecast of the National Football League championship game 
from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer was a young company that used the Super Bowl to  
establish itself as a serious contender. It introduced its 
Macintosh personal computer during the 1984 game with an ad that 
indicated the machine would free its users from a grim Orwellian 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Internet company to advertise during the Super Bowl  
was Auto-by-tel.com Inc., an Irvine, Calif.-based car dealer, that 
had been in business for about two years when it bought an ad in 
the 1997 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	It spent about 25 percent of its revenue to buy and make the ad,  
said founder Pete Ellis. Just purchasing the ad cost $1.2 million 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis said revenue jumped so much after the ad appeared that  
they returned to advertise during the 1998 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got pretty big bang for the buck,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While the company is advertising elsewhere this year, Ellis said  
the Super Bowl ``works terrific'' for establishing a brand name. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what Richard Johnson, a co-founder and chief  
executive of New York-based HotJobs, wants to do. ``We needed to 
step out in a big way,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said being a Super Bowl sponsor is something he can use when  
trying to recruit companies who pay the freight for the jobs 
listings service. Job seekers use the service for free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running an ad in the Super Bowl has lasting effects -- it's not  
just 30 seconds,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	HotJobs, which generated $4.6 million in revenue last year in  
its second full year as a Web site, agreed to buy a Super Bowl slot 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	It hired the agency Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, Inc.,  
to create the commercial. The Boston-based agency has made Super 
Bowl ads in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Criniti, a senior vice president at Hill Holliday, said  
HotJobs wanted an edgy ad and of a half-dozen concepts, HotJobs 
executives liked one in which a zookeeper swept an elephant cage, 
both man and beast oblivious to the other's presence. As they 
unwittingly moved towards one-another, the elephant sat on the 
zookeeper. When the elephant got up, all that remained was the 
broom, suggesting the man dissappeared inside the elephant. 
</P>
<P>
	The message: If you are stuck in a bad job, try HotJobs'  
listings. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, despite its risque programs such as ``Melrose Place'' and  
``Married ... With Children,'' rejected the proposal as tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks have wide latitude to edit or reject ads. Last  
year, NBC rejected Vivus Inc.'s proposed ad for an impotency 
medicine, saying it was inappropriate for a Super Bowl audience. It 
sold the time to another advertiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson wasn't interested in modifying the ad, nor in trying to  
get his money back. HotJobs needed a new idea. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hill Holliday went back to the drawing board, HotJobs posted  
a plea on its Web site asking for ideas for a Super Bowl commercial 
and Johnson talked with an executive at another agency. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke with Kevin Moehlenkamp, an acquaintance who is now  
creative director of McCann-Erickson's Detroit agency. When word 
got back to Hill Holliday that HotJobs was looking for ideas from 
another agency, Hill Holliday resigned in a huff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it was going to be a bake-off,'' Criniti said.  
</P>
<P>
	With seven weeks to the kickoff, McCann-Erickson Detroit was  
hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Criniti denied that they created an ad they knew  
would be rejected as a way to get publicity. But the company has 
courted attention, inviting reporters to sit in when its new ad 
agency pitched its ideas and to watch the commercial being made. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency presented six ideas for the HotJobs ad in  
mid-December and Johnson settled on one featuring a security guard 
daydreaming about other jobs -- financier, actor, scientist -- and 
winding up with a better security job. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson anticipates no problems getting clearance for the ad,  
but says he has a fallback idea: ``We'll just have a logo and a 
voice-over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	End advance for release anytime

<HEADLINE> Q&AMP;A on Brazil's Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brazil's abrupt devaluation of its currency and  
its change of central bankers shocked financial markets Wednesday, 
as investors worried that Brazil's economic problems could spread 
to the rest of Latin America and eventually the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been stampeding out of Brazil since last July,  
alarmed by the government's large budget deficit and the rapid 
depletion of its foreign currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation took a sharp turn for the worse last week after a  
powerful state declared that it couldn't pay back debt to the 
central government. The move worsened fears that Brazil might not 
have the political will to implement the sharp government spending 
cuts and other fiscal austerity measures it has promised to get its 
finances in order. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some questions and answers about what's going on in  
Brazil and the repercussions. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. What happened in Brazil on Wednesday?  
</P>
<P>
	A. Gustavo Franco, head of Brazil's central bank, quit, citing  
personal reasons and policy differences. His replacement, Francisco 
Lopes, allowed the country's currency, the real (pronounced 
'ree-ahl'), to decline about 8 percent against the dollar. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. Why did they do that?  
</P>
<P>
	A. As part of an effort to keep inflation in check, Brazil had  
been defending the real's value by keeping interest rates high and 
by buying the real on currency markets. Those measures had exacted 
a high price on Brazil's economy. The government is running out of 
foreign money to buy reals, and the high interest rates have been 
stifling economic activity. Brazil hopes that by letting its 
currency decline, or devalue, it will be able to bring interest 
rates lower and will spend less in defending the real. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. But the International Monetary Fund approved a $41 billion  
aid package for Brazil last fall. Shouldn't that be helping? 
</P>
<P>
	A. The IMF aid package was approved on condition that Brazil  
take fiscal austerity measures, including spending cuts. Some of 
those measures have yet to be approved, meaning that the bulk of 
the IMF aid has not yet been released. But even if the IMF package 
had been in place, some experts say that Brazil may have had to 
devalue its currency anyway. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. What happens if Brazil's economic situation worsens?  
</P>
<P>
	A. Latin America economies are already weak, making them even  
more vulnerable to a drastic downturn in Brazil, the largest 
economy in the region with 160 million people. Many U.S. banks have 
significant loans outstanding in Brazil, an estimated 2,000 U.S. 
companies do business there. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about these companies' profits pressured the U.S. stock  
market Wednesday. Should Brazil's troubles spread to Mexico, it 
could have an even greater impact on the United States since Mexico 
is one of the United States' biggest trading partners after Canada 
and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has been seen as a test case for whether the financial  
turmoil that has gripped Asia and Russia can be contained. ``If the 
situation in Brazil unravels, you could have a much more severe 
recession throughout the region which could start a vicious cycle 
that could hurt the U.S. economy,'' says Francisco Larios, senior 
emerging markets economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. Why is currency devaluation such a big deal anyway?  
</P>
<P>
	A. One of Brazil's most serious problems now is that  
international investors have been pulling their money out of the 
country's stock and bond markets because they're losing faith in 
the government's ability to get the economic problems under 
control. Every time the real falls, foreign investors take a hit as 
their Brazilian holdings lose value. A gradual decline in the 
real's value is bad enough, but an unexpected move like Wednesday's 
one can be even more unsettling. If investors keep pulling money 
out and selling their reals against other currencies, the real 
suffers further, creating a vicious circle. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. What does Brazil do now?  
</P>
<P>
	A. Brazil's main task is to convince foreign investors that  
their country is a safe place to invest. Even though some 
economists agree with the thinking behind Brazil's currency 
devaluation, they say it comes at a very bad time. ``They had a 
policy which was not sustainable. They wanted a stable currency 
that required high interest rates,'' Larios said. But, he added, 
the crisis is intensifying just as many countries around the world 
are in recession and as financial markets remain jittery. ``Their 
chances of success are much lower now than they were a year ago.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks closed mixed today amid lingering  
concern over volatility in the foreign exchange market following 
intervention by Bank of Japan on Tuesday. The dollar slipped 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 42.63  
points, or 0.32 percent, closing at 13,403.60 points. On Tuesday, 
the index shed 7.51 points, or 0.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Nikkei's gains, decliners outnumbered advancers 650  
to 459, with 201 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 111.55 yen, down  
0.95 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New 
York level of 112.43 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices opened slightly lower after a drop Tuesday on  
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 
9,474.68, down 145.21. 
</P>
<P>
	But later, the market improved as investors cautiously bought  
blue chips amid persistent unease about the direction of the 
currency market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market sentiment hasn't improved, with the number of  
retreaters beating gainers, although the rise of international blue 
chips such as Sony, Honda and Canon supported the Nikkei average,'' 
said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor information group at 
Kankaku Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Among gainers were stocks of big exporters and banks. Losers  
included major steelmakers and drug shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 1.15 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,057.08. The 
TOPIX lost 1.41 points, or 0.13 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 375  
million shares, up from Tuesday's turnover of 361 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, currency  
players avoided taking aggressive positions after the Bank of Japan 
triggered a rally in the U.S. currency on Tuesday by intervening in 
support of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Koji Tanami, Japan's vice finance minister, told reporters today  
that sharp foreign exchange movements were ``highly undesirable.'' 
Tanami refused to comment on Tuesday's central bank action. 
</P>
<P>
	``As players in the game, authorities don't comment on that,''  
Tanami said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's yen-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan, the  
first such action since February, 1996, was estimated at $1 billion 
to $2 billion in foreign exchange markets as the central bank 
dumped yen holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, after sliding from a high of more than 147 yen in  
August to a 28-month low on Monday, rose more than 4 yen on Tuesday 
on the back of the surprise intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive  
abroad and cuts into profits earned overseas. Lower earnings by 
exporters could hamper efforts to jump start Japan's recession 
plagued economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said there was no indication on the foreign exchange  
market today that the Bank of Japan stepped in to bolster the 
sagging dollar for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 129.50 yen, up from 127.83 yen late  
Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.725 percent from Tuesday's close of 1.770 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.60 yen from 100.24 yen.

<HEADLINE> William H. Whyte Dies at Age 81 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- William H. Whyte, who helped pioneer the  
scholarly study of urban human habitats and warned against the 
proliferation of corporate conformity in his best-seller ``The 
Organization Man,'' is dead at 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte died Tuesday in Manhattan, where he lived.  
</P>
<P>
	A champion of spontaneity in workplaces and cities, Whyte took  
camera and notebook in hand and walked urban streets, painstakingly 
observing pedestrian behavior and making observations on the way 
people were using newly planned urban spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Whyte's 1956 best-seller ``The Organization Man,''  
written while he was a Fortune magazine editor, that first brought 
him public attention for rethinking America's corporate ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	The book lamented that individualists' once-bold visions had  
been replaced by ``modest aspirations of organization men who lower 
their sights to achieve a good job with adequate pay and proper 
pension and a nice house in a pleasant community populated with 
people as nearly like themselves as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also sounded an optimistic theme: that ``individualism within  
organizational life'' was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the book was published, Whyte was Fortune's  
assistant managing editor, a post he kept until he left in 1958 to 
become a scholar of human habitats. 
</P>
<P>
	As a planner, he made keenly amusing observations. He had this  
perception of lovers: ``Contrary to plaza lore, they do not tryst 
mostly in secluded places. They're right out in front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men gathering to talk favor pillars and flagpoles -- something at  
their backs, Whyte discovered. ``Schmoozers do not stand often or 
long in the middle of big plazas,'' he observed. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Whyte spent 16 years charting and unobtrusively  
recording New Yorkers' meanderings, concluding the inner city was 
as safe as suburban parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
	His advice was heeded in the design of many public spaces, among  
them the midtown oasis Bryant Park. His 1959 study ``Conservation 
Easements'' was credited with helping bring about open-space 
legislation in California, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte was a Distinguished Professor at Hunter College of the  
City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his environmental books were ``The Last Landscape''  
(1968), ``The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces'' (1980), ``City'' 
(1989) and ``The Exploding Metropolis'' (1993). 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Jenny Bell; a daughter and a  
granddaughter.

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Replaced on Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- New York Yankees owner George  
Steinbrenner was replaced on baseball's executive council by 
Seattle Mariners chairman John Ellis at Wednesday's American League 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, a maverick among owners since buying control of  
the Yankees in 1973, was elected to a three-year term on the 
council in March 1995 and was not reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees and Adidas agreed to a $95 million, 10-year  
marketing contract that conflicted with parts of baseball's 
national deals and then sued, Steinbrenner was suspended from the 
council on May 13, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was settled nearly a year later and Steinbrenner was  
reinstated last April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	While the leagues sometime reappoint owners to the council, they  
also rotate the spots. The eight-man council ran baseball from 
commissioner Fay Vincent's forced resignation in September 1992 
until last July, when Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig -- who had 
been acting commissioner for nearly six years -- was voted to a 
formal five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig then placed his ownership shares of the Brewers into a  
trust that picked his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	In other business, owners were set approve the $150 million sale  
of the Florida Marlins from H. Wayne Huizenga to John Henry. 
Huizenga founded the franchise, which started play in 1993, but 
became disenchanted in 1997 when Florida failed to fund a publicly 
financed ballpark with a retractable roof. Not even a World Series 
championship for the Marlins that year changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, a commodities trader from Boca Raton, Fla., hopes to get  
a new stadium for his team, which is a shell of its former self. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's payroll dropped from $52.5 million to $19.1 million,  
and the Marlins went 54-108, the worst record ever for a defending 
champion and the poorest record in the National League since 1969. 
Just four players remain from the World Series roster: Antonio 
Alfonseca, Craig Counsell, Cliff Floyd and Livan Hernandez.

<HEADLINE> The Philosophy of STD Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If you want to change the way people act, you have to know  
what's important to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing what mattered to poor black and Hispanic women in San  
Antonio helped counselors make almost a 40 percent difference in 
the number reinfected with sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS, gonorrhea, chlamydia and other STDs are far more common  
among minorities than among whites. And clinic workers have found 
that it is harder to get women to stop doing things that put them 
at risk than it is to get men to change. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochelle N. Shain's group at the University of Texas found a way  
to deal with that, according to a report in Thursday's New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Before researchers began counseling women for this study, they  
spent 18 months looking at local black and Hispanic life, cultures, 
values, beliefs, behavior and knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	They then enrolled 617 women who were being treated for STDs at  
clinics in the San Antonio area. The women were divided into two 
groups, and the researchers looked at the numbers who came down 
with a second STD. 
</P>
<P>
	One group got standard counseling. The other group's counselors  
got the benefit of the research. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the researchers found that cleanliness, including  
not ``eating behind'' others -- sharing their plates or silverware -- 
is important among blacks. So the counselors explained that just as 
it is important not to eat or drink behind someone, you don't want 
to have sex ``behind someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The infection rate in the experimental group was 34 percent less  
than that in the control group at six months, 49 percent less at 12 
months, and 38 percent less overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shain cautioned that people who want to help other groups  
would have to study them, to learn what they feel is important. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not look at AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Cut Losses; Dow Down 103.24 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock markets were roiled today by the abrupt  
resignation of Brazil's central bank chief and the subsequent 
devaluation of its currency, which intensified worries that Latin 
America's biggest economy would drag the region into a severe 
economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was off 103.24 at 9,371.44 in  
afternoon trading, but had regained most of its lost ground after 
falling as far as 261.58 points earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more dramatic was the swing in the technology-heavy Nasdaq  
composite index, which was up 13.43 at 2,334.12, recovering from a 
plunge of nearly 5 percent, or 114.56 points, in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was heavy, with about 638 million shares changing hands  
on the New York Stock Exchange by midday, well above Tuesday's 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's drop came after the head of Brazil's central bank,  
Gustavo Franco, resigned and his replacement effectively devalued 
the country's battered currency in hopes of stemming its financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency, the real, was allowed to trade in a wider band  
against the U.S. dollar by new Central Bank chief Francisco Lopes, 
and its value fell 8 percent against the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, opened in  
a free fall and dropped 10 percent before rebounding somewhat. The 
index was down 5.3 percent at midday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jitters spread to markets throughout Europe and Latin  
America. London's main stock index closed down 3 percent, while 
Paris fell 3.3 percent and Frankfurt slid 4.1 percent. Mexico's 
main stock index was down 3 percent at midday and other Latin 
American markets followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said the United States has  
consulted with its allies about the turmoil in Brazil -- the 
fastest-growing market for American goods and services -- and he 
hopes the problem is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are monitoring developments closely,'' the president said,  
adding that U.S. officials have talked with key officials in 
Brazil, the G-7 organization of wealthy industrial nations, other 
countries and the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally in the U.S. bond market pushed the yield on the  
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite 
direction of price, down to 5.14 percent at midday from 5.21 
percent late Tuesday. Bonds are often seen as a safe haven in times 
of international economic unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The worries about Brazil caused a second straight day of  
declines on Wall Street, where cautious investors on Tuesday were 
taking profits, especially in high-tech stocks, run up in the new 
year's bull market. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq dropped 63.84 to 
2,320.75, while the Dow fell 145.21 to 9,474.68.

<HEADLINE> IOC Exec Meets With Coke Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Damage control is the goal of the visit to  
Atlanta by the top marketing officer of the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, IOC marketing director based in Lausanne,  
Switzerland, had Tuesday night meetings set with Coca-Cola Co. 
officials, and planned other meetings today at the headquarters 
offices of United Parcel Service and The Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne came to Atlanta to begin a series of meetings to answer  
questions and give assurances to Olympic sponsors that action is 
being taken to clean up the Salt Lake City corruption mess. 
</P>
<P>
	One corporate sponsor, US West, has said it will hold up a $5  
million sponsorship payment due at the end of this month amid 
investigations of bribery in the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch said Tuesday's meeting was expected  
to be lengthy, but he wasn't sure whether the company would release 
any details. Coke, an Olympic sponsor since 1928 that spent some 
$200 million on sponsorship and global marketing of the 1996 
Atlanta Summer Games, emphasized its continued commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in the Olympic movement. We're concerned about  
anything that can negatively impact the Olympics,'' Deutsch said. 
``We've expressed our concerns to the IOC, U.S. Olympic Committee 
and the Salt Lake City organizing committee and have been assured 
that they will take swift action to bring this situation to a 
positive closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company has been in regular contact with Olympic  
officials about the allegations.

<P>
	``We are very confident that they are taking the right steps,''  
Deutsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has already contracted to sponsor both the Summer and  
Winter Games through 2008. Home Depot, which became a sponsor for 
the first time for the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, has also 
signed on for the Salt Lake City games as a U.S. sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	But UPS hasn't decided whether to extend its Olympic sponsorship  
past the 2000 Games in Sydney. Spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said UPS 
planned even before the scandal broke to make a decision sometime 
this year on a Salt Lake City sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think it would be a factor in the discussion, but I  
think it's premature to say what factor,'' she said. ``We really 
look at it from the standpoint of the Olympic brand. We think it's 
a strong brand and it can sustain a hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said UPS wants to see action not only to clean up the Salt  
Lake City mess, but to prevent a repeat with future games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it will release a report on the allegations  
Jan. 24. Besides the Olympic bodies' probes, the U.S. Justice 
Department also is investigating the allegations that cash payments 
of as much as $70,000 were given to IOC members along with other 
gifts and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Former officials of the Atlanta Olympics have sharply denied  
that there was any bribery involved in gaining the 1996 games for 
the city.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Central Bank President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The president of Brazil's central  
bank resigned today, one day after the country's president sought 
to calm investors by pledging the nation would honor all its 
foreign debt obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing personal and professional reasons, the president of the  
country's Central Bank, Gustavo Franco, said he was leaving his 
post in a speech today in Brasilia, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco's resignation comes at a delicate time for Brazil.  
Investors have pulled more than $40 billion from the country since 
July, and reserves have plunged to about $35 billion. On Tuesday 
alone, $1.2 billion left the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, international lenders put together a $41.5 billion  
aid package to shore up the nation's economy. But to get the funds, 
Brazil must sharply reduce its $65 billion deficit -- a goal that 
looks ever more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco, who became president of the country's top monetary  
authority in 1997, has strongly defended high interest rates to 
attract foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But that policy is increasingly under fire from businessmen and  
workers, who claim it strangles growth and raises unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's promise  
that debt obligations would be honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market can rest assured,'' Cardoso said. ``We know what we  
will do, we know what we are doing, we will pay all our debts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments, however, failed to stem losses on the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo exchange -- Latin America's largest -- closed down  
7.6 percent Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Drink Milk, Keep Your Colon Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Adding calcium to the diet -- through milk or other means -- can  
help prevent tumors in the large intestine, researchers reported 
today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect was moderate but significant, wrote Dr. J.A. Baron of  
the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 832 people who underwent surgery for  
colorectal adenomas -- benign tumors -- at six hospitals around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	About half got calcium supplements and half got placebos.  
Doctors looked to see whether they developed another adenoma over 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 percent were taking their pills at least 90 percent  
of the time during the fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second through fourth years of the study -- the main risk  
period -- 127 of the 409 people taking calcium had developed at 
least one adenoma, compared with 159 of the 423 taking placebos. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, there were more tumors per patient in the placebo  
group: 0.73 compared with 0.55. 
</P>
<P>
	The study seems to back up a theory that bile acids may be part  
of the reason that a diet rich in vegetables and fruits carries a 
lower risk of intestinal growths than one high in red meat and fat. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory held that calcium binds bile acids traveling through  
the bowel, reducing their opportunity to cause growths.

<HEADLINE> Nike Will Continue To Market Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike has been preparing for years for the  
day when the man who helped sell $2.6 billion in shoes would 
finally hang up his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Michael Jordan has made his retirement official, the  
world's largest athletic shoe company is banking he still can fly, 
positioning His Airness as an icon like Babe Ruth or Muhammad Ali, 
whose attraction goes beyond the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really time to stop marketing the basketball player and  
start marketing the person,'' Nike spokeswoman Vizhier Mooney said 
after Jordan announcement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans are in the works to keep expanding Jordan's signature line  
of athletic shoes and clothing with the high-flying silhouette logo 
rather than the swoosh by playing off Jordan's charisma rather than 
his jumper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan has become a bona fide brand and not just an  
endorsement,'' said Nike Chairman Phil Knight. ``I don't think 
you're going to see anything like this for quite a while. This is 
something very, very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight acknowledged he had mixed feelings about seeing Jordan  
retire, but denied an ESPN report that he visited Jordan last 
weekend in an attempt to talk him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, I know it wouldn't do any good if I did try,''  
Knight said. ``Secondly, there is part of me, probably more than 
half, that is really kind of pleased that for him to go out the way 
he went out. It really befits the grace and dignity with which he 
played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said Jordan will be personally involved in product  
development, just as he's been involved every step of the way since 
Nike signed him for a mere $500,000 as an NBA rookie in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a bargain, considering sales of Air Jordan shoes were  
$130 million in the first year. They reached $350 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you took the Jordan brand out of Nike, it would still be  
number two basketball company in the world next to Nike,'' Mooney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Jordan has been compared to such American exports as  
Coca-Cola and Mickey Mouse, and is a huge star in places where 
basketball is barely even followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion is that Jordan is obviously one of the few athletes  
who transcends sport,'' said Josie Esquivel, an analyst with Morgan 
Stanley in New York. ``He has this appeal that makes him a great 
ambassador for sports of any kind. The corporate executives 
certainly believe that mantra, but I think you have a large number 
of people who believe that too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan line has taken a big hit only once, in 1993, when he  
quit basketball for nearly two seasons to try his hand at a 
baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball shoe sales slumped 30 percent, not just for Nike, but  
for the entire athletic shoe industry. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Jordan was even more valuable to Nike because his  
line represented a bigger slice of the revenue pie. His shoes and 
apparel accounted for about $280 million in sales, or 8 percent of 
Nike's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The $350 million in Air Jordan sales last year were less than 4  
percent of Nike's overall revenue, which has more than doubled in 
five years to $9.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Jordan as an 82-game-a-year billboard couldn't have come  
at a worse time for Nike, which began the year with hopes of an 
Asian economic recovery after tightening its corporate belt most of 
last year with falling profits, layoffs and budget cuts across the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything has gone horrible for them in the past year,'' said  
analyst Jennifer Black of Black &AMP; Co in Portland. ``There's been 
nothing but negative on the horizon for Nike for such a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, an  
athletic shoe industry newsletter in Glen Mills, Pa., said Jordan's 
retirement may force the company to make more changes in the way it 
uses its biggest star. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good part is that the Air Jordan had gotten a little long  
in the tooth,'' he said. ``Dynasties, after a while, can be boring. 
It was kind of time from the NBA standpoint for some new blood 
there.''

<HEADLINE> Sun Devils Looking to Upset Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Sixteen games into his first season at  
Arizona State, with his team getting better and better, coach Rob 
Evans would love a breakthrough victory for his promising program. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's matchup with seventh-ranked Arizona provides  
the perfect opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	`It's like the UCLA game,'' Evans said. ``Had we won the UCLA  
game, that would have been a milestone for this program. Beating 
Arizona would be a milestone for this program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans came to Arizona State from Mississippi, taking over a Sun  
Devil program still recovering from the shame of a point-shaving 
scandal, a program trying to escape the long shadow of Lute Olson 
and his highly successful teams down Interstate 10 at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the players on the Sun Devils' roster, only Bobby Lazor has  
beaten Arizona, and that was when he was a freshman and sophomore 
at Syracuse, before he transferred to Arizona State. The Sun Devils 
haven't beaten the Wildcats since 1995, a span of six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear Arizona this and Arizona that,'' ASU guard Eddie  
House said. ``Well, if you beat Arizona, it's going to turn around. 
People are going to start talking about Arizona State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a miserable start that included homecourt losses to  
Northern Arizona and New Orleans, Arizona State has won eight of 
its last 10 to improve to 10-6 overall, 2-2 in the Pac-10. The two 
losses were heartbreakers, 72-70 at USC and 88-85 in overtime at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Sun Devils blew out Washington by 24 points and  
Washington State by 28, the first time in 11 years that Arizona 
State has had back-to-back 20-point Pac-10 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	The blowouts would seem to make the Sun Devils strong candidates  
to ambush a young Arizona team that has a glossy 11-1 record, 3-1 
in the Pac-10, but has shown signs of vulnerability, committing 30 
turnovers in an 11-point home victory over Washington State, then 
barely escaping with an 88-86 wih over Washington last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our freshmen have to understand the intensity that comes with  
games like this,'' Olson said of the Arizona State game. ``We will 
have to play the best we have played all year long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans has no doubt he has his program headed in the right  
direction. At Ole Miss, he led the team to consecutive 20-win 
seasons for the first time in 60 years. And recruiting players to 
Tempe is a whole lot easier than to Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	His first class of early signees, due in next fall, has been  
rated one of the best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	This team, though, is mainly holdovers from interim coach Don  
Newman's one season that followed Bill Frieder's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's leaders are House, Lazor and Mike Baptiste, who was  
ineligible for the first eight games because of academic problems. 
The Sun Devils are 6-2 since Baptiste's return. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona State also has benefited from the addition of freshman  
Kenny Crandall, who can play guard and small forward. Crandall 
missed the first three games while his SAT test results made their 
way through the university's red tape. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of better than 13,000 is expected, about twice what the  
Sun Devils drew for last week's games against the Washington 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sports-saturated Phoenix area, the Sun Devils face an  
uphill fight to build fan support. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're able to win this game, I think people will start to  
get behind us a little more,'' Lazor said. ``I wish they were 
behind us in the first place. There's no reason we shouldn't have 
10,000 or 11,000 at every game because we play a fun style of 
basketball to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona freshman Richard Jefferson, who grew up in Phoenix,  
thinks that with Evans, the rivalry will get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always had players, they just needed somebody to  
motivate them,'' Jefferson said. ``If Rob Evans is as dedicated as 
he says he is, I think it will start to be more and more intense 
throughout our years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Arizona State can upset the Wildcats, both teams would be 3-2  
in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're kind of jelling as a team,'' House said. ``If  
we go out and execute and we get these guys, it would be a sweet 
feeling. I'd have a sweet taste in my mouth.''

<HEADLINE> Latin American Markets Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Their currencies and stock markets reeling  
from turmoil in Brazil, Latin American countries scrambled 
Wednesday to prevent their giant neighbor's problems from dragging 
down their economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin American officials sought to persuade citizens and  
investors that their economies were strong. Mexico took steps to 
shore up its falling peso. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets worldwide tumbled after Brazil's Central Bank chief,  
Gustavo Franco, resigned and his successor devalued the Brazilian 
currency by 7.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin American markets were affected immediately. In addition to  
Brazil, which fell 5 percent, the Mexican market fell 4.6 percent, 
Venezuela 3 percent, Peru 5.45 percent, Chile 3.25 percent and 
Colombia 3.4 percent. The market in Argentina, Brazil's partner in 
the Mercosur bloc, fell 10.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's problems are also fueling fears of a new regional  
economic crisis like the one that followed the collapse of the 
Mexican peso in late 1994 and early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco resigned at a time of falling investor confidence in  
Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. More than $40 billion has 
left the country since July and reserves have plunged to $35 
million, raising fears it might default on its debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of other Latin countries worked to distinguish their  
economic situations from Brazil's. Chilean officials, for example, 
said their country could head off any crisis through its strong 
economic foundations, flexibility and the joint efforts of the 
government and Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But some economists voiced concern that problems in one Latin  
American economy can make investors wary of the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
	``It provokes as an aversion on the part of investors toward the  
markets of emerging countries. This is reflected throughout Latin 
America,'' said Alejandro Mercado, an economist in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect can be particularly hard on smaller countries.  
</P>
<P>
	``Peru isn't big enough to remain stable if the rest of the  
markets in the region suffer. Fundamentals here are fairly strong 
and improving, but that's not enough,'' said Marco Modenessi, an 
analyst with the Lima brokerage house ABS Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico moved immediately to try to defend its economies. The  
Bank of Mexico sold $200 million from its reserves and raised 
interest rates by expanding monetary restrictions on commercial 
banks 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican peso, which had been trading at 10.75 to the dollar  
early in the day, regained some strength and closed at 10.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria said Mexico's  
free-floating foreign exchange policy would enable the peso to 
absorb the volatility stemming from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan bolivar fell slightly Wednesday, but the  
currency, which many consider undervalued, could come under more 
pressure because of the Brazilian problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to spur more dollar buying in coming days. Even  
though Brazil is a minor trading partner to Venezuela, the move has 
a psychological effect,'' said Simon Brad, a Caracas-based 
investment adviser.

<HEADLINE> White House: No Impeachable Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of opening arguments, the White  
House sent the Senate a legal brief today vigorously arguing that 
there are no legal, constitutional or factual grounds for the 
removal of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is strong agreement among constitutional and legal  
scholars and historians that the substance of the articles does not 
amount to impeachable offenses,'' Clinton's attorneys wrote. They 
said the allegations ``do not begin to satisfy the stringent 
showing required by our Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected 
president from office, either as a matter of fact or law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 130-page brief offered a preview of the case that Clinton's  
attorneys will present in defending him against perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges in the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House officials are suggesting the impeachment case  
will be prosecuted like a conspiracy, alleging that the president 
schemed to keep Monica Lewinsky from revealing their extramarital 
affair and ultimately plotted to ruin her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts will move from written pages to the Senate chamber  
Thursday when the House opens its presentation. There, television 
cameras will show Americans their first live presidential 
impeachment trial and record the proceedings for history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has an obligation to turn away an unwise and  
unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of impeachment,'' the 
president's lawyers said in their brief today. ``If the Senate 
removes this president for a wrongful relationship he hoped to keep 
private, for what will the House ask the Senate to remove the next 
president and the next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brief said that removing Clinton on the basis of the  
allegations facing him would ``substantially alter the delicate 
constitutional balance'' of power among the branches of government 
and ``move us closer to a quasi-parliamentary system in which the 
president is elected to office by the choice of the people but 
continues in office only at the pleasure of Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not simply the president -- but the vote the American  
people rendered in schools, church halls and other civic centers 
all across the land 26 months ago -- that is hanging in the 
balance,'' the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief did not present new evidence. Instead, White House  
officials described it as the most comprehensive and detailed 
presentation to date about Clinton's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers argued that the articles of impeachment against  
Clinton ``fall far short of what the American people demand be 
shown and proven before their democratic choice is reversed.'' And 
in a slap at Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the House 
impeachment team, the brief said the charges ``fall far short of 
what a prudent prosecutor would require before presenting a case to 
a judge or jury.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Thinking About Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of opening arguments in his trial,  
President Clinton said today he intends ``to spend as little time 
thinking about'' his impeachment as possible and focus instead on 
issues facing Americans. ``I trust that the right thing will be 
done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton's lawyers told senators in a legal brief that  
they had an ``obligation to turn away an unwise and unwarranted'' 
House impeachment that threatens the American democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote the American people rendered ... is hanging in the  
balance,'' the presidential lawyers said in their trial brief, 
arguing that there are no legal, constitutional or factual grounds 
for removal of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is strong agreement among constitutional and legal  
scholars and historians that the substance of the articles does not 
amount to impeachable offenses,'' the attorneys wrote. They said 
the allegations ``do not begin to satisfy the stringent showing 
required by our Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected president 
from office, either as a matter of fact or law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke for the first time about the crisis since his  
impeachment last month: ``I think the Senate has to deal with that. 
We filed our brief today. It makes our case. The important thing 
for me is to spend as little time thinking about that as possible 
and as much time working on the issues we are here to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have their job to do in the Senate and I have mine and I  
intend to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president indicated he has no plans to address the  
impeachment matter in his State of the Union speech Jan. 19. ``I 
think the American people have heard about that quite extensively 
and my understanding is that I should do their business,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House filed papers today that contested the White House's  
legal assertions but did not make any expansive arguments. The 
papers contended the articles of impeachment ``properly state 
impeachable offenses,'' warrant Clinton's removal from office and 
disqualification from further office and are not 
``unconstitutionally vague'' as presidential lawyers argued. 
</P>
<P>
	House officials suggest the impeachment case will be prosecuted  
like a conspiracy, alleging that the president schemed to keep 
Monica Lewinsky from revealing their extramarital affair and 
ultimately plotted to ruin her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts will move from written pages to the Senate chamber  
Thursday when the House opens its presentation. There, television 
cameras will show Americans their first live presidential 
impeachment trial and record the proceedings for history. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the jurors, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., suggested  
today that his colleagues can't ignore public opinion polls showing 
widespread opposition to Clinton's removal even as they try to 
judge the case impartially. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously no senator should be controlled in his or her  
decision in this trial by the public opinion polls. But I do think 
it's appropriate to take notice of them. ... This is a trial 
established by the framers of the Constitution to decide whether an 
election should be overturned,'' Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 130-page White House brief offered a preview of the case  
that Clinton's attorneys will present in defending him against 
perjury and obstruction of justice charges in the Senate 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has an obligation to turn away an unwise and  
unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of impeachment,'' the 
president's lawyers said in their brief today. ``If the Senate 
removes this president for a wrongful relationship he hoped to keep 
private, for what will the House ask the Senate to remove the next 
president and the next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brief said that removing Clinton on the basis of the  
allegations facing him would ``substantially alter the delicate 
constitutional balance'' of power among the branches of government 
and ``move us closer to a quasi-parliamentary system in which the 
president is elected to office by the choice of the people but 
continues in office only at the pleasure of Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not simply the president -- but the vote the American  
people rendered in schools, church halls and other civic centers 
all across the land 26 months ago -- that is hanging in the 
balance,'' the lawyers said 
</P>
<P>
	The brief did not present new evidence. Instead, White House  
officials described it as the most comprehensive and detailed 
presentation to date about Clinton's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers argued that the articles of impeachment against  
Clinton ``fall far short of what the American people demand be 
shown and proven before their democratic choice is reversed.'' And 
in a slap at Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the House 
impeachment team, the brief said the charges ``fall far short of 
what a prudent prosecutor would require before presenting a case to 
a judge or jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to show a scheme to conceal the relationship and  
eventually destroy Ms. Lewinsky's reputation and credibility, the 
prosecutors plan to weave together conduct including: searching for 
a job for the former intern, hiding gifts she exchanged with 
Clinton, having her sign a false affidavit in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case against the president, possibly coaching 
presidential secretary Betty Currie and the president's making 
comments to aides that portrayed Ms. Lewinsky as the aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance on Dec. 5, 1997, lawyers representing Mrs. Jones  
placed Ms. Lewinsky on a potential witness list at a time her 
five-month job search had gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 11 presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who had met with  
Ms. Lewinsky the previous month but produced no job contacts, began 
calling corporate executives and obtained interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also planned to link the stepped-up search to a Dec.  
11 order from the Jones trial judge, who ruled Mrs. Jones was 
entitled to information on any state or federal employee who had 
had sexual relations with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 7, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky signed an affidavit in the Jones  
case denying a sexual relationship, the House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Ms. Lewinsky had a Jordan-arranged interview and  
told the president's friend it went poorly. Jordan called the 
company's CEO, Ronald Perelman. More interviews were held and Ms. 
Lewinsky was offered a job.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Executes Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man convicted of three murders in two  
states was executed by injection early Wednesday for the 1981 
shooting death of a St. Louis taxi driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Malone, 37, was pronounced dead at 1:20 a.m. He did not  
have any last words. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing spree happened in 1981 after Malone escaped from a  
Monterey County, Calif., jail, where he was serving time for 
robbery. On March 18, he stepped off a Greyhound bus in St. Louis 
and hailed a cab. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, William Parr, 62, was abducted and shot in the head.  
Two days later, police said, Malone was in Baker, Calif., where he 
kidnapped service station attendant Myrtle Benham and beat her to 
death after a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was sentenced to death in California for that murder and  
to life in prison for the roadside shooting of a woman in Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
	He was extradited to Missouri to face charges in Parr's death.  
His attorneys, in appeals, had argued that the California death 
sentence was a factor that helped convince the St. Louis County 
jury to condemn Malone.

<HEADLINE> Noise Could Be Factor in AFC Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Along with league MVP Terrell Davis,  
future Hall of Famer John Elway and an array of experienced, 
talented players, the Denver Broncos have another impressive 
weapon: Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	They haven't lost there since the 1996 playoffs. The last 18  
games have been mostly lopsided victories. Last week, they routed 
Miami 38-3 to get to their second straight AFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, with 76,000 screaming devotees rocking the old  
building, the Broncos play the New York Jets for a spot in the 
Super Bowl. Denver won the NFL championship a year ago, albeit with 
only a first-round home game before winning at Kansas City and 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not unlike anywhere else we've played on the road,''  
linebacker Bryan Cox said Wednesday. ``In adverse conditions, and 
they'll be cheering for their team, but that's something we've 
gotten used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And prospered dealing with. The Jets won in Kansas City, Miami,  
Buffalo and New England this season to capture their first AFC East 
crown. They don't seem overly concerned about the noise level, 
thinner air and difficult surroundings in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have pretty loud fans out there and we know they are  
going to be very loud once again,'' quarterback Vinny Testaverde 
said. ``But we faced some pretty hostile crowds this year on the 
road and we've done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have to concentrate that little bit more, not make  
mistakes like jumping offsides and things like that. We know what 
we are in for and hopefully will be able to overcome those 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overcoming the Broncos at Mile High means keeping Denver from  
getting off to a quick lead. Not only did the Broncos lead the AFC 
in scoring with 501 points (the Jets scored 416), they outscored 
opponents 144-54 in the first quarter and 156-87 in the second. By 
halftime, the Broncos were in control nearly every week, leading 
each home game but one -- they were tied at 21 with Kansas City -- 
and averaging a 23-8 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is players the caliber of Davis, Elway and company that  
achieve such things, it doesn't hurt to have such vociferous 
support from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Broncos are a hard team to beat anyway, because in most  
cases, they have better players than you do,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy 
Johnson said. ``But it doesn't hurt to have all the other stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes, according to backup QB Bubby Brister -- a former  
Jet -- the loudest fans anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans are crazy everywhere,'' he said. ``You can go to Buffalo  
or Pittsburgh or even the Meadowlands and they'll be loud in the 
good times. But here, they're loud all day long. They don't boo. 
They just scream and yell and kick and holler, and it gets to teams 
after a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd for last Sunday's Jets playoff victory over  
Jacksonville was pretty deafening at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to take a few thousand along to Denver,'' receiver  
Keyshawn Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway wouldn't want that at all.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know what I find annoying?'' Elway said. ``Hearing  
`J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets' 50 times a game. Try playing in the 
middle of that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't have to on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Apple's Quarterly Profit Triples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. rode the successful  
sales of its iMac computer to its fifth-straight profitable 
quarter, easily surpassing Wall Street forecasts in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple tripled its profit from the year-ago period, earning $152  
million, or 95 cents a share on a diluted basis, in the three 
months ended Dec. 26, 1998, compared to $47 million, or 33 cents a 
diluted share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time gains, the company earned 78 cents a diluted  
share in the recent quarter, surpassing the 70 cents forecast by 
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's revenues grew 8 percent to $1.71 billion from $1.58  
billion. The company sold 519,000 iMac computers, which now come in 
five colors, since they went on sale last August. The new brand 
became the top-selling desktop machine sold at retail in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says it's selling 32 percent of iMacs to first-time  
PC buyers, suggesting that Apple is successfully reaching beyond 
its core of loyal Macintosh users. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple chief financial officer Fred Anderson said the company  
plans to take unspecified steps to keep stores supplied if they run 
out of a popular color, but for now is selling iMacs in five-packs 
to retailers, with one computer of each color included. 
</P>
<P>
	``They clearly have tapped into a market that most of us  
suspected was there,'' said analyst Barry Jaruzelski, a partner 
with Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York, who said the earnings 
success was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of cute comments about the fruit basket  
colors, but the reason the thing is doing so well is that it's a 
great industrial design,'' he added, ``which is super easy to use 
and super easy to set up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs said in a statement that Apple's stock of unsold computers  
was a healthy two days, better than Dell Computer's 
industry-leading seven days of inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's sales in foreign countries accounted for 47 percent of  
the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac's unusual-looking translucent colored cover makes them  
stand out sharply on store shelves against traditional beige home 
PCs.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today offered his good  
wishes to the newly retired Michael Jordan, and urged Americans to 
``take a day or two to ooh and ahh'' as they remember the exploits 
of the greatest basketball player of his time. ``We wish Michael 
Jordan well,'' the president said during a ceremony at which he 
announced a plan to help disabled people find jobs. ``We admire 
him, we like him very much and we thank him for years of thrilling 
exploits.'' The president spoke while Jordan, 35, was announcing 
his retirement in a news conference at Chicago's United Center.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were trimming their losses, after  
President Clinton said he hoped the crisis in Brazil would be 
``resolved in a satisfactory way.'' Brazil's currency devaluation 
this morning sparked a sharp sell-off at the open. Just before 2 
p.m. EST, the Dow industrials were down 116.63 to 9,358.05, after 
being down more than 250 this morning. NYSE decliners led advancers 
2,158-847. The Nasdaq was up 9.54 to 2,330.29 after being down more

the battered currency by nearly 8 percent in hopes of stemming the 
financial crisis in Latin America's largest economy. The Brazilian 
real was allowed to trade in a wider band against the U.S. dollar

County Cork, is being hailed as a mathematical genius for devising 
a new code for sending electronic mail -- and is being flooded by 
job offers from computer firms, the Times of London said today. 
Flannery unveiled the code to amazed judges at the Irish Young

	Police: Man Kills Ex-Wife, Himself

<P>
	RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- A man killed his ex-wife,  
mother-in-law, another woman and himself this morning in a home in 
an upscale neighborhood, and a 12-year-old boy escaped and was 
standing in the front yard when police arrived. A shotgun was found 
in the house. The man and one woman died at the scene; the two 
other women died at a hospital. Police weren't certain of a motive 
for the killings but believe it may have been related to recent 
legal action, possibly involving child support for the couple's 
college-age daughter, who was not at the house.

<HEADLINE> Quebec May Seek Damages in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEBEC (AP) -- Quebec City will claim $12.5 million in  
compensation if irregularities are proven in the choice of Salt 
Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the amount the city spent on its bid for the Games, Mayor  
Jean-Paul L'Allier and Rene Paquet, head of the Quebec 2002 
Committee, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the other cities who vied for the 2002 Games should  
also demand reimbursement from the International Olympic Committee, 
with the money going to amateur sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not at the point of claims; we're far from judicial  
proceedings,'' Paquet said. ``I've always said that if it's 
established that the (IOC) was aware and closed its eyes, 
candidates could demand compensation for their bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paquet suggested it would be a good time for IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch to step down, but he stopped short of calling for 
cancelation of the Games in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in a position to judge,'' Paquet said. ``I think it's  
more important that (IOC) accept reforms.''

<HEADLINE> Collins Confirms Fight With Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Former WBO super-middleweight champion  
Steve Collins on Wednesday confirmed he is coming out of retirement 
to fight Roy Jones Jr. for the American's WBC light-heavyweight 
title April 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irishman fighter told a news conference it would be a  
``dream come true'' if the bout was held in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight is on and if we can get it in Dublin that would be  
the icing on the cake,'' said 35-year-old Collins. ``I don't care 
where it is -- I'll fight him in America, no problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors suggest the preferred site might be Dublin's northside  
Croke Park -- the home Gaelic football -- with a capacity of about 
35,000, which would make it one of the largest fights ever staged 
in the British Isles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Celtic Warrior fighting in Croke Park would be perfect,''  
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who is coming out of retirement, quit 18 months ago  
saying he couldn't wait any longer for Jones to agree to a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones made a successful mandatory defense Saturday by stopping  
top-ranked contender Rick Frazier, a 39-year-old New York cop. The 
fight was ended in the second round of what generally was described 
as a mismatch.

<HEADLINE> Drooped Dreams: Life Without Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For 11-year-old Anthony Heredal, being like Mike  
is more than a slogan to sell a sports drink -- it's a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony spends time after school on the basketball court,  
mimicking Michael Jordan. He's even mastering the wagging tongue 
that has become a sure sign his hero is on the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Jordan hero-worship is a rite of passage for many of the  
city's youth, word of his planned retirement has hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Feels like the game is ruined,'' said Anthony, who met some  
friends after school Tuesday at a YMCA basketball court to play the 
game they have grown up associating with the Chicago Bulls star. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts me, man,'' he said, shaking his head. Without MJ, he  
said, the game ``ain't gonna have the same action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kids like Anthony see Jordan as everything they aspire to be.  
They imitate the way Jordan drives the ball, the way he defies 
gravity with his jumps shots and the way he rolls his fingers, 
flipping the ball in the hoop with such easy grace. 
</P>
<P>
	These are the kids who watch every game, hang on Jordan's every  
word, even follow the changing style of the Air Jordan sneaker. 
They buy his books and wear his No. 23 jerseys proudly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has all the right game,'' said Terrence Webb, 16. ``He  
can't be stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terrence said there's only one thing left for the Bulls: rebuild  
the whole program. Without Jordan, he said, the team will struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a crummy season,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Few were as depressed about the coming season than 10-year-old  
Anthony Williams, who came to watch his friends play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts me,'' he said, shaking his head. Without the guy they  
affectionately call M.J., professional basketball just won't have 
the same buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	Debates about who is the best player ever to step onto a  
basketball court can get heated at these after-school pickup games. 
In the past, said 14-year-old Montel Gest, kids have almost come to 
blows over whether Jordan is the greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them love him, some of them hate him,'' he said with a  
shrug as he threw the ball back in-bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	They all agree, though, that Jordan's absence will have an  
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gonna miss Jordan,'' Anthony Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Killings of Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A man accused with two Marines of killing 34  
wild horses for sport was described by neighbors as a cocky sort 
who used to blast birds outside his apartment with a shotgun and 
once gutted a deer on his living room carpet. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Merlino, 20, a construction worker, was arrested Tuesday  
after the granddaughter of a sheriff's department employee 
overheard a conversation about the horse slaughter at a party, 
according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested were Lance Cpl. Scott William Brendle, 21, and  
Lance Cpl. Darien Thomas Brock, 20, high school buddies of Merlino 
who authorities said joined the slaughter while on home leave from 
their bases in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this kind of behavior is in fact true, it doesn't speak  
very highly of a Camp Pendleton Marine,'' Lt. David Nevers, a 
spokesman at Brock's base, said Wednesday. ``We're as disgusted and 
sickened as anyone by this kind of behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbor Melissa Sarenana, who lived in the apartment  
next to Merlino for more than a year, said she was not surprised to 
hear of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed like somebody who had been picked on his whole life  
and had to take it out on innocent things,'' she said. ``He was 
sick. He was bizarre. He was really disgusting. I don't know any 
other way to put it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 27 shootings on the hillsides outside town sparked  
outrage. The horses were picked off with rifles, and several had 
limped away and lay dying when authorities found them and put them 
out of their misery. 
</P>
<P>
	A reward fund grew to $35,000, and hundreds of tips about the  
crime poured in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing the number of everyday people that were  
interested in helping us,'' sheriff's Sgt. Bill Petty said. ``I've 
been getting checks for $5 and $10 from as far away as Florida and 
Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merlino was charged with offenses including grand larceny and  
maiming, poisoning or killing another person's animal. He was 
jailed on $60,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the three have attorneys, Washoe County Sheriff's Lt.  
Janice Lee said in Reno. Requests to interview Merlino were denied 
by the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock is a rifleman based at Camp Pendleton near San Diego,  
while Brendle is a computer technician based in Twentynine Palms 
east of Los Angeles. Both were taken into custody at jails near 
their bases. Brock told officials he would fight extradition to 
Nevada, while Brendle indicated otherwise, Ms. Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not say where Merlino lived now. But people who  
lived in the same apartment building as Merlino in 1997 said he 
routinely blasted birds with a shotgun in a grassy area outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were always dead birds outside on the ground,'' said  
Walter Alarcon, who described Merlino and his former roommates as 
``cowboy-style punks'' who liked to start fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He cleaned a deer on the living room carpet,'' said Sarenana.  
``He'd leave dead ducks around the house all the time. I mean, for 
days at a time he would leave animals on their kitchen counter.''

<HEADLINE>  Only Michael Could Stop Michael </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For a true perspective on Michael Jordan's greatness, perhaps it  
is best to begin with those he loved to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a long list, filled with Hall of Famers, brilliant coaches  
and helpless defenders who learned the hard way that Jordan was 
simply the best. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars, Larry Bird and Pat Riley. Craig Ehlo, Gerald Wilkins  
and Bryon Russell. Lenny Wilkens tried in vain to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, only Jordan could do that.  
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan expected to retire today after 13 seasons as the  
greatest player in the game, opponents, coaches and teammates took 
time to remember what he meant to the sport -- and wonder whether 
they would ever see the likes of him again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest basketball player who ever lived is now retiring,  
and there's no replacement for Michael Jordan,'' said Dumars, whose 
``Bad Boy'' Detroit Pistons unwittingly encouraged Jordan to the 
greatness that defines him. ``I don't see anyone replacing him. No 
one should try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His influence reached far beyond basketball, a graceful game  
that he changed, mastered and transcended. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA, the fans, the players, the coaches, American society  
and history are losing the greatest influence that sports has ever 
had,'' said Riley, the Miami Heat coach whose teams had some epic 
battles with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird, the Indiana Pacers coach and an old Jordan nemesis on the  
Boston Celtics, said it was ``sad for everyone to see the greatest 
basketball player in the world'' retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision, and he feels it's his time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Chicago Bulls teammates remember the incredible  
competitiveness that drove him to six NBA championships and 10 
scoring titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents recall standing, slipping or sliding in dumbfounded  
amazement while His Airness worked his magic. Ehlo, Wilkins and 
Russell, victims of three of Jordan's most famous shots, will never 
live them down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jordan says, `You're going to play me one-on-one, then this is  
what you're going to get,''' said Ehlo, who was guarding Jordan 
when he made ``The Shot'' that knocked Cleveland out of the 
playoffs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``He scared you, he was so intense,'' said Brad Sellers, who  
passed to Jordan for that shot over Ehlo. ``... He took offense at 
the thought that one guy could hold him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years to come, CEOs will be counting the money he made for  
them. Youngsters will be lacing up sneakers that bear his likeness. 
Though his playing days are apparently over, his business empire 
will live on -- and perhaps grow to the epic proportions of his 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who truly, as far as I'm concerned, is the  
modern-day Babe Ruth,'' said Jerry West, the Lakers vice president 
and former NBA great. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's impact reached from pro basketball to the college ranks  
to every basketball court in America. His retirement prompts an 
array of emotions that rivals his arsenal of shots -- and agreement 
between some unlikely figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, who coached Jordan in the 1984 Olympics, called him,  
``the best player involved in a team sport of any kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson, leader of the new generation of NBA stars, said,  
``His game speaks for itself. With all his off-the-court marketing 
and everything he did, it makes me want to do something like that 
in my life. He set a standard for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one should ever forget this about Jordan: He held grudges. He  
never forgot. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaten in the playoffs by Dumars' Pistons in the late 1980s,  
Jordan learned that he had to pass more and develop an outside 
shot. He did. 
</P>
<P>
	Incensed that Wilkens, then coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers,  
refused to double-team him, he vowed to make him pay. Of course, he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael has been great for the game,'' Wilkens said. ``The  
game is going to miss him. But another young star will come along. 
They won't do it like Michael. No one can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among his amazing accomplishments, Jordan redefined how athletes  
are portrayed -- on television, on billboards, as celebrity maitre 
d's in restaurants. He is the original author of the highlight 
reel, the father of today's athlete who plays movie roles and rap 
songs when the games are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Even one of Jordan's greatest admirers believes the environment  
he's created may hurt his place in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports have moved into the corporate level,'' Temple coach  
John Chaney said. ``The people in the stands are reading 
newspapers, and they look up every once in a while and see a dunk. 
We've lost kids in sports. In another two or three years, you'll 
find kids wondering, `Who is Michael Jordan?' 
</P>
<P>
	``You ask any kid when was the last time he was in the house  
with Michael Jordan, actually there in the house to see him play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one understood sports as a business better than Jordan. But  
he had the presence not to let anything distract him from the pure 
competition that truly drove him. 
</P>
<P>
	Attracting rock star treatment everywhere he went, the  
basketball court was one of the few places where Jordan could be 
himself -- except for a few months in 1994, when he played minor 
league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time in his life, it seemed like baseball gave him  
more satisfaction than hitting a shot at the buzzer,'' said 
Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francona, who managed Jordan 
during his one minor league baseball season in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't dominant in baseball. But when he hit an 0-2  
curveball for a game-winning hit, it was the same look on his face 
as when he won a game on a buzzer-beater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one will ever forget that face.

<HEADLINE> Infant's Death in Car Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAUFORT, S.C. (AP) -- A 2-month-old baby missing for more than a  
week was found dead in a car pulled from a creek, and searchers 
today found the body of one of the two Marines believed to have 
been with the infant. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby, Quinniah Jones, was still strapped into her car seat  
in the back of the car, which had been spotted from the air 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby's death appeared accidental, but authorities were  
investigating, Coroner Curt Copeland said. An autopsy was 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinniah, her father, Lance Cpl. Marlon T. Jones, and Lance Cpl.  
Patrick Monroe were reported missing Jan. 3 by family members. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe's body was found in the water today about 150 yards from  
the spot where the car was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby's father was still missing.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 21, and Monroe, 23 -- both assigned to the Marine Corps  
Air Station at Beaufort -- were last seen on St. Helena Island. They 
had picked up the baby from a house where Jones' mother-in-law was 
baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's mother, LaRoesa Jones, was at the creek on St. Helena  
Island when the car was pulled from the water.

<HEADLINE> Labor Dept. Releases Data Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in less than three months,  
the Labor Department let market-sensitive economic data 
accidentally slip onto its Internet site ahead of the release time. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics posted December's  
Producer Price Index, which measures prices charged for goods by 
factories and other producers, at about 1 p.m. EST Tuesday, said 
William Parks, special assistant to the bureau's commissioner, 
Katharine G. Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not supposed to be publicly released until 8:30 a.m.  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was posted on a little-used archival page on the  
bureau's site, Parks said. After about an hour, a bureau employee 
discovered it and it was removed, he said. After the stock market 
closed, the bureau notified news agencies and reposted it at about 
5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Department reports, ranging from the monthly unemployment  
rate to inflation figures, can set off frenzied trading on Wall 
Street, depending on whether they contradict traders' views on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	This report, showing a 0.4 percent increase in prices, the  
largest in 15 months, was mildly surprising to analysts, who 
expected around a 0.3 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks said the bureau did not yet know how many Internet users  
viewed the report during trading hours, but guessed the number was 
``approximately 10, maybe a few more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know who it was ... but we don't believe there was  
any market impact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the bureau's second slip concerning the Internet. On  
Nov. 5, the bureau posted job-growth figures for October that were 
not supposed to be released until the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial analyst Ray Stone of Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research in  
Princeton, N.J., noticed that gaff an e-mailed his clients after 
alerting the bureau that it had broken its own embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Abraham blamed that release on ``a serious  
failure of management control.'' A bureau employee had loaded the 
data on an internal server and did not realize that would result in 
the data's release on the bureau's public Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks said the latest release was the result of ``an internal  
computer system error.'' The earlier release involved human error, 
he said, and the new procedures implemented after it are working 
well.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Proposes Plan for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed $2 billion in tax  
credits, health benefits and other services Wednesday to make it 
easier for disabled Americans to hold jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House ceremony, Clinton endorsed legislation being  
introduced next week by Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass., that would expand federal health coverage for 
disabled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should never have to choose between the dignity of  
work and the health care they need,'' Clinton said. ``With this 
initiative, they'll have a ticket to work, not an impossible 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on  
Education and the Workforce, praised Clinton's move. But he said 
the president should go further and endorse a GOP plan to allow 
small businesses and self-employed people to band together in 
buying group health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important patient protection is access to affordable  
health care,'' Goodling said. ``President Clinton should embrace 
Republican commonsense reforms ... to help make health coverage 
affordable for all Americans, regardless of where they live and 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the House passed, 410-1, a proposal similar to the  
one Clinton announced Wednesday. Called the Ticket to Work and 
Self-Sufficiency Act, introduced by then-Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., 
that bill would have established a voucher-like ticket that 
disabled people could use for health coverage, transportation help, 
rehabilitation and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the disabled said Clinton's proposal would help  
encourage more disabled people to seek work because they no longer 
have to fear losing their Medicaid coverage when they get jobs that 
pay more than current income limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospect of losing Medicaid after earning a mere $550 a  
month frightens people from even trying to enter the labor market. 
People with disabilities will finally be free to pursue the jobs 
they are capable of doing, without risking their health and 
security in the process,'' said Hank Cheney, president of WORK 
Inc., a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that provides 
employment and residential services to disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he plans to provide in his budget proposal  
sufficient money to finance an initiative called the Work 
Incentives Improvement Act, which would extend Medicaid coverage to 
disabled people who return to the work force. It also establishes a 
$1,000 tax credit to help defray costs of employing disabled 
workers, such as transportation or making work sites more 
accessible for those in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The health insurance plan is expected to cost $1.2 billion, the  
tax credit $700 million over five years.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Looks Forward to Carpooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Picture Michael Jordan as the ultimate doting dad  
or a Little League parent now that his playing days are apparently 
over. For a while, at least. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaching doesn't appeal to him right now. His business empire  
will still need tending and don't expect his string of 
endorsements, estimated to bring him around $45 million a year, to 
dry up now that he's not playing. There are plenty of golf courses 
to play, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, Jordan said he yearns to be a normal person.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard him talking about his family and kids. I popped the  
question to him: `Do you want to spend some time at home and feel 
like what's it like to be in a carpool?' And he said, `Yeah,''' 
former North Carolina roommate Buzz Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life takes on a different stage now and it's a different  
challenge and I welcome that and I knew it was coming,'' Jordan 
said as he announced his retirement Wednesday from the game he 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and his wife have three children, including two boys who,  
like Mike, play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy taking my kids to school, which I did that this  
morning. I normally enjoy picking my kids up from school, which I 
look forward to doing,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And watching my kids play. My wife and I have a fun time  
watching our kids play one-on-one, which is very entertaining. So 
those are things that seem so simple in a lot of people's lives and 
never really been enjoyed by me because of my schedule and because 
of the things that I've done over the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure there's a lot of business opportunities there and that  
won't consume me, but that certainly will take away some of the 
competitive juices that will be left over from not playing 
basketball. For the most part I'm just going to enjoy life and do 
some of the things that I've never done before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Juanita, doesn't see things changing drastically,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life won't change at all,'' she said. ``I can see Michael  
doing more carpooling. That's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agent David Falk said Jordan's immediate business interest is an  
athletic apparel company ``Brand Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a lot of corporate affiliations. He has to decide what  
the next challenges are, what the next mental challenges are and 
how much of his time he wants to devote to corporate activities and 
how much he wants to devote to private activities,'' Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect to hear the words ``Coach Jordan.'' He has no  
plans, like Larry Bird, to return to the game and draw up plays on 
the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never say never,'' Jordan said. ``But I want to get  
away from basketball a little bit and look at it from afar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the only coaching I can do it at home and I'm  
having a tough time doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are those who are think Jordan's competitiveness will  
eventually lead back to the game, maybe even as a player again. 
After all, he's unretired before. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-teammate Craig Hodges knows Jordan will keep playing  
somewhere, even if it's in the driveway or his own gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he'll play basketball. It's not like he'll never pick  
up a basketball again,'' Hodges said. ``It's just there won't be 
20,000 people watching him when he goes to work out.''

<HEADLINE> Missing Secretary Case Winding Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Prosecutors cannot say precisely how a  
woman died at the home of her wealthy lover, but his claim that 
another mistress accidentally shot her in a jealous rage ``defies 
common sense,'' a prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors do not have a body, eyewitness or a murder weapon --  
or anything else that would allow them to explain how Anne Marie 
Fahey, the governor's scheduling secretary, died on June 27, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	No one disputes that she died at the home of Thomas Capano and  
that he stuffed her body into a cooler and dumped it at sea, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Colm Connolly said in closing arguments in 
Capano's murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did we have to wait almost two and a half years to learn  
the defendant did not dispute those facts?'' Connolly said. 
Because, he said, Capano tailored his story to dispute as little of 
the evidence as possible ``and what we're left with is the 
ludicrous account he gives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the key witnesses have admitted they deceived police at  
some point, and Capano's uncorroborated version of events is the 
only one the jury has heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Capano, a member of a prominent Delaware family,  
killed Ms. Fahey because she wanted to end their secret affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano has said Deborah MacIntyre came to his house on June 27,  
1996, and shot Ms. Fahey and that he disposed of the body to 
protect Ms. MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, that story is ludicrous. It defies  
common sense,'' Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre has denied being at Capano's home the night Ms.  
Fahey died and testified against him, saying she bought Capano a 
gun at his request a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	If Capano is convicted of first-degree murder, he could be  
sentenced to death. If acquitted, Capano still could be charged 
with obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has already accused Capano of soliciting the murders  
of two witnesses and Ms. Fahey's family has filed a wrongful death 
suit against Capano and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month trial in this small, close-knit state has  
scraped away the public persona of Capano, a former prosecutor and 
trusted political adviser, to reveal details of deceit and adultery 
that have sullied more reputations than his. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Capano's brothers, members of a family that made a  
fortune building homes throughout the region, helped dispose of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony of Capano's sexual romps -- he is a 49-year-old  
father of four who has advised a former mayor and former governor -- 
embarrassed the state's chief deputy attorney, who admitted on the 
stand to having a tryst with Ms. MacIntyre that Capano arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, it's a story about a young woman who fell in  
love with a powerful man who showered her with gifts but who later 
proved, according to her diary, to be a ``controlling, 
manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fahey, 30, was last seen having dinner with Capano in a  
Philadelphia restaurant. When police first questioned Capano, he 
said he had taken her home afterward and never saw her again. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, Capano admitted for the first time that Ms. Fahey was  
dead and that he got rid of her body. He had lied all of this time, 
he later testified, to protect Ms. MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically made the wrong decision, a cowardly decision, to  
get rid of the body,'' Capano testified. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no witnesses or concrete evidence that can show  
precisely how Ms. Fahey died, and none to corroborate Capano's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have other evidence they believe shows Capano had  
murder on his mind -- telling his brother someone was extorting him, 
asking Ms. MacIntyre to buy him a gun, buying the cooler months 
before Ms. Fahey's death. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kathleen Fahey-Hosey, the case of her sister's death is  
simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anne Marie was shot. Anne Marie was stuffed in a cooler,'' she  
said. ``We have been surrounded by some very evil people.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Polls Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from polls released this week on President Clinton,  
Congress and the Senate impeachment trial. 

</P>
<P>
	Do you think the U.S. Senate should hold a full trial, complete  
with witnesses and testimony, to decide whether or not to remove 
President Clinton from office, or don't you think a full trial is 
necessary? 
</P>
<P>
	Hold full trial -- 36 percent; not necessary -- 60 percent (CBS  
News). 

</P>
<P>
	Do you think President Clinton's actions are serious enough to  
warrant his being convicted by the Senate and removed from office, 
or not? 
</P>
<P>
	Serious enough -- 37 percent; not serious enough -- 61 percent  
(CBS News). This number has held steady in the CBS poll since 
Clinton was impeached. 

</P>
<P>
	Which of the following statements better describes your feelings  
about having an impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate? 
</P>
<P>
	A. A Senate trial will hurt the nation, because things will not  
get done and will become too partisan and polarized. 
</P>
<P>
	B. A Senate trial will not hurt the nation, because things will  
continue to get done and we will be able to work through our 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Will hurt nation -- 45 percent; will not hurt nation -- 51 percent  
(NBC News/Wall Street Journal). In mid-December, 56 percent thought 
a trial would hurt the nation and 39 percent thought it would not. 

</P>
<P>
	Do you think the Senate will or will not conduct a fair  
impeachment trial? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, fair trial -- 50 percent; not a fair trial -- 32 percent (NBC  
News). 

</P>
<P>
	Do you approve or disapprove of the way Bill Clinton is handling  
his job as president? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve -- 65 percent; disapprove 30 percent (CBS News). Approve  
-- 62 percent; disapprove -- 36 percent (ABC News). Approve -- 67 
percent, disapprove -- 30 percent (CNN/USA Today/Gallup). Clinton's 
approval ran as high as 73 percent in some polls last month. 

</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 1,014 adults taken Friday  
through Sunday and the CBS News poll of 1,182 adults taken Sunday 
and Monday had margins of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. The ABC News poll of 923 adults taken Friday through Sunday 
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points and 
the NBC poll of 502 adults taken Monday and Tuesday had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. If numbers don't 
equal 100 percent, the remainder offered no opinion.

<HEADLINE> Burley Tobacco Season Turns Out OK / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOONE, N.C. (AP) -- Heavy spring rains last year didn't ruin  
North Carolina's burley crop after all, experts and farmers report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last spring I wouldn't have bet you a plugged nickel that we'd  
make a half-crop. But our yields have turned out OK,'' said Frank 
Bolick, tobacco specialist for the Watauga and Avery county offices 
of the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the crop was a good one, ``even though some of our  
tobacco hasn't ended up weighing quite as much once we've cured as 
it looked like it would while it was in the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashe County extension agent Jim Carey said the crop was better  
than during the past two seasons, and this year's price has 
averaged $1.92 a pound, 2 cents to 3 cents above last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolick said heavy spring rains forced many burley-tobacco  
growers to delay planting up to a month. He didn't think the crop 
would recover. But then the weather turned hot and dry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a little better than average, but a lot better than  
I thought it would be,'' Bolick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey said farmers also got a break from blue mold.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our farmers did a good job controlling it,'' he said. ``Plus,  
the dry, sunny weather we had most of the season helped keep the 
disease from spreading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The burley-tobacco sales season has at least another week to go,  
but it is winding down, said tobacco warehouse officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey said the heat last summer and fall in the burley tobacco  
region didn't hurt the plants in the field, but caused problems 
once they were hung in the barn to cure. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers reported the tobacco cured too quickly, resulting  
in yellow-tinted leaves rather than the customary golden brown 
preferred by tobacco companies. Carey, however, said the color did 
not affect farmers' ability to sell their crops, because yellow 
leaves were a problem elsewhere in the eight-state burley belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of our elevation, I think we've had a little more  
humidity and it's been a little cooler here, which has helped the 
leaf cure closer to the way it's supposed to,'' Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SAYRE, Okla. (AP) -- Grassy fields are stunted, stock tanks are  
low and honeysuckle vines have died as repercussions of the 1998 
drought continue to be felt. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall levels since April remain almost 11 inches below normal  
in southwest Oklahoma, according to the state Water Resources 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing that we see is the pastures are extremely  
short,'' said John Biscoe, extension educator for agriculture in 
Beckham County. ``I was in a pasture yesterday that just looked 
like a carpet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Oklahoma has received only 55 percent of its average  
rainfall over the past nine months, according to the Water 
Resources Board. In south central Oklahoma, precipitation is 
running 10.41 inches behind -- or just 67 percent of normal since 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get some rain, I think it's going to limit the  
amount of large plantings,'' said Ray Miller, landscaper at 
Kingston Greenhouses in Kingston. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said shrubbery, lawns and older trees in south central  
Oklahoma fell victim to the summer's excessive heat and persistent 
lack of rain. He urged homeowners to water their trees and shrubs 
through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in Lake Texoma's water level has not deterred tourists  
or thwarted fishing, said Lloyd Swaim, owner of Newberry Creek 
Resort and Marina near Durant. Swaim said most boat ramps and docks 
remain open at the lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in a usable state, and with it low like this, we have no  
beach erosion,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Redskins Coach Herman Ball Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Herman Ball, head coach of the Washington  
Redskins from 1949 through part of the 1951 season, died Tuesday 
from heart ailment complications at a hospital in Paoli, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, who lived in King of Prussia, Pa., was 88.  
</P>
<P>
	Ball spent eight years on the Redskins' staff, winning promotion  
from line coach to head coach midway through the 1949 season. The 
Redskins finished that year with a 4-7-1 record and won three out 
of 12 games the following year. Ball was replaced as head coach 
after a winless streak in the 1951 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He later was a Redskins scout. In 1955, he joined the Pittsburgh  
Steelers as an assistant coach. He also was on the coaching staffs 
of the Baltimore Colts and the Philadelphia Eagles before retiring 
in 1968.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Up Sharply on Brazil Worries / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. Treasury bond prices surged Wednesday after  
Brazil's surprise currency devaluation sent stock markets stumbling 
worldwide, causing traders to scurry for a haven for their money. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/4 points,  
or $12.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.13 from 5.21 percent late Tuesday and 
5.31 percent Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The devaluation and the resignation of the head of Brazil's  
central bank revived fears of yet another flareup of a world 
financial crisis that many had hoped was finally abating. Stocks 
tumbled in European exchanges and plunged in the United States 
early in the day before recovering much of their losses by the 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. government bonds, traditionally a safe place to park money  
in times of uncertainty, gained on the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up 3/16 to 1/4 point and intermediate maturities were up 15/32 
point to 25/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 5.59 
points to 1,317.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.43 percent as the  
discount fell 0.03 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.33 percent. 
Six-month yields fell to 4.45 percent, as the discount fell 0.04 
percentage point from Tuesday to 4.30 percent. One-year yields were 
4.46 percent as the discount fell by 0.06 percentage point from 
late Tuesday to 4.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.50 percent from 4.56 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 3/8 from 124 1/16 on Tuesday. The 
average yield to maturity fell to 5.18 percent from 5.20 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Michael Jordan Set To Call It Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan's first retirement didn't last.  
His second, more than five years later, just might. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally different circumstances. He's a different age,  
he's won six titles instead of three,'' said guard Steve Kerr, 
Jordan's Chicago Bulls teammate and now a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last time, as Jordan grieved for his murdered father, he said  
he'd had enough of the NBA grind, needed more time with his family 
and new challenges. But on that stunning October day in 1993, a 
30-year-old Jordan didn't rule out a return to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	After a short-lived baseball career, he came back. Did he ever,  
adding three more NBA titles and re-establishing himself as the 
game's greatest player. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's ready to retire again. And as he turns 36 next month,  
this time, it will probably be for good. The Bulls called a news 
conference at the United Center, the building where Jordan held a 
glitzy retirement party in November 1994, the building where he so 
often led the team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's the place where, according to a league source, Jordan  
planned to announce his retirement after 13 seasons with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could have things our way, I'm sure that Michael  
probably could play another couple of years and would embrace the 
opportunity,'' teammate Scottie Pippen told WLS-TV this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with a lot of the things going on in the organization, and  
unhappiness and things of that nature, he felt that right now, he's 
on top, this is the best time for him to get out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get into my soliloquy about Michael Jordan  
until I hear it's official,'' Kerr said Tuesday after working on 
his jump shot at the Berto Center in suburban Deerfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be the fool who talks about it before it all  
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the league and throughout the city that worships him,  
Jordan's impending retirement didn't come as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	But most acknowledged that neither the Bulls nor the NBA would  
be the same without him, especially during this lockout-shortened 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losers! Losers! Losers!'' 32-year-old Derrick Watt said as he  
left Jordan's downtown restaurant on another cold winter's day. 
``Without Michael, they'll be in the basement of their division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan met with a few teammates at his home Monday and told them  
the thought of playing an abbreviated, 50-game season wasn't enough 
of a challenge, the Chicago Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr and free-agent center Luc Longley said Tuesday they hadn't  
heard from Jordan or the team about the retirement, and that's why 
they wanted to get their information directly from the source. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us after the season that he didn't want to come back.  
But at that point, I don't know if any of us wanted to come back,'' 
Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were kind of tired. But after a summer of rest -- a summer  
and a fall and a winter of rest -- it's easy to be rejuvenated, so 
everybody knew he had that option to come back. '' 
</P>
<P>
	But now Jordan can go out as he always wanted -- on top. His  
last-second shot -- the last one he might ever take -- beat Utah in 
Game 6 last June and gave the Bulls their sixth title. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a way to go out as an athlete, and that's the way to  
go out,'' said B.J. Armstrong, one of about a dozen players working 
out Tuesday at the Berto Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who now plays with Charlotte, is a good friend of  
Jordan's and a teammate on Chicago's first three NBA championship 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out on top, he made the last shot, he made all the  
right plays. He's had a fabulous career and everything you could 
ever ask as an athlete, he's done. He had a chance to leave and 
this was the chance,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing it his way. There's a part of me that is sad, but a  
part of me that is happy to see him go out on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would also be going out as a five-time league MVP, 10-time  
league scoring champion and the No. 1 per-game scorer in NBA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause, who openly feuded with Jordan, had  
no comment as he pulled his car into the snowy parking lot at the 
practice center. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd wasn't saying much, either. He rolled  
his car window down and said: ``I don't think it would be 
appropriate for me to say anything at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In case everyone has forgotten, for a long time Jordan loudly  
proclaimed he had no intention of playing for any coach but Phil 
Jackson, who left the team after June's championship and has 
declined several invitations to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's Dream Team teammate and TV commercial sidekick Larry  
Bird, who retired and then returned as coach of the Indiana Pacers, 
jokingly suggested the NBA hadn't seen the last of His Airness: 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time in every player's career that they have to  
make that decision, and he feels it's his time. We want to wish he 
and his family well and we look forward to seeing him sometime in 
late March when he makes his return again in Market Square Arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Jordan made his comeback nearly four years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Bach, an assistant coach on three of the Bulls'  
championship teams, praised Jordan for not only his skill, but for 
the joy he brought to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never looked like he'd been sentenced by a judge to play  
basketball,'' Bach said. ``I've seen too many athletes not go out 
at the right time. They stay and struggle and lose some of the 
dignity they are entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appalachian State coach Buzz Peterson called his former North  
Carolina roommate and put the question to him directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going on? I've got 25 pink slip phone messages here in  
front of me,'' Peterson said. ``He just laughed and said 
everything's coming out now and everything's being said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said the Bulls' coaching change didn't have anything to  
do with Jordan's decision, but family considerations did. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just run out of things to prove and he loves those kids.  
Whenever I talk to him, he just can't stop talking about Marcus and 
Jeffrey and Jasmine,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marcus and Jeffrey are playing basketball now and he could  
tell you how many points they scored and how many assists they had 
and what the final score was of every one of their games.''

<HEADLINE>  Michael Jordan Set To Call It Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan's first retirement didn't last.  
His second, more than five years later, just might. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally different circumstances. He's a different age,  
he's won six titles instead of three,'' said guard Steve Kerr, 
Jordan's Chicago Bulls teammate and now a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last time, as Jordan grieved for his murdered father, he said  
he'd had enough of the NBA grind, needed more time with his family 
and new challenges. But on that stunning October day in 1993, a 
30-year-old Jordan didn't rule out a return to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	After a short-lived baseball career, he came back. Did he ever,  
adding three more NBA titles and re-establishing himself as the 
game's greatest player. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's ready to retire again. And as he turns 36 next month,  
this time, it will probably be for good. The Bulls called a news 
conference at the United Center, the building where Jordan held a 
glitzy retirement party in November 1994, the building where he so 
often led the team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's the place where, according to a league source, Jordan  
planned to announce his retirement after 13 seasons with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could have things our way, I'm sure that Michael  
probably could play another couple of years and would embrace the 
opportunity,'' teammate Scottie Pippen told WLS-TV this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with a lot of the things going on in the organization, and  
unhappiness and things of that nature, he felt that right now, he's 
on top, this is the best time for him to get out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get into my soliloquy about Michael Jordan  
until I hear it's official,'' Kerr said Tuesday after working on 
his jump shot at the Berto Center in suburban Deerfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be the fool who talks about it before it all  
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the league and throughout the city that worships him,  
Jordan's impending retirement didn't come as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	But most acknowledged that neither the Bulls nor the NBA would  
be the same without him, especially during this lockout-shortened 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losers! Losers! Losers!'' 32-year-old Derrick Watt said as he  
left Jordan's downtown restaurant on another cold winter's day. 
``Without Michael, they'll be in the basement of their division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan met with a few teammates at his home Monday and told them  
the thought of playing an abbreviated, 50-game season wasn't enough 
of a challenge, the Chicago Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr and free-agent center Luc Longley said Tuesday they hadn't

<HEADLINE> '96 Olympic Bid Group Found Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- A senior member of the Toronto 1996 Olympic bid  
group says it was scammed by corporate members of the International 
Olympic Committee, the Toronto Sun reports today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified member of the bid team (TOOC) told the  
newspaper of an elaborate series of travel scams perpetrated by 
some members of the IOC during the bidding process for the 1996 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the scams:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Toronto group would send an IOC member two first-class,  
round-trip plane tickets, as the IOC rules stated at the time. The 
member would cash in the tickets, keep the money and not travel to 
Toronto -- or cash in the first-class tickets and travel economy, 
pocketing the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An IOC member would demand cash or tickets for more than one  
guest. Even though the Toronto group realized it was a breach of 
IOC rules to provide more than two tickets, it agreed to the 
request rather than jeopardize the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An IOC member would receive two tickets from TOOC, arrive in  
the city with a ticket paid for by another source (either the IOC 
or another bid city), cash in the ticket and keep the money. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In 1990, Toronto and Atlanta were bidding for the 1996 Summer  
Games and Salt Lake City, Utah, was bidding for the 2002 Winter 
Games. The bid official told the Sun that certain IOC members would 
take advantage of that situation by requesting first-class, 
round-trip tickets from each bid city in North America. The 
individuals would then use one set of tickets, cash in the other 
two and take cheaper connecting flights between the three North 
American cities. 
</P>
<P>
	These scams were documented by the Toronto bid team and  
presented to the IOC in January of 1991, just a few months before 
Atlanta was selected to host the '96 Games.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Legal Brief -3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Article I alleges that in his Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury  
testimony, President Clinton provided `perjurious, false and 
misleading' testimony to the grand jury concerning `one or more' of 
four subject areas. Article I does not, however, set forth a single 
specific statement by the president upon which its various 
allegations are predicated. The article haphazardly intermingles 
alleged criminal conduct with totally lawful conduct, and its 
abstract generalizations provide no guidance as to actual alleged 
perjurious statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Article I thus violates the most fundamental requirement of  
perjury indictments. It is fatally vague in three distinct 
respects: (1) it does not identify any statements that form the 
basis of its allegations; (2) it therefore does not specify which 
of the president's statements to the grand jury were allegedly 
`perjurious,' which were allegedly `false' and which were allegedly 
`misleading'; and (3) it does not even specify the subject matter 
of any alleged perjurious statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Article II is also unconstitutionally vague. It alleges that  
the president `obstructed and impeded the administration of justice 
... in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, 
cover up and conceal' unspecified evidence and testimony in the 
Jones case. It sets forth seven instances in which the president 
allegedly `encouraged' false testimony or the concealment of 
evidence, or `corruptly influenced' or `corruptly prevented' 
various other testimony, also unspecified. In fact, not only does 
Article II fail to identify a single specific act performed by the 
president in this alleged scheme to obstruct justice, it does not 
even identify the `potential witnesses' whose testimony the 
president allegedly sought to `corruptly influence.''' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``An American impeachment trial is not a parliamentary inquiry  
into fitness for office. It is not a vote of no confidence. It is 
not a mechanism whereby a legislative majority may oust a president 
from a rival party on political grounds. To the contrary, because 
the president has a limited term of office and can be turned out in 
the course of ordinary electoral processes, a presidential 
impeachment trial is a constitutional measure of last resort 
designed to protect the Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Senate is therefore vested with an extremely grave  
constitutional task: a decision whether to remove the president for 
the protection of the people themselves. In the Senate's hands 
there rests not only the fate of one man, but the integrity of our 
Constitution and our democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fidelity to the Constitution and fidelity to the electorate  
must converge in the impeachment trial vote. If the Senate is to 
give meaning to the Constitution's command, any vote on removal 
must be a vote on one or more specifically and separately 
identified `high crimes and misdemeanors,' as set forth in properly 
drafted impeachment articles approved by the House. If the people 
are to have their twice-elected president removed by an act of the 
Senate, that act must be intelligible. It must be explainable and 
justifiable to the people who first chose the president and then 
chose him again. The Senate must ensure that it has satisfied the 
Constitution's requirement of a genuine two-thirds concurrence that 
specific, identified wrongdoing has been proven. The Senate must 
also assure the people, through the sole collective act the Senate 
is required to take, that its decision has a readily discernible 
and unequivocal meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Should the Senate decide to authorize the House managers to  
call witnesses or expand the record, the president would be faced 
with a critical need for the discovery of evidence useful to his 
defense -- evidence which would routinely be available to any civil 
litigant involved in a garden-variety automobile accident case. The 
House managers have had in their possession or had access at the 
OIC to significant amounts of nonpublic evidence, and they have 
frequently stated their intention to make use of such evidence. 
Obviously, in order to defend against such tactics, counsel for the 
president are entitled to discovery and a fair opportunity to test 
the veracity and reliability of this `evidence,' using compulsory 
process as necessary to obtain testimony and documents. Trial by 
surprise obviously has no place in the Senate of the United States, 
where the issue in the balance is the removal of the one political 
leader who, with the vice president, is elected by all the citizens 
of this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The consequences of an impeachment trial are immeasurably  
grave: the removal of a twice-elected president. Particularly given 
what is at stake, fundamental fairness dictates that the president 
be given at least the same right as an ordinary litigant to obtain 
evidence necessary for his defense, particularly when a great deal 
of that evidence is presently in the hands of his accusers, the OIC 
and the House managers. The Senate has wisely elected to proceed on 
the public record established by the House of Representatives, and 
this provides a wholly adequate basis for Senate decision-making. 
In the event the Senate should choose to expand this record, 
affording the president adequate discovery is absolutely 
essential.''

<HEADLINE> Co. Ties Free Long-Distance to Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Low-cost long-distance offers are plentiful,  
but a Maryland company is offering long-distance for free -- if the 
caller agrees to listen to advertising first. 
</P>
<P>
	After testing the plan in Pittsburgh last year, BroadPoint  
Communications of Landover, Md. began offering it nationwide on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say, however, that many people won't want to invest the  
time listening to the advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people out there who want the  
(long-distance) service, will pay for it and don't want to think 
about it,'' said Bruck Kasrel, an analyst at Cambridge, Mass.-based 
Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	People who sign up for the service will get up to two minutes of  
free long-distance calling in the United States for each 
advertisement of 10-15 seconds that they listen to. 
</P>
<P>
	Users must listen to the advertising before they are able to  
obtain the free call and several ads if they plan to make a longer 
call. A beep will alert callers that time is up a few seconds 
before. Each call requires listening to another series of ads. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of weeks of advertising, the service began in  
Pittsburgh last April with about 800 people using the service, said 
company president and CEO Perry Kamel. The number of users quickly 
grew to 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamel says BroadPoint expects to have 1 million members by the  
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamel said the service is free, but that BroadPoint may have to  
look at the possibility of charging if demand moves beyond 
expectations and the company needs to expand rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer could be a tough sell. Baltimore pizza deliveryman  
Mike Vogel says he's happy with his phone service and the added 
convenience of a calling card that allows him to call from any 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wouldn't consider the plan ``even if they say they'll  
give you a couple of months free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also question whether people will be willing to  
sacrifice their time for free long-distance, especially since rates 
have come down. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers spend on average 11 1/2 cents a minute on long distance,  
said Fred Voit, an analyst with Yankee Group, a market research and 
consulting company. He wondered whether people would listen to an 
advertisement to save 22 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is free, but it's going to cost you time,'' he said.  
``Certainly there are people out there who are going to find this a 
wonderful service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volt said it also remains to be seen whether the people using  
the service are spending money and benefiting companies paying for 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	BroadPoint, which started Freeway in partnership with Duquesne  
Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of DQE, Inc., says its 
demographic profile represents a cross-section of the population 
``with an emphasis on advertisers' most desirable, upscale 
customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People can only sign up for the service through the company's  
Web site, located at www.BroadPoint.com. They are asked to fill out 
a detailed questionnaire requesting information about demographics, 
work, education, hobbies and shopping and travel tendencies. 
Advertisers can then select target audiences for their messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do is allow advertisers to determine what group they  
want to target,'' Kamel said. ``It really extends their ability to 
deliver the right message to the right people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers pay only for messages delivered. Freeway ensures  
that people who use the service hear the messages because they have 
to enter a response after hearing each one, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that have signed on to advertise through Freeway  
include TGI Friday's, Acura and Blockbuster Entertainment. But in 
addition to large companies, local businesses can advertise as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers can offer trial offers that consumers can order with  
a touch of a phone button, or companies can solicit information 
such as whether the caller planned to buy a car within the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense, we're extending the whole concept of interactive,  
media and electronic commerce well beyond the Internet,'' Kamel 
said.

<HEADLINE> Study Targets Welfare in Wisconsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Most people who left Wisconsin's welfare rolls  
during the transition to a work-based system found jobs but said 
they are just scraping by, a study released Wednesday found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, the state's first attempt to document how former  
welfare recipients have fared, found that 83 percent had worked at 
least part of the time since leaving the rolls in the first three 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-eight percent of former recipients said getting a job was  
easier than living on welfare, though the same percentage said they 
were just barely making it financially. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin was one of the first states to implement its  
work-focused program after Congress overhauled welfare regulations 
in 1996. President Clinton called Wisconsin's program one of the 
``boldest, most revolutionary'' welfare plans in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on interviews with 375 people who left the  
rolls of Wisconsin Works, the state's new welfare-to-work program, 
or the program it replaced, Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
	About 62 percent said they were employed when they were  
interviewed. Of those who did not have jobs, one-third said they 
could not find one or did not have the necessary skills or 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	That raised concerns among advocates for the poor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is a work-based program and you've got 38 percent of people  
who don't have a job,'' said Anne Arneson, director of the 
Wisconsin Council for Children and Families. ``That's quite a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who found work after leaving welfare earned an average of  
$7.42 an hour, the study said. And 87 percent said they had health 
insurance, either through Medicaid or through their employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Works requires recipients to work or receive job  
training to receive benefits. In return, the state pays for child 
care, transportation and other job-related costs. There were 13,818 
families in the program in November, less than half the number who 
were on welfare when the program began in September 1997.

<HEADLINE> Arizona, Texas Execute Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A man convicted of kidnapping, raping and  
killing a woman in 1981 by shoving her off a cliff and then bashing 
her head with rocks was executed by injection Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jess James Gillies, 38, offered no last words.  
</P>
<P>
	No members of Gillies' family or the victim's family attended  
the execution, though Corrections officials said relatives visited 
with Gillies before the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Wednesday, Texas executed a former truck driver who killed  
a police officer during a drug deal 15 years ago. Troy Farris, 36, 
denied shooting Tarrant County sheriff deputy Clark Rosenbalm Jr., 
who was killed in 1983 after he happened upon a drug deal along a 
stretch of road northwest of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief final statement, Farris turned to four members of his  
victim's family, and said: ``I'm done. Take me, Jesus. Take me, 
Jesus. I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillies and friend Mike Logan were convicted of abducting,  
raping and murdering Suzanne Rossetti, 26. She had bought them a 
six-pack of beer and given them a ride as a reward for opening her 
car after she locked the keys inside at a Phoenix convenience store 
on Jan. 29, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said she was thrown off a 40-foot cliff but didn't  
die immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Rossetti begged for mercy before the men  
stoned her and buried her under boulders and rocks. A coroner said 
she probably was still alive when she was buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan, now 45, cooperated with prosecutors and was sentenced to  
life in prison with a chance for parole after 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillies was the 13th execution since Arizona reinstated the  
death penalty in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Areas for Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration designated 20 poor  
communities as ``empowerment zones'' Wednesday, which makes the 
areas eligible for special federal help. 
</P>
<P>
	The communities, 15 urban and five rural, will share at least  
$55 million in federal grants and $2.2 billion in tax-exempt bonds 
to help shrink unemployment and aid development in communities that 
are struggling financially, Vice President Al Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will push Congress to approve an additional  
$1.6 billion in federal grants to be spread out over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress approves full funding for our new empowerment  
zones, it will help create and retain about 90,000 jobs and 
stimulate more than $20 billion in new private and public 
investment,'' Gore said. ``That's a down payment on extending the 
American Dream to millions of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urban communities named empowerment zones include Boston;  
Bridgeton and Vineland, N.J.; Cincinnati; Columbia and Sumter, 
S.C.; Columbus, Ohio; El Paso, Texas; Gary and East Chicago, Ind.; 
Huntington, W.V., and Ironton, Ohio; Knoxville, Tenn.; Miami; 
Minneapolis; New Haven, Conn.; Norfolk and Portsmouth, Va.; Santa 
Ana, Calif.; East St. Louis, Ill., and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The rural empowerment zones include Cordele, Ga.; Griggs and  
Steele counties, N.D.; Riverside County, Calif.; Ullin, Ill.; and 
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20 communities were chosen from more than 270 applicants  
based on a scoring system that measured the quality of 
revitalization plans and private and public commitments to 
implement the plans.

<HEADLINE> Scaggs Using Fame To Fight Drugs </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Boz Scaggs, whose son died recently of a  
heroin overdose, says he will use his fame to warn of the dangers 
of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``These dealers are selling death,'' the musician said. ``Kids  
need to be given the means to defend themselves. They've got to 
know that they're under attack so they can take care of each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar Scaggs, 21, died in a rundown San Francisco hotel on New  
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, who recorded the hits ``Lowdown'' and ``Lido  
Shuffle,'' said a well-to-do upbringing did not save his son from 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went to some of the better schools in some of the better  
neighborhoods,'' Scaggs said in Wednesday's San Francisco 
Chronicle.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Falls As Stocks Grow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures tumbled Wednesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange as U.S. inventories continue to build amid a worldwide oil 
glut. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures rose sharply, while grain and  
soybeans retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude fell after the American Petroleum Institute reported  
inventories jumped 1 percent, or 3.1 million barrels, in the past 
week, surpassing expectations of a modest increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline inventories, meantime, jumped a sharp 6.8  
million barrels, or 3.2 percent, as snowstorms in the Northeast and 
Midwest cut sharply into demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The supply numbers reignited fears that inventories will  
continue to swell in coming weeks as world producers do little to 
ease a supply glut caused by falling demand in Asia and 
overproduction elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's de facto devaluation of its currency also pressured  
prices as investors worried demand to Latin America will fall 
sharply amid economic uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for February delivery fell 58 cents to $12.31 a barrel;  
February heating oil fell 1.92 cents to 33.78 cents a gallon; 
February unleaded gasoline fell 1.56 cents to 36.40 cents a gallon; 
February natural gas fell 5.1 cents to $1.770 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures jumped 2.3 percent on the New York Board of Trade  
after an influential crop forecaster predicted Brazil's next crop 
will be smaller than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Widely respected agronomist Leon Yallouz predicted Brazil's  
1999-2000 crop will come in at between 23.7 million bags and 25.9 
million bags. Brazilian farmers this year produced the largest 
combined harvest in 11 years, at an estimated 35 million bags 
weighing 132 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
	Those plentiful Brazil supplies have caused coffee prices to  
tumbled nearly 30 percent in the past year as roasters were allowed 
to pick and choose purchases at their leisure. 
</P>
<P>
	The crop forecast helped overcome fears Brazilian producers will  
sell their stored supplies in the wake of the government's decision 
to devalue the Brazilian currency, the real. Devaluation would 
bring greater income because commodities are based in U.S. dollars 
that remain strongly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	March arabica coffee rose 3.15 cents to $1.20 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures retreated anew on the Chicago Board of  
Trade, weighed down by economic troubles in Brazil and beneficial 
weather for competing crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat, corn and soybean prices also suffered from Brazil's  
effective devaluation of its currency. The troubles in Brazil could 
trickle down to other Latin American economies, exacerbating weak 
export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were pressured by continued beneficial rains  
in Argentina, which were helping competing corn and soybean crops 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 7 1/4 cents to $2.74 1/4 a bushel; March  
corn fell 2 cents to $2.15 1/4 a bushel; March oats fell 2 1/2 cents to 
$1.06 a bushel; March soybeans fell 4 3/4 cents to $5.33 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Taylor, Levy Among Hall Finalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor, who led the New York Giants  
to wins in two Super Bowls, and Marv Levy, whose Buffalo Bills lost 
four of them, are among 15 finalists for induction into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor and Levy were among four candidates to make the list in  
their first year of eligibility, joining running back Eric 
Dickerson and defensive end Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
	They were joined by seven other modern-era finalists and seniors  
candidate Billy Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall's 36 selectors will meet in Miami on Jan. 30 -- the day  
before the Super Bowl -- to elect the class of 1999. Between four 
and seven new inductees will be voted on. 
</P>
<P>
	The other finalists were coach George Allen (1966-70 Los Angeles  
Rams, 1971-77 Washington Redskins); defensive end Carl Eller 
(1964-78 Minnesota Vikings, 1979 Seattle Seahawks); punter Ray Guy 
(1973-86 Oakland-Los Angeles Raiders); guard Tom Mack (1966-78 
Rams); tight end Ozzie Newsome (1978-90 Cleveland Browns); 
executive Dan Rooney (Pittsburgh Steelers 1955-present); wide 
receivers John Stallworth (1974-87 Steelers) and Lynn Swann 
(1974-82 Steelers); tackle Ron Yary (1968-81 Vikings, 1982 Rams); 
and defensive end Jack Youngblood (1971-84 Rams). 
</P>
<P>
	The modern-era finalists were determined by a vote of the  
selectors. Shaw, a guard for nine years with the Bills (1961-69), 
was nominated by a seniors committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the finalists spent their entire NFL careers with the  
same team and two others spent most of their playing time with one 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy coached the Bills for 12 years, becoming the only coach to  
reach -- and lose -- four straight Super Bowls. He retired in 
December 1997 with a 143-112 record in 17 years, including five 
seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marv not only taught football, but he taught us how to be  
people,'' Bills wide receiver Andre Reed said. ``He taught us how 
to conduct ourselves off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor has insisted he deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know I belong there,'' he said upon learning he was being  
considered for induction. ``I just figured it as a given. I don't 
want to sound cocky, but I expect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who will turn 40 one week after the induction  
announcement, was a quick and athletic linebacker selected for 10 
Pro Bowls while with the Giants from 1981 to 1993. Since his 
retirement, he has been dogged by drug, tax and bankruptcy 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson ran for a record 2,105 yards with the Rams in 1984. He  
stands third on the career rushing list with 13,259 yards, having 
rushed for more than 1,000 yards seven times. He also played for 
the Indianapolis Colts and Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Long was renowned for rushing the quarterback and leading the  
Raiders defense from 1981-93.

<HEADLINE> Mistress to Alleged Mob Boss Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She was both a lawyer and a mob groupie,  
bleached blonde and slender, a beauty school graduate with brains. 
He was the reputed boss of the Colombo crime family, balding and 
not-so-dapper, but a don nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	She says that after meeting at a party, they became lovers --  
``the gangster and the lawyer'' he called them. But authorities say 
they also schemed to obstruct the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, Dorothy Fiorenza, 32, and Andrew Russo, 65, were  
reunited Tuesday in a federal courtroom where Fiorenza is a key 
prosecution witness in Russo's trial on charges of trying to tamper 
with a juror in the racketeering trial of his son. Russo and a 
co-defendant, Dennis Hickey, also are accused of impeding an FBI 
inquiry into the tampering allegations by hiding a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	As mob trials go, this one is low on criminal intrigue. But the  
appearance of Fiorenza on the witness stand -- her long hair died 
dark brown since becoming a protected witness in a mafia trial -- 
added an element of soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorenza began cooperating with the government in hopes of  
seeing her ailing second husband, convicted Colombo mobster 
Lawrence Fiorenza, released early from prison. She still faces 
possible prison time for her role in the Russo case. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began in the late 1980s at a barber shop in Queens where  
she mixed with a clientele that included Colombo crime family 
figures, she testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After earning a law degree from St. John's University and  
beginning a legal career, Fiorenza and her first husband were 
invited to a Christmas Party in 1994. There she met Russo, who was 
also married. He had just served eight years in federal prison for 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Fiorenza was invited to a New Year's Eve party at  
Russo's estate on Long Island and they later began an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Russo took Fiorenza to fancy restaurants and to see ``Phantom of  
the Opera.'' He often complained about the ``heat'' he was feeling 
from investigators. She said he also persuaded Fiorenza to begin 
visiting his jailed son, Joseph ``JoJo'' Russo, each week. 
</P>
<P>
	As a lawyer, Fiorenza needed no special clearance to see the  
junior Russo. She used her visits to deliver verbal, coded messages 
from Russo, she said. She claimed she didn't want to know what they 
meant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't ask questions,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Through Andrew Russo, Fiorenza met Joseph Russo's mistress,  
Teresa Castronova. She also knew that Russo and Hickey were 
allegedly hiding Castronova from the FBI, but didn't report it. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI believed that Castronova had recognized an alternate in  
the anonymous jury at Joseph Russo's trial as someone she had gone 
to school with, and had given the woman's name to the elder Russo. 
The father then allegedly sent a private investigator to try to 
find the juror -- a criminal violation of a judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorenza's affair with Russo eventually ended, but her interest  
with gangsters did not. On her visits to jail, she met Lawrence 
Fiorenza, who had been convicted with Joseph Russo in the 
racketeering case against the Colombo family. 
</P>
<P>
	She married Fiorenza in April 1996.

<HEADLINE> Spy Agency Bans Furbys As Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warning: Furbys could be a threat to national  
security. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Security Agency has banned the popular mechanical  
pets from its Fort Meade premises in Maryland. In an internal 
message to workers, the NSA issued a warning about the toy, which 
is embedded with a computer chip that allows it to utter 200 words 
-- 100 in English and 100 in ``Furbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally owned photographic, video and audio recording  
equipment are prohibited items. This includes toys, such as 
'Furbys,' with built-in recorders that repeat the audio with 
synthesized sound to mimic the original signal,'' the Furby Alert 
read, according to today's editions of The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are prohibited from introducing these items into NSA  
spaces. Those who have should contact their Staff Security Office 
for guidance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Furby resembles an owl, with tufts of hair between its huge  
pink ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its ability to repeat some of what it hears, NSA  
officials were worried ``that people would take them home and 
they'd start talking classified,'' one Capitol Hill source told the 
Post.

<HEADLINE> Plans To Restore Fisheries Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmental groups today said the government  
has failed to craft plans to restore the nation's fisheries as 
Congress required it to do in a landmark 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and eight regional fishery management councils  
have, at best, done ``the minimum they could get away with'' under 
the Sustainable Fisheries Act, or, at worst, made little or no 
effort to meet the law's requirements, the groups said in a report 
called ``Missing the Boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The act ``clearly called for a sea-change in the way our  
fisheries are managed,'' said Ken Hinman, co-chairman of The Marine 
Fish Conservation Network. ``Instead, what we're getting is 
business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network, a coalition of 88 environmental groups, called on  
Commerce Secretary William Daley to repair or reject fishery 
management plans that do not live up to the mandates of the 1996 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for the Commerce Department's National Marine  
fisheries Service said the groups have ``hastily issued a report 
card before the test is finished.'' Scott Smullen said many fishery 
management plan amendments were submitted in recent months and are 
still being analyzed by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 act, which aims to stop overfishing, protect fish  
habitat and minimize unwanted ``bycatch,'' gave eight regional 
councils until last October to rewrite 39 existing fishery 
management plans and write new ones where needed. 
</P>
<P>
	But in its report, the environmental groups say many of the new  
plans have failed to offset the harmful effects of bottom trawling 
and have missed opportunities to more quickly recover fish 
populations that have been decimated. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the Pacific Fishery Management Council adopted no  
measure to minimize bycatch or protect habitat from fishing 
effects, the environmentalists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service said the eight councils  
have drafted 58 amendments to the nation's 39 fish plans and 
submitted 33 of the 58 amendments for the agency's review. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency ``has come a long way'' and ``accomplished much in a  
relatively short time'' to meet the obligations of the 1996 act, 
said Rollie Schmitten, director of the fisheries service. 
</P>
<P>
	The fisheries service acknowledged that the process has taken  
longer than expected, in part because of a lack of federal dollars 
and because fishermen and environmental groups requested more time 
to comment on the effort.

<HEADLINE> Magic Says Teams Must Carry NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Magic Johnson believes the era of  
one superstar dominating the NBA ends with Michael Jordan's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think one person can carry the baton and lead the  
league, it'll have to be the teams. ... The Lakers have to become 
the team they are supposed to be. Indiana and New York are going to 
have to come up,'' Johnson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like when the Lakers dominated, and the Celtics  
dominated, we have to turn to somebody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball needs to develop new role models as well, Johnson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to continue to be the good guys until the young guys  
break through. Maybe it will be Kobe Bryant or Shaquille O'Neal or 
Grant Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, commenting after Jordan announced his retirement  
earlier Wednesday, called Jordan ``the most incredible athlete I've 
ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an icon, a one-man show. It's going to be a devastating  
loss. It's a loss for basketball, but for kids, too'' in terms of 
not being able to see a superb role model in action, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping he would stay just one more year to help these  
young NBA players learn how to be a true professional. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA has to have a great year, 50 games,'' said Johnson, to  
regain fans and respect in recovering from the labor dispute that 
will keep the league idle until next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have any incidents, players getting into trouble. ...  
I feel sad because we won't be able to watch the superstar and the 
best player anymore. It's really disappointing because of the 
lockout. But I'm happy for him because he found peace with himself, 
and will have more time with his wife and kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was the dominant player of the '80s, leading the Los  
Angeles Lakers to five championships before Jordan's Chicago Bulls 
won six NBA titles in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's won one more championship than I did. He'll be rubbing it  
in my face for eternity,'' Johnson said with a laugh as he talked 
with reporters outside the offices of Magic Johnson Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who became part-owner of the Lakers after retiring,  
hopes he and Jordan can get together for some pickup games. 
However, Johnson's not about to talk himself into 1-on-1 action 
against Jordan, his former teammate on the U.S. Dream Team for the 
1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's his game. If we played 10 times, he'd win 10 times. My  
game was leadership, and passing. He can't match my passes. But I 
can't score 60 points. I can't compete against him dunking,'' 
Johnson said.

                        *William Bentley Ball    	
</P>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- William Bentley Ball, a nationally known  
lawyer who championed religious freedom and won a case that helped 
preserve the Amish way of life, died Sunday at 83. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued nine civil rights-related cases before the U.S.  
Supreme Court and assisted in more than two dozen others. But his 
best-known case was Wisconsin vs. Yoder, in which state officials 
sought to force Amish children to attend public schools until age 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	The early 1970s case set a standard under which the government  
was required to show a compelling public need behind policies 
affecting religious groups. However, it was weakened in the early 
1990s and a bill in Congress to revive the protection, called the 
Religious Freedom Act, was muted by a Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball was an attorney with W. R. Grace and Co. in New York and

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jim Peters, the British runner who broke the world  
marathon record four times in the 1950s but is best remembered for 
a poignant failure in the 1954 Commonwealth Games, died Jan. 9, 
according to news reports. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	A report in The Times of London said he had suffered from  
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters first broke the 26-mile marathon record in 1952 with a  
time of 2 hours, 20 minutes, 42.2 seconds and he remained the 
world's best for that distance until 1958, The Times of London 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1954 Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, British Columbia,  
he entered the stadium at the end of the marathon with an 
astonishing three-mile lead over the rest of the field but began to 
stagger from effects of severe dehydration. He then fell more than 
a half dozen times, even crawling on all fours as he tried but 
failed to complete the last lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters ran in the 10,000-meter race in the 1948 Olympic Games  
and finished a disappointing ninth. Afterward, his new coach 
persuaded him to become a marathoner. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke the world record in 1952, but had his finest year in  
1953, winning four top-class marathons and reducing the world 
record twice more.

	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Gavin Relly, a former chairman  
of South African mining and investment conglomerate Anglo American

</P>
<P>
	Relly became chairman in 1983 and served until 1990. He also  
held positions on the boards of sister companies, De Beers 
Consolidated Mines Ltd. and Minorco SA, and was chairman of Anglo 
American Industrial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	He also worked in the coal mining, gold and steel areas.

<P>
	Relly, who joined Anglo in 1949, was elected a board member in

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- William H. Whyte, who helped pioneer the  
scholarly study of urban human habitats and warned against the 
proliferation of corporate conformity in his best-seller ``The 
Organization Man,'' died Tuesday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	A champion of spontaneity in workplaces and cities, Whyte took  
camera and notebook in hand and walked urban streets, painstakingly 
observing pedestrian behavior and making observations on the way 
people were using newly planned urban spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Whyte's 1956 best-seller ``The Organization Man,''  
written while he was a Fortune magazine editor, that first brought 
him public attention for rethinking America's corporate ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	The book lamented that individualists' once-bold visions had  
been replaced by ``modest aspirations of organization men who lower 
their sights to achieve a good job with adequate pay and proper 
pension and a nice house in a pleasant community populated with 
people as nearly like themselves as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also sounded an optimistic theme: that ``individualism within  
organizational life'' was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the book was published, Whyte was Fortune's  
assistant managing editor, a post he kept until he left in 1958 to 
become a scholar of human habitats. 
</P>
<P>
	His advice was heeded in the design of many public spaces, and  
his 1959 study ``Conservation Easements'' was credited with helping 
bring about open-space legislation in California, New York, 
Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his environmental books were ``The Last Landscape''  
(1968), ``The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces'' (1980), ``City'' 
(1989) and ``The Exploding Metropolis'' (1993).

10 seasons in the National Hockey League and scored a dramatic 
overtime goal for the St. Louis Blues in the 1986 playoffs, died 
Tuesday of cancer. He was 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser, who played for St. Louis from 1983 to 1987,  
completed the Blues' rally from a 5-2 deficit to beat the Calgary 
Flames 6-5 in Game 6 of the Campbell Conference finals on May 12, 
1986. The Blues trailed by three goals with 11:52 to go but scored 
three to force overtime, and Wickenheiser got the game-winner at 
7:30 of the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory forced Game 7, which Calgary won 2-1 two nights  
later to advance to the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser totaled 111 goals and 156 assists in 556 games in  
career that also had stops at Montreal, Vancouver, the New York 
Rangers and Washington from 1980-90.

<HEADLINE> ABC Union Lockout May Be Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An end to ABC's lockout of 2,400 employees  
seemed just days away Wednesday, as union leaders reviewed a 
back-to-work proposal from the network. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're real close,'' said Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the  
National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which 
represents ABC's camera operators, producers and other 
behind-the-scenes workers. 
</P>
<P>
	NABET members at the network, who have been without a contract  
since March 1997, staged a one-day strike over health benefits on 
Nov. 2. After that, ABC locked them out of their jobs until they 
promised advance warning on future job actions. Initially the union 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wednesday an agreement containing what Donahue termed the  
union's ``ironclad guarantee'' not to disrupt network operations 
without notice was approved by ABC and returned to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything seems to be moving in the right direction,'' said  
ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``handful'' of unresolved issues remain to be worked out,  
Donahue said, ``but the union believes that the two sides are 
closer than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement gets us back to work within days,'' he said,  
``and subsequent to that, the ratification vote on the contract 
vote would be held.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, ABC has used temporary workers while NABET  
members walk picket lines at network facilities in New York, 
Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, technical glitches have sometimes been evident  
on the screen. But the biggest impact on viewers has been the 
refusal, at the union's urging, by some entertainers and Democratic 
politicians to appear on ABC shows like ``Nightline,'' ``Good 
Morning America'' and ``This Week.''

<HEADLINE> Moseley-Braun Running for Alderman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Carol Moseley-Braun is running for city alderman.  
</P>
<P>
	No, not the former U.S. senator. This Moseley-Braun is the  
former Lauryn K. Valentine, 21, a market researcher who changed her 
name to match her role model's a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon first learning of Valentine last summer, the 51-year-old  
Moseley-Braun politely tried to discourage the name change. She 
later denounced the woman as a fraud. Her lawyer, Bill Von Hoene, 
said Wednesday he plans to file court papers seeking to set aside 
the new name. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone else who worries that confused voters will be drawn to  
the recognizable name on the ballot is Alderman Percy Giles, who 
has held the seat for more than a decade and is running to retain 
it in the Feb. 23 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are shocked,'' he said Tuesday. ``They can't believe  
someone would go so far to get elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giles filed an objection with the Board of Election  
Commissioners alleging Valentine did not register to vote under her 
new name in time to be a contender. A hearing is set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Valentine could change her name, a judge ordered her to  
contact the former senator, who after losing her November 
re-election bid to Republican Peter Fitzgerald said she was through 
with politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wrote that your attempt to change your name is your way of  
honoring me,'' Moseley-Braun wrote in an August letter to 
Valentine. ``The fact is that by taking my advice seriously and 
striving to improve not only your circumstances but those of the 
people around you as well, you have already given me the highest 
honor that I could possibly hope for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She took a tougher stance last month after the new Moseley-Braun  
announced her political ambitions, saying: ``I'll do everything I 
can to let everyone know that this woman is a fraud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former senator did not return phone messages this week  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles said he first thought the famed name on a ballot petition  
circulating last month was a prank. He has since had campaign 
volunteers going door-to-door to get the word out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This young lady,'' Giles said, ``she took advantage of the  
good name of Carol Moseley-Braun.''
