<HEADLINE> China Strictly Forbids Tourism at Public Expense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
the Ministry of Supervision have jointly issued a circular
demanding that leading cadres at all levels strictly forbid
tourism at public expense.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on leading personnel to take the lead in
carrying out the relevant rules drawn up by the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that serious abuses in this regard which cause a
bad public impression will be severely dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The circular cited the case of Inspector Wang Shuchun of the
Cotton and Flax Bureau of the All-China Federation of Supply and
Marketing Cooperatives (an official at departmental director
level).
</P>
<P>
In late July 1996 Wang asked to go on a tour to Shengnongjia, a
leading tourism resort in the western part of Hubei Province,
despite urgent flood-relief work. A traffic accident occurred en
route to the scenic site, with one person critically injured and
the car damaged. The accident cost the Wuhan Cotton Quality
Supervision and Examination Center 130,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, in October of the same year Wang once more arranged to
go on a tour to Shengnongjia at public expense.
</P>
<P>
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the
Ministry of Supervision gave Wang Shuchun a severe warning and a
demerit.
</P>
<P>
Tourism activities using public funds not only increase the
financial burdens on the concerned units, but undermine the
Party's image, and this should be strictly curbed, the circular
noted.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on all leading officials to draw a lesson
from Wang's case and promote the Party's tradition of hard work
and thrift.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Bids Farewell to Welfare Housing Allocation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- This capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province has promulgated rules to put an end to the
traditional welfare housing allocation system.
</P>
<P>
The new rules stipulate that a new system will be applied to
the allocation of newly-built residences, which mainly focus
on selling publicly-owned housing property instead of renting.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, publicly-owned residences newly built by
government units and departments, social communities, enterprises
and institutions in the city should be sold to their staff members
in line with the housing sales policies contained in the housing
reform package.
</P>
<P>
The rules provide that units may also build houses by raising
their own funds, and these houses will be sold to their employees
at cost price upon completion.
</P>
<P>
Households with annual incomes below 50,000 yuan or average
annual per capita income less than 16,600 yuan are allowed to
apply to purchase houses at cost price.
</P>
<P>
According to a deputy mayor of the city, Nanjing started its
housing reform in 1992, and has now set up a system whereby it
raises public funds for new housing construction. So far, some
125,000 publicly-owned apartments have been sold in line with the
housing reform policies.

<HEADLINE> UUP Leader Says Talks with Blair Inconclusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP) leader David Trimble said today his meeting with Prime
Minister Tony Blair on the surrender of IRA arms was inconclusive
but more efforts would be exerted.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, emerging from a one-and-half hour meeting with Blair
at Downing Street, told reporters: "There are some possibilities
of progress...but the matter is not yet clear."
</P>
<P>
"We will not shirk our responsibilities. We are not in the mode
of walking out. We are there to try to achieve things," the leader
of the most powerful Pro-British Protestant party said.
</P>
<P>
UUP, which wants Northern Ireland to remain under British rule,
are angry at government decision to allow IRA's political wing
Sinn Fein to join the peace talks because the IRA called a truce
at the weekend. The Irish Republican Army has launched military
campaign in the past 28 years to end British rule of Northern
Ireland, costing 3,200 lives.
</P>
<P>
Trimble insists that IRA should hand over weapons at the start
of the negotiation before Sinn Fein is allowed to have a place at
the talks scheduled for mid-September.
</P>
<P>
But Britain's Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam, who was
with Blair at the talks, said Trimble had not threatened to walk
out of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication that the UUP were going to walk from
the talks which is very useful because, after the ceasefire, what
is important to so many people in Northern Ireland is that we do
manage to move the talks process forward," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Trimble will hold another round of talks with British
government officials ahead of a vote on Britain's
"decommissioning" plans on Wednesday at the talks in Belfast
co-sponsored by Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
However, two other pro-British unionist parties, the U.K.
Unionist party and the Democratic Unionist Party, are threatening
to boycotting the talks in protest of British government's "terror
appeasement."
</P>
<P>
Under British proposals the Irish Republican Army and other
guerrilla groups will not have to surrender weapons to gain
representation at the talks but must discuss the issue in a
sub-committee alongside political negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Senior Pak Diplomat Holds Talks with Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pakistani diplomat
today resumed his shuttle diplomacy in Afghanistan by holding
talks with the leadership of the Islamic Taliban militia to bring
Afghan warring factions to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Iftikhar Murshed, Pakistan's Additional Foreign Secretary, held
talks today with the Taliban's acting foreign minister Abdul Jalil
and other officials in Kandahar, a major city in southern
Afghanistan, Pakistan Television (PTV) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Murshed briefed the Taliban leaders on his
parleys last week with ousted Afghan president Burhanuddin
Rabbani, Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik and former military chief Ahmad
Masood, who control the northern one-third of the Afghan
territory, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the Taliban leaders on the talks held with
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Alauddin Broujerdi in Islamabad on
Friday, said PTV.
</P>
<P>
During Broujerdi's visit to Pakistan, Tehran and Islamabad
agreed to use their influence to induce the Taliban and the rival
northern alliance to sit together and find a peaceful solution to
the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, Murshed held talks with the leadership of
the northern alliance in Mazar-e-Sharif, during which all of them
expressed willingness to enter into political dialogue aimed at
bringing peace to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance, based in Mazar-e-Sharif, has forwarded
the idea of setting up a joint political commission for a
broad-based government in Afghanistan while the Taliban call for
unconditional release of their senior officials including foreign
minister Mulla Muhammad Ghous as a confidence-building measure for
talks.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls on Muslims to Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today called on Muslim countries to get
united to fight against world hegemony.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 10th International Islamic Unity Conference
being held here, Rafsanjani said the Islamic countries have an
important role to play in the world in view of their rich energy
resources and strategic geographical locations in the most
sensitive parts on the globe.
</P>
<P>
"This has prompted the hostility of powerful countries and
made them challenge the Muslim and Islamic governments," said the
64-year-old president who is to step down on August 3 after his
two terms of office.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani called on Islamic countries to use their oil
resources as a rational lever against foreign bullying and drop
the practice of adventurism in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He added that "All Muslims want is to be allowed to live in
peace and freedom from any domination."
</P>
<P>
"The shortest way for Islamic movements to recapture glory and
sovereignty of Islam is the establishment of Islamic system of
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the big powers in the West are working to
promote the idea that Islam lacks the platforms needed for
the establishment of a government.
</P>
<P>
"The driving motive of big powers behind this approach is to
plunder the wealth of the Islamic countries and maintain their
presence in these countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, no contradiction exists between formation
of an Islamic government in Islamic countries and the world of
Christianity and in relations with European countries.
</P>
<P>
About 75 foreign guests from 31 countries and a large number
of scholars attended the three-day conference.

Treasury here today.

"This is an historic occasion, in more than one sense
...This is a new Government at the dawn of developing a more
constructive relationship generally between our two countries,"
Liddell added
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Memorandum of Understanding which the UK
Government signed with the China Securities Regulatory Commission,
Liddell said: "as a direct result of this agreement, this

Looking forward to further cooperation between Britain and
China in economic and financial areas, the Secretary said:

member of the International Organization of Security Commissions
and is playing a full and active role, commensurate with her
rapidly expanding financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Delay over Euro to Bring Threat of Damages: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Commission
official has warned that postponing the introduction of the
European single currency named euro beyond the planned start of
1999 would have serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European Union (EU) Commissioner
responsible for monetary affairs, was quoted by today's Financial
Times as saying that a delay over euro would be a breach of the
1992 Maastricht Treaty for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
"If the EU heads of government decide that we begin in 2001 or
2002, a flood of damage claims will break over us," de Silguy
said.
</P>
<P>
"All banks, all companies that have put their faith in the
Maastricht Treaty could demand reimbursement of their costs of
preparation for the EMU," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner insisted that Maastricht Treaty did not allow
EMU to be delayed beyond January 1 1999, warning the euro would be
dead because that would require the treaty to be changed and
ratified again by the parliaments of the EU member states.

<HEADLINE> France to Pay the Price for New Profits Tax: Employers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- France's national employers'
association the CNPF reacted mildly to the announcement by the
Socialist government to raise 22 billion francs (3.6 billion U.S.
dollars) of profit tax on enterprises in the remaining months of
the year in order to reduce public deficit.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn announced the new tax, the CNPF said that not only
the enterprises, but also France itself, will pay the price for
the measure which is aimed at helping the country join the
European single currency by 1999.
</P>
<P>
France's public deficit is expected to stand at 3.5-3.7 percent
of its gross domestic product by the end of 1997, higher than the
three percent criteria set by the Maastricht treaty for joining
the euro.
</P>
<P>
In a symbolic gesture to support the enterprises, President
Jacques Chirac today had dinner together with a number of French
and German entrepreneurs in the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
"Once more, France, which keeps the world record of public
taxes, has decided to resolve the difficulties by increasing taxes
and making enterprises bear the bulk of the efforts," said CNPF,
adding that the measure must be "exceptional" and have a
"limited duration."
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister and the leader of France's Liberal
Democratic Party, Alain Madelin, described the measure to raise
profit tax as being "against the current of Europe."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is not only the rich bosses and great enterprises
which will pay, but also medium-sized enterprises which are
growing, those which can invest, innovate and create jobs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
All French enterprises with 50 million francs (8.3 million U.S.
dollars) of transactions will be covered by the new tax.

</P>
<P>
The new rules stipulate that a new system will be applied to
the allocation of newly-built residences, which mainly focus
on selling publicly-owned housing property instead of renting.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, publicly-owned residences newly built by
government units and departments, social communities, enterprises
and institutions in the city should be sold to their staff members
in line with the housing sales policies contained in the housing
reform package.
</P>
<P>
The rules provide that units may also build houses by raising
their own funds, and these houses will be sold to their employees
at cost price upon completion.
</P>
<P>
Households with annual incomes below 50,000 yuan or average
annual per capita income less than 16,600 yuan are allowed to
apply to purchase houses at cost price.
</P>
<P>
According to a deputy mayor of the city, Nanjing started its
housing reform in 1992, and has now set up a system whereby it
raises public funds for new housing construction. So far, some
125,000 publicly-owned apartments have been sold in line with the
housing reform policies.

<HEADLINE> African Health Conference Opens In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The biannual Social Science and
Health International Conference started here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 delegates from seven African countries are
attending the five-day conference with a theme of ''African
Health in the 21st Century''.
</P>
<P>
The conference seeks to bring together social scientists and
medical practitioners so they can find a holistic approach to health.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare
Minister Timothy Stamps urged African governments to implement efficient
mechanisms for identifying and assisting people with hereditary,
genetic and environmental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
He said such illnesses were difficult to modify and militated
against attempts to achieve the goal of good health for most
populations.
</P>
<P>
''In managing and mitigating their deprived or deficient
circumstances clearly, this requires more than dishing out fancy
pills or satisfying the ubiquitous passion for an injection,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Stamps also castigated the World Trade Organization for granting
private institutions patents to genes, including those of human
beings, which could be transferred to animals to produce additional
sources of organs like hearts and kidneys to be used in human
transplant operations.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of China's
water sports announced here today that China would try to send a
yacht to the prestigious America's Cup yacht race sometime early
next century.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qing, director of the Water Sports Administrative Center
of the Chinese State Sports Commission, made the announcement
after the completion of the country's first ever high-sea sailing
regatta South China Sea Sailing Race here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The regatta involved 19 boats -- seven from China's inland
areas and the others from Hong Kong. The 20-day race started on
July 1 at Dalian, a major port city in northeast China's Liaoning
province, and covered some 3,000 nautical miles.
</P>
<P>
Two of the participating boats had to quit mid-way as their
sails were torn to pieces by strong gusts.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step for the Chinese Yachting Association
towards America's Cup," Zhang said at the awarding ceremony held
at the Hong Kong Yacht Club here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the association would continue its efforts for
entering the world's top-class yacht race.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Chinese yachtsmen have competed in Olympic-class
yacht races, with boats smaller than some of the boats used in the
Dalian-Hong Kong regatta.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Moves Poison Atmosphere: Cypriot President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today rejected Turkish
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's statement made Sunday on
Turkey's partial integration process with northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said here that Ecevit's
statement, together with a joint declaration issued Sunday by
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime in the northern Cyprus, will
harm the good climate that has emerged from recent U.N.-sponsored
bi-communal direct talks.
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration was reported to outline a proposed series
of steps toward integration of the Turkish occupied northern
island.
</P>
<P>
It states that the partial integration in economic and
financial areas and partnerships in the fields of security,
defense and foreign policy, will coincide with Cyprus' European
Union (EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
The EU has confirmed to start the accession talks with Cyprus
next year, a move which was rejected by Turkey and the Turkish
Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who was Turkey's Prime Minister in 1974, attended
celebrations organized Sunday in the northern part of Cyprus to
mark the 23rd anniversary of the Turkish invasion of the island.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as claiming that the Turkish Cypriot regime in
the north "will live for ever as an independent state, but its
foreign policy and defense will be handled by Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally a breakaway state
"the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which was only
recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters whether the Greek Cypriot side might
reconsider its decision to take part in a second round of direct
talks, Clerides said "the issue will be discussed in depth both at
the meeting of the National Council, top advisory body to the
President on the Cyprus problem, on Thursday, and with the Greek
government."
</P>
<P>
The first round of direct negotiations between Clerides on the
Greek Cypriot side and Turkish Cypriot leader Ruaf Denktash, for a
solution to the protracted Cyprus problem, took place in
Troutbeck, near New York, on July 9-12 and a second round of talks
is scheduled for August 11-16, in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island was divided since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed and seized the northern third in the
wake of a Greek Cypriot coup engineered by military junta
ruling Greece at the time.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Somali Aid Worker Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU,July 21 (Xinhua)-- The Somali aid worker working for
an American aid agency, abducted by unidentified gumen Friday
night, was freed today.
</P>
<P>
The aid worker, Saed Aden Mohamed (Firdhis) was released
following an intensive talks by the North Mogadishu authorities
and representatives from the abductors.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdurahman Ahmed Mohamed, a program officer for
CARE International here in Mogadishu, Fordhis was released
unconditionally by his captors and was brought to Mogadishu from
Elow village, 40 km North of the capital, where he has been kept
by his abductors since Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Firdhis, a Somali aid worker working for the American aid
agency, CARE International, said after his release that he has
been treated and fed well during his captivity.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the abductors, the gunmen have
asked for a ransom of US $ 5000 for the release of Firdhis.
However, no such money was paid, but an undisclosed sum of money
was given out to the abductors, added the sources.
</P>
<P>
Firdhis was abducted by six gunmen driving a Land Rover near
his house in North Mogadishu where security was deteriorating
since October last year after the Islamic Sharia courts were
disabled following the political dispute between Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and the strong religious leader, Sheikh Ali sheikh
Mohamud.

<HEADLINE> Senior Israeli Official to Visit US to Discuss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to dispatch Cabinet Secretary
Danny Naveh to Washington soon to discuss new ideas on reviving
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
This may signal the start of a new round of intensive
diplomatic offensive launched by Netanyahu after he averted
early this month a coalition crisis triggered by the resignation
of former finance minister Dan Meridor.
</P>
<P>
Naveh is to discuss with U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis
Ross and other officials new ideas put forward by Netanyahu on
breaking the ice in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that have
been deadlocked since Israel began in March building the Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the center of the new proposals was the suggestion that the
talks be taken on to a "fast track" to the final-status
talks. This means skipping the Oslo process, which requires
Israel to complete the three-stage troop withdrawals from West
Bank before August next year.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu even proposed accelerating the final-status talks in
order to conclude them as fast as within six months. The
permanent talks will tackle the most difficult issues of final
borders, status of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement signed between the two sides in
January, the final-status talks should have begun since
March. But the peace process have been frozen by the start of the
Har Homa construction.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's new ideas were believed to be based on the
so-called "Allon-Plus Plan", which was first publicized early
June by his aides as Israel's guidelines in the final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was the enlarged version of the plan proposed
by former Israeli foreign minister Yigal Allon after the 1967
war, envisioned Israel's relinquishing of only 40 percent of the
West Bank in the final settlement, while retaining control over
major settlements, water resources and strategic borders and
roads for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Knesset (Parliament) today, Netanyahu stressed
that all those ideas would only be implemented after the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) changes its approach toward
security, namely the handling of the alleged Palestinian police
involvement in anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops arrested three Palestinian policemen last week,
who were allegely to be on their way to carry out a shooting
attack against a Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of
Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the Palestinian police of organizing riots and
terrorism, the Israeli government is pressuring the PNA to arrest
Ghazi Jabali, the commander of Palestinian police forces, who
was charged for masterminding the planned attack.
</P>
<P>
"We want a systematic action, an uprooting (of terrorism),
and steps be taken against those senior Palestinian officers
that were involved," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Palestinian police's uncovering of a bomb-making
factory run by the militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
near Bethlehem, Netanyahu emphasized that the Palestinian side
should launch a long-term crackdown on terrorism rather than
only take actions under Israeli pressure.
</P>
<P>
It remained doubtful if Netanyahu's new ideas could break the
ice in the peace process. The PNA wants to gain control over 80
percent of the West Bank in the final settlement, nearly double
the size in the "Allon-Plus Plan."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy Sunday, PNA Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the PNA was
not opposed to the idea of accelerating the final-status talks,
but required Israel to make concessions first by stopping
settlement activities and refraining from taking further
unilateral actions to derail the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Parties Split up Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's opposition now seems
deeply divided as some opposition leaders called today for
boycotting talks with President Daniel arap Moi, while some
others are to attend the talks expected tomorrow or the day
after.
</P>
<P>
At the core of the mounting schism within the opposition ranks
is believedly their discomfort at both Moi's tendency to choose
who to meet and who they can approve of as their representatives
at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Only after Moi "unequivocally" affirms acceptance of the
constitutional reforms before the forthcoming general
elections, the talks can be held, Kivutha Kibwana, chief of the
National Convention Executive Council (NCEC), urged at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
So far "there have been no wide consultations to ensure that
there is genuine, open and democratic dialogue," leaving the
expected talks nothing meaningful, said Kibwana.
</P>
<P>
NCEC, the umbrella body set up in April to coordinate the
opposition's campaign for constitutional reform, "has not been
invited" to take part in the talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he charged that the talks is Moi's cosmetic and public
relations exercise which " would only make the government " succeed
in emasculating the determination and will " of the opposition
which has advocated reforms for months.
</P>
<P>
"Piece-meal negotiations are unacceptable" and all talks
between Moi and the opposition on the issue should be held under
the auspices of the NCEC and within the institutional framework
the NCEC provides, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He announced the opposition will continue to hold rallies for
constitutional reform without seeking permits from the
authorities, including an already planned one in Mombasa
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the NCEC boycotting, the expected talks between Moi
and some prominent opposition leaders are surely to take place,
some local political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
However, it is yet to be known who have been chosen by Moi
from the opposition camp to participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 73, and in power for 19 years, in a sudden softening of
his hard stance, met opposition leader Kijana Wamalwa as well as
19 key religious leaders respectively last week.
</P>
<P>
The government now is drafting bills which will be presented in
two weeks to the current session of the parliament for enactment
of a commission to review the constitution and make proposals
for the repeal or amendment of laws charged as oppressive.
</P>
<P>
These laws include the Public Order Act on public rallies, the
Preservation of Public Security Act which allows detention
without trial, as well as other nine laws.
</P>
<P>
The government's shifts came days after the most violent
conflicts between the police and the opposition supporters, which
claimed 13 lives around the eastern African country on July 7.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets to Compensate War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today announced that a commission of inquiry will look into the
disbursement of war victims' compensation, which is looming into
sticky problem to the government.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member commission of lawyers and doctors is chaired by
Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku.
</P>
<P>
''You will be required to give measures of recovering all such
amounts of compensation as may have been improperly paid in
contravention or in excess of the qualifications and requirements
prescribed in the compensation act,'' Mugabe told the commission.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended payments under the act in March this year
following discoveries and allegations that undeserving people had
benefited from the fund.
</P>
<P>
War veterans, irked by the suspension, have taken to the streets
demanding the immediate release of the money.
</P>
<P>
Today, about 1,500 ex-combatants, mostly soldiers who had
taken part in the long struggle for national liberation in the
70s, staged a demonstration in Harare demanding an audience with
Mugabe over the disbursement of the war victims compensation
fund.
</P>
<P>
Chanting slogans and denouncing some government officials, they
sang revolutionary songs outside the gate of the president office.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe used to be a British colony, called Southern
Rhodesia, at the end of 19th century. Zimbabwean people carried
out decades of struggle against British colonialists and won its
independence on April 18, 1980.

CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has squarely rejected holding
any labor contacts or cooperation with Israel before solving
disputes bedeviling the faltering Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Realizing a just and comprehensive peace in the region and
establishing an independent Palestinian state are pre-requisites
for contacts with the Israeli Labor Federation (Histadrut),"
Al-Sayed Rashid, chairman of the Egyptian Trade Unions Federation

He called for concerting employer-employee organizations'
efforts to set up an Arab common market and attract Arab funds to
launch investment projects.

Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 but ties have
been cool. Many Egyptian trade unions have objected to dealing with
their counterparts in the Jewish state before any breakthrough is
made in the Mideast peace process.

The symposium, held under the theme of globalization and the
role of labor unions, is co-organized by the Egyptian Labor

SARAJEVO, July 21 (Xinhua) --The European Union on Monday
signed a telecommunication agreement with the Muslim-Croat
federation of Bosnia, paying the way for restoration of telephone
lines throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Memorandum of Understanding for the Rehabilitation of the
Telecommunications Network in Bosnia and Hercegovina was signed by
Donato Chiarinl, head of the Representation Office of European
Commission in Sarajevo and Edhem Bicakcic, prime minister of the

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Genocide Suspects Arrested in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said today that seven genocide
suspects arrested in the Kenyan Capital last Friday were using
false passports, mostly from the Francophone countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Arusha, northern Tanzania,
Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna said that documents found with
them were false and "We're scrutinizing the documents".
</P>
<P>
He denied reports from Nairobi that ICTR had arrested another
additional 80 Hutu genocide suspects, pointing out that the
tribunal has nothing to do with the weekend's arrests in Nairobi
by the Kenyan police. "Maybe it was a normal clean up exercise of
the Kenyan police," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed any suggestion that there was link between
Friday's arrests and a visit Wednesday by Rwanda's Vice-President
Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR would prepare an indictment within maximum 90 days
for those suspects arrested in Nairobi, he said.
</P>
<P>
President of the tribunal, Judge Laity Kama, who also attended
the press conference, praised the co-operation of the Kenyan
government in arresting the suspects and urged other African
countries to offer help to bring to justice the leading
architects of the Rwandese genocide in which an estimated number
of over 500,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
He said that some African countries, he said without
mentioning names, have been issued with arrest warrants of
suspects, "but there are no good co-operation and this delays the
work of the tribunal."
</P>
<P>
On the allegations of Rwandan people that the tribunal is slow
in prosecuting those who committed genocide, the ICTR president
assured that everything possible was being done and promised that
cases would be speeded up after second trial courtroom will be
ready next month.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Jean Kambanda, Rwanda's interim Prime
Minister during the 1994 genocide, was among those arrested
during a series of dawn raids in Nairobi on Friday. The other
arrested were also dignitaries in the former Rwandan regime who
occupied positions of political or military responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The arrested were immediately transferred to the detention
facility of the tribunal in Arusha.

AMMAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and India inaugurated today a
phosphoric acid plant worth 170 million U.S. dollars in southern
Jordan to guarantee sustainable supply of the product to the
Indian market.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan who attended the occasion said at
the inauguration ceremony that the setting up of the plant was the

The joint venture is expected to produce about 250,000 tonnes
of phosphoric acid annually.
</P>
<P>
All the products will be exported to India, where they will be
used to manufacture diammonium phosphate, a fertilizer greatly
demanded by Indian farmers.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is Jordan's first major project set up under
its strategy to promote the export of finished fertilizers instead
of rock phosphates.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes European Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today voiced welcome to the recent European efforts to
break the impasse in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters here that he also welcomed the
discussions the European Union (EU) foreign ministers will have in
Brussels, Belgium Tuesday with the Palestinian and Israeli
sides in an attempt to review the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Top Palestinian National Authority (PNA) negotiator Nabil
Shaath and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will meet at the
15-member EU's General Affairs Council meeting, as part of a
European bid to advance stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace moves.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat has yet to decide whether or not
to meet Levy there. But European officials said earlier they hope
the two sides could agree on confidence-building measures, mainly
to provide aid to the ailing Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Moratinos, EU's Mideast peace envoy, who arranged a
meeting between Shaath and Levy Sunday, said progress was made on
security issues.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt, while following up the U.S. efforts,
continues to work for a balanced peace that satisfies the
legitimate demands of the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to disentangle the peace process from
its current crisis and give it momentum in line with the terms of
reference of the Madrid peace conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat added that all the U.S., European
and Arab peace initiatives are equally vital.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stepped in as a major broker between the
Palestinians and Israelis since the U.S. lowered its mediation
profile in the four-month-old peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
A tripartite Arab meeting grouping Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein and Arafat is expected to take
place here before the end of this month, according to local
media reports.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes to Extend Mandate of UNOMIG in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today proposed to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) for a period of six months
until January 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan said that the Government of Georgia and
the Abkahaz authorities had reaffirmed their commitment to
resolving the conflict by political means and expressed support
for a more active role for the United Nations in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said that the key issues of the Georgian
peace process, such as the future political status of Abkhazia and
the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, remained
unsolved.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Gali restricted weapons zone and in
particular, the security zone, had remained intense. Acts of
violence, including common crimes, continued to be a serious
problem. Most of the mine-related incidents were directed at the
CIS peacekeeping force, Abkahaz militia and the administration,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
In the light of progress in the political process and the
positive effects that UNOMIG continued to have in the situation,
Annan recommended that the Security Council extend the mandate
of UNOMIG in Georgia.

JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government will ask
for 775 million Rand (about 172 million US Dollar) from the
international donor community to implement a program to fight
poverty in the next five years, a senior Lesotho official said today.

<HEADLINE> African Health Conference Opens In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The biannual Social Science and
Health International Conference started here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 delegates from seven African countries are
attending the five-day conference with a theme of ''African
Health in the 21st Century''.
</P>
<P>
The conference seeks to bring together social scientists and
medical practitioners so they can find a holistic approach to health.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare
Minister Timothy Stamps urged African governments to implement efficient
mechanisms for identifying and assisting people with hereditary,
genetic and environmental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
He said such illnesses were difficult to modify and militated
against attempts to achieve the goal of good health for most
populations.
</P>
<P>
''In managing and mitigating their deprived or deficient
circumstances clearly, this requires more than dishing out fancy
pills or satisfying the ubiquitous passion for an injection,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Stamps also castigated the World Trade Organization for granting
private institutions patents to genes, including those of human
beings, which could be transferred to animals to produce additional
sources of organs like hearts and kidneys to be used in human
transplant operations.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Parties Split up Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's opposition now seems
deeply divided as some opposition leaders called today for
boycotting talks with President Daniel arap Moi, while some
others are to attend the talks expected tomorrow or the day
after.
</P>
<P>
At the core of the mounting schism within the opposition ranks
is believedly their discomfort at both Moi's tendency to choose
who to meet and who they can approve of as their representatives
at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Only after Moi "unequivocally" affirms acceptance of the
constitutional reforms before the forthcoming general
elections, the talks can be held, Kivutha Kibwana, chief of the
National Convention Executive Council (NCEC), urged at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
So far "there have been no wide consultations to ensure that
there is genuine, open and democratic dialogue," leaving the
expected talks nothing meaningful, said Kibwana.
</P>
<P>
NCEC, the umbrella body set up in April to coordinate the
opposition's campaign for constitutional reform, "has not been
invited" to take part in the talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he charged that the talks is Moi's cosmetic and public
relations exercise which " would only make the government " succeed
in emasculating the determination and will " of the opposition
which has advocated reforms for months.
</P>
<P>
"Piece-meal negotiations are unacceptable" and all talks
between Moi and the opposition on the issue should be held under
the auspices of the NCEC and within the institutional framework
the NCEC provides, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He announced the opposition will continue to hold rallies for
constitutional reform without seeking permits from the
authorities, including an already planned one in Mombasa
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the NCEC boycotting, the expected talks between Moi
and some prominent opposition leaders are surely to take place,
some local political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
However, it is yet to be known who have been chosen by Moi
from the opposition camp to participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 73, and in power for 19 years, in a sudden softening of
his hard stance, met opposition leader Kijana Wamalwa as well as
19 key religious leaders respectively last week.
</P>
<P>
The government now is drafting bills which will be presented in
two weeks to the current session of the parliament for enactment
of a commission to review the constitution and make proposals
for the repeal or amendment of laws charged as oppressive.
</P>
<P>
These laws include the Public Order Act on public rallies, the
Preservation of Public Security Act which allows detention
without trial, as well as other nine laws.
</P>
<P>
The government's shifts came days after the most violent
conflicts between the police and the opposition supporters, which
claimed 13 lives around the eastern African country on July 7.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President
Oomar Ali Juma today called upon the South African Business
community to invest in Tanzania saying the country has necessary
economic potentials yet to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
Opening the one-day trade seminar organized by the Ministry of
Industries and Trade in collaboration with South African High
Commission here, Juma told about 40 South African businessmen that
Tanzania had excellent business environment ranging from Natural
endowments to peace and national unity.

<P>
He said despite the natural endowments, the country's
geographical location was an asset to further transit trade with
landlocked neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said unlike many other countries,
Tanzania's problem was not lack of natural endowments, but rather
the means to tap the country's natural potential.
</P>
<P>
"Substantial financial resources combined with requisite human
skills and technology are required to exploit these potentials
into tangible projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma said that among the foreign investors in the country,
South Africa had comparative advantage taking into account its
technology, geographical proximity and the emerging in depth
knowledge among business communities.
</P>
<P>
He urged the South African businessmen to establish economic
projects between the two countries in the spirit of South-South
Commission.

JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat decided today to attend an EU Council of Ministers
meeting in Brussels amid speculations that he will meet Israeli
Foreing Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafa's information advisor Nabil Abu-Rodaineh
indicated that it is not clear whether the Palestinian leader
will hold talks with Levy there. Arafat and Levy were invited to

</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to call on the EU to step up its
involvement in the peace process to try to break the impasse in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Britain and Austria last week, Arafat
urged European leaders to use economic pressure against Israel
in order to reactivate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by EU peace envoy Miguel Moratinos, Levy and
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International cooperation
Nabil Shaath met in Jerusalem Sunday night. Moratinos said that
another step had been taken to get the peace process back on
track.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if President Arafat will be in Brussels there
will be a meeting (between Arafat and Levy)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Sunday that his primary objective in going to
Brussels is to attend the EU meeting, but would not object to a
meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"If Arafat happens to be there or not is not for me to
determine," he said, "If he is there and wants to hold a
meeting, why not? I do not anticipate, am not asking, and do not
invite."

<HEADLINE> Present Mir Crew not to Repair Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The present crew of the Mir orbital
station will not make a space walk, and the repair work which is
to be carried out by the present crew, will be done by Pavel
Vinogradov and Anatoli Solovyev in August.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency cited a source at the Mission Control
Center as saying on Monday, the flight of French astronaut Leopold
Eyhartz, scheduled for August 5, is likely to be put off.
</P>
<P>
This operation is opposed, above all, by Yuri Semenov, chief of
the Energia corporation, the firm which is the real owner of the
Mir station.
</P>
<P>
Semenov claimed that "the present crew made their utmost,
therefore they should not be trusted a space walkout." The
station's repairs should be made by Solovyev and Vinogradov who
are now industriously preparing for the flight at the Cosmonauts'
Training Center.
</P>
<P>
In Semenov's opinion, this would be an optimum version.
Besides, he suggests that periods of cosmonauts' return to earth
should be cut to September 12, instead of planned October 2 when
Tsibliev and Lazutkin were supposed to make their landing.
</P>
<P>
Semenov claimed that the crew and Mission Control who
overloaded the Progress M-34 cargo ship, are to blame for what
happened at the station, mostly for the puncture of the module.
The ferry developed another dynamics due to overload, which was
not taken into account either by crew commander Tsibliev or
Mission Control specialists.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the Gagarin Cosmonauts' Training Center
believes that Tsibliev is not to blame for the collision and that
the Mission Control Center should not pay to the Energia
corporation for the damage inflicted on the station, which Semenov
is striving for.
</P>
<P>
The American NASA agency now takes a wait-and-see attitude,
while the French space agency, it is said, agrees to delay the
flight of the French astronaut for some time in the future, and
will not demand 60 million U.S. dollars which are already paid to
the Russian Space Agency.

CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman has abandoned plans to supply natural gas to
Dubai, one of the seven sheikdoms of the United Arab Emirates
because of its limited gas reserves, Oman's oil minister said in
a press release which is available here today.
</P>
<P>
Said bin Ahmed al Shanfari said his country had considered to
provide Dubai with natural gas through a pipeline.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to do so," he said," but our limited reserves
have blocked this project."
</P>
<P>
Oman has earmarked the bulk of its gas resources for
liquefied natural gas ventures which it hopes will sharply boost
its income when it starts exports in 2000. Its small gas wealth
has also prompted it to drop an ambitious plan to supply India
with natural gas through an underwater pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Oman's gas reserves were estimated at around 750 billion
cubic meters at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A shipment of Egyptian medicine worth 5 million pounds
(1.47 million U.S. dollars) has been sent to Iraq, within the
framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program, the Egyptian Gazette
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Egyptian Holding Co. for Pharmaceuticals Galal
Gharib said in an announcement Sunday that he would hold a
meeting with an Iraqi trade and economic delegation currently
visiting Egypt to discuss Iraq's request to buy Egyptian
medicines and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Five thousand tonnes of Egyptian soap arrived in Iraq by
mid-July while 5,200 tons of Egyptian industrial detergents will
be expected in the Iraqi market in ten days.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has purchased 50 million dollars worth of food from Egypt
since the implementation of the U.N.-Iraqi deal.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Twenty to 40 percent of the shares of the Egyptian
Pharmaceutical Company will be offered for sale at the stock
market in September, the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Holding Company for Pharmaceuticals Galal
Gharib was quoted as saying the stake amounts to 700,000 to 1.4
million shares, 10 percent of which would be sold to the company's
workers.
</P>
<P>
There was a general direction to offer only 40 percent of the
shares of pharmaceutical companies for public subscription
because of the industry's social dimension in Egypt, he said.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) boosted spending
to a record high in 1996 as the government increased allocations
for subsidies, an official report showed today.
</P>

The total expenditure reached 19.6 billion U.S. dollars last
year, a more than 15 percent rise compared with 17 billion
dollars in 1995, said the latest report issued by the UAE Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Most of the spending increase that year went to allocations
for subsidies and government transfers abroad, which jumped to
about 4.7 billion dollars from 2 billion dollars in the previous
year, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
New jobs and promotions boosted allocations for salaries to
civil servants from 3.2 billion dollars in 1995 to 3.4 billion

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Report on Clinton-Yeltsin Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The White House today denied a
report that said U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin will meet in Moscow next March or April.
</P>
<P>
There has been no decision on the timing or venue of any 1998
summit meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin, said White House
spokesman Michael McCurry.
</P>
<P>
McCurry made the comments on a report by Russia's Itar-Tass
news agency that Yeltsin would host Clinton in Moscow at a summit
that would focus on energy.
</P>
<P>
But he added, "We have a summit with President Yeltsin every
year and look forward to having a summit with him at some time in
1998."
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Eight agreed in Denver to hold a ministerial
meeting on energy issues, which may be where the confusion stems
from, in Moscow in 1998, with the results to be discussed at the
next Summit of the Eight in Birmingham, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"I do anticipate that President Clinton and President Yeltsin
will meet in 1998, as you would expect them to meet, but we have
not set a place or a time for said meeting," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Separately, the president and President Yeltsin had a casual
discussion (in Denver) about a summit in 1998, but nothing has
been fixed," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin met last month on the sidelines of the
Denver G-7 summit. Their last formal summit meeting took place in
March in Helsinki, Finland.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Mining Giant to Tap Tanzania's Nickel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's mining
giant,the Anglo American Corporation, today signed an agreement
with a Canadian company, Sutton Resources Limited, for the
acquisition of a majority stake in a nickel and cobalt project
in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, signed in Dodoma, Tanzania and the
South African corporation will undertake a program of additional
exploration drilling at the Kabanga nickel-cobalt project in
north-western Tanzania, reported the local press.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study of the project will be completed in four
years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Robert Danchin, Chairman of
Anglo's new mining business division in Tanzania, said he was
optimistic that the program of exploration and drilling, expected
to be conducted over the next 18 months, would provide the
necessary basis for the establishment of a mine and treatment
facility at Kabanga.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the support given to the project by the
government of Tanzania and trust that masks the beginning of a
successful and mutually beneficial relationship," said Danchin.
</P>
<P>
Kabanga forms part of a belt of nickelferous mineralization
that stretches from the Ugandan border in the north to the shores
of Lake Tanganyika in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The total capital investment to establish a mine and
associated facilities at Kabanga is estimated at 135 million US
Dollar. Anglo hopes to bring the mine to production in the year

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia said today it
has banned the imports of beef from and through Belgium to
prevent possible flow of beef infected by the mad cow disease
into the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Saudi Ministry of Trade was quoted by the Saudi
Press Agency as saying that the decision was made after the
alleged implication of the two Belgian companies in illegal sale
of British beef which has been subject to worldwide export ban
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the ministry was cooperating with all the
concerned authorities to prevent any possible mad cow disease
infiltration into the country.
</P>
<P>
He asked importers in the kingdom to make sure of the source
of their products.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, an Islamic country with 18 million people,
imports large amounts of beef from various parts of the world
every year.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission had earlier decided to suspend the
operating licenses of the two Belgian companies specialized in
meat exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that more than 1,000 tonnes of British
beef had been illegally exported to the Netherlands, Egypt and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Russia announced last Friday a ban on beef imports
from Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks Closer Ties With EU, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
left here today for Brussels for a Western European Union (WEU)
meeting, with a mission to strengthen the fragile Turkey-EU ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Ankara Esenboga Airport before
departure, Cem indicated that at the meeting, Turkey will seek to
improve its ties with the EU through WEU, of which Turkey is an
associate member.
</P>
<P>
He said the WEU ministerial meeting would approve a declaration
which is expected to be added into the EU Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has actively participated in the preparation of the
draft declaration which "we consider as positive in respect of
strengthening our status in WEU," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cem said Turkey will benefit from the close WEU-EU cooperation
as some WEU sponsor nations, such as France and Germany, are also
leading EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Cem also said the current WEU policies towards its associate
members are conducive to developments for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey suffered a heavy blow when the European Commission
published a recommendation report recently excluding Turkey from
the ranks of prospective EU membership candidates.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of Cyprus into the candidate nations angered
Ankara even more due to the bitter experiences between Turkey
and island state, which maintains close ties with Greece, a
long-standing rival of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News said that the foreign minister will
also lodge Turkey's complaints over the membership to EU
officials in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
He will also explain Turkey's policies towards relations with
Athens to EU Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans Van Den
Broek, also former Dutch Foreign Secretary.
</P>
<P>
Though repeatedly stressing its "important relations with
Turkey", EU was reluctant to accept Turkey as a full member
state due to its human rights record, stance on the Cyprus
issue as well as its weak economy.

SARAJEVO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
and Chairman of the Bosnian Presidency Alija Izetbegovic will meet
on August 6 in the Croatian city of Split, it was announced today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by U.S. Ambassador to United Nations
Bill Richardson who was on a tour of the Balkan region during
which he had met both presidents.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled summit has been repeatedly delayed due to
differences on a number of issues between the two sides, such as
the Muslim-Croat joint police force in Hercegovina-Neretva canton
and the leasing of the Croatian harbor of Ploce by Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The first unit of the joint police force, which was regarded
the major obstacle to the summit, was scheduled to be in place in

<HEADLINE> Taylor's Suspected Assassin Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A business leader arrested seven weeks
ago for alleged assassination attempt at presidential candidate of
former warlord Charles Taylor has been set free.
</P>
<P>
Also released are some 32 persons arrested for attempting to commit
electoral malpractices during Saturday's landmark election in
war-ravaged Liberia, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The order for the release was given by Major-General Victor Malu,
commander of the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG which
is responsible for providing conducive security environment for the
election.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Mapison Wion, Managing Director of the
Forestry Development Authority of Liberia, has confessed his
involvement in the plot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taylor has voluntarily pardoned Woin and all those
involved in the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, conditions for Wion's release are based on the
fact that he has undertaken to desist from acts capable of undermining
peace in the country and also demonstrated in practical terms his
desire to reconcile with Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's presidential and parliamentary elections ended peacefully
on Saturday and is expected to bring final peace after seven years of
bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results from the country's Independent Elections
Commission show Taylor has won nearly 66 percent of the votes counted
so far.
</P>
<P>
The 219,754 votes already counted are collected from 684 of the
1,900 polling centers nationwide, including the capital Monrovia of
its environs.
</P>
<P>
Considering these areas are not the stronghold of Taylor, many
observers believe the National Patriotic Party candidate is now only
one step toward the top seat of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taylor's closest rival, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of the
Unity Party, has reportedly alleged that the Nigeria-led ECOMOG
interfereed with the vote, especially where voters did not understand
the election process.
</P>
<P>
Sirleaf has received 34,914 votes, or 15.887 percent of the total,
ranking second among all the 13 presidential candidates, who promised
before Saturday's election that they would accept whoever wins.
</P>
<P>
Poll counting is still proceeding under supervision of ECOMOG and
international observers. The final results are expected on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> German Money Supply Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's M-3 money supply has
settled down within the central bank's target range for the first
time this year, bolstering expectations that the central bank is
unlikely to raise interest rates to curb inflation in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
The M-3 measure of money supply grew by 6.4 percent in June
compared with the fourth quarter of 1996, well below the 7 percent
growth registered in May.
</P>
<P>
For 1997 as a whole, the German central bank has set a 3.5 to
6.5 percent corridor for the growth in M-3, which counts money
circulation, sight deposits, fixed deposits under four years and
savings deposits, an important barometer for the bank to measure
inflation and to make decisions on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, known as the Bundesbank, said a decline in
lending activities of both corporate and private borrowers was the
chief factor in June's slowdown in money supply growth. Borrowing
by the public sector was also weaker than in May.

<P>
ATHENS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece decided today to take new
measures to fight against the increasingly border crimes of
Albanians, Greece's Public Order Minister George Romeos said after
a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
The decision came following a series of recent illegal
activities of Albanian criminals in the northwest border area of
Florina and Kastoria, which included kidnappings of Greeks and
robberies.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government intended to increase the number of joint
army and police patrols on the border with Albania in a bid to
stop Albanian criminals from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
The policing measures would be increased inside Greece also to
crack down on the activities of foreign criminals, Romeos said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that
the main border crossing into Albania at Kakavia was operating
normally today after a few hours' closure Sunday night due to the
"special situation" stemming from the arrest of an alleged
Albanian drug lord.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze said here today that he had got positive response to
the idea of deploying a large multinational peacekeeping force for
his country.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, who visited Washington before coming to the
United Nations, made the remarks after briefing U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, members of the Security Council and
others concerned on the situation in Georgia, whose Abkhazia
region is under the control of separatists.
</P>
<P>
"At every meeting there has been expressed a positive attitude
towards the deployment of the multinational, large-scale
peacekeeping operation," Shevardnadze told reporters in the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, that will require the allocation of funds and there
will be some structural and organizational work. But this must
happen as soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
A 1,500-strong Russian-led peacekeeping force deployed by the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has been patrolling a
buffer zone between Georgia and the breakaway region of Abkhazia.
The mandate of the CIS troops expires on July 31 and Georgia has
said that they must leave if they do not agree to do more,
including policing a wider zone and helping ethnic Georgian
refugees to resettle.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a report to the Security
Council today, recommended extension of the mandate of just over
100 U.N. observers stationed in Georgia. The current Mandate of
the U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia expires on July 31.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Reports 38 percent Drop in 2nd-Quarter Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., the largest
long-distance operator of the U.S., said today that its profit
dropped 38 percent in the second quarter, despite a lightly
increase in revenues.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the drop was affected partly by the cost of
expanding into local phone and other markets and slow revenues
from its core long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
The company said it earned 959 million U.S. dollars in the
quarter ended June 30. That was down from 1.54 billion U.S.
dollars, in the year-ago period, excluding results from AT&AMP;T's
underwater cable unit, which it has since sold.
</P>
<P>
Revenues rose 2.4 percent to 13.17 billion U.S. dollars from
12.87 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from AT&AMP;T's core long-distance business grew only 1.5
percent to 11.582 billion U.S. dollars, dragged down by
competition for customers with price breaks and other promotions.
The slow growth came despite a 9.7 percent increase in calling
volume.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a federal appeals court threw out key parts of new
regulations aimed at opening the 100 billion U.S. dollar local
phone market to long-distance companies and other rivals. It
would provide some chances for the long-distance provider.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Fishermen End Blockade of U.S. Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadian fishermen have cleared the
way for an Alaskan ferry to leave the Canadian port of Prince
Rupert in British Columbia (B.C.) province, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
About 200 fishing-boats began to withdraw Monday night from the
three-day blockade within an hour of meeting federal Fisheries
Minister David Anderson.
</P>
<P>
Bob Rezansoff, a spokesman for the fishermen, said that they
have proved their point.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen "have a sense of accomplishment, of bringing the
issue to the attention of the public all over," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Anderson promised that he will ask his government to shoulder
some of the liability from B.C. fishermen who blockaded the ferry
in the B.C. port, some 1,500 kilometers northwest of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
A committee will also be formed to investigate possible
compensation for some of the poor B.C. fishing communities that
the blockaders were trying to help, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, nearly 400 fishing boats surrounded the Alaskan
ferry, preventing it from leaving the port.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen said the action was a protest against heavy
interception of Canada-bound salmon by Alaskan boats and Ottawa's
limited response.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the U.S. State Department called for an immediate
end to the blockade. It also hinted at retaliation against Canada
over the blockade.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing salmon war between Canada and the United States
started after the failure of negotiations in June over revisions
to the Pacific Salmon Treaty of 1985, which set salmon catches for
both countries.

ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners in the Afghan capital
of Kabul are preparing to evacuate as the factional fighting moves
closer to the city, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental organizations were asked to reduce their staff
starting Wednesday, the reports quoted an aid official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation by the Kabul NGO community, which numbers 120,
was in response to five jet raids on Kabul launched Sunday by the
forces opposing the Islamic Taliban militia, killing eight
civilians and injuring many others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a growing tide of civilians were fleeing towns north
of the Afghan capital as fierce battles raged between the Taliban
and rival forces, said another report.
</P>
<P>
Residents streaming south from the battle zone reported an
overnight attack by the fighters loyal to anti-Taliban strongman
Ahmad Masood on the town of Qarabagh, 50 kilometers (31 miles)
north of Kabul, it said.
</P>
<P>
The main road leading south from the frontline was lined with
at least 1,000 local villagers evacuating the battle zone carrying
whatever possessions they could manage in the summer heat, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Masood's forces on Sunday morning recaptured the strategic
Bagram airbase and Charikar, capital of Parwan province, about 50
km and 65 km respectively north of Kabul.

MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan's gross domestic
product dropped 29 percent in the first six months this year, and
the industrial output was down 35.2 percent, a report of the
Interfax news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the National Statistics Bureau as saying that
after a 14.7 percent decrease in the January-March period, the
industrial output plummeted by 59.5 percent in the April-June
period.
</P>
<P>
The statistics bureau attributed the sudden drop to
Turkmenistan's suspension of natural gas export in March, one of
the country's pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, last year's poor cotton output also caused a 79.3
percent drop in the country's cotton processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan's oil output in the first six months this year
increased 1.3 percent from the same period last year to 2.2
million tons, but the natural gas output fell 46 percent to 122
million cubic meters.

"We must cut and replace the apparatus of the Defense
Ministry ... It does not meet the demands of the present day,"
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He noted there were fervent opponents of the reform program
among high-ranking officers as well.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Kremlin unveiled a plan for military reform,
which aimed to turn the conscript-based forces into a leaner
professional war machine.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Russian troops will be cut by 500,000 to 1.2
million by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that after a meeting with Sergeyev on Monday,
President Yeltsin declared that the number of generals in Russia
will be cut down to 2,300, which means more than 500 top brass
will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The minister is convinced that a military reform shall be
launched immediately. But he did not rule out the possibility of a
collapse of the reform.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully determined to take advantage of this moment. In
order to preserve the Russian Armed Forces, it is necessary to
begin an immediate and deep reform... If I fail, I shall have to
go," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the success of reforms will depend on the support
of the army, especially the middle-ranking army servicemen.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Gives Third Party Chance to Influence Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair today
invited the Liberal Democrats to join a cabinet committee, giving
a chance for Britain's third party to influence the Labor
government's policy.
</P>
<P>
Less than three months after coming to power with a massive
179-seat majority in parliament, Blair reached an agreement with
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown on a new consultative
committee that will look initially into constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
An aide to Blair said that the cooperation was not the first
step towards a coalition government and that there was no
intention of appointing Liberal Democrats as ministers.
</P>
<P>
Establishing the committee of six senior ministers and five
Liberals, which will probably meet once a month, marked the prime
minister's desire to create a new politics in Britain by reaching
out to like-minded parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is the real beginning for a different style of politics
in Britain," Ashdown told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Conservatives said the agreement deprived
the Liberals of the right to be regarded as opponents of Blair.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials acknowledged that one of the aims of the
committee was to bind the Liberal Democrats closer to Labor in
case the ruling party ever needed their parliamentary support.
</P>
<P>
Top of the agenda for the committee will be issues such as the
devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and English regions, the
possible introduction of proportional representation for the House
of Commons, and reform of the House of Lords.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Faster Development in Inner Mongolia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 22 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua has
spoken highly of the economic achievements and historic changes
which have taken place in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in
the past 50 years since its founding.
</P>
<P>
At an economic work forum to mark the founding anniversary of
the region, China's first autonomous ethnic-minority region, he
congratulated the people of various ethnic groups, the Party and
government officials, the PLA men and officers, and the armed
police in Inner Mongolia, on behalf of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Zou particularly noted that the 18 years since the launching of
the reform and opening-up drive in 1978 had been the best period
for the region, which has recorded rapid economic development,
with the average annual economic growth rate hitting 9.7
percent. The region has quadrupled its GDP five years ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Inner Mongolia is enjoying prosperous economic
development, which has laid a solid basis for achieving
social stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
By 1996 the grain output in Inner Mongolia had totaled 13
billion kg, successfully achieving self-sufficiency in grain
supply. Its animal husbandry sector has achieved bumper harvests
for 12 consecutive years, with the number of animals head topping
60 million head.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the region increased the number of its larger animals
by 7.349 million head and produced 921,000 tons of pork, beef and
mutton, representing increases of 110 percent and 440 percent
respectively over the figures for 1980.
</P>
<P>
The region, which had virtually no industry before 1949, is now
a leading production base for energy resources and raw materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
The region had developed an annual coal production capacity of
80 million tons and electricity generating capacity of 32 billion
kwh by 1996.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1980, Inner Mongolia has increased its railway
mileage by an additional 1,400 km and highway mileage by 10,000
km. And its annual railway and highway passenger transport
volumes have more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the urban and rural telephone exchange capacity in
the region has been expanded from 130,000 to 1.3 million lines,
which has effectively enhanced the region's posts and
telecommunications capacity.
</P>
<P>
The target of the region's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and
the Development Program to the Year 2010 demands that the region
put into force five strategic measures involving the development
of resources, opening-up drive, science and education, skilled
personnel and famous-brand products. It urges that priority be
given to readjustment of the industrial structure, enhancement
of economic returns and tapping of markets.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed that Inner Mongolia should strive to
develop the market-oriented economy. It must not only probe into
its own markets, but also markets in the surrounding areas,
and even the national and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia should give full play to its
own advantages and steadily expand them, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the region to pay close attention to the application
of scientific research findings to practical work. He said that
leading officials at all levels should constantly upgrade their
scientific and technological knowledge, and work out preferential
policies in support of the development and popularization of
advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zou asked the autonomous region to take the path of
sustainable economic development and protect its mineral, forest,
water and grass resources in an even better way.

<HEADLINE> Oman to Open Office in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Oman decided today to open a
representation office in Gaza to show its support for the Middle
East peace process, the Omani news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Oman's Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued today that
the opening of the office is aimed at backing the Middle East
peace process which has been stalled since March due to Israel's
hardline settlement policies. It gave no further details of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Oman has repeatedly urged Israel to stop the construction of
thousands of houses in East Jerusalem which Palestinians want to
be their capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
Oman is the second Arab Gulf state to open an office in Gaza
after Qatar. Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia also have
representatives in Gaza, the seat of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Ambassador Salem Bin Fankhar al-
Shanfari has been appointed to head the office in Gaza, but no
date has been set for its opening.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the case with most Arab states, the PNA has no
diplomatic representation in Muscat, capital of Oman.

<HEADLINE> Fourth African African-American Summit Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A four-day fourth African
African-American summit started here today with a series of
workshops expected to contribute to policy formulation, economic
development and social activities that will help improve the
quality of life of Africans.
</P>
<P>
The workshops will discuss issues ranging from agriculture,
arts and culture, business and economic development,
communications and the media, education, health, peace, democracy
and governance, population and women's issues.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe is expected to officially
open the conference on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said more than 1,000 delegates including
at least 20 African heads of state and government confirmed their
participation at the summit. Most African leaders are expected
to arrive in Harare on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A number of American experts and businesspersons also attended
the summit set to encourage investment and aid to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Today, the communications and the media workshop examined the
impact of information on relations between Africa and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, chairman of the Inner City Broadcasting of
New York Pierre Sutton noted that the exchange of information
between Africa and the rest of the world was cumbersome,
expensive, often one-sided and generally not considered to be
newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian journalist Uche Ezechukwu commented that the impact
of the foreign press on Africa was quite pervasive.
</P>
<P>
He said African Americans should let their "brothers and
sisters" on the African continent give them positive views about
Africa and not through foreign-owned media.
</P>
<P>
The communications and media workshop aims to help create
viable African media outlets so that information between Africa
and the rest of the world could be transferred efficiently and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
At a workshop on women, the delegates called on African
governments to provide special guarantees for women as collateral
security when they borrow money for business projects from banks.
They also urged women entrepreneurs to improve their ability to
access credit through training.
</P>
<P>
The delegates hoped the summit would not be another talk shop.

MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Garry Kasparov, unofficial world
chess champion, said Tuesday that his match with Anatoly Karpov,
the World Chess Federation (FIDE) champion, may never take place
because Karpov's weak playing.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov was quoted as saying that "People who initially wanted
to give money for the match concluded that our duel would have no
sports intrigue. They think that the final result is slightly
predictable."
</P>
<P>
Kasparov became world champion in 1985 aged just 22, beating
his compatriot Karpov who had been the undisputed king of chess
for the previous 10 years.
</P>
<P>
But Karpov regained the title when FIDE sanctioned Kasparov for
setting up the breakaway Professional Chess Association in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Karpov-Kasparov match was designed to end their bitter
rivalry on the eve of the newly-designed world championships, due
to start in December with prize money totalling five million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Expects Cyprus' Rival Community Leaders to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are expected to meet very
soon here to discuss humanitarian issues, a U.N. official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Clerides,
U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel said the
U.N. expects that "the meeting between Clerides and Denktash will
go on."
</P>
<P>
He noted the two leaders are likely to meet "very soon" at his
residence here -- anytime before August 11, when the second round
of U.N.-led direct talks are scheduled to convene near Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The first round of direct talks between the leaders of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities took place at Troutbeck near
New York on July 9-12. During the talks, the two leaders decided
to have a meeting in Nicosia, under the U.N. auspices, to discuss
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether issues such as confidence building measures may
be discussed during the Nicosia meeting, Feissel said "it is for
them to decide what they want, but the focus is on humanitarian
matters."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official refrained from any comment on a joint
declaration issued Sunday by Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit and Denktash threatening the "partial integration" of the
Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus into Turkey, if the island joins
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which was rejected by the Greek Cypriot
side, outlines a series of steps toward partial economic and
financial integration, and partnership in the fields of security,
defense and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was worried that Denktash may refuse to attend the
second round of talks in Switzerland, Feissel said "as we had
announced in Troutbeck, the meeting arrangements remain to be
confirmed, but we look forward to having the meeting."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the
island nation as a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation through peace
talks, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

SHANGHAI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- An old US-made warship was
auctioned off here today for 2.01 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Zhangjiagang Hongchang Salvage Company Ltd, in east China's
Jiangsu Province, became the new owner of the ship after more than
30 rounds of fierce bidding.
</P>
<P>
The ship is 100.3 m long, and has a displacement of 3,900
tons. It was first given as a gift to the Kuomintang navy after
being built in the United States in 1942. It had been in the
possession of the People's Liberation Army since 1949, until it
was decommissioned two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The landing vessel was sold in 1995 to a Shenzhen company,
which, however, was unable to pay a Shanghai shipbuilder to turn
it into a multi-function yacht, though work on major structures
had already been completed.
</P>
<P>
So the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court entrusted a
local auctioneer to put the ship up for auction, after accepting a

BAGHDAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has presented to the
U.N. Security Council a new plan for the distribution of the
humanitarian goods to be bought under the renewed "oil-for-food"
deal.
</P>
<P>
Nazar Hamdoun, Iraqi ambassador to the U.N., submitted the plan
Monday, which had been agreed upon by the U.N. program coordinator
in Baghdad, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
But the INA report gave no details about the distribution
proposal.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the rotating president of the U.N. Security
Council for this month,
</P>
<P>
The INA report quoted Hamdoun as saying that only after the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ratifies the new plan, can his
country resume exporting oil.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, Iraq fulfilled its quota of oil export in
the first six months' period under the "oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the Security Council agreed to renew the
deal for another six months, under which Iraq is allowed to sell
oil to raise cash for the purchase of food and other daily
necessities badly needed in the sanctions-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under a harsh U.N.-imposed sanctions since
August, 1990 following its invasion of the oil-rich neighbor
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Fishermen Continue Blockade of U.S. Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian fishermen continued to
hold the U.S. ferry Malaspina captive at Prince Rupert, British
Columbia (B.C.), for a third day today despite a court injunction
calling for its release.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Fisheries Minister, David Anderson, has reportedly
arrived in this coast community in a bid to free the U.S. ferry.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen, frustrated by the lack of action of the federal
government, took the action themselves to protest the U.S. state
of Alaska's overfishing of Canadian-bound sockeye.
</P>
<P>
Though the Alaskan government obtained an injunction from a
Canadian federal court on Sunday ordering the end of the blockade,
there has been little effect.
</P>
<P>
And more Canadian fishing boats and pleasure boats are reported
to have joined the siege today.
</P>
<P>
Tension began to rise in Prince Rupert on Friday after the
United States admitted it had caught more than three times its
limit of sockeye that spawn in Canadian waters.
</P>
<P>
That night, dozens of Canadian fishing boats surrounded two
U.S. salmon vessels to prevent them from delivering their
catch. And one U.S. boat collided with a Canadian vessel.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, some 200 boats surrounded the Alaskan ferry
carrying about 300 passengers, preventing it from leaving port.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen said they wanted Anderson to restart the salmon
talks with the U.S. and allow northern B.C. fishermen to increase
their take of sockeye.
</P>
<P>
They also wanted transit fees imposed on all U.S. marine
traffic along the B.C.'s northern coast.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing salmon war between Canada and the United States
started after the failure of negotiations over revisions to the
Pacific Salmon Treaty of 1985, which set salmon catches for both
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Academic Conference of the
10th Anniversary of the World Federation of Acupuncture-
Moxibustion Societies (WFAS) is expected to be held here from
November 1 to 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference, which is sponsored by the WFAS and
the World Health Organization (WHO), and hosted by the Chinese
Acupuncture and Moxibustion Society, is "Acupuncture and
moxibustion in the new century," said Shen Zhixiang, director of
the Foreign Affairs Department of the State Administration of
Chinese Traditional Medicine and secretary-general of the
conference's preparatory committee.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the participants will review and summarize the
developments in the science of acupuncture and moxibustion in the
past decade, and discuss its new development trends in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 Chinese scholars and 500 experts from over 30
countries and regions have registered to attend the conference,
and some 700 papers have been received, he said.
</P>
<P>
The WFAS was founded in Beijing in November 1987. It held the
first academic conference the same year and another three
conferences of the same kind in France, Japan and the United States,
respectively, in the subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
The organization began to publish a magazine, named "World
Acupuncture and Moxibustion", in 1991. It has been distributed
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Britain Threatens to Impose Ban Over EU Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
threatened to ban beef imports from the rest of the European Union
(EU) if its EU partners refused to tighten their control on beef
processing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio this morning, British
Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham said he would call on his EU
counterparts at a meeting in Brussels later today to adopt the
same stringent health standards as Britain in their abattoirs.
</P>
<P>
"I shall lay orders in the House of Commons to ensure beef
imported to Britain must be subject to the same treatment and the
same rigorous safeguards for public health as our own beef in this
country, or it will not be allowed into the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham explained: "I'm on very strong grounds in European
policy terms and in safeguarding the health of the British people
to do exactly that, and that's what I will do."
</P>
<P>
The British Agriculture Minister noted Britain had raised
hygiene standards since the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British
beef exports in March 1996 after London admitted possible links
between the BSE, or mad cow disease, and its human equivalent
Creutzdfelt Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
The British government has repeatedly urged the rest of the EU
to emulate British abattoirs by removing and destroying the brain,
spinal cord, spleen and other parts of cattle most at risk of
carrying the BSE.

The Chinese people began to apply acupuncture in medical
treatment as early as 3,000 years ago, said Professor Deng
Liangyue, secretary-general of the WFAS.
</P>
<P>
Modern acupuncture skills include traditional needle
application and moxibustion techniques, as well as technological
methods such as electricity, magnetic influence, lasers,
ultra-violet rays and microwaves. These are all applied to
stimulate acupoints on the "meridians and collaterals" of the
human body, Deng explained.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture can be used to treat more than 300 kinds of
diseases, those involving pain and functional disorders in
particular, he noted. It can also improve the immunity and
adaptability of the body.
</P>
<P>
Working in co-operation with the WHO, China set up three
international acupuncture training centers in 1975 -- in Beijing,
Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively -- which train acupuncture
practitioners for countries all over the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the WHO published a list of 43 kinds of ailments which
can be treated with acupuncture and moxibustion.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are acupuncturists in more than 120 countries
and regions. Acupuncture research and education are also being
carried out in many countries, where it has become an important
part of medical treatment.

<HEADLINE> Building HK on Education One of SAR's Priorities: Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said today
that building Hong Kong on education is one of the priorities of
the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
"Education in Hong Kong should maintain its diversity and
incorporate the strength of the Chinese and Western cultures. It
should also improve students' understanding of Chinese culture and
history, thus encouraging them to care more for the future of our
country," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the week-long "Building
Hong Kong on Education" project here, Tung stressed the importance
 of drawing up a comprehensive plan and injecting sufficient
resources to improve the quality of education.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government would speed up the implementation of
full-day schooling to all primary schools and strengthen the
standard of language training and information technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also promote a balanced development on
"ethics, the intellect, the physique, social skills and
aesthetics", and enhance students' understanding of Hong Kong, the
 country and the world, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Tung also promised to raise the professional qualification of
teachers and updating tertiary education.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the young people of Hong Kong in the next century
would treasure traditional Chinese virtues and have a new mission
towards oneself, the family and the country. They should be able
to distinguish between right and wrong, care for the community and
keep up with the times.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, they need a wide range of knowledge, think
independently and have good communication skills, he said.
</P>
<P>
The "Building Hong Kong on Education" project featured an
exhibition, an international conference on "Language, Education
and Culture", a gala week and a series of school and community
building activities.
</P>
<P>
The project is jointly organized by the Home Affairs Department
and Lingnan College with the assistance of seven other University
Grants Committee-funded tertiary institutions to celebrate the
Hong Kong's return to China.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Glacial Lake Causes Panic in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Will it burst or not? That's the
question. It is simply because the Tsho-Rolpa glacial lake in the
Himalayas has not only caused panic in the flood-prone areas, but
also arrested the attention of the whole of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The drama unfolded when studies revealed in mid-June that the
glacial lake, situated 4,580-meter high in the Rolwaling Valley
about 80 kilometers east of here, has expanded from 1.37 sq.m. to
1.65 sq.m. and might burst this summer.
</P>
<P>
The studies further showed that the melting process of the
lake, detected in 1996, has sped up along its northwestern side,
and its water volume has reached 80 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Some experts warned that if the lake bursts, 40 million cubic
meters of water will gush out and affect 18 villages along the
Rolwaling River banks, including the Khimti Hydro-electricity
Project.
</P>
<P>
Being the most extensively studied glacial lake in the
Himalayas, the 3 kilometer-long and half a kilometer-wide
Tsho-Rolpa saw a minor burst of its neighboring Tshubing glacial
lake in July 1991.
</P>
<P>
That Tsho-Rolpa might also burst one day has been warned of
every now and then in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the renewed warning has caused panic immediately
among the locals who are in a constant state of trepidation.
</P>
<P>
They fear that water from such a burst would flood a wide area
and inflict serious damages, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
As the monsoon season has set in, the fear has intensified.
</P>
<P>
The fear is so widespread that Tsho-Rolpa has become the
foremost topic in household conversations, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the disaster, some have moved to safer
regions while some just stay out of their houses at night.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who were compelled to harvest the maize crop before it
was ripe are just looking on helplessly with their fields
remaining barren and the cultivation season already past, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Aakashe Airport had to be closed for 20 days for fear of a
sudden outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Daily necessities become more expensive in the flood-prone
areas while incidents of theft and smuggling have also been on the
rise, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has taken preventive steps to allay the
fear.
</P>
<P>
The Tsho-Rolpa Disaster Control and Management Committee under
the Home Ministry has been established, and a set of measures have
been taken including the evacuation of residents.
</P>
<P>
An alarm system is now in place and it can alert at-risk
communities within 5-7 minutes in the event of an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, 10 police and army posts have been set up in
Dolakha and Ramechhap, the two districts expected to bear the
brunt of a burst.
</P>
<P>
If a burst happens, observers from an army base camp in Na, the
village immediately adjacent to the lake, will instantly alert
personnel at the Home Ministry via satellite phones. These
personnel will then send messages to the 10 police and army posts,
which will set off the sirens to alert the surrounding communities
to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the water volume of the lake, one complete siphon has
been installed. An older one set up earlier by a Dutch team has
been reactivated.
</P>
<P>
Together, the two siphons are capable of mitigating water from
the lake at a rate of about 420 liters per second. Once another
four are installed as planned, the rate will be up to 900 liters
per second, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to install a total of 32 siphons in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
While it is impossible to predict exactly whether and when the
lake may burst, some experts argued that the intensity of the risk
has been exaggerated by the media.
</P>
<P>
These experts said fears gripping government officials and
locals are turning out to be unfounded, because the lake has so
far shown no definitive signs of breaking this monsoon.
</P>
<P>
Even if it does, the burst will occur in stages rather than at
one go, and most of its fury will have dissipated before the
onrushing waters reach populated areas, they said.
</P>
<P>
Yet it is undisputable that the lake is a risk site for a
glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), and natural disasters are
usually unpredictable not only in terms of the exact time of
occurrence but also in terms of the damage they could inflict.
These more than anything else call for preparedness, some experts
warned.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Faster Development in Inner Mongolia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua has spoken
highly of the economic achievements and historic changes which
have taken place in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the
past 50 years since its founding.
</P>
<P>
At an economic work forum to mark the founding anniversary of
the region, China's first autonomous ethnic-minority region, he
congratulated the people of various ethnic groups, the Party and
government officials, the PLA men and officers, and the armed
police in Inner Mongolia, on behalf of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Zou particularly noted that the 18 years since the launching of
the reform and opening-up drive in 1978 had been the best period
for the region, which has recorded rapid economic development,
with the average annual economic growth rate hitting 9.7
percent. The region has quadrupled its GDP five years ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Inner Mongolia is enjoying prosperous economic
development, which has laid a solid basis for achieving
social stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
By 1996 the grain output in Inner Mongolia had totaled 13
billion kg, successfully achieving self-sufficiency in grain
supply. Its animal husbandry sector has achieved bumper harvests
for 12 consecutive years, with the number of animals head topping
60 million head.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the region increased the number of its larger animals
by 7.349 million head and produced 921,000 tons of pork, beef and
mutton, representing increases of 110 percent and 440 percent
respectively over the figures for 1980.
</P>
<P>
The region, which had virtually no industry before 1949, is now
a leading production base for energy resources and raw materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
The region had developed an annual coal production capacity of
80 million tons and electricity generating capacity of 32 billion
kwh by 1996.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1980, Inner Mongolia has increased its railway
mileage by an additional 1,400 km and highway mileage by 10,000
km. And its annual railway and highway passenger transport
volumes have more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the urban and rural telephone exchange capacity in
the region has been expanded from 130,000 to 1.3 million lines,
which has effectively enhanced the region's posts and
telecommunications capacity.
</P>
<P>
The target of the region's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and
the Development Program to the Year 2010 demands that the region
put into force five strategic measures involving the development
of resources, opening-up drive, science and education, skilled
personnel and famous-brand products. It urges that priority be
given to readjustment of the industrial structure, enhancement
of economic returns and tapping of markets.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed that Inner Mongolia should strive to
develop the market-oriented economy. It must not only probe into
its own markets, but also markets in the surrounding areas,
and even the national and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia should give full play to its
own advantages and steadily expand them, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the region to pay close attention to the application
of scientific research findings to practical work. He said that
leading officials at all levels should constantly upgrade their
scientific and technological knowledge, and work out preferential
policies in support of the development and popularization of
advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zou asked the autonomous region to take the path of
sustainable economic development and protect its mineral, forest,
water and grass resources in an even better way.

<HEADLINE> Suffocating Weather Afflicts Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijingers are suffering from hot
weather again after a heavy rainfall over the weekend, and they
complain that walking in the street is like "taking a sauna".
</P>
<P>
Afternoon data from the Beijing Meteorological Observatory
shows that the highest temperature in the urban area today again
exceeded 35 degrees centigrade, and the figure in Tiananmen Square
reached 37.
</P>
<P>
The relative humidity today reached 62 percent, much higher
than the average for this season, which is about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the hot and suffocating weather will see
little change in the coming few days. "The recent wet and hot
airflow from the south will make Beijingers feel like they are
living in the south," said Ding Deping, deputy director of the
Beijing Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
From July 8 to 15 Beijing experienced an eight-day heat wave,
with the highest daily temperature exceeding 35 degrees
centigrade; in some areas the figure even reached 39.5, rarely
seen in the past half a century.
</P>
<P>
Some local factories, shortly after returning to their normal
working hours, permitted their workers to go off duty two hours
early again today.
</P>
<P>
As power consumption by household air-conditioners is reaching
an unprecedented high, the Beijing Municipal Power Supply Bureau
has released a notice asking a number of dance halls to stop using
air-conditioners -- as a way to strike balance.
</P>
<P>
However, the bad weather is welcome to air-conditioner sellers,
for they are embracing a big boom of business. Purchasers have to
wait for about ten days for installation.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, some leading air-conditioner
manufacturers have stopped supplies to small shops in order to
cope with big department stores or shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Some cities in northwestern China, including Xi'an and Lanzhou,
are also reporting a second heat wave. Today, the highest
temperature in Lanzhou reached 38 degrees centigrade. The city
used to be a summer resort for people running away from summer
heat elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on Taiwan's "Representation" in UN (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan, as a part of China, is not
entitled whatsoever to join the United Nations (UN), a Chinese
Foreign Ministry Spokesman said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Tang Guoqiang noted that Nicaragua and a small number of other
countries recently sent a letter to the UN Secretary General,
proposing the issue of Taiwan's so-called "representation" in the
United Nations, in a vain attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" in the UN.
</P>
<P>
Doing so has willfully trampled upon the UN Charter and its
general purpose and principles and is a gross interference in
China's internal affairs, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemn this action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang went on to say that the United Nations is an international
inter-government organization composed of sovereign states, and
that only sovereign states can become its members. There is only
one China in the world and that is the People's Republic of China,
he said. Taiwan, as part of China, is not entitled to join the UN
in any form.
</P>
<P>
On October 25, 1971, the 26th UN General Assembly adopted
resolution No. 2758 by an overwhelming majority, a decision which
had far-reaching significance, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
The resolution decided to restore all legitimate rights of the
People's Republic of China in the United Nations and expel the
representatives of the Taiwan authorities from the seats they had
unlawfully occupied in the UN and from all its subsidiary bodies,
so that the issue of China's representation in the UN was settled
fairly and thoroughly, he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was a triumph of justice and legal principles
and reflects the general purpose and principles of the UN
Charter. It also thwarted an attempt by a small number of
countries to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."

<P>
Today the Taiwan authorities, in opposition of the historical
trend, have gone so far as to buy off a small number of countries
to reverse resolution No. 2758, Tang continued, noting that such
moves openly despise the will of most of the UN member nations and
challenges the general purpose and principles of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
But the tricks of the Taiwan authorities are doomed to fail,
Tang noted, saying that this has exposed the Taiwan authorities'
stubborness in clinging to the stance of separating the motherland,
which will be firmly opposed by all Chinese people, including
the compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" is the
basic guideline to be followed by the Chinese government to settle
the Taiwan issue, Tang said, noting that on July 1 this year the
Chinese government successfully resolved the issue of Hong Kong in
accordance with the concept of "one country, two systems." This
heralded a major step China has taken on the way to the
accomplishment of the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Macao will also return to the motherland, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the issue of Taiwan will eventually be
settled properly in accordance with the guideline of 'Peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems'," Tang said, adding
that the reunification of the motherland is the fundamental
guarantee for the interests of the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
With the accomplishment of the motherland's peaceful
reunification, the Taiwan compatriots, together with the rest of
the Chinese people from all ethnic groups, will enjoy fully the
dignity and glory of the motherland internationally, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Moves to Self-Support in Grain Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Landlocked Shanxi Province in
north China has increased its grain production by 216 million kg
this summer, in a major step towards self-support in grain supply.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, there has been a sharp
contradiction between grain supply and demand in the province,
which used to buy an annual 700 million kg of grain from other
provinces. Its average annual per capita ownership of grain stands
at a mere 300 kg, lower than the national average.
</P>
<P>
To be self-sufficient in grain supply the province has launched
a massive campaign since 1996 to increase grain production.
</P>
<P>
It has earmarked special funds for the upgrading of farming
technologies and improvement of agricultural production
conditions, with priority given to nearly 30 counties, covering a
total area of 1.5 million ha, or 28 percent of the province's
total arable land.
</P>
<P>
Since the enforcement of a series of grain-boosting measures,
the province has improved nearly 11,000 ha of irrigated farmland
and popularized more than 10 up-to-date farming
technologies. Meanwhile, the mechanization of agriculture has been
greatly enhanced.

<HEADLINE> New PNG PM Promises Inquiry Into Alleged Corrupt Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's (PNG) new
Prime Minister Bill Skate today moved to rid his government of
corruption, promising to set up an inquiry to look at a number of
alleged corrupt deals involving the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Skate was elected prime minister today after defeating former
prime minister Sir Michael Somare by a vote of 71 to 35 in an open
ballot in the South Pacific nation's new 109-seat parliament, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
"I've been a strong advocate of anti-corruption," the
44-year-old prime minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he preempted it by saying many PNG leaders had been
brought undone by unsubstantiated allegations.
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many accusations, (but) there is no proof
and at the moment we have been accusing leaders and destroying
them," Skate told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Skate defeated Somare with the support of the country's four
major parties, including the previous ruling coalition of the
People's Progress Party (PPP) and Pangu Party.
</P>
<P>
Until the unlikely alliance was formed late Monday Somare and
Skate had the numbers to form a new government divorced from the
old regime.
</P>
<P>
Skate's tough stance against the 35 million US dollar contract
to use mercenaries to end Bougainville's separatist rebellion is
understood to have won his support from a block of independents in
his bid for the prime ministership.
</P>
<P>
Skate, who was an adviser to the former government of Paias
Wingti prior to winning the National Capital District seat of Port
Moresby in 1992, launched an unsuccessful no-confidence vote
against then prime minister Julius Chan in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
He formerly held a number of important public positions after
obtaining an accountancy degree from the University of Technology
in the city of Lae.
</P>
<P>
Australia, from which PNG gained independence in 1975, today
welcomed Papua New Guinea's new government.
</P>
<P>
Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said he wished
Skate well in meeting the many challenges the new leader faces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced
that he would visit PNG soon for talks with Skate.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Overseas bank branches here say
that their months-old Renminbi business is going well.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has given
approval to nine branches of overseas banks in Shanghai to deal in
yuan-based business on a trial basis in the city's Pudong New
Area, an emerging trade and financial zone.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials say that six of the nine licensed overseas banks
have already started Renminbi business, including the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Mitsubishi Bank, the Industrial
Bank of Japan, the Sanwa Bank, the Daiichi Kangyo Bank, and
Citibank of the US.
</P>
<P>
However, some seven other overseas banks have set up branches
in Pudong in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of the central bank, all overseas banks
hoping to do Renminbi business have to move their headquarters in
China to the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Bank and Citibank were the first to move to Pudong
in order to do Renminbi business last year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Shanghai branch of the Mitsubishi Bank has opened
150 Renminbi accounts for local enterprises, according to bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials say that the overseas banks are enhancing their
cooperation with local Chinese banks to increase their sources of
Renminbi.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- World football ruling body FIFA
general secretary Sepp Blatter is confident of an agreement
between Barcelona and Inter Milan on Brazilian international
striker Ronaldo's transfer.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said on Tuesday that the only problem was the amount of
the transfer fee. Ronaldo has paid 27.5 million U.S. dollars to
make him a free agent.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona vice-president Joan Gaspart announced an extra 17
million U.S. dollars to acknowledge the expiry of Ronaldo's
contract which should not come to an end until 2004.
</P>
<P>
However, Inter Milan announed on Tuesday that the club would
not pay a cent more than the world record 27.5 million dollar
transfer fee demanded by Ronaldo's transfer clause.
</P>
<P>
The dispute on the transfer fee forced FIFA to postpone the
scheduled talk on Tuesday between the two clubs to next week. The
decision was made on Monday at Zurich, Switzerland.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China has enjoyed a smooth financial
performance in the first half of this year, through keeping to a
moderately tight money policy, further adjusting the credit
structure and flexibly wielding financial instruments.
</P>
<P>
"Relatively good outcome was seen in controlling the macro
economy, furthering financial supervision, preventing financial
risks and thereby supporting economic growth," according to a
financial report by the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The money supply maintained a balance during the period. The
growth of broad money supply, at 19.1 percent, slowed by 6.2
percentage points compared to last year, indicating a further
lessening of inflationary pressure. The supply of narrow money, on
the other hand, saw a faster growth during the period, a sign that
the financial strain the enterprises have been suffering was eased
to some extent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Cash in circulation, though maintaining relatively higher
growth than reasonable due to the overheated stock market and
bumper harvests last year, had little impact on the market and
reported normal circulation.
</P>
<P>
Deposits with the banks rose to 7.545 trillion yuan at the end
of June, up 19.8 percent over the beginning of this year. The
total amount broke down into 2.567 trillion yuan in enterprise
deposits and 4.277 trillion yuan in individual savings deposits,
up 27.5 percent and 19.7 percent during the period, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The rise in bank deposits has resulted in more credit funds for
economic development. The industrial sector received 79.8 billion
yuan more in loans, while the loans to the agricultural sector
increased by 44.71 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Renminbi yuan remained stable, while the foreign exchange
reserve continued to climb to 120.94 billion US dollars-worth, up
18.63 billion US dollars from last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also called for further adjustment in the
credit mix to improve the economic structure, while stepping up
financial supervision to reduce and prevent financial risks, and
tightening control over cash to ensure effective recall of money
and a stable yuan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Disarmament Conference Opens in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.N.-sponsored disarmament
conference, aiming at seeking ways to end the current arms-cut
stalemate, today opened in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo,
said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference is expected to focus as much on control
of small arms and regional security issues as on its traditional
topic of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was a departure from the annual meeting's past
emphasis on nuclear testing and the prevention of the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Japanese State Foreign
Secretary Masahiko Komura, the No. 2 man in the Foreign Ministry,
said that there is a need to tackle conventional weapons,
including small arms, as part of the international disarmament
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"After all, it is conventional weapons that are actually
causing heavy casualties in regional conflicts and civil wars in
various parts of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Komura urged controls on anti-personnel mines,
which he said "have killed and maimed many civilians, posing not
only a grave humanitarian concern, but also a large obstacle to
post-conflict efforts for reconstruction and development."
</P>
<P>
The conference, which has been held annually in Japan since
1989, is being attended by 79 diplomats, academics, government
officials and other experts from 32 countries.
</P>
<P>
While the first session still focused on nuclear disarmament,
three other sessions and working group meetings will tackle issues
including the prevention of the proliferation of small arms, roles
of regional security groups and maritime arms control.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Raps US for Flagging Peace Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat today rapped the United States for its
diminishing input into the Mideast peace process and urged
unswerving aid to the Palestinian people, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious that the U.S. administration has become more
occupied with other matters rather than the Mideast situation and
the peace accords...," Arafat told reporters after a meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's Mediterranean city of
Alexandria this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader regretted that U.S. President Bill
Clinton has not done his part with a somewhat "unclear stand" in
the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
"In his capacity as one of the peace co-sponsors, (Clinton)
personally witnessed the signing of the peace accords which became
international. Hence, there is an American morale and political
responsibility regarding such agreements," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been blasted for its increasingly negative
attitude to the peace march and conniving in Israel's settlement
policy. In addition, a recent U.S. Congress resolution that
allocates funds to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem also drew strong opposition from the international
community and Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he knew nothing of any Israeli initiative to
promote the peace march, brushing aside the so-called "bridging
ideas" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday
Tel Aviv is working on jointly with Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat referred to the sufferings of the Palestinian people in
the West Bank cities of Hebron, Bethlehem, Rafah, Nablus and
Khan Yunis due to Israel's hardline measures.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions are now worsening than any other time," he said.
Israel has imposed embargoes upon the cities under Palestinian
control to prevent the spread of escalating violence into Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Peace, however, is not in the interests of the Palestinians
only, but it is in the interests of Israel, the U.S., and Russia
as well," he said before leaving for Brussels, Belgium, to attend
a meeting of foreign ministers of the European Union (EU) and
hold talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the reported French initiative to push the peace
march forward, Arafat said he is unware of such an initiative,
but there are European attempts supplementary to the Egyptian
ones to salvage the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians welcome the European role in spite of the
Israeli rejection of any European endeavors so far," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU have stepped in as the major mediators
between the PNA and Israel as the U.S. efforts slacked off in the
the past four months.
</P>
<P>
Regarding his talks with Mubarak, the PNA president said they
evaluated efforts exerted and meetings held recently to
revitalize the peace process paralyzed in March by Israel's
building of thousands of Jewish homes in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mubarak meeting, following up Egyptian efforts to
push forward the Mideast peace process, was "more than positive
and important," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting will be followed up by an enlarged
Egyptian-Palestinian meeting in Cairo Sunday to evaluate the
present situation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to host a tripartite summit among Mubarak,
Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace march has been deadlocked for
four months, with violence raging in both the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, refused to
give a temporary halt to the settlement expansion, a prerequisite
the Palestinians insist on for the resumption of
Israeli-Palestinian talks.

<HEADLINE> East, North Europe Potential Partners: Chemical Industry Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Enormous cooperative potential
exists in the chemical industry between China and the eastern and
northern European countries, according to Minister Gu Xiulian.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, minister of the Chemical Industry, made the remark
in an interview with Xinhua, just prior to her visit to Russia,
Poland and Finland.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that her visit will play an important role in
opening China's chemical industry wider to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
She added that she will introduce the developments scored by
China's chemical industry and the goals of China's Ninth Five-Year
Plan to those countries, and help promote mutual exchanges and
economic, trade, and technological cooperation with them in the
chemical industry, so as to spur the export of China's chemical
industrial technology and products.
</P>
<P>
"The three countries I will visit have their own advantages in
the chemical industry and have been cooperating with China for
years and have forged good cooperation relations with China," she
said, adding that there are bright prospects for cooperation
between China and the three countries.
</P>
<P>
She said that the chemical and petrochemical industries of
Russia have a solid foundation, as Russia leads the world in the
production of methanol, synthetic ammonia and chemical fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
China has already carried out cooperation in some chemical
industrial projects with Russia in Yunnan Province, Gu said. She
noted that the two sides will discuss problems cropping up in the
course of undertaking the cooperation projects during her visit to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides will discuss the introduction of technology,
equipment and funds during my visits to Poland and Finland," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The total trade volume of China's chemical industry reached
31.7 billion US dollars in 1996, with exports amounting to 12.4
billion US dollars and imports, 19.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that China will expand large-scale and in-depth
technological, economic and trade cooperation with the countries
she is about to visit, in line with the principle of mutual
benefit and common development.
</P>
<P>
She said she is convinced that China's cooperation with eastern
and northern European countries in the chemical industry will
enter into a new phase through better mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
She will make a 17-day tour of the three countries from July 23
at the invitation of the Russian Ministry of the Economy, the
Polish Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Trade and
Industry of Finland.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Outgoing President Vows to Remain Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian outgoing President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani vowed here today to remain a soldier of the
Islamic Revolution for the years to come.
</P>
<P>
"I will work for the revolution under the guidance of the
Supreme Leader of the revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,"
Rafsanjani said at his farewell ceremony to Parliament honoring
his eight years of presidency.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who also served as parliament speaker between 1980
and 1989, thanked the Parliament for its cooperation with his
government.
</P>
<P>
"The Parliament modified only two or three percent of our
programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of our government's goals which were called too
ambitious by experts have been achieved because of this
cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this cooperation would continue during the
administration of His Excellency Mr. Khatami (the
president-elect). We hope that we can achieve the revolution's
goals despite a sea of mischiefs," the 64-year-old president said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's President-Elect Mohammad Khatami won a landslide
victory over his arch rival Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq
Nouri on the May 23 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who took office in 1989 after the end of Iran's
war with Iraq (1980-88), could not take part in the elections
because the constitution does not allow him to run for a third
consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
"When I took over, Iran had a 16 percent unemployment. Now we
have reduced unemployment to 9.1 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to worry about. Inflation is gradually
reducing, production has increased, and the distribution network
has been organized," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for his government's record on the developments of culture
and education, Rafsanjani attacked domestic and international
criticism of the reduction of the quality of cultural activities
and education in Iran.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the ceremony, Rafsanjani was awarded a letter
of commendation signed by the parliamentary deputies.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, foreign ambassadors, representatives of the
international organizations and government organizations attended
the farewell ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Condemns Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- South Mogadishu faction leader
today condemned the ongoing Ethiopian intervention in some parts
of Somali's southwestern region of Gedo.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of Prophet Mohamed's birthday, Hussein Aidid
called on Ethiopia to peacefully pull out its forces from Somali
soil before Somalis take up aggressive measures in defending
their country.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia should not start problems they will not be able to
find solutions for", he said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid blamed Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi for
perpetrating the intervention into Somalia by his forces.
</P>
<P>
The Somalis can no longer tolerate the continuing provocation
of Ethiopia, he said, adding "I would like to remind Meles Zenawi
of the history and that the Somalis have the muscle to defend
their prestige and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
"Let them look before they leap," said the 34-year-old
president of the self-proclaimed government established by late
warlord, general Aidid.
</P>
<P>
In another strong tone against the Ethiopian involvement in
Somalia, Hussein Aidid has castigated the recent meeting by the
Sodare factions and characterized the Ethiopian-sponsored
conference for 27 Somali factions as a sign of dividing the
country's unity.
</P>
<P>
The president called all Somalis including the religious
groups to be ready for defending their country.
</P>
<P>
On his recent meeting in Cairo with Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Hussein
Aidid said they discussed about the general reconciliation
efforts in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"We never spoke about anything related to Sodare or my future
participation in it," he added.

<HEADLINE> Inland Publishing Houses Active at Hong Kong Book Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 7,000 kinds of books
rolled out by the Chinese inland publishing houses will be
exhibited at the upcoming Eighth Hong Kong Book Fair, scheduled
for July 23 to 28.
</P>
<P>
"To be held in Hong Kong less than one month after the historic
handover, this important get-together of the publishing community
is of great significance," said Yang Deyan, who headed a
155-member inland delegation for the six-day event.
</P>
<P>
Yang, director general of the 100-year-old Commercial Press,
told a news briefing here today that nearly 200 inland publishing
houses would bring to the fair about 20,000 copies of books,
ranging from social and natural science to literature, arts,
culture and education.
</P>
<P>
Out of 7,000-odd kinds of books, 89 have been picked up as
creme de la creme and will be displayed in a pool, including "Deng
Xiaoping: the Great Man of the Century", "Modern Chinese
Dictionary" and "A Comprehensive Collection of Lu Xun".
</P>
<P>
Wu Jiangjiang, president of the China National Publishing
Industry Trading Corporation, expected that the cooperation
between Hong Kong and inland publishing houses would be
strengthened after the handover. "As you will see, they will join
hands to promote books at this year's fair," he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 20,000 books are introduced to Hong Kong from the
inland areas each year, according to Wu, whose company is engaged
in foreign trade of books in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a Chinese official with the Press and Publication
Administration, there are over 500 publishing houses in the
Chinese inland areas, which in 1996 alone published more than
112,800 kinds of books, roughly 300 kinds of books a day. Books
printed in the year reached 7.158 billion copies, breaking the
hurdle of seven billion for the first time in the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the book
fair is the biggest of its kind in Asia. This year it is likely to
attract about 400 exhibitors, who will display their books in more
than 800 booths.

PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Motor racing's ruling body
international automobile federation (FIA) turned down Portuguese
hopes to hold an extra stage of formula one world championship
Grand Prix in November at Estoril, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
FIA insisted that the season would end as planned with the
European Grand Prix on October 26 at Jerez, Spain. But Estoril
would be considered for the 1998 season if the Portuguese made
more repairs and a commerical agreement, said FIA on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The final race of the season was moved from Estoril to Jerez
because FIA was not sure whether extensive repairs would be
carried out in time.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong PLC Operates Successfully, Paper Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) has been operating successfully since its inception last
December, the Ta Kung Pao newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
It noted in a commentary that the legislature has made
remarkable achievements during the seven-month period by blocking
or passing a number of bills.
</P>
<P>
Before the handover, the PLC examined and approved 13 bills
indispensable to the HKSAR in the beginning of its establishment,
and adopted three other important motions, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
At its first meeting after the establishment of the HKSAR in
the small hours of July 1, the PLC passed the Reunification Bill,
confirming the 13 bills which had been passed by the legislature
prior to July 1 and dealing with various transition-related
matters.
</P>
<P>
The Reunification Bill also endorsed the appointment of the
justices of the Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the
High Court, Ta Kung Pao said.
</P>
<P>
On July 9, the provisional legislature pushed through an
immigration bill, or the Immigration (Amendment) No.5 Bill, in all
three readings. Under the bill, a certificate of entitlement
scheme is introduced for children born to Hong Kong permanent
residents in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
These children are entitled to the right of abode in Hong Kong,
according to the Basic Law, but they must come in a legal and
orderly way.
</P>
<P>
The 60-member PLC endorsed a motion from the HKSAR government
on July 16 to suspend the operation of three labor-related
ordinances adopted by the pre-handover Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
After more than seven hours of lengthy debate, most legislators
were convinced that these laws had been adopted without careful
study of their impact and would harm the long-term interests of
Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The previous Legislative Council rushed through these
ordinances proposed by radical unionists without making
consultations in its last legislative sitting four days before the
handover, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The daily stressed that the PLC has been playing a good role
since its establishment.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a legal vacuum immediately after the handover, the PLC
was elected in the southern China city of Shenzhen on December 21,
1996 by a 400-member Selection Committee, which was also
responsible for the selection of the first Chief Executive of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The provisional legislature will stop functioning when the
first Legislative Council of the HKSAR is established, not later
than June 30, 1998, under a decision made by the Preparatory
Committee for the HKSAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military would
continue to fight Muslim rebels who engage in criminal activities
despite the signing of a general ceasefire agreement, Chief of
Staff of the Armed Forces Arnulfo Acedera said today.
</P>
<P>
Criminal activities such as kidnapping, harassment and
hijacking are "hostile acts", Acedera said.
</P>
<P>
The truce deal, signed by the government and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), took effect on July 21.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, the military was willing to pull out
its troops based in various MILF camps captured by the military as
soon as peace and order returns to Central Mindanao, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the military was waiting for whatever
decision is reached by the peace panels of the government and the
MILF, which are expected to meet on July 30 to set guidelines for
the implementation of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"If the government troops in the said areas are not needed
anymore, they will be recalled and reassigned to other areas," he
said, adding that there is no need for additional troops to be
sent to Mindanao and the repositioning of troops.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a 12,000-member separatist group which has been
fighting government troops in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> India Develops Freon Substitute for Refrigerators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- India has developed a chemical
which can be used as substitute for freon in air conditioners and
refrigerators but will not destroy the earth's ozone shield, Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The chemical called HFC-134a will replace currently used
freon-12 gas, which is blamed for breaking up the ozone layer that
protects humankind from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
Under a United Nations convention on climate change to which
India is a party, all nations are expected to switch over to
ozone-friendly refrigerators by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
There are only five companies in the world that have the
know-how to make the freon substitute and the technology can be
purchased for 25 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Institute of Chemical Technology based in Hyderabad,
Andhra Pradesh, developed HFC-134a on its own, therefore saving
India a huge amount of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The chemical will soon be ready for commercial production in
the country, PTI said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises UK Labor's "Excellent Start" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today praised the British government for establishing tight
monetary and fiscal policy, but called for broadening of
value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the end of 10 days of discussions with the
Treasury and the Bank of England, the IMF said "the new government
has made an excellent start."
</P>
<P>
"It has set a high standard for its economic policies, aiming
to maintain stability and foster long-term growth while seeking
fairness and developing human potential," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
"And it has taken decisive steps toward these goals by making
the Bank of England independent, introducing a budget that makes
rapid strides toward sound public finances, and initiating
welfare-to-work and other programs to enhance employability," the
IMF said.
</P>
<P>
But the fund warned the financial markets might be
overestimating the increase in interest rates required to attain
the government's inflation target.
</P>
<P>
"With output now close to potential and the associated risks of
rekindling inflation, the economy faces a period of increased
uncertainty. However, the fiscal and monetary policies should
alleviate these tensions significantly," it added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said that chancellor Gordon Brown's Budget earlier this
month did more to get monetary and fiscal policy in balance than
was "sometimes supposed".
</P>
<P>
"While the budget measures could have been tilted more heavily
against current consumer spending, particularly in view of earlier
cuts in income tax, it is difficult to criticize the magnitude of
the overall up-front fiscal correction," the fund said.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF criticized Brown's adoption of the "golden
rule", in which the government is allowed to borrow to cover its
investment.
</P>
<P>
It said the government should aim to balance books completely
to release extra resources for private investment.
</P>
<P>
The IMF welcomed Brown's decision to abolish the tax credit on
dividend payments for some shareholders, and his announcement of
reviews on corporate and capital gains taxes and pensions.
</P>
<P>
But it urged the government to reconsider its refusal to extend
value-added tax to a wider range of goods.
</P>
<P>
Together with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development, the IMF is regarded as one of most authoritative
analysts of economic policy worldwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The 15th World Petroleum Congress
(WPC) is scheduled to be held in Beijing between October 12 and 16
this year, with an expected attendance of about 3,000
representatives from over 80 countries and regions across the
world.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the upcoming WPC will be "Technology and
Globalization -- Leading the Petroleum Industry into the 21st
Century."
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao, chairman of the Chinese Organizing Committee of the
15th WPC, noted that the five-day conference consists of six
plenary addresses, 21 panel forums, 10 review and forecast reports
and a ministerial forum. In addition, some 95 papers will be
presented to the congress and 240 papers will be offered for
academic exchange.
</P>
<P>
All the reports and papers will focus on issues of oil
exploration, development and drilling, processing technology,
natural gas, oil and gas reserves, environmental protection and
safe production, as well as oil and gas transportation, the
chairman added.
</P>
<P>
He said that oil experts throughout the world will conduct
exchanges on the latest scientific and technological results
concerning oil production from different perspectives.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the opportunities and challenges facing the
world petroleum industry in the 21st century.

<P>
During the conference, the WPC organizing committee will hold
an international exhibition on oil, gas and petrochemicals and
about 600 companies and enterprises across the world will display
their latest oil scientific and technological results, equipment
and products.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the upcoming world petroleum congress, China set
up the Chinese organizing committee of WPC in 1993, with former
president of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) Wang Tao
acting as chairman. Other members of the organizing committee are
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State Science and
Technology Commission, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the
Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, the China Petrochemical
Corp, the China National Offshore Oil Corp and the China National
Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese organizing committee, the WPC was set
up in London in 1933, with its first congress held the same
year. It now consists of 47 member states, all of which are the
world's major oil producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The WPC is held every three years. China joined in the WPC
organization in 1979. It is the first time for the country to host
WPC.

<HEADLINE> UAE's New Labor Law Ensures Jobs for Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
published here today a draft labor law in a bid to reverse the
trend of hiring foreign labors rather than nationals by its
booming private sector.
</P>
<P>
The new labor law, carried by the Arabic newspaper Al Bayan
pending endorsement by the union cabinet, requires the country's
private sector to give priority to employing nationals instead of
expatriates.
</P>
<P>
"recruitment of non-nationals in the private sector will not be
allowed unless it is proved that there are no jobless UAE
nationals who can do the same work given to non-nationals," said
the law.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as a further step of the campaign launched earlier
by the UAE authorities to nationalize jobs, ease dependence on
expatriate labor and ensure jobs for its increasing university
graduates.
</P>
<P>
While there was progress in the employment of nationals in the
public sector, the private sector has been reluctant to employ
nationals on the grounds that they lack experience, work fewer
hours and demand far higher salaries than expatriates.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry
will also be authorized to cancel labor permits granted to
non-nationals in some cases, especially when there is a local
worker who is qualified to do that job, the law said.
</P>
<P>
Special sections would be set up at government labor offices in
the country's seven emirates to supervise the implementation of
the law in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, locals account for around 20 percent of
the nearly 50,000 civil servants but less than 10 percent of the
private workforce.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of the UAE labor force are foreigners and
more than half of employees in the private sector are expatriates
from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> HK's Regional Flag Combines Wisdom of People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Qian Weichang, vice-chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), described the regional flag and
regional emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) as the "crystalization of the collective wisdom."
</P>
<P>
Qian, former director of the Committee for Selecting Designs
for the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong SAR,
said the work was completed with help from the committee members
as well as members of the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the regional flag and regional emblem was a
nationwide event, drawing entries from Chinese people both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1987, the fourth plenary session of the Drafting
Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR adopted a
procedure for collecting and approving the designs of the regional
flag and regional emblem of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Selecting Designs for the Regional Flag and
Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong SAR was also formed in July
1987. The committee consisted of 11 members, including five
members of the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law and six
experts in various fields.
</P>
<P>
During the period for receiving applications, the committee
received 7,147 designs from people all over the country and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
After a series of meetings, during which opinions were
solicited from various circles, the committee selected the three
best designs and developed three styles of the regional flag and
regional emblem which carried the pattern of the bauhinia flower.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1990, the Ninth Plenary Session of the Drafting
Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR passed a
procedure for selecting drafts of the regional flag and regional
emblem of the Hong Kong SAR in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Drafting Committee in the afternoon of February
16 chose one set from the three copies, with more than two-thirds
of the members voting to approve the design.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, 1990, the designs were adopted at the Third Session
of the Seventh National People's Congress along with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Since then, a red flag and an emblem with a bauhinia
highlighted by five star-tipped stamens have become symbols of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Developed Province Helping Needy People In Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province in east China
is using its capital, technology, and information in combination
with the rich resources, markets, and inexpensive labor in the
Three Gorges Dam area, to help local people improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
The province has signed more than 100 contracts worth 800
million yuan with the area and nearby Sichuan Province to help the
needy people.
</P>
<P>
It has also financed the construction of nearly 30 primary
schools in the area, which have helped thousands of drop-outs
return to school. It has helped resettle more than 4,000 migrant
farmers and provided jobs for 5,000 laborers from the two regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the State asked all provinces to help the poor in the
Three Gorges area. Last year, Zhejiang was told to take charge
of poverty-eradication efforts in the area and in some poor parts
of Chongqing city and Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou-based Wahaha Group spent 40 million yuan in 1994
setting up a branch company in Fuling city, and took on the task
of moving and reorganizing three local enterprises that were
running at a loss and which were due to be covered by the waters
of the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
The branch introduced a competitive system and management
methods to help revitalize the three otherwise bankrupt
businesses, providing job opportunities for 1,200 workers in the
process. In 1995, the company had 66 million yuan in output value
and more than six million yuan in pre-tax profits, a figure that is
expected to hit 40 million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The state's strategy, started by Deng Xiaoping, is for the more
developed East to help the undeveloped West to narrow the economic
gap and seek common prosperity, Zhang Qimei, vice-governor of
Zhejiang, explained.

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Disease Epidemic Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The epidemic of BSE, or mad cow
disease, is rapidly slowing down and the risk of further
infection of cattle from contaminated feed now appears to have
been contained, the British Royal Society said in a statement
today.
</P>
<P>
The statement estimated that no more than 7,000 new cases of
BSE are expected over the next five years, compared with an
estimated one million cattle infected since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the number of confirmed cases of
new variant CJD, BSE's human equivalent, is too small to
predict the eventual size of any outbreak.
</P>
<P>
CJD's mostly likely source is transmission from mad cow
which brain is known to be infectious to humans, muscle and
milk are not thought to be infectious.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is not yet clear whether the measures
implemented in 1988 and 1990 have succeeded in completely
removing infectious material from the human food chain,"
said the statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Finance Minister Liu
Zhongli called here today for improved and tightened fiscal
management, while pointing out problems such as high deficits and
indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
"Ineffective fiscal management has become an evident problem in
need of an urgent solution, in spite of all the efforts the
financial departments have made in the field during the past few
years," he told a national conference on fiscal work that is in
session in this capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
He said that the emphasis of the task should be on five
aspects. First, the taxation departments should enhance tax
collection, perfect taxation policies, solve problems such as tax
evasion and fraud, and halt unauthorized extension of tax
reductions and exemptions.
</P>
<P>
He also called for tighter control over fiscal spending, to
effectively check any unnecessary overspending that eats away at
fiscal revenue.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also need to have a tighter rein on the
extra-budgetary funds, the minister said, while urging a better
handling of the state assets to help them increase value rather
than drain it off.
</P>
<P>
Redoubled efforts are also necessary to better guide and
supervise Chinese accountants, he added.

<HEADLINE> UAE Freezes Bank Accounts of Suspected Drug Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The UAE Central Bank has frozen
bank accounts of eight people suspected of involvement in drug
trafficking, officials from the bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank instructed commercial banks to freeze the
accounts of five UAE-based Indians, a Pakistani, a Zambian woman
and a UAE national as well as their companies, they said.
</P>
<P>
The instruction was triggered by the five persons' alleged
involvement in narcotic pill factories which were busted by
police in Dubai last month, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The freeze came after the publication this month of a draft law
on money laundering, giving UAE authorities greater access to bank
accounts and allowing them to freeze the funds of drug suspects.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, which is to be ratified by the Federal Cabinet,
followed a surge in narcotic trafficking in the country by
international gangs.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urges Monetary Sector to Keep Rupiah's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called on the country's monetary authorities to make efforts
to keep the stability of rupiah which has plunged to a record low
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call after hearing report of Finance
Minister Mar'ie Mohamad about the monetary situation in the
country at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
"There is no new policy in the monetary sector, we still carry
out the controlled float rate," Mar'ie said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said today's spot rupiah against the U.S. dollar
recovered to 2,600:1 from 2,650:1 on Monday following the Central
Bank's intervention.
</P>
<P>
Currency speculators in the country continued their relentless
attack against the rupiah, pushing it to a record low of
2,650/55:1 dollar on Monday morning from 2,510/20 open before
easing to 2,636/41 at 6 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Speculative attacks on the rupiah escalated early last week
following the de facto devaluation of the Thai baht earlier this
month and the Philippine peso on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank was promoted Monday to raise its daily fixing
of the U.S. dollar-rupiah intervention band by one point to
2,378/2,382 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The central bank intervened in the market with some 500 million
U.S. dollars through four or five brokers.
</P>
<P>
The government is optimistic that the condition will be better
because Indonesia's economic fundamental is strong, Mar'ie said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank on July 11 had widened the dollar-rupiah
intervention band to 12 percent from 8 percent to avert
speculative attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Former warlord Charles Taylor seems
to have emerged as the winner of Saturday's Liberian election,
with an overwhelming 65 percent majority by votes counted so far.
</P>
<P>
By Monday evening, reports reaching here said of the about two
thirds of the votes counted, Taylor enjoyed a comfortable lead of
65 percent.
</P>
<P>
His close rival, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, won only 15 of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
Though the final results are expected not to come out before
Wednesday evening, observers believe that Taylor has actually won
the election, making a run-off unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
In contemplating her defeat, Johnson-Sirleaf, the former
senior official of the United Nations has accused the west
African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG of influencing voters
at polling stations.
</P>
<P>
She made the allegation while addressing her supporters on
Monday in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
International observers of the election, however, agreed that
the election is free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference Monday afternoon in Monrovia,
former U.S. president Jimmy Carter praised, on behalf of the
observers, the conduct of the election and the large turnout of
voters.
</P>
<P>
He did admit that there were minor problems, but said they are
not enough to influence the results of the election. Carter that
any complaints should be filed to the Independent Electoral
Commission for investigation.

<HEADLINE> Japan Values Ties with Pakistan: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan attaches high importance
to its relations with Pakistan, said a spokesman for Japanese
Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda who has arrived here for a
three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Being the gateway of the central Asia, Pakistan could play an
important role in development and peace in the region, the
spokesman said late last night shortly after Ikeda's arrival.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by a Japanese government official since
the Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif took
office in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The visit will help improve bilateral relations and enhance
economic cooperation between the two countries, the spokesman told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
There are many opportunities for joint ventures and investments
between the two countries, he said, adding that Japan appreciates
the economic reforms introduced by the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors are willing to enter into joint ventures
with Pakistani businessmen, provided they are ensured protection
of their investment and consistency of the government's policies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the spokesman said Japan wants both India
and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue peacefully through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the high-level contacts between India and Pakistan
would bring about positive results to further improve cooperation
and understanding for resolving bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Afghanistan, the spokesman said Japan fully
supports the efforts of the United Nations for the peace process
in that war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that all warring Afghan factions would reach some
acceptable agreement, as the continued war is destablizing the
peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Outside US-initiated African Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, the largest contributor to
African peace-keeping, has been barred from taking part in the
African Quick Reaction Force initiated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of U.S. military trainers in Senegal and
Uganda on Sunday, which many observers say is a prelude to the
U.S. initiative proposed last year, Nigeria is seen out of the
list of seven African countries the U.S. soldiers are scheduled
to head for.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military personnel will be in Senegal and Uganda for
two months to train the soldiers designed for the force, mooted
by the U.S. last year. They will then go to Tunisia, Mali,
Ethiopia, Malawi and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that Nigeria was barred from
participating in the force because it is not a "democratic
country".
</P>
<P>
No official reaction has been made to the training plan for
the U.S.-initiated African intervention force. But military
sources have expressed the government view that it is impossible
for a pan-African peace-keeping force without Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The military administration in Abuja has been advocating for
the establishment of a continental peace-keeping force with the
west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) as the nucleus.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG, whose successful mission has ensured a peaceful
conduct of elections last Saturday in war-ravaged Liberia, is led
by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The force is also in Sierra Leone ready for restoring the
country's civilian government overthrown by a military coup on
May 25.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the arrival of 60 U.S. trainers in
Senegal was without fanfare. None of the country's daily
newspapers, including the government-owned, published news of the
arrival.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the seven countries included in the U.S. military's
itinerary, no other African countries have expressed support for
the planned intervention force.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela had last year berated
the U.S. initiative, saying it should be the United Nations'
prerogative.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has expressed concern that the initiative would allow
outsiders, especially the U.S. to have authority over how and
when African countries deploy their forces.
</P>
<P>
The South African government reportedly restated its objection
to the initiative on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The industrial city of
Liuzhou, in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is
building a permanent flood-control embankment along the Liujiang
River.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that the main streets of Liuzhou are 85-95
meters above the sea level. Without any form of flood control in
place, severe flooding that might occur within the next 20 years
could submerge many industrial and mining enterprises in the city,
the data show.
</P>
<P>
An exceptionally fierce flood in July, 1994 forced 90 percent
of Liuzhou's factories to suspend operation and inundated half of
the city.
</P>
<P>
A city official said Liuzhou's flood-control project
consists of dykes, sluice gates, lock gates and water pumps. The
embankment under construction is 16.62 kilometers and has 22
sluice gates and 20 water pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the dyke, scheduled for completion in the year
2000, will cost 1.2 billion yuan. As part of the work, 160,000 sq
m of housing in the area will be removed, and more than 120,000
people will be displaced.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the revelation of the audit on public finance, the
French government announced on Monday its plan of readjustment
aimed at reducing by 32 billion francs (about 5.3 billion
U.S. dollars) of France's public deficit to respect the criteria
of Maastricht treaty on single currency. Even though the strict
objective of cutting the deficit to 3 percent of the gross
domestic product will be postponed until 1998, the plan was
welcomed by the European Commission and the German government.
</P>
<P>
-- France and Spain reaffirmed on Monday their will to work
together in the fight against terrorism perpetrated by the Basque
separatist movement ETA. At the annual meeting of the two interior
ministers, Spain asked France to arrest the leading figures of the
ETA who Madrid believes are hiding in France. Madrid also asked
Paris to extradite Luis Alvarez Santacristina, a former leader of
the ETA who was arrested in France in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The center-right opposition on Monday strongly reacted to
the announcement by the government of the plan of readjustment to
reduce public deficit. Nicolas Sarkozy, the spokesman of the
Gaullist Rally for the Republic, accused the government of
incoherence in its policy-making.
</P>
<P>
-- The Cambodian royalist forces of Prince Norodom Ranariddh
Monday failed in their attempt to recapture the strategic base of
Samrong in northern Cambodia. At least 20,000 villagers of Samrong
have fled to a frontier town in the Province of Surin in Thailand
over the past several days as fighting went on between the
royalist forces and the forces of Hun Sen, said international
humanitarian organizations.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker As Markets Trade Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
marginally weaker today as markets await the release of quarterly
inflation and wages figures.
</P>
<P>
The June quarter consumer price index (CPI) from the Australian
Bureau of Statistics is due tomorrow, while key quarterly wages
figures are due Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 74.08 US cents from 74.13 at
Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Australian dollar had begun the day in a
weaker mood after falling in sympathy with the New Zealand dollar.
</P>
<P>
The CPI report is expected to bolster the argument for a cut to
the 5.5 percent cash rate by the Central Bank in the short term.
</P>
<P>
"The market has factored in a very good CPI, an okay wages
number and a rate cut in the next couple of weeks, so it just
depends now on what the data brings out," said Rory Robertson from
Bankers Trust of Australia.
</P>
<P>
On cross-rates, the Australian dollar finished at 86.16 from
85.66 against Japanese yen and was at 1.3363 up from 1.3278
against the German mark.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Displaces 200,000 People in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Recent heavy fighting in
northern Afghanistan has brought the number of displaced people
entering the capital city Kabul since the beginning of this year
to 200,000.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here today by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), several thousands
more are believed to be scattered across the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the seven days leading up to July 20, the release said,
a UNHCR monitoring post north of Kabul recorded 15,474 displaced
people entering Kabul from the north.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest rate over a similar period since
mid-January, when 47,000 were displaced from the same area in a
week.
</P>
<P>
The latest sharp increase in the number of displaced people was
the result of intense fighting, in which the Taliban militia lost
the key town of Charikar, about 65 kilometers north of Kabul, to
the anti-Taliban alliance, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The alliance also recaptured the strategic air base of Bagram,
some 40 kilometers north of Kabul, in its attack last Saturday
night against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The release said that most of those who arrived in Kabul last
week were among the last remaining inhabitants of Charikar itself.
</P>
<P>
The town, which is believed to have had somewhere between
100,000 and 150,000 inhabitants a year ago, is now reported to be
largely deserted by civilian inhabitants, said the release.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Exports Likely to Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The insolvency of the Kia Group and
the currency crisis in the Southeast Asian region will likely deal
a harsh blow to South Korea's exports in the second half of the
year, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the country's exports will suffer
greatly in the latter half, as it may take a long time for the
ailing Kia to normalize operations.
</P>
<P>
The Kia Group had forecast its sales and exports at 21.8
billion U.S. dollars and 4.5 billion dollars respectively for this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, in the process of taking steps to regain managerial
normalcy, with the government's financial support, Kia's sales and
exports are expected to decline, said ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ongoing Thai baht crisis, which has spread to
other Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and
Malaysia, is expected to hurt the exports of South Korean
enterprises operating in the region, including the Kia group.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Political violence in South
Africa has plummeted, the country's independent Human Rights
Commission said in a report issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in its annual report for 1996 that it had
identified many positive signs three years after the first
all-race general elections brought the black majority to power in
1994.
</P>
<P>
"Paramount is the decline in political violence for the third
consecutive year to the lowest total recorded in our existence,"
the commission said.
</P>
<P>
It said 1,057 people died in all forms of political violence
in 1996, down from 1,296 in 1995 and from a peak of 4,406 in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a separate monthly report for May that
although 340 people died in all forms of political violence in
the first five months of this year,the monthly average for 1997
was down to 68 from 81.5 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the commission noted that non-political crime and violence
are still high since apartheid was lifted.
</P>
<P>
The commission was set up in 1988 to monitor violence and
human rights in the struggle over apartheid.

East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their future
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mubarak meeting will be followed up by an enlarged
Egyptian-Palestinian meeting in Cairo on Sunday to evaluate the
present situation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt brokered three meetings between Palestinian National
Authority top negotiator Nabil Sha'ath and Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in Tel Aviv last week and is expected
to host a tripartite summit among Mubarak, Arafat and Jordan's
King Hussein before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Arafat is due in Belgium to meet with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy, which is part a European bid to
advance the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace moves.
</P>
<P>
European officials said earlier they did not want the
Arafat-Levy meeting to be superficial and hoped the two sides
could agree on confidence-building measures, mainly to provide aid
to the ailing Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Arafat will also meet with foreign ministers of
the European Union (EU), who are there to attend the
organization's General Affairs Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa welcomed the rising
European mediation role on Monday, expressing hope that Arafat's
meeting with EU ministers could achieve progress.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace march has been deadlocked for
four months, with violence raging in both West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, refused
to give a temporary halt to the settlement expansion, a
prerequisite the Palestinians insist on for resumption of talks.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down On Oil Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Customs has pledged to
tighten its control on the smuggling of oil products, which has
been on the rise since the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, Chinese Customs solved 41 smuggling cases
involving 62,000 tons, or 133 million yuan-worth, of oil products.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the weakened international oil prices, oil
smuggling has run rampant since March. Ocean transport is the main
means of moving the illegal goods, so Customs officials have
tightened their checks in coastal provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi,
Fujian and Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
A recent national anti-smuggling conference initiated by the
Chinese Customs has called for coastal customs officers to
examine all oil tanks which dock at Chinese ports.
</P>
<P>
Police are expected to patrol coastal seas 24 hours a day and
oil tankers must be checked ship by ship.

COLOMBO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's army authorities have
decided to extend a declared amnesty, which was effective from
July 10 to Monday midnight, till midnight Saturday, a military
spokesman said here today .
</P>
<P>
During the 11-day amnesty, the fifth in the war-torn island
country since 1995, about 3,000 deserters had reportedly returned
for duty, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the army authorities had decided to extend the
amnesty at the request of many parents and relatives of deserters.

<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean Minister has
reaffirmed the government's commitment to selling off
parastatals, but said the process is dragging because the
majority of Zimbabweans are still poor and the policy is new.
</P>
<P>
Minister of state in the President's Office Cephas Msipa said
this on Monday when he gave a keynote address to senior
management of hotel giant, Zimbabwe Sun, which is holding its
annual conference at the Great Zimbabwe Hotel in Masvingo of
south Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
''That is why we are having to go through the process of
commercialization first so that we shade them off on a strong
financial base,'' Msipa noted.
</P>
<P>
He added, ''the reason why we are taking time is that the
majority of Zimbabweans have no money, and that this is new
territory for us. We do not want a situation where the same
people who already own something will earn more.''
</P>
<P>
The minister said indigenization is a process aimed at
democratizing the economic system and promoting human rights --
''such as the right to employment, the right to own property and
the right to earn an equitable standard of living''.
</P>
<P>
''Our aim is to develop a strong domestic sector which can be
the engine for economic growth,'' said Msipa.
</P>
<P>
''The overall objective is to promote more wealth and
employment, reduce poverty and restore self respect and dignity
to the majority of Zimbabweans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the rise in crime could be linked to
rising unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Female Corpse Unearthed in Downtown Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- An ancient corpse with clearly
distinguishable features was recently unearthed from a
construction site in downtown Shanghai, giving residents of
China's most bustling city an idea of what one of their ancestors
looked like.
</P>
<P>
The female corpse, said to be some 400-500 years old, is
believed to be the oldest well-preserved corpse ever excavated in
Shanghai. She was found in one of 14 tombs located in the
construction site of a middle school building in Luwan District,
according to Monday's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The report described the corpse, dressed in silk clothing and
probably aged 40, as being "preserved so perfectly that her joints
can move and her muscle tissue is not stiff; the rarest thing is
that her nose is still intact and her features are easily
identified."
</P>
<P>
Ancient corpse researcher Xu Yongqing said the body, possibly
from the middle years of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), was found
in a pool of fragrant, coffee-colored fluid when her coffin was
opened.
</P>
<P>
Moisture usually leads to the rapid decay of a buried
body. Mummies previously found in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region were all preserved under extremely dry
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Such a kind of ancient corpse is very rare, mostly found in
east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Shanghai
area," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is because of the airtight coffin and the fluid which was
able to destroy harmful microorganisms that the corpse was so well
preserved," explained Xu, author of "Chinese Ancient Corpses."
</P>
<P>
The corpse has been sent to the Shanghai Museum of Natural
History. But the newspaper did not say how the corpse is currently
being stored.
</P>
<P>
The museum where Xu works is China's leading research institute
of ancient corpses, keeping more than 20 ancient human bodies. It
is conducting a study of ancient corpses in the Shanghai area
jointly with the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery provides precious materials for our research,"
Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The tombs, the most complete family tomb complex ever found in
Shanghai, are said to belong to a wealthy family which lived
during the Ming Dynasty. A golden coronet also was unearthed from
the tomb.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A new plan to boost food
production, storage and marketing has been launched in
famine-stricken Kamuli District, eastern Uganda, "The Monitor"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, locals have an obligation to produce food
to support themselves but not for cash, and every homestead must
have three granaries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at a function chaired by Coordinator of
Political Activities in the Resident District Commissioner's
Office that production and marketing committees are to be formed
at local councils to coordinate food and cash crop production.
</P>
<P>
The function also called schools, health units and sub-county
headquarters to plant banana and coffee, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is an important local cash crop. Local people use
banana as one of the many kinds of their staple food.
</P>
<P>
Kamuli is one of the 19 famine-stricken districts during this
dry season among a total of 45 districts in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The present famine is caused by drought. Kotido, the most
productive agricultural district in the area, has witnessed one
of the worst food outputs in many years. Crops like millet,
maize, sorghum and cassava are dying, and nomads are moving their
cattle to seek for water and greener pastures in the district.

<HEADLINE> UN Relief Agency to Move to Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) has decided to move its headquarters from
Vienna, the capital of Austria, to Gaza Strip, according to a
report of The Jerusalem Times today.
</P>
<P>
The relocation of UNRWA headquarters is in response to a call
by the U.N. General Assembly to shift the agency to the field of
operations proper as soon as possible, said Peter Hansen,
Commissioner of UNRWA for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that UNRWA moves headquarters in its
47-year-old history. In 1978, owing to the unstable conditions in
Lebanon, UNRWA moved its headquarters to Vienna, where it has
remained for the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Hansen told reporters in Gaza that the official opening of the
new headquarters will take place in August, adding that there was
full co-ordination between UNRWA and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, UNRWA has funded the construction of 20
schools in Gaza Strip to accommodate the children of the
refugees, and has invested in the restoration work of over 2,000
homes in the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
Hansen pledged that his organization will continue to offer
its services to Palestinian refugees wherever they are found.
</P>
<P>
"In July 1994, (former) U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali announced that UNRWA headquarters would be shifted
to Gaza as part of the support extended by the United Nations to
the peace process," Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
By moving its headquarters from Vienna to Gaza, UNRWA expects
to save large sums of money. This is especially important as UNRWA
expects a large deficit in its 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 members of personnel will be relocated from Vienna to
Gaza, many of them Palestinians. Another 80 people from Gaza Strip
are to join the staff.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA was established on December 8, 1949 in accordance with a
U.N. General Assembly decision. It draws its funds mainly from
various governments, governmental and non-governmental
organizations and private contributions.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's External Debt Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's external debt stood at
350 billion Kenyan Shillings (about 6 billion U.S. Dollars) as of
March 1997, according to the latest issue of the Economic Review
available here today.
</P>
<P>
The monthly review issued by the Central Bank of Kenya said
that the debt amounts had declined during the past two years,
falling from 380 billion Shillings in December 1995 to 360
billion Shillings in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
It noted that out of the current debts, 200 billion Shillings
was owed to multilateral institutions, accounting for 57 percent
of the total debts while bilateral debts stood at 130 billion
Shillings representing 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce external debt, the review said, the Kenyan
government has increased domestic budget financing by the issue
of floating rate Treasury Bonds.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government has launched the third and fourth
issues of floating rate Treasury Bonds in April and June
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The review noted that the 11 months of the 1996/97 fiscal year
indicated a higher budget deficit at 10.3 billion Shillings
compared with 9 billion Shillings during the same period of
fiscal year 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was negatively impacted by interest payment on
government debt which was on the increase.

<HEADLINE> Ice Jam Control Project On China's Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The disastrous ice jams that
plagued the lower reaches of China's Yellow River, the country's
second longest, throughout history will no longer pose a threat
when the Xiaolangdi water control project is completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The multi-purpose project, which has a storage capacity of 12.6
billion cubic meters, including two billion cubic meters designed
to prevent ice jams, will combine with the Sanmenxia, Guxian and
Luhun reservoirs to control ice jams on the river's upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
Ice jams have long been a problem for the lower reaches. From
1855 to 1955, there were problems with ice every five years, and
it was considered even more destructive than summer floods.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have done heir utmost to
solve the ice problem since the founding of new China in
1949. Breaking the ice up was one preventive measure, but the
river is so long and the water and ice are discharged in such
large amounts that it was not the most efficient way to deal with
the problem.
</P>
<P>
The river originates on the Loess Plateau and travels eastward
through central China's Henan province, then changes its course
and moves northeastward. This contributes to the ice problem in
the early spring when ice and water are discharged from the upper
reaches, while the lower reaches are still frozen.
</P>
<P>
The Sanmenxia Reservoir is the first key water control project
on the Yellow river and has been successful in controlling ice
jams by regulating water flow. But, power plants on the upper
reaches meant a larger water flow, and as a result, the 1.8
billion cu m capacity was not sufficient to contain the ice and
water.
</P>
<P>
Last January, an ice jam hit Liangshan County in east China's
Shandong province, where the river turns southward again, and
in Taiqian County in central China's Henan province, inundating
6,000 ha of farmland and affecting 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
This menace is expected to disappear when the Xiaolangdi Dam
is completed in the early 21st century.

PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today defended its decision to
admit Myanmar, saying the move provides an opportunity to

</P>
<P>
"It is better to engage with them," Abdullah Ahmad Badawi,

Myanmar, together with Laos, will officially become members of
the regional grouping tomorrow, thus boosting the number of ASEAN
members from seven to nine and marking a step closer toward the
organization's dream of including all the 10 Southeast Asian
countries in its membership.
</P>
<P>
"Engaging Myanmar continually as of now will be good for all of
us," Abdullah Ahmad Badawi declared.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, which presently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, decided in May
to admit Myanmar simultaneously with Laos and Cambodia over
criticism from some Western countries, but it later deferred
Cambodia's entry to a later date because of the factional fighting
in the country.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony will be held for the admission in this township near
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, tomorrow when the national flags
of Myanmar and Laos will be raised.

<HEADLINE> Australia, WWF to Hold Seminar on Traditional Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The first international symposium
on traditional Chinese medicine and wildlife conservation in
Australia is to be held on August 4 in Sydney, it was announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will "build crucial bridges of communication and
understanding between local Chinese community and the government
in Australia," the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) Australia and
Trade Record Analysis of Fauna and Flora In Commerce (TRAFFIC)
Oceania said today.
</P>
<P>
In co-hosting this symposium, the Australian government is the
first of the 139 parties to the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to answer
the call from the recent meeting in Harare to work more closely
with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and users, the WWF
Australia said.
</P>
<P>
The practice of traditional Chinese medicine is growing in
Australia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
There are now approximately 4,500 Chinese medicinal
practitioners in Australia, a number forecast to double by the
year 2000. Currently 2.8 million consultations are conducted each
year, with an annual turnover of at least 62 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"With the increasing popularity of traditional Chinese medicine
in Australia, there is an urgent need to inform the practitioners,
traders and users of traditional Chinese medicine about the issue,
the rationale behind CITES and the relevant Australian law, and
the proper procedure for importing products into Australia," said
Samuel Lee of TRAFFIC East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is jointly organized by TRAFFIC Oceania,
Environment Australia and the University of Western Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Fishermen Continue Holding U.S. Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian fishermen continued to
hold the U.S. ferry Malaspina captive at Prince Rupert, British
Columbia (B.C.), for a third day today, despite a court injunction
calling for its release.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson have arrived in the
northern B.C. coast community, some 1,500 kilometers northwest of
Vancouver, in a bid to free the U.S. ferry.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen, frustrated by the lack of action of the federal
government, took the action themselves to protest the U.S. state
of Alaska's overfishing of Canadian-bound sockeye.
</P>
<P>
Despite that the Alaskan government obtained an injunction from
a Canadian federal court Sunday ordering the end of the blockade,
there has been little effect.
</P>
<P>
And new Canadian fishing boats and pleasure boats have joined
the siege today at the port.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen said they will not let the ferry go unless those
named in the injunction not be held responsible for any blockage
damages.
</P>
<P>
Tension began to rise in Prince Rupert on Friday after the
United States admitted it had caught more than three times its
limit of sockeye that spawn in Canadian rivers.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, dozens of Canadian fishing boats surrounded
two U.S. salmon vessels to prevent them from delivering their
catch. And one U.S. boat collided with a Canadian vessel.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, an estimated 200 boats surrounded the Alaskan
state ferry carrying about 300 passengers, preventing it from
leaving port.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen said they wanted Anderson to restart the salmon
talks with the U.S. and allow northern B.C. fishermen to increase
their take of sockeye.
</P>
<P>
They also wanted transit fees imposed on all U.S. marine
traffic along B.C.'s northern coast.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing salmon war between Canada and the United States
started after the failure of negotiations over revisions to the
Pacific Salmon Treaty of 1985, which set salmon catches for both
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is launching

effort to boost foreign exchange revenue, local newspaper the
Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee said that the "Thai
Services Trade Promotion" program has been designed to increase

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Jose Maria
Figueres is planning a tour to Mercosur (Southern Common Market)
countries soon to establish closer ties with the trade bloc,
Foreign Trade Minister Jose Manuel Salazar said today.
</P>
<P>
The president's trip to the Mercosur member countries --
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, is part of Costa Rica's
development strategy, Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)
scheduled for the year 2005 has contributed to closer relations
between Central and South American countries, the minister said at
a seminar on Costa Rica's growth strategies.
</P>
<P>
Central American countries have few trade relations with South
America so far, he added.
</P>
<P>
This year, Costa Rica is the president in rotation of the FTAA
coordinating body and will host a ministerial meeting next year to
analyze the progress of the process.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Vice President Rodrigo Oreamuno said that his
country's exports are expected to reach 5 billion U.S. dollars
next year which was the initial goal set by President Figueres for
the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Intervenes as Rupiah Plunges to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Currency speculators in Indonesia
continued their relentless attack against the rupiah Monday,
pushing it to a record low and prompting the central bank to
intervene to defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said today spot rupiah against the U.S. dollar dipped
to a historic low of 2,650/55 Monday morning from 2,510/20 open
before easing to 2,636/41 at 6:00 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, was forced to raise its daily
fixing of the U.S. dollar-rupiah intervention band by one point to
2,378/2,382 rupiah, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Bank Indonesia official, the intervention was to
calm foreign exchange markets following the rupiah's fall in
value.
</P>
<P>
"We did it just to calm down the market ... I hope it
(speculative action) will not continue," said Djakaria, head of
the central bank's Foreign Exchange Division.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono called on the
people Monday not to panic about the steep fall in the rupiah's
exchange rate and not to join the rush to the American dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rupiah became the target of speculators Monday
after being spared previously when they focused on other regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to force the central bank to float the rupiah
or at least widen the intervention band because they have been
long on dollar and short on rupiah," a dealer with a local foreign
exchange bank said.
</P>
<P>
"If they could force the Thai baht and the Philippine peso to
devalue by more than 15 percent, why not the rupiah?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia on July 11 widened the dollar-rupiah
intervention band to 12 percent from 8 percent to avert
speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
Speculative attacks on the rupiah escalated early last week
following the de facto devaluation of the Thai baht earlier this
month and the Philippine peso on July 11.
</P>
<P>
"The intervention seemed to help calm the market. But the
overall appetite for dollar remains strong. There are still
attempts to test the (intervention) band," a dealer said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Capital on Clean Campaign for Tourism Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kathmandu, the capital city of
Nepal, has launched a campaign to make the city cleaner for a
tourism year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A measure taken by the authorities is to collect garbage at
night in an effort to boost waste handling.
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected Mayor of Kathmandu Keshab Sthapit said on Monday
that as the Visit Nepal Year' 98 comes near, the municipal
government decided to give more attention to the garbage issue.
</P>
<P>
The work of waste collection at night began on June 19,
covering the downtown area and the major roads of the city, the
local press reported.
</P>
<P>
This new system of garbage collection might turn out to be more
effective because there are less traffic at night, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
With rapid growth in population and an even faster expansion of
the fleet of vehicles, Kathmandu is faced with a serious
environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
In a drive to make the capital cleaner and free from unwanted
animals, a total of 470 stray dogs have been killed so far, the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
And illegally built structures have been demolished, the mayor
added.
</P>
<P>
The mayor also said that an integrated programs will be
launched to improve water supply, traffic, environmental
protection, sewerage and solid waste management in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Chile Stepping Up Efforts to Train Labor Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government is
stepping up efforts to train the country's labor force and gain
competitiveness at the increasingly demanding world market.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have been prompted up by Chilean President Eduardo
Frei, who signed, on April 30, a decree to declare a "National
Year of Training" between May 1, 1997 and May 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
On signing the decree, Frei emphasized that training is
fundamental for Chile to become a developed nation, and that
neither individuals nor companies can grow without training.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, a National Council on Training was established
to group together government and private sector representatives
and coordinate research into the development of human resources
and the use of tax breaks for training purposes.
</P>
<P>
And this week, the Senate approved a new training and
employment statute that seeks to train 20 percent of the labor
force in the country every year. Last year, only 8.6 percent of
the labor force received training.
</P>
<P>
To provide incentives, the law, which will take effect on
January 1, 1998, offers tax exemptions for businesses which
provide training for their workers.
</P>
<P>
In another effort to expand coverage, a National Training Fund
was created for those who wish to join the labor force training.
</P>
<P>
With a budget that will go up to the equivalent of 29 million
U.S. dollars by 1998, the institution will be able to train more
men, women and adolescents to become workers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the National Training and State Employment Service
(SENCE) is responsible for organizing the training of unemployed
workers and 16-24 year-olds for free.
</P>
<P>
SENCE Director Ignacio Larraechea said his institution has used
a total of more than 660 million dollars to train 4.32 million
people since it was created 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Through the Chilean Youth Program, the SENCE plans to offer
training courses for some 70,000 poor, jobless young people at a
cost of 58 million dollars to the state between 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
And through the School Program for Women (PRODEMU), some
120,000 poor women have received training, and many of them have
already formed their own home businesses and rural shops.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of their training, the women are now aware of
their potentiality and their dignity," said President Frei.
</P>
<P>
The PRODEMU is expected to enroll another 120,000 women this
year to help develop their creativity and give them better chances
to join the country's social, cultural and economic processes.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's GDP Down 7.5 Percent in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's economy, which has been in
crisis for the last four years, is still contracting with gross
domestic product (GDP) and investment for the first six months of
1997 both down on last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Statistics Ministry last week show
that the country's GDP for the first half of this year was just
under 40 billion karbovanets, (21.8 billion U.S. dollars), down
7.5 percent on the same period in 1996. That comes on top of a 10
percent slide in GDP in 1996 over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The fall was worst in agriculture, transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
Investment also slumped 11 percent, mainly in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's economy has been steadily worsening since
independence in 1991. Industry and agriculture have been hit hard
by the country's transformation from a centrally-planned economy
to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, President Leonid Kuchma, whose reform plans
over the last three years haven't borne fruit, set up a High
Economic Council to speed up reforms.
</P>
<P>
The council will make strategic economic decisions and
implement reforms, including economic liberalization, halving
taxes within year, speeding up privatization and agricultural
reforms and legalizing the vast shadow economy.

BANGKOK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will press South Korea to
ease trade barriers faced by Thai products.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee is scheduled to

</P>
<P>
It will be the first meeting between trade ministers of the two

</P>
<P>
Thai exports to South Korea, mainly food and textiles, face
hefty customs tariffs, tough quarantine standards and complicated
import regulations, according to a Thai Commerce Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
South Korea does not allow the import of rice for direct sale,
only as an ingredient in food processing and tapioca flour is
similarly affected.
</P>
<P>
Imports of frozen shrimps are taxed at 75 percent, frozen squid
30 percent and canned tuna 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Narongchai would also try to persuade South Korea to accept
more Thai frozen chicken and pork.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Decides to Go Slow in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Siemens AG group, which has
already invested 500 million U.S. dollars in India since 1991,
will slow down its original plan to invest another 500 million
dollars in the country by the year 2000, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to postpone an additional investment of 500
million dollars followed disastrous results recorded by Siemens
India in 1996-97 which made a loss of 800 million rupees (about 23
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press conference in Berlin Monday, Gunter
Wilhelm, a senior Siemens AG manager for the Asia-Pacific region,
said the adverse business climate in India and the expected losses
in their business activities in the country would pull down their
net profit for the entire Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He complained of a sustained slowdown in India's industrial
growth and delay in implementation of the reform process in key
sectors like telecommunications which resulted in a slump in
demand for Siemens products.
</P>
<P>
Later, Heinrich Pierer, chief executive of the Siemens group
worldwide, noted that the main reason for the adverse business
climate in India was the delay in implementation of policy by the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
"The problem in India is bureaucracy. You can not wait
endlessly for clearances," he said.

in the past year.
</P>
<P>
"The last one year had been rather momentous for the
Association as we strove toward further enhancement and
consolidation of intra-ASEAN cooperation in various fields," said
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, chairman of the 30th ASEAN Standing
Committee (ASC) and foreign minister of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In a closing statement at the two-day ASC meeting, Badawi said
the ASC meeting reviewed the progress the ASEAN has made in
political, security and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"An appraisal of the work of the ASC showed that we have
attained encouraging achievements in political and security
cooperation, economic integration efforts as well as in function
cooperation areas and in our relations with dialogue partners," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which will have
discussions here later this month, the ASC chairman noted that the
ARF has progressed into an effective multilateral forum for
promoting security dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
"The ARF has played a positive role in enhancing mutual
understanding and trust, promoting greater transparency as well as
strengthening the commitment among participants to maintain peace
and stability in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ARF is represented by the seven ASEAN member countries --
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam; the ASEAN dialogue partners including Australia,
Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand,
South Korea, Russia, the U.N. Development Program and the United

Abdullah Ahmad Badawi pointed out that one of the "major
preoccupations" of his committee in the past year was the "active
preparations" for Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar to join the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
But while Laos and Myanmar will officially become ASEAN members
tomorrow and their foreign ministers are to attend the 30th ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting (AMM) scheduled to start on July 24, the
admission of Cambodia, which the ASEAN had decided to admit as a
full member in May, has been deferred because of the factional
fighting in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ASC chairman told a press conference after the ASC closing
session that Cambodia will retain its observer status and any
change will have to be decided by the ministerial meeting, which
is expected to hear a report from an ASEAN mission sent to meet
Cambodian officials earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The ASC meeting, together with a senior officials meeting, was
held to make preparations for the AMM and the ARF.

<HEADLINE> Papua New Guinea Elects New PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Port Moresby Governor Bill Skate
was today elected Papua New Guinea's (PNG) new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Skate's election, with 71 votes in favor in PNG's 109-seat
parliament, means the return to power of the coalition which held
government before last month's national election, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The new ruling alliance includes the country's four major
political parties.
</P>
<P>
Skate, who defeated former Prime Minister Michael Somare 71 to
35, takes over as prime minister from Julius Chan, who lost his
seat in last month's election.
</P>
<P>
John Pundari, member of the former ruling Pangu Party, was
earlier elected parliamentary speaker, defeating a group of
parties and independents headed by Michael Somare.
</P>
<P>
Skate had campaigned strongly against the former Chan
government, accusing it of corruption and condemning its
controversial plan to use mercenaries to quell a secessionist
rebellion on Bougainville island.
</P>
<P>
Skate is the first ethnic Papuan to serve as prime minister
since PNG's independence in 1975. Papua is a region in the south
of PNG's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chris Haiveta, former deputy prime minister, who was criticized
by a judicial inquiry for the failed mercenary plan, was expected
to be a contender for the deputy prime ministership.
</P>
<P>
Chan's coalition suffered a major defeat in last month's
elections, with 15 ministers losing their seats in a voter
backlash against alleged political corruption and the mercenary
plan.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Use Of Rainwater For Irrigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in north China's dry areas
are benefiting from a rainwater irrigation project that uses
cisterns to store rainwater for use during dry periods,
</P>
<P>
This project has proven effective in helping poor villagers
eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province in northwest China began using the method in
1995, and since then has applied it to some 13,000 ha of farmland
last year. It plans to use it on another 33,000 ha this year
and 166,000 ha by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the use of rainwater doubled per-unit wheat output
in the central mountainous part of the province, greatly
encouraging local farmers, who had long been plagued by water
shortages. Now they are all busy building rainwater storage
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The province had a record grain harvest last year and more than
a million farmers became better off. The rainwater project was said
to have contributed considerably to this. This year, the
facilities will mainly be built in poor mountainous areas to help
the remaining 3.7 million poor people.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to provide 3,000 yuan per
ha in subsidies for rainwater-irrigated land, to help the 10
million farmers in dry areas in central and eastern parts of the
province to have a certain amount of farmland.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to China's reforms and
opening-up, Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, is not
only a prominent economic success story but an increasingly
important training center for its next-door neighbor Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer in China's reforms, Shenzhen in Guangdong Province
has plenty of well-educated professionals and advanced technology,
while Hong Kong, although a major international trade and
financial center, lacks technical personnel.
</P>
<P>
So, in recent years, Shenzhen has held a number of training
courses for Hong Kong people, covering everything from nursing to
CAD computers and domestic market operations.
</P>
<P>
With its return to the mainland, it and Shenzhen have come to
be even closer economically, so co-operation in training is
expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
Recently, experts from both sides held a series of meetings to
discuss the possibilities and ways to improve exchanges. A
proposal was made to set up universities and special training
centers in Shenzhen to provide skilled personnel for Hong
Kong-based companies.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts say that Shenzhen's multitude of
professionals need greater international expertise, while Hong
Kong wants more scientists and technicians with a better
knowledge of the basic sciences and technology, especially in
hi-tech fields.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The 800-men Ugandan unit to be
trained by the United States "green beret" soldiers is a force
for disaster responding and traditionally peace keeping, Uganda's
army commander has said.
</P>
<P>
Major General Mugisha Muntu told local English newspaper "The
Crusader" last night that the unit to be trained by the U.S.
soldiers is not an elite commando force, adding, "they'll just be
trained in peace-keeping, not combat."
</P>
<P>
He made the explanation to the newspaper under widespread
speculation that the unit is to be trained as an elite commando
force to defend the country.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are not carrying into the country any
sophisticated equipment such as fighter planes, Muntu noted.
</P>
<P>
Fifty Americans started to arrive here yesterday and will
train the 800 Ugandan unit in Kabamba barracks in Mubende
District, central Uganda, the general disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the training will last three months instead of
two months as reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan unit is part of eight to 10 African battalions to
be trained by Americans for peace-keeping purpose under the
auspices of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Other units
are from Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali and Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Developing Sericulture In Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region is set to build a 6,600-hectare sericulture base
by the year 2000 as a means of improving the lives of local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has listed sericulture as one of its
ten pillar industries for rural development and a key poverty
reduction program since 1989. Governments at various levels have
worked out preferential policies like loan guarantees, technical
training programs, and free mulberries seedlings to help with
this.
</P>
<P>
Some poverty-stricken counties in the Xihaigu area, one of the
poorest areas in the country, have improved farmers' living
standards by growing mulberries on a large scale. As a result, a
mulberry grower can earn 22,500 yuan annually from each ha of land.
</P>
<P>
Many counties have also established special funds and research
institutes to offer technical guidance.
</P>
<P>
The region's mulberry fields have by now grown to 1,333 ha and

<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest Coal Bins In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Two bins for storing coal, 40m in
diameter and 54m deep with a 60,000-ton storage capacity each,
have been completed at the Yungang Mine in Shanxi Province in
north China.
</P>
<P>
The two bins signal a shift at Yungang Coal Mine, which is
directly under the jurisdiction of Datong Coal Mining
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Yungang Coal Mine was designed and built by China, with a
designed annual production capacity of 2.7 million tons of
coal. In the past 20 years, it had produced 78 million tons of
coal and generated 1.11 billion yuan in pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
It was designated as a coal exporter in 1990. In recent years,
the mine decided to build a coal dressing plant as a way to
improve coal quality.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the coal dressing plant began in August of
1992 with an estimated cost at 302 million yuan. The 1.17-hectare
plant will be able to wash four million tons of coal and provide
three million tons of quality coal for export annually.

<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China maintained a rapid economic
growth while keeping inflation low in the first half of this year,
the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gross Domestic Product totaled 3,318 billion yuan in the past

<HEADLINE> China to Formulate Mediation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China is mulling a law on
mediation in an effort to expand such a practice in solving civil
cases without going to court, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"Mediation, already an important method of avoiding costly
court hearings in Chinese civil cases, may be expanded through a
mediation law expected to come out in a few years," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice has drafted a law on the people's
mediation work and will submit it to the Legislative Bureau of the
State Council for examination by the end of this year, an official
with the ministry's Grassroots Work Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The law is expected to be discussed by the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress in a year or two, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mediation allows disputing parties to settle their
disagreements with the help and co-ordination of mediators. This
will keep the disputes from escalating into more severe situations
that end with the parties going to court.
</P>
<P>
The justice official said that the mediation system is "an
important part of the legal system with Chinese characteristics
that enjoys prestige worldwide."
</P>
<P>
The mediation law needs to cover many difficult subjects, the
official noted, including the legal status of mediation, the
validity of mediation agreements, rights and procedures of
handling civil disputes by grassroots mediation organizations and
funds for mediation.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are 1 million mediation organizations and more
than 10 million mediators across the country, and about 6 million
civil disputes of various kinds are mediated each year.
</P>
<P>
That is twice as many as first hearings of civil cases handled
by Chinese courts each year.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 civil disputes are resolved and prevented
from being intensified through mediation each year, the ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that mediation has made important contributions
to maintaining social stability, safeguarding economic development
and promoting legislation in china.
</P>
<P>
But lack of a comprehensive law covering mediation does not fit
the rapid development of the work and the important role it has
played, he said.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Rebuild Flood-hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government has launched
a long-term plan to rebuild the country's water infrastructure and
improve its water control system following the devastating floods
which hit the country this month, leaving 51 people dead and
64,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
The project, announced by the government today, consists of
three major steps.
</P>
<P>
First, immediate action will be taken by the government to
ensure people in flood-stricken areas have adequate housing and
children can go back to school before winter.
</P>
<P>
The second step aims at rebuilding infrastructure damaged by
the widespread flooding. The final step involves enlarging and
modernizing the country's reservoir system and rebuilding river
courses.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn up in the wake of torrential rain which has
caused widespread flooding across Poland over the last fortnight,
affecting 25 of the country's 47 provinces.
</P>
<P>
More than 1500 roads have been damaged, and 547,000 hectares of
farm land are under water.

<HEADLINE> Jetta Car Sales Up Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The No.1 Automobile and
Volkswagen Corporation in Changchun, northeast China's Jilin
Province, sold 20,100 Jetta cars in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
This is a 101.7 percent rise over the same period last
year. According to sources at the Sino-German joint venture,
20,600 Jettas were produced in the same period, up 45 percent from
last year.
</P>
<P>
Jetta's domestic market share rose to 8.3 percent in the first
quarter of the year and to 9.1 percent by the end of June,
compared to only 6.7 percent at the end of 1996. It is expected to
go up to 10 percent by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The company is reporting a profit also for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 Automobile and Volkswagen Corporation has China's
first modern assembly line, with a production capacity of 150,000
cars a year. The assembly line was completed last year when the
auto market was recovering after a more than a three-year slump,
during which time it was losing money.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that moves to increase the variety of autos and the
use of sales agents, which were started last year, have been key
factors in promoting growth.
</P>
<P>
The company now produces Audi sedans and three types of Jettas,
and now offers more color choices. It employs more than 150 sales
agents in 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions,
helping to ensure more even distribution of Jettas across the
country.
</P>
<P>
It has also improved after-sales service and has more than 150
service centers across the country, something that has helped win
more customers for the auto maker.

<HEADLINE> Italian Company Uses New Tech to Recycle Toxic Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian environment and land company
SIAT is hoping to use its new recycling technology to cash in on
the thousands of tons of toxic waste generated by used television
tubes, computers and neon lights.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Italy generated 56,000 tons of used tubes and 32,000
tons of electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
These used goods, which contain cadmium, mercury and other
heavy metals, usually pollute the environment after they are
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
The technology developed by the company sucks out the heavy
metals contained in the used goods and enables them to be
reused. Even glass can be recycled.
</P>
<P>
The items which can't be recycled and are finally discarded
account for only six percent of the total weight of the original
product.
</P>
<P>
Last year, SIAT handled just 174 tons of used TV tubes and 719
tons of electronics equipment, a tiny fraction of the total
dumped. This year, it's hoping for a bigger share of the market.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Resumes Import Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Just seven months after abolishing
import tariffs, Slovakia today reimposed across the board import
duties in the face of a rising trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Imports will now face tariffs of 7 percent in a move the
government said was taken to protect the national market.
</P>
<P>
Since tariffs were abolished on January 1 this year, the
country has witnessed a surge in imports which have seriously
affected domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
It also contributed to a widening trade deficit which is
expected to exceed last year's 74.5 billion koruna (about 2.4
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Slovakia took initial measures to try to curb imports in April
with limits on imports of non-alcoholic drinks, followed by limits
on imported beer in June.
</P>
<P>
But the new import tariffs have angered the neighboring Czech
Republic which has threatened to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia and the Czech Republic emerged from the former
Czechoslovakia in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Expecting 1.4 Million Tourist Visits in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Cuba hopes to receive at least 1.4
million tourists in 1998, an increase of 17.6 percent over the
projection for this year, a senior tourism official said today.
</P>
<P>
If fulfilled, said Deputy Tourism Minister Eduardo Rodriguez de
la Vega, the goal will put this island nation in a very favorable
position to hit its target of 2 million visitors in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the number of travelers to this biggest island of the
Antilles will be nearly 1.19 million, 18.5 percent more than 1996,
the first year it received more than one million visitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 580,000 foreigners visited Cuba in the first half of
1997, or 15.3 percent more than the same period last year, and 21
percent more are expected in the second half, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more and more foreign tourists are coming
to Cuba, from 340,000 in 1990 to 740,000 in 1995 and 1.4 million
the next year.

<HEADLINE> Argentina's Public Sector Owes 2 Million Dollars in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's public sector was
running a deficit equivalent to a little over 2.0 billion
U.S. dollars in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The six-month deficit, Finance Minister Pablo Guidotti said
today, was nearly 289 million dollars less than the goal agreed
upon with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF, an international financial institution based in
Washington D.C., the United States, set the half-year goal as 3.0
billion dollars and the annual goal as 4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The improved financial status of the country's public sector,
Guidotti said, should be attributed to greater economic activity,
better tax collection and more control over spending.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission will visit Argentina in mid-August to finalize
an extended credit agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the Argentine government has promised to better
plan the national budget, draw up new legislations to strengthen
credit relations and improve the execution of guarantees.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Moves to Cut Birth Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province will
launch a health-promotion campaign in a bid to reduce incidence of
birth defects, a disease causing infant death and poor quality of
population.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will allocate a special budget of
eight million yuan (963,000 US dollars) in the next four years to
down the incidence to half that of the year 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of counties of Shanxi will set up networks
to carry out pre-marital health examinations and provide medical
care for pregnant and lying-in women, according to a report in
today's Beijing-based "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The province has reported about 180 newly-borns among every
10,000 suffering from neural tube defects, which refer mainly to
babies born with no brains or with an exposed spine. Most infants
with such defects are born dead or die within a year.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi's incidence of birth defects is the highest not only in
China, but also in the entire world, China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
China has the highest incidence of neural tube defects in the
world, with some 80,000 to 100,000 cases a year - one-third of the
world's total, it said.
</P>
<P>
Health experts believed that the disease is closely related to
shortage of B-group vitamins and folic acid, known to be essential
to baby's development.
</P>
<P>
An investigation into diets for pregnant women conducted by the
China Medical University showed that an average 30 percent of
Chinese women of reproductive age suffer from vitamin B deficiency.
</P>
<P>
The research also found that if a woman takes about 0.4
milligrams of vitamin B supplements daily after marriage and until
her third month of pregnancy, the incidence of neural tube defects
is reduced 70 percent.

<P>
HAVANA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's Parliamentary President
Ricardo Alarcon returned home today from New York after talks on
migration between his delegation and their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The talks on migratory matters between Cuba and the United
States are an attempt to facilitate an orderly and controlled
migratory flow in compliance with a series of agreements the two
countries signed in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said that the acquittal in the United States of Cubans
accused of air piracy by Cuba was part of the deliberations held
on July 16-17.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the United States' acquittal in U.S. courts of
the Cubans who hijacked two Cuban airplanes was a violation of the
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Since the very beginning Cuba has demanded the extradition of
the Cubans in line with the accords, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Juventus coach Marcello Lippi
insisted that willpower will help his champions to stay atop of
Italian football next season.
</P>
<P>
Juventus were busy running between their Turin home and a
training base in northern Italy this week, to tune up for their
title defence and a revenge in the European Cup which they lost to
Borussia Dortmund.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of both Christian Vieri and Alen Boksic, Lippi
has spinned his hope in strikers with ball skills by recruiting
Filippo Inzaghi, top scorer last season with Atalanta.
</P>
<P>
Inzaghi is expected to play with Del Piero and newcomer Daniel
Fonseca, the Uruguayan who became strong under Lippi at Napoli in
1993-94 but performed poor after joining AS Roma.
</P>
<P>
Juventus also signed Napoli midfielder Fabio Pecchia to replace
Vladimir Jugovic, although a bigger influence will be effected by
the return of skipper Antonio Conte.
</P>
<P>
Conte injured cruciate ligaments last October in a World Cup
qualifier against Georgia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The trial for the alleged soccer
match-fixing, involving Zimbabwean Bruce Grobbelaar, was adjourned
on Monday as "no evidence" was found against him.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Banks, goalie for England's World Cup-winning team, told
the trial that he had seen videos of games highlighted in the case
and there was "not a scrap of evidence" to suggest that Grobbelaar
had fixed the games.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar, former Liverpool and Southampton keeper, had played
in a thoroughly professional and competent manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Grobbelaar also won support from former
England captain Jimmy Armfield and from former World Cup player
Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
Ball, manager of Southampton who signed Grobbelaar at the start
of the 1994 season, spoke of his admiration for Grobbelaar and
described how he had continued to pick him after the match-fixing
allegations were first made in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that Grobbelaar, together with three
others, was part of a plot involving a Far Eastern betting
syndicate to rig the results of Premier League games.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Park Fascinates Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Thirty Siberian tigers are now
feeling at home in the world's largest forest-based tiger park in
Harbin, capital city of Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, since the park opened in
January, over 200,000 people, including 20,000 from abroad, have
visited the park to enjoy the majestic Siberian tigers.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xinchen, manager of the park, says that the tigers, whose
ancestors roamed the earth one million years earlier than man, are
living mainly in Northeast China and Siberia.
</P>
<P>
There are now less than 300 wild Siberian tigers in the world;
In China, the number of the tigers in the wild stands at around
20, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
China founded a Siberian tiger breeding base in 1986 to
increase the number of the endangered beast. The base has bred 88
tigers so far and has become the biggest tiger-breeding base in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Last January, an area in the park was set up to copy the
tigers' natural habitat.

LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- World Boxing Council (WBC)
heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis is being lined up to defend his
title against Poland's Andrew Golota in Las Vegas on October 4.
</P>
<P>
Golota, based in the United States, had been notorious for his
fights against Riddick Bowe for being twice disqualified because
of persistent low blows.
</P>
<P>
Lewis's last two fights have seen little fighting at all.
</P>
<P>
His first challenger, fellow Briton Henry Akinwande, was
disqualified for holding during their Lake Tahoe bout two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in February, the Briton faced Oliver McCall in Las

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Australian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Treasurer Peter Costello conceded last night a
top-secret Australian report on the South Pacific was "very deeply
insulting" but refused to make a formal apology to regional
politicians subject to extraordinary personal criticisms. The
leaked 93-page report criticized some South Pacific island
countries and their leaders for economic mismanagement and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Fears that Sydney is losing its race with Melbourne have
driven a business group to set up a committee to crash through
where bureaucracies have failed to plan, promote and protect the
city. The committee is to be launched by the state government
where the city is located with an agenda ranging from urban
planning and tourism to the arts and law and order.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The hearing ability of Australian children is likely to
decline quicker than that of their parents because of pop music,
noisy films and head injuries, a new study shows. The National
Acoustic Laboratories study of 2,500 people from birth to old age
has also found that boys are faring worse than girls.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The six-week strike at resource giant Rio Tinto's Hunter
Valley mine is set to end from midnight tonight after the union
backed down in a dispute that had threatened to escalate into a
national stoppage. But Australia's biggest coal port has now been
affected by industrial action, with maritime unions imposed bans
and limitations on coal movements from Newcastle and threatening
full-scale stoppages that would disrupt coal exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- FIFA puts off a decision on
Ronaldo's disputed transfer from Barcelona to Inter Milan, saying
the two clubs should work out an agreement between themselves.
</P>
<P>
FIFA announced in a statement on Monday that its Players'
Status Committee would not make a ruling on the issue as scheduled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA is of the opinion that the two clubs could possibly reach
agreement," the statement said, "The Bureau for the Players'
Status Committee ... will therefore only examine the file and will
not take a formal decision on the matter..."
</P>
<P>
The two clubs, failing to reach a deal on the Brazilian's
record 27 million-dollar transfer after more than four hours' talk
on Monday, have agreed with FIFA to meet in Zurich again next week
to try to settle the case once and for all.

<P>
ATHENS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos has hailed the recent joint communique signed between
Greece and Turkey in Madrid as a major political development that
created a new situation and brought about their direct talks on
bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) today,
speaking in an interview with the Athens daily The News, Pangalos
said that Greece and Turkey would meet in November on the Greek
island of Crete on the sidelines of the summit meeting of European
countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the possibility of top-level Greek-Turkish meetings, he
said, "We now have this possibility and this is the major gain
from Madrid."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that although Washington continued its contacts
with both Athens and Ankara, he believed that the next initiative
should come from the two countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
He called on Ankara to abandon its past and look to the future,
noting that Athens would follow such an effort with a sincere
desire to help.

UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) is targeting poverty in China's western
provinces as its top development priority, according to UNDP Flash
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Holcombe, UNDP resident representative in Beijing, said
here recently that 40 percent of the UNDP's program in China for
1996-2001 is focused on poverty, according to the UNDP Flash.
</P>
<P>
UNDP funding for the new country program will be 110-120
million dollars, and that amount could double with other funding
from the Global Environment Facility, the Montreal Protocol and
cost-sharing.
</P>
<P>
In poor communities, micro-finance and income-generating
activities are being supported, and health and social services
strengthened. Other chief areas of UNDP assistance are
environmental protection and economic reform, according to the
UNDP publication.

<HEADLINE> USS Constitution Sails After 116 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The USS Constitution, the
wooden sailing ship that defended the United States during the War
of 1812 with Britain, today set sail for the first time in 116
years in Massachusetts Bay.
</P>
<P>
It set sail today for its 200th birthday. The sails were the
same configuration the 204-foot ship used in battle.
</P>
<P>
The wind was from the southwest at up to 14 knots in
Massachusetts Bay, pleasant for sailing.
</P>
<P>
Aboard for the historic cruise were politicians, military
officers and sailors formerly assigned to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 people, on land and on sea, watched as the
ship was towed out to open sea today from Marblehead, where it
spent the night after being brought from its berth in Boston
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Launched as one of the U.S. Navy's first warships, the ship,
Old Ironsides, was undefeated in 30 engagements. Its victory over
the HMS Guerriere in 1812 signaled America's birth of naval power.
</P>
<P>
The ship's most famous visit to Marblehead Harbor came on April
3, 1814, when it sought shelter from two 38-gun British frigates.
With nearly a third of its crew from Marblehead, the Constitution
had little problem navigating the narrow channel into the harbor.
The British ships wouldn't risk the unfamiliar water.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the ship's parts has taken three and a half
years.
</P>
<P>
Constitution's last free sail was in 1881. It visited ports on
both coasts in the early 1930s.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Canada to End Blockade in Salmon Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. today urged the
Canadian authorities to end a blockade of a U.S. Alaska's ferry by
Canadian fisherman.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has protested and continues to protest this
blockade," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"We also protest the refusal of Canadian federal authorities to
stop the blockade or to enforce the court injunction. Canada must
take action to enforce the court's judgment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Angered by allegations that Alaskan fishermen were taking more
than double their normal catch of salmon so far this year,
Canadian fishermen today continued for the third day their
blockade of the Alaska state ferry off Canada's British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian government has not enforced that injunction,
neither the provincial officials in British Columbia, nor the
federal officials in Ottawa," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
"The blockade harms innocent people who have nothing to do with
the salmon fishery," Burns said.

NEW YORK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
struggled higher today, but stocks were mostly lower in nervous
trading before Tuesday's congressional testimony by Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
The Dow gained 16.26 points to 7,906.72, after erasing an early
50-point deficit. The blue-chip barometer hit 8,000 for the first

sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators slumped for the third consecutive
session, led by the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 459.49
million shares, down from 585.61 million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Official to Be in Washington on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel's cabinet secretary
Danny Naveh is coming to Washington to hold talks with U.S.
mediator Dennis Ross, seeking a way out of the current stalemate
in the Middle East peace process, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to talking to him. We are trying to be
an effective mediator," spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
His visit followed the one by chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erakat who held talks with Ross and other senior department
officials last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Erakat urged the Clinton administration to devise a new
strategy to revive negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians or face the prospect of disaster in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
But the United States urged the two sides to revitalize their
negotiations by themselves, and Washington first has to "listen to
their ideas how the peace process can move forward," U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters the main objective of the Clinton
administration through talks with both the Israelis and
Palestinians "is to promote the willingness of the two sides to
move forward."
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians
have run aground for several months since the Israeli government,
in defiance to peace accords signed by both sides, decided in
March to build new Jewish housing units in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The United States has given only lip criticism on Israel's move
and, meanwhile, criticized the Palestinians for their protests
against Israel's construction plan.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Statements by Turkish Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece today criticized Turkish
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's statements made Sunday on
Turkey's partial integration process with northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greece's government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that
Ecevit's statements were "completely inopportune, incompatible
with efforts for a settlement of the Cyprus problem and
inconsistent with Turkey's effort to come closer to the European
Union (EU)."
</P>
<P>
"Such behavior compromises Turkey and is seen by the
international community as belonging to the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU had fixed in the most official and
categorical manner the timetable for accession negotiations with
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Reppas warned that Greece wanted calm and stability in the
region but at the same time it was ready to confront any
phenomenon and was on alert.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who as prime minister ordered the 1974 Turkish invasion
of Cyprus, attended the 23rd anniversary ceremony in the northern
part of the island Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit reportedly claimed that integration with Turkey of the
self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized
only by Ankara, was inevitable after last week's confirmation by
the EU that Nicosia was among the countries who would start the
accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Turkish Cyprus regime in the north would
live forever as "an independent state," but its foreign policy and
defense would be handled by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied northern Cyprus in the wake of a Greek Cypriot coup
engineered by the then ruling military junta in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Ruaf Denktash held their first face-to-face talks in three
years in Troutbeck, near New York, in a bid to seek solutions to
the Cyprus problem. The two also have agreed to hold their second
round of talks in Switzerland in August.

<HEADLINE> Germany, World Largest Importer of Farm Products in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite a slight drop in imports,
Germany was still the world largest importer of farm products in
1996, taking in nearly 10 percent of farm goods traded on the
world market, the German Ministry of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the ministry in Bonn today,
Germany's farm imports dropped by 0.5 percent to 67.8 billion
marks (37.9 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996 while exports climbed
nearly 4 percent to a new record of 39.5 billion marks (22.1
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The export boom, which was attributed to the weak German mark
and the fast-growing demand from central and eastern European
countries, had helped reduce the country's trade surplus in the
agricultural sector by 1.7 billion marks (950 million dollars) to
28.3 billion marks (15.8 billion dollars) last year, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union was still Germany's largest market, which
absorbed about two thirds of the country's farm exports, followed
by central and eastern Europe where Germany's farm exports soared
23 percent to 6 billion marks (3.4 billion dollars) last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States, expressing
regret at Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's refusal of
international mediation for the recent Cambodia crisis, today
called on him to reconsider the offer.
</P>
<P>
"The United States very much regrets Hun Sen's rejection of
ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asia Nations) mediation,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing
today. "We hope very much he will reconsider the constructive
recommendations."
</P>
<P>
Three ASEAN foreign ministers, assigned by the organization,
went to Phnom Penh, capital of Cambodia, Saturday and offered to
broker a settlement of the crisis, erupted after Hun Sen ousted
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh on July 6. But Hun Sen
flatly rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
The United States also sent Stephen Solarz as a special envoy
to Asia Saturday on a mission of resolving the crisis by
consulting with Asian leaders, including Hun Sen. He is also
scheduled to meet Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He will brief Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on his
talks with these leaders on July 26 in Kuala Lumpur, where the
ASEAN member countries will hold a foreign ministers meeting to
discuss the situation in Cambodia. Albright is to attend the
gathering.
