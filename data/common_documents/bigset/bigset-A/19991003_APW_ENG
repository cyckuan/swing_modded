<HEADLINE> Controversy Over Salt Company Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL VIZCAINO BIOSPHERE RESERVE, Mexico (AP) -- The Japanese need  
more salt than any nation on Earth. The Baja California peninsula 
of northern Mexico has the lagoons, sunshine and wind conditions 
needed to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
	But the area where a Japanese firm operates the world's largest  
salt evaporation plant -- and where they are planning to build 
another $150 million plant -- is also Latin America's largest 
biosphere reserve and the winter refuge of the gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan has shocked many environmentalist groups in the United  
States and Mexico, raised red flags at the office of Mexico's 
environmental prosecutor, and caused dismay among the population of 
Punta Abreojos, near the proposed new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're afraid we won't be able to make a living anymore,'' said  
Antonio Zuniga, secretary-general of the Punta Abreojos fishing 
cooperative, which provides the community of 1,000 people with 
electricity and drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're planning to build a dock where we do most of our  
fishing, and the discharges of brine on the open sea could kill the 
lobsters, fish, shrimp, abalone and oysters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exportadora de Sal, known as ESSA, is outgrowing its factory in  
the Ojo de Liebre lagoon just south of the city of Guerrero Negro, 
in the middle of the peninsula that stretches south from 
California. Its new plant would be built along a pristine lagoon 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes salt by evaporating seawater in salt flats  
near the ocean. Brine -- extremely salty water -- is a byproduct. 
Marine animals can be affected by sudden changes in the salinity of 
ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 environmental audit disclosed 298 deficiencies in the  
plant, ranging from unauthorized discharges of brine to the dumping 
of almost 300 industrial batteries in the lagoon. Rather than fine 
the company, authorities decided to give ESSA the chance to clean 
up its act. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the expansion plan has become a public-relations nightmare  
for ESSA, a joint venture between Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. and the 
Mexican Commerce Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups have launched an international campaign to  
prevent the expansion. In July, 34 of the world's most 
distinguished scientists signed an open letter protesting the 
expansion plans that appeared in several newspapers across the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council is leading  
a letter-writing campaign to Mitsubishi Chairman Hiroaki Yano and 
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. Writes Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a 
senior NRDC attorney: ``If Mitsubishi has its way, the whales of 
San Ignacio may soon return to their last unspoiled breeding 
grounds only to find an industrial wasteland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA claims the project would not pose a danger to marine  
wildlife and would provide a much-needed boost to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalist groups say the company is pressuring the  
government into approving the project and point to a possible 
conflict of interest: The Mexican government, which is responsible 
for enforcing environmental laws, owns 51 percent of ESSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Azuela, Mexico's environmental prosecutor, denied any  
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can categorically state that during the administration of  
President Ernesto Zedillo, environmental authorities have never 
been pressured into not imposing a fine, or imposing a lesser 
fine,'' Azuela said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government rejected the expansion project in 1995, but later  
decided to let the company appeal. ESSA is now working on an 
environmental impact study it says will prove the project is safe 
to the delicate environment of the biosphere reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA has said it will scrap the project if Mexico's  
environmental authorities find it poses a danger to the biosphere 
reserve, which UNESCO declared a World Heritage Site in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't want to be involved here or anyplace else  
in a project that would have environmental danger,'' said James E. 
Brumm, executive vice president for Mitsubishi International. 
``It's not something that we want to be known for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brumm said Mitsubishi and the Mexican government are in close  
agreement on developing the expansion project. Commerce Ministry 
officials declined to comment on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups are concerned with the possible effects on  
the gray whale, which migrates every year from the Arctic waters of 
the Bering Sea to mate and give birth in the warm waters of the 
peninsula. The spectacle draws hundreds of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine wildlife experts hired by ESSA to work on the  
environmental impact study have expressed doubts as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton D. Winant, a professor at the Scripps Institution of  
Oceanography in San Diego, said he would have no qualms about the 
project -- were it not located at a World Heritage Site. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Scripps professor and ESSA consultant, Paul Dayton, said  
the increased ship traffic represented a risk that could lead to 
the deaths of some whales. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is also under review by a congressional committee,  
members of which are skeptical about its long-term impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is it that the government previously said the project was  
illegal and is now reconsidering ESSA's proposal?'' congressman 
Jorge Gonzalez of the Green Party said at a recent hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA's operations and future expansion plans have also drawn  
concern from UNESCO. A team of UNESCO representatives made a 
three-day trip to the biosphere reserve in August to gauge the 
environmental impact of the salt plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation, which will present its conclusions in November,  
could declare the area an endangered World Heritage Site, an act 
which would put more pressure on the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of growing public pressure, ESSA has announced it  
has modified its project to minimize the possibility of 
environmental damage. But that's hardly any relief to the community 
of Punta Abreojos. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've made some changes, but it doesn't change the fact that  
it's going to affect the environment,'' Zuniga said. ``It could 
really affect our livelihood, and we're scared, because the damage 
it can cause would outweight any economic benefits.''

<HEADLINE> 3Com Slashes Palm VII Price by $100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Competition is driving down the price of  
electronic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressured by rival sellers of less expensive hand-held  
computers, 3Com Corp., is slashing prices by as much as $100 on its 
Palm electronic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Effective today, the Palm VII, a wireless organizer that lets  
users exchange messages and retrieve information off the Internet, 
costs $499, down from $599. 3Com also reduced the monthly fees it 
charges users to hook into the wireless network serving the device 
being released nationwide this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on less expensive Palm organizers also were cut, to as  
low as $179. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come as rivals introduce less expensive models. A 3Com  
official acknowledged that mainstream consumers shied away from the 
wireless Palm VII, its most expensive hand-held model, because it 
cost more than $500, an important purchase threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition is definitely starting to heat up,'' said Jim  
Kruger, product manager for the Palm.net service that gives Palm 
VII access to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Windows-based machines, Palm faces competition  
from a new low-priced personal digital assistant created by the 
Palm's creators, who struck out on their own last year. Handspring 
Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., targets its new $149 Visor to 
everyday consumers, instead of the mobile professionals loyal to 
the Palm computer. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com is not merely cutting Palm prices to compete; it is  
diversifying. The company now licenses its Palm operating program 
to rivals, much as Microsoft licenses its Windows operating system 
to makers of personal computers and hand-held gadgets. HandSpring, 
in fact, licenses the Palm operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5 million Palms have been sold since they were  
introduced in 1996, becoming a sort of mobile badge for on-the-go 
professionals seeking a convenient way to store contacts, 
appointments and notes. The product accounted for $570 million in 
fiscal 1999 sales at the Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com, or 10 
percent of the company's total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com plans to launch an initial public offering of the Palm unit  
early next year in a deal that could value the new company anywhere 
from $5 billion to $10 billion. 3Com hopes separating the two 
companies will help it focus on its main business of selling 
computer modems and networking equipment, such as routers that help 
data move between computers.

<HEADLINE> Evolution Taught the Mormon Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When students at Ensign School ask about  
evolution, Sue Otis just goes to the Book of Genesis and the Book 
of Mormon. Otherwise, her sixth, seventh and eighth graders don't 
spend much time studying Darwin's theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's just not a big deal to us,'' said Otis, a teacher  
who co-founded the private Mormon school in American Fork, about 30 
miles south of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the Heavenly Father has created all things, so we  
let him worry about those things,'' she said. ``We just try to 
teach truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the truth is, and how children should learn it, has been of  
particular interest since August, when the Kansas Board of 
Education adopted new testing standards that play down the 
scientific importance of evolution, including the theory that 
humans descended from apes and other lower species. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics and advocates alike say the decision could bring more  
religion into the classroom. In Utah -- the state with the highest 
concentration of any one religious denomination -- the issue isn't 
as clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
	While state standards require biology students to learn  
evolution according to the recommendations of the National 
Association of Science Teachers, practice in Utah's mostly Mormon 
classrooms may be very different. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Utah, teachers are cautious, mostly because of they don't  
feel comfortable teaching something they don't believe in 
themselves,'' said Gayle Ruzicka, president of the Utah Eagle 
Forum, a conservative organization pushing to allow more religious 
thought into public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``And those who do believe evolution understand the culture and  
know they could have hostility coming down all around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's core curriculum, finalized in 1995, says students in  
public high schools must understand the theory of biological 
evolution and be able to explain how species evolved from common 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a state that is 76 percent Mormon, science sometimes  
doesn't jibe with faith. In its official position on the origin of 
man, first set out in 1909 and restated in 1925, The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints declares that man is the child of 
God, formed in the divine image. 
</P>
<P>
	The church goes on to say that though the scriptures tell why  
God created man, they do not explain how -- a mystery that will be 
solved with the second coming. 
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, church leaders rely on this statement,  
issued in 1931: 
</P>
<P>
	``Leave biology, archaeology, and anthropology, no one of which  
has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind, to scientific 
research, while we magnify our calling in the realm of the 
Church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is plenty of room for interpretation.  
</P>
<P>
	Duane Jeffery, a zoology professor at the majority-Mormon  
Brigham Young University, estimated about 40 percent of students 
who take the school's required biology class come in opposed to the 
idea of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Biology 100 teachers usually explain the church's  
position on the subject before teaching the science. It might be 
simpler to skip over evolution, he said, but teaching biology 
without Darwin's theory is like teaching chemistry without the 
periodic table. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much better that students learn this within the context  
of faith, rather than seeing it used as a hammer against 
religion,'' said Jeffery, who frames the science by telling 
students that God works through natural law. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are different in public high schools, where the U.S.  
Supreme Court has forbidden the teaching of creationism, the belief 
that a higher power created the universe, because it violates the 
separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll occasionally have calls into our office,'' said Brett  
Moulding, science education specialist for the state Office of 
Education. ``We always go back to what is science and what we 
believe and what we know based on evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Open debate about teaching evolution has been rare in Utah,  
where some religious families just trust students are being taught 
in their tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The most ardent opponents of evolution are turning not to  
politics but to a handful of private schools that teach according 
to Mormon doctrine -- schools such as Ensign and its sister school, 
Ensign High School, which started up this fall with five students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel like the kind of options we wanted to provide  
our children were available anywhere else,'' said Brian Bates, a 
co-founder of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Students there find much the same approach to evolution those at  
the elementary school do: that Darwin and his proponents came up 
with just one of many theories that attempt to understand God's 
working in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people have to realize that a religious person need  
not be threatened by error, they just need to know the truth,'' 
Bates said. ``We don't fully understand God's work and are trying 
to explain the processes of our world. There's probably some truth 
in there and there's probably some error in there, too.''

<HEADLINE> Montjeu Wins Arc de Triomphe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Montjeu won the Arc de Triomphe on Sunday,  
overtaking El Condor Pasa late in the showcase race to complete an 
exceptional season. 
</P>
<P>
	Montjeu, ridden by Mick Kinane and trained by John Hammond,  
captured the French and Irish derbies earlier this year. The 
victory in the 78th edition of the race at Longchamps was worth 
$862,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Olivier Peslier, attempting to win a fourth consecutive  
Arc de Triomphe, was well back on Borgia. 
</P>
<P>
	El Condor Pasa was trying to become the first Japanese-owned  
horse to win this race the Arc de Triomphe. He led from the start 
and was ahead by about three lengths with more than a furlong to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	But Montjeu closed the gap and moved in front with less than a  
furlong left. He won by two-thirds of a length, covering the 1 1/2 
miles on a soft track in 2 minutes, 37 seconds. Croco Rouge was a 
distant third.

<HEADLINE> Leyland Hands Out Final Lineup Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Arguing with umpires and making late-game lineup  
moves, Jim Leyland managed until the very end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies rewarded Leyland with a ninth-inning  
comeback Sunday, giving him a 9-8 victory over the San Francisco 
Giants in his final game as manager. Leyland is walking away with 
two years left on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those games where you're still managing hard,''  
a composed Leyland said. ``You're trying to win it. I wanted that 
game real bad. I'm not going to lie about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory left the Rockies with a 72-90 record in their only  
season under Leyland, who plans to go home to Pittsburgh before 
deciding whether to remain with Colorado in another capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, who won a World Series title with the Florida Marlins  
in 1997, is 1,067-1,127 in 14 years with Pittsburgh, Florida and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough, but I'm a big boy and I enjoyed it, and it was a  
great way to go out,'' Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants looked like they would spoil Leyland's farewell at  
Coors Field, taking leads of 2-0, 5-2, 7-4 and 8-7, but the Rockies 
came back each time, winning the game on Dante Bichette's RBI 
single and Edgard Clemente's sacrifice fly in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette gave a Tiger Woods-like fist pump after his run-scoring  
hit, and Todd Helton was mobbed near home plate after he beat 
Armando Rios' strong throw from right field. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland was in the middle of the pack and got several hugs and  
pats on the back from players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won this one for Jim,'' Bichette said. ``I know it has been  
a disappointing year, but he's had a great career. We wanted to 
send him out with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland was active throughout the game, pacing in the dugout and  
jogging out to dispute calls by second-base umpire Hunter 
Wendelstedt in the fifth and first-base umpire Steve Rippley in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument with Wendelstedt was animated, but Leyland went  
back to the dugout almost immediately after hearing Rippley's 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're doing everything you can to win every game, and this  
was no different,'' Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Leyland smiled and shook hands with Giants  
manager Dusty Baker and all four umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `Good luck, man. I'll miss ya,''' Baker said.  
``I'll see him down the road. I'm sad for us to lose this game, but 
you've got to be happy for him to win his last game, so it's a 
double-edged sword of emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, 54, told his players in September that he would not  
return for the final two years of a three-year, $6 million 
contract. He said he no longer had the passion for the daily rigors 
of the job and wanted to spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely no second thoughts whatsoever,'' Leyland  
said. ``I'm very comfortable with my decision. I know that in the 
near future, they're going to have their third manager here, and I 
want to wish them the best in their selection process. I hope they 
get the right guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies hired Leyland last winter, thinking he would be able  
to turn around a team that finished 77-85 in 1998, but Colorado 
actually got worse, finishing in last place for the first time in 
its seven-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little embarrassed at the type of year we had,'' Leyland  
said. ``I don't really apologize to anybody but the fans. I gave it 
my best. It just wasn't good enough, but I do apologize to the fans 
because they were loyal and they stayed with us throughout the 
whole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Detroit manager Buddy Bell reportedly is the front-runner  
to replace Leyland. Other candidates include former New York 
Yankees second baseman Willie Randolph and Cleveland hitting coach 
Charlie Manuel.

<HEADLINE> Burn 4, Galaxy 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Jason Kreis had two goals and an assist Sunday as  
the Dallas Burn overcame a two-goal halftime deficit for a 4-3 
victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the fifth straight at home for the Burn (18-13), who  
moved into a for second place in the MLS Western Division with the 
Colorado Rapids. Los Angeles (19-12), which led 3-1 at halftime, is 
in first place in the conference and could have clinched it with a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreis has 17 goals and 15 assists and became the first player in  
MLS history to go 15-15 in one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreis opened the scoring with a rebound of his penalty kick in  
the 7th minute. Los Angeles' Carlos Hermosillo then sandwiched 
goals around on own goal by Brandon Pollard of the Burn for the 
two-goal halftime lead. 
</P>

	Kreis scored on a penalty kick in the 64th minute and Chad

<HEADLINE> NYC Art Exhibit Attracts Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The curious gathered in long lines for a second  
day to see the art exhibit Mayor Rudolph Giuliani found so 
offensive he cut the museum's funding, a decision he defended again 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The art critics, meanwhile, had mixed reviews.  
</P>
<P>
	The New Yorker magazine said the controversial exhibit at the  
Brooklyn Museum of Art ``offers plenty of targets for indignation'' 
-- such as a rotting cow's head covered with flies and mannequins of 
little girls with genitals on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	But the reviewer called the piece of art at the heart of the  
firestorm -- a painting of a black madonna with a clump of elephant 
dung and cutouts from pornographic magazines -- ``gorgeous, sweet 
and respectful of its subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time magazine's critic called the exhibit ``a sheep in wolf's  
clothing'' that has ``generated more noise than it deserves.'' The 
critic dismissed the Madonna portrait as having ``no real depth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum -- which usually gets little notice from either  
tourists or the media -- is basking in the attention. More than 
9,200 people viewed ``Sensation'' Saturday, its first day. It was 
the largest opening in the museum's 175-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 showed up Sunday, waiting in line for up to 90  
minutes and paying $9.75 for tickets. The museum's gift shop ran 
out of black T-shirts printed with the word ``SENSATION.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One woman who braved the crowds, Rachel Fedde, said the exhibit  
``was really well put-together, impressive, great, beautiful.'' But 
she added that the Virgin Mary ``was not remarkable one way or 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who is raising money for a likely Republican bid for  
the U.S. Senate next year, hit the national talk show circuit to 
defend his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor is withholding the city's October payment of the  
museum's $7 million annual subsidy on the grounds that it cannot 
charge admission in a city-owned building. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum has sued to get the funding restored, claiming the  
mayor is violating the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the mayor of the city of New York, am I going to approve  
the hard-earned dollars of the people of this city supporting this? 
I have to say no. And for standing up for that principle, I'm being 
attacked by the First Amendment hysterics,'' Giuliani said Sunday 
on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters had demonstrated outside the museum on both sides of  
the issue since Friday, but their numbers on Sunday had dwindled to 
two. One held a sign that read: ``Father, forgive them, for they 
know not what they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal John O'Connor, head of the New York Catholic  
Archdiocese, thanked his followers for writing letters of protest 
about the Madonna painting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our blessed mother,'' he said, adding that he believed  
anti-Catholicism is ``one of the few things left in the country in 
which there seems to be very little uproar when attacks are 
forthcoming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn, black  
activist Rev. Herbert Daughtry said the painting's African features 
are really at the heart of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the feces, but the face,'' he said. ``It's not the  
picture, it's the pigmentation.''

<HEADLINE> Britney Spears Explains Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Singer Britney Spears says that a growth spurt,  
not breast implants, have contributed to her increased proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first signed with the record label, we took a lot of  
photos, and those were the pictures that got used. I weighed 105 
pounds; I weigh 130 now. I went through a major growth spurt,'' 
Spears, 17, tells the Oct. 9 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Spears, whose ``Baby One More Time'' album has sold more than 5  
million copies, says the rumors bothered her for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some interviews I would just start crying,'' she says.  
``I'd be like, 'Why are you being so rude to me?' After a while 
people stopped staying stuff. But for a while it got really 
tough.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Show Flutie More Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An unopened box of Flutie Flakes sits prominently  
displayed on a shelf in the middle of the Dolphins locker room. As 
anyone familiar with the Miami-Buffalo rivalry knows, this is more 
than just a simple box of cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	What becomes of the box will be decided Monday night when Doug  
Flutie and the Bills (2-1) play the Dolphins in a rematch of last 
year's first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was after that game, a 24-17 Miami victory, that Jimmy  
Johnson smashed open the Flutie Flakes, scattering cereal around 
the locker room and touching off a controversial, flake-stomping 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	In the leadup to this week's game, the Dolphins (2-0) seemed to  
showing more respect for Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	It's well deserved.  
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 former CFL quarterback threw for a combined 566  
yards and four touchdowns in two games against the Dolphins last 
season. He also ran for 38 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes things happen for them,'' Dolphins safety Calvin  
Jackson said. ``He's their offense. For a defensive back, whenever 
you play a guy who scrambles, it's tough. That's when the damage 
can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie has inflicted plenty of damage in 27 NFL starts, most of  
them coming last season when Flutiemania swept through Buffalo and 
the NFL. He is 18-9 as a starter, including wins against the New 
York Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He rushed for a career-high 67 yards against the Jets, including  
a 24-yard scramble for a touchdown. He also leveled Jets linebacker 
Mo Lewis to spring running back Antowain Smith for a 12-yard run 
that set up the game's first score. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie has completed 59 percent of his passes this season and  
has rushed for 123 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my standpoint, I'm seeing teams for the second and third  
time around, and in the case of Miami, this will be the fourth time 
I've seen their defense, and I'm just getting more confident in 
running our offense,'' Flutie said. ``Hopefully, the more time I 
spend on the field, the more comfortable I'll get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie won't surprise Miami. The Dolphins are well aware of his  
abilities. They've seen it all up close. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very effective at running their offense,'' defensive end  
Trace Armstrong said. ``He forces you to be disciplined as a line. 
If you get sloppy in your rush lanes, he can hurt you. You don't 
want to allow a guy a scramble opportunity by doing something 
stupid. You want to try to hem him in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie has some big-play weapons surrounding him.  
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Andre Reed, a 16-year veteran, has 120 regular-season  
catches for 1,711 yards vs. Miami, the most by any receiver against 
the Dolphins. In the three meetings last season, Reed caught 12 
passes for 147 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds was even better.  
</P>
<P>
	He hauled in 17 passes for 380 yards and scored three  
touchdowns, one in each game. Moulds, who led the AFC last season 
with 1,368 yards receiving, torched the Dolphins secondary for an 
NFL postseason record 240 yards in the playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith can be dangerous, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've shown a real commitment to running the football,''  
Armstrong said. ``They may not have success early in the game, but 
they're going to stay with it and keep pounding away and that 
patience has paid off for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patience is what paid off for Flutie, who spent eight seasons in  
Canada before returning to the NFL and leading the Bills to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great story,'' Dolphins safety Shawn Wooden said.  
``He's a great quarterback and he makes their offense right now.''

<HEADLINE> Record Year for Home Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Home runs sailed over fences at a record pace  
this year, even though Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa didn't set any 
individual marks. 
</P>
<P>
	With only Sunday's rain-delayed Cincinnati at Milwaukee game  
remaining, there were 5,524 homers in 2,426 games, a record average 
of 2.28 and up from 2.05 last year. The previous high of 2.19 was 
set in 1996, when 4,962 homers were hit in 2,227 games. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire beat Sosa 65-63 in the individual home-run race, the  
third- and fourth-highest single-season totals behind McGwire's 70 
and Sosa's 66 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty proud of myself as far as how I overcame a lot of  
things and to put up the numbers I put up this year,'' McGwire 
said. ``It just goes to show you the mind is a lot stronger than 
people think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head matchup, each homered on the regular-season's  
final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a happy man, not disappointed,'' Sosa said. ``I had a  
great year. For me, that's something to be happy about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. won his third straight AL home-run  
title and fourth overall, beating Rafael Palmeiro of Texas 48-47. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen players hit 40 or more homers, matching last year's  
total but still four short of the record set in 1996. A record 45 
players hit 30 or more homers, two more than the previous high set 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Larry Walker won his second straight National League  
batting championship. Walker, who started only 111 games because of 
injuries, hit .379, the highest NL average for a full season since 
Arky Vaughan hit .385 for Pittsburgh in 1935. Tony Gwynn hit .394 
in the strike-shortened 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's 42-point victory over Arizona's Luis Gonzalez was the  
biggest in the NL since 1948, when Stan Musial hit .376 and 
finished 43 points ahead of Richie Ashburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good, I guess. In the same breath, it's a bad thing,''  
Walker said. ``It's all right to have a batting title, then keep 
playing. But to win the batting title and go home, it doesn't mean 
as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Nomar Garciaparra won his first AL batting title,  
hitting .357 to finish eight points higher than New York's Derek 
Jeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra has a sore right wrist and hasn't played since  
Thursday, but says he'll be ready for Boston's playoffs opener 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice but it hasn't really sunk in yet. I don't think  
maybe it'll sink in until after everything is all over,'' 
Garciaparra said. '' Myself and the team are focused on what's to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's Manny Ramirez had 165 RBIs, the highest total in the  
major leagues since Jimmie Foxx had 175 for Boston in 1938 and 
matching the 12th-highest total ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-eight players had 100 or more RBIs, eight more than the  
previous record, also set in '96. McGwire led the NL with 147 RBIs, 
matching his 1998 total and became the first player to play a full 
season and finish with more RBIs than hits (145). 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland scored 1,009 runs, the most in the majors since Boston  
scored 1,027 in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Craig Biggio hit its 56th double Sunday, the highest  
in the majors since Detroit's George Kell had 56 in 1950 and most 
in the NL since Joe Medwick had 56 for St. Louis in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Randy Johnson led the majors in strikeouts for the  
sixth time, fanning 364, the fourth-highest season total ever. He 
struck out 10 or more 23 times, matching the record Nolan Ryan set 
with the California Angels in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Pedro Martinez won his first AL strikeout title with  
313 and won his first AL ERA title at 2.03 -- he won the NL ERA 
title two years ago for Montreal. Martinez also led the major 
leagues in wins, going 23-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Mike Hampton had the most victories in the NL, beating  
Los Angeles on Sunday to finish 22-4, one win ahead of teammate 
Jose Lima. Johnson won the NL ERA title at 2.48. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Mariano Rivera led the AL with 45 saves and  
Montreal's Ugueth Urbina led the NL with 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Tony Womack won his third straight NL steals title,  
swiping 72, and Seattle's Brian Hunter won the AL title with 44 -- 
the fewest for an AL champion since Baltimore Luis Aparicio won 
with 40 in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero had 19 errors, matching the  
post-World War II high for outfielders of 19, by Lou Brock (1966) 
and Chili Davis (1988). After making nine errors in April, Guerrero 
avoided becoming the first outfielder to reach 20 since Bob Johnson 
of the 1935 Philadelphia Athletics.

<HEADLINE> Hindu Nationalists To Win Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A rag-tag coalition led by Hindu  
nationalists probably won India's parliamentary elections that 
ended Sunday, giving the nation the chance of its first stable 
government in three years, exit polls predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two exit polls conducted by television networks at the end of  
the world's biggest election said the Bharatiya Janata Party, 
headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, would return to 
power with help from 21 parties in its campain alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The main rival Congress Party -- led by Italian-born Sonia  
Gandhi, widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi -- and its 
allies placed second, but with too few seats to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the five-phase, month-long election, in which 605  
million Indians were given the opportunity to vote, are expected 
this week after the ballots are counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee will probably return as prime minister, a post he held  
for 13 months before his minority government was toppled in April 
by a no-confidence vote in parliament, forcing India into its third 
election since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The BJP had two seats when it first entered the parliament in  
1984, and has gained strength on a platform of Hindu nationalism. 
However, with Vajpayee at the helm of a coalition government, the 
party has not pursued many of its more radical issues. 
</P>
<P>
	An exit poll conducted for state-run Doordarshan television by  
Development Research Survey gave Vajpayee's coalition, the National 
Democratic Alliance, 287 seats. That's slightly more than half the 
543 elected seats in parliament needed to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
	Another poll, conducted by Insight Ltd. for the private STAR-TV  
network, said the alliance would win 295 to 305 seats. Both exit 
polls, which have a margin of error of one percentage point, were 
conducted on the five voting days that began Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of districts will vote Monday and Tuesday and on Oct.  
28. Flooding, the assassination of candidates and electoral fraud 
required postponements or revotes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take some satisfaction that with a difficult election  
with limited forces ... it's gone off very well,'' said Chief 
Election Commissioner Manmohar Singh Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	While violence marred the election -- with about 95 people killed  
since the voting process began Sept. 3 -- that death toll was far 
below past elections. Most deaths came in clashes between rival 
party supporters and in attacks by separatist militants trying to 
enforce election boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, about half a million armed soldiers, police and  
government officials were deployed in 10 states to ensure safe and 
fair elections, Gill said. Still, 39 people died over the weekend, 
mostly in shootings and bombings by separatist rebels in three 
northeastern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over half of registered voters cast ballots in the  
election, Gill said. Voter turnout has decreased rapidly in recent 
years, partly because of the frequency of elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Participation was even lower this year as most candidates traded  
insults instead of discussing basic issues, such as clean water, 
health, education and employment. 
</P>
<P>
	The BJP launched a bitter campaign against Mrs. Gandhi, saying  
Indians should be ashamed to choose a ``foreigner'' for the top 
job. She took Indian citizenship 18 years after her 1968 marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, in turn, portrayed the BJP as a group promoting  
religious fanaticism and its allies as political opportunists. 
</P>
<P>
	India was governed by the Congress party for most of its 52  
years of independence. But its popularity has eroded over the years 
as its leaders have gotten embroiled in scandals. That's allowed 
regional parties that have championed local issues to gather more 
support.

<HEADLINE> A Call to Arms for Playoff Openers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	To David Cone, Omar Vizquel and most everyone else in the AL  
playoffs, these matchups look extremely familiar. 
</P>
<P>
	New York vs. Texas, Boston vs. Cleveland. For the second  
straight year, and third time overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes for an interesting playoff,'' said Cone, who helped  
pitch the Yankees to the World Series championship last year. ``All 
four teams legitimately think they have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the AL was all set -- Game 1 was at Yankee Stadium on  
Tuesday night, Game 1 was at Jacobs Field on Wednesday night -- the 
NL picture was jumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston clinched the NL Central on Sunday, but New York and  
Cincinnati were scrambling for the final spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets beat Pittsburgh 2-1 to assure at least a tie for the  
wild card, and Cincinnati needed to beat Milwaukee to force a 
one-game playoff. But the Reds-Brewers game at County Stadium was 
delayed by rain for five hours, 47 minutes and did not begin until 
shortly before 10 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, this much was certain: Greg Maddux would throw the first  
pitch for Atlanta in the best-of-5 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were to open the first round Tuesday at Turner Field  
against either the Astros or Reds. Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine and 
John Smoltz, if necessary, were to follow in Atlanta's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our pitching staff is in great shape,'' Braves manager Bobby  
Cox said. ``It's as healthy as it's been all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Bank One Ballpark, Randy Johnson was to start for Arizona  
against an undetermined opponent. The Big Unit and the second-year 
Diamondbacks play Game 1 on Tuesday at 11:09 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know a lot about the National League clubs,'' Arizona  
manager Buck Showalter said. ``You don't hear the players saying, 
`If this happens or that happens.' We know we will be playing a 
quality opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late start time at Arizona was partly to make sure all games  
in the first round are televised -- ESPN, Fox and NBC will take 
turns showing them. 
</P>
<P>
	At Yankee Stadium, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez (17-9) will  
pitch the opener against Texas' Aaron Sele (18-9). 
</P>
<P>
	Texas will be trying to avenge last year's three-game sweep --  
and a four-game playoff loss in the opening round in 1996 -- to the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last postseason, the hard-hitting Rangers scored only one run in  
the entire series against New York and batted just .141. They have 
since added Rafael Palmeiro to a lineup that includes Juan Gonzalez 
and Ivan Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great deal of respect for that organization, for the  
job Joe Torre has done,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``They 
are a professional team. But they had the season of the century 
last year. They're 15, 16 games less this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte is scheduled to start Game 2 for the Yankees on  
Thursday, followed by Roger Clemens and, if necessary, Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to come down to pitching,'' Torre said Sunday.  
``That's the only way you can stop their kind of offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, the Yankees hope their past will benefit them in the  
present. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience makes you better,'' Torre said. ``When you go  
into postseason play year after year, there are things you take to 
the table with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who became the first team in the majors to score  
1,000 runs since 1950, will face Pedro Martinez in the opener. He 
led the majors in wins (23) and ERA (2.07) and topped the AL with 
313 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez won Game 1 at Jacobs Field last year, but the Indians  
came back to win the next three and chase Boston. In 1995, 
Cleveland completed a three-game sweep of the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping the third time is the charm against these guys,''  
Boston's Mike Stanley said. ``It's frustrating to continue to play 
them and keep losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel knows it won't be easy against Martinez and the Red Sox.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the matchup is going to be interesting,'' the  
Cleveland shortstop said. ``I really think Boston is the toughest 
team to play right now because they have been in the wild-card race 
and playing under pressure.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's right-wing Bharatiya Janata  
Party will probably return to power with more strength than ever, 
winning the most seats in parliament, according to an exit poll 
Sunday at the end of the monthlong elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The party led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is expected  
to win 184 seats on its own and 287 with its 21 allies, giving it a 
clear majority of the 543 elected seats in the lower house of 
Parliament, according to state-run Doordarshan television. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll showed the main opposition Congress Party and its  
allies with 174 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	A clear majority for the BJP indicates that it could stay in  
power for a full five-year term. India has had three elections 
since 1996 because of unstable governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by Development Research and Associates, has  
a margin of error of 1 percent, and was based on interviews with 
34,000 voters in 155 election districts across India. 
</P>
<P>
	Vote counting begins Wednesday, and a clear trend is expected to  
emerge by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The BJP had two seats when it first entered Parliament in 1984.  
It gained strength on a platform of Hindu nationalism. However, 
with Vajpayee at the helm of a coalition government, the party has 
not pursued many of its more radical issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The election was called because Vajpayee lost a confidence  
motion by one vote in April, when a member of his unwieldy 
coalition defected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take some satisfaction that with a difficult election  
with limited forces ... it's gone off very well,'' said Election 
Commissioner Manmohar Singh Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 605 million Indians were given the opportunity to vote in  
the world's biggest democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	While violence marred the election -- with about 95 people killed  
since the voting process began Sept. 3 -- that death toll was far 
below past elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Most deaths came in clashes between rival party supporters and  
in attacks by separatist militants trying to enforce election 
boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill said 56 percent of the 133 million people eligible to vote  
Sunday had cast their ballots. Half a million troops, police and 
officials deployed in 10 states to ensure safe, free and fair 
elections. But 39 people died over the weekend, most of which were 
blamed on separatists rebels in three northeastern states. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of constituencies must still vote Monday, Tuesday and  
on Oct. 28, because flooding, ballot fraud or candidates' 
assassinations forced postponement. But a new parliament is 
expected to be seated by the middle of the month.

<HEADLINE> 1989 San Francisco Quake Lookback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Paul Cobb was standing in his bedroom  
when he heard the Cypress Freeway come crashing down in a welter of 
concrete, metal and blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody ran out in the street, people started saying, 'Look  
at the freeway! Look what has happened!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb ran to help people who had life enough left to squirm out  
of their mangled cars. Without time to think, he and many other 
residents of West Oakland, a largely black, mostly poor 
neighborhood, rose up in a united rescue effort, hauling out 
ladders, climbing atop the wrecked freeway, getting medical help. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the shining stories of the disastrous 1989  
earthquake that shook the San Francisco Bay area 10 years ago this 
month, killing 67 and leaving $7 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the back of Cobb's mind that dreadful day, another rescue  
effort was born: At last, a chance for West Oakland to crawl out of 
the shadow of the hated elevated freeway that had loomed over the 
neighborhood for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-eight hours after the quake, a group of city leaders and  
neighborhood activists met in the dignified grey-and-white dining 
room of Cobb's restored Victorian home. 
</P>
<P>
	By meeting's end, said Cobb, they had a plan -- ``Now that Mother  
Nature's shaken her hips and caused the freeway to fall, this is an 
opportunity to reroute it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	From the beginning, the Cypress Freeway was a hated symbol of  
power and powerlessness. It went up in 1957, slicing West Oakland 
into two. Suburban commuters thundered along its concrete 
shoulders; urban residents lived beneath, sucking in carbon 
monoxide fumes and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents fought against it without success.  
</P>
<P>
	``The world you live in today as far as black people was not the  
world we lived in then,'' said Bill Love, who was a teen-ager when 
the Cypress went up, linking the Bay Bridge and San Francisco to 
Interstate 880 and the southeastern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, businesses dwindled and died. The neighborhood, an  
eclectic mix of mansions and humble railroad cottages perched on 
the lip of the San Francisco Bay, turned into a dusty relic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was dirty, it was noisy, it divided West Oakland into two  
areas -- below and above,'' said Love. ``It was of no benefit to 
those of us who lived in West Oakland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The world came crashing to a stop on Oct. 17, 1989. The  
7.1-magnitude quake struck as the Oakland A's were about to play 
the San Francisco Giants in the World Series, wreaking havoc 
throughout the bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy miles south in Santa Cruz, falling buildings killed  
three people. More died in San Francisco's upscale Marina district. 
</P>
<P>
	But the quake hit hardest at the Cypress, where 42 people were  
killed in a concrete avalanche when the top deck thundered down on 
the lower roadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Taylor, who lives in a housing complex 30 feet from the  
old freeway, rushed outside to marshall neighborhood children to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were saying, 'But Mrs. Taylor, the ground is moving.' I  
told them to just keep moving,'' she said. She shooed the children 
inside, but they were already crying. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had seen people under this freeway, they knew that before  
this freeway crashed, people were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those who came running to help lived on the fringe of  
society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Street people, who were the ones who were in tennis shoes,  
scaled that mess of concrete to save lives and there were dozens of 
them,'' said Cobb, who remembers standing on the ground marveling 
at their daring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys that people looked at as winos were climbing up the  
freeway,'' said Ralph Williams, the unofficial ``Mayor of West 
Oakland.'' The early rescuers helped people down and directed 
official rescue teams to survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were actually very, very heroic,'' Love said.  
</P>
<P>
	There were other heroes. Buck Helm, the tough stevedore who  
survived 89 hours buried in the rubble and held on for 28 days in 
the hospital. Six-year-old Julio Berumen, whose leg had to be 
amputated to free him from the car where his mother died. 
</P>
<P>
	People remembered something else, too -- how a forgotten  
community risked life and limb to come to the aid of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole world looked at this neighborhood, they  
remembered those people were climbing on the structures trying to 
save these folks,'' said Warren Widener, a county supervisor in 
1989. ``I think that they said that this neighborhood deserved 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, neighborhood activists battered futilely against the  
doors of bureaucracy. In 1989, they knew some of the people inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by allies like Widener, Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson and  
Congressman Ron Dellums, ``For the first time we had the 
opportunity to pick up the telephone and say, 'We don't want to do 
this,''' said Love. 
</P>
<P>
	They showed they were serious early on, going to Washington to  
talk to transportation officials and hiring their own engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	It took the best part of a decade and about $1 billion, but in  
July 1997, the new freeway opened, a single deck skirting most of 
West Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the old freeway is gone, West Oakland's troubles  
aren't over. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of industry have left contaminated soil, and crime is  
still high. But new roads will soon link the neighborhood with the 
thriving shops and restaurants of next-door Emeryville, and new 
people are moving in. 
</P>
<P>
	On a sunny afternoon, Cobb and his friends were all smiles as  
they walked past the site of the old freeway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where it used to be,'' they said, gesturing to a  
grassy expanse that is awaiting landscaping improvements. For Cobb, 
the view is a pleasant one. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first what we had was a nightmare that divided us all with  
this poisonous air,'' he said. ``Now the air is clear and we have a 
field of dreams.''

<HEADLINE> Tax Credit Provides Crucial Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tax credit for the working poor that House  
Republicans want to convert from a lump sum to monthly payments 
provides crucial annual savings for people trying to get ahead, a 
study finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the 1998 earned income tax credit recipients questioned in  
the draft Syracuse University study said they planned to save at 
least a portion of their annual check so they could move to a 
better neighborhood, pay tuition or buy or repair a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The EITC appears to be our most effective federal program for  
leading low-income families on a path toward true economic 
independence,'' said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Center 
for Policy Research at Syracuse. ``The EITC is what makes these 
expenditures possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans want to spread the tax credit payment over a  
year, saving $8.7 billion in fiscal 2000 and pushing the cost of 
the credit into the following budget year. That would help balance 
the 2000 budget without dipping into Social Security accounts or 
breaking self-imposed spending caps. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has pledged to veto appropriations bills that  
change the payments. GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush 
has joined Democrats in questioning whether such a chance might 
harm the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Created in 1975, the credit is intended to keep people working  
and to offset the payroll taxes they contribute for Social Security 
and Medicare. Last year, taxpayers earning between $10,000 and 
$31,000 were eligible, depending on number of children. The average 
1998 claim was $1,459 for 19.4 million taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the GOP arguments for making 12 payments over the year is  
that poor people actually need more help making monthly ends meet 
and that the single payment is more difficult for people to manage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's something that helps families in need to get  
their money on a monthly basis instead of one cash drop sometime in 
the spring,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Syracuse study suggests otherwise. It was based on  
interviews with 826 Chicago-area EITC recipients who used a free 
tax clinic to do their returns in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of that group expected a refund when they came  
into the clinic and had definite ideas of what to do with it, the 
research shows. Three-quarters said they would use the money to pay 
bills or meet household expenses, but 49 percent of those added 
they would save some money for bigger purchases, tuition or moving 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``These uses suggest that the EITC also plays a large role in  
improving social mobility, a finding we did not expect,'' Smeeding 
said. ``There is a large and growing recognition of the program and 
the potential payoff for working households.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that many working people use their annual  
payments to open their first checking or savings account at a 
financial institution. Without such accounts, Smeeding said working 
poor are ``less likely to be able to effectively prioritize'' how 
to use a large check. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the study recommends that the federal government  
consider using electronic transfers of the payments to banks or 
other financial institutions so that recipients are encouraged to 
open those accounts 
</P>
<P>
	``Checking and savings accounts offer the possibility for having  
both precautionary savings and for asset building,'' Smeeding said. 
</P>
<P>
	But recipients seemed less interested in paying off credit card  
debt. About 25 percent of the group had credit cards and 80 percent 
of them had debt averaging $2,400, yet Smeeding found that only 18 
percent listed paying off the cards as a priority for their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the study concluded that the credit enables working poor  
to meet most of their pressing consumption needs and also set aside 
money for ``upward mobility.'' Without it, four out of 10 
recipients would be unable to reach their goals or would experience 
a significant delay.

<HEADLINE> Seed Bank Is 'Botanical Seatbelt' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The small flower that lived on the banks of the  
Slapton Lea in the southwest English county of Devon slowly faded 
out until none were left. But thanks to the Millennium Seed Bank, 
the corrigiola litoralis was not lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at the bank germinated the seeds, then created a  
habitat by the river that would let the flower thrive. And today, 
thrive it does. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Smith, the seed bank's director, hopes the taxpayer-funded  
project will serve as an impetus for a worldwide movement to save 
plant species by storing their seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	He likens the bank to a ``botanical seatbelt.''  
</P>
<P>
	``If you are unfortunate enough to have a crash, it doesn't have  
to be as damaging as it might have been,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	A $127 million building is at the center of the project. Set to  
open next summer in Wakehurst Place in Sussex, south of London, it 
will store the seeds of 10 percent of the world's flora and fauna, 
as well as those of all of Britain's wild plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith chose to focus the seed bank's collection efforts on  
drylands, which are in jeopardy because of population growth. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 inches of rain falls in drylands annually, about six  
times the amount of desert rainfall. But growing populations 
deplete the land's resources during dry spells, turning it into a 
desert-like habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith says he opted to concentrate on drylands because other  
habitats can be protected through political efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	To save the rainforests, activists can involve local governments  
in protecting them from loggers, he notes. But the drylands are 
being destroyed by people who have always made their homes there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to imagine the politician who could sell the slogan  
`more species, lower standard of living,''' Smith says wryly. 
</P>
<P>
	The seeds collected from the drylands will be dried and then  
frozen, a method that Smith says will preserve them for decades, if 
not centuries. Seeds can be removed from cold storage and 
germinated if they are needed for research or become extinct in the 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has a very different purpose than Britain's seed  
bank, the National Seed Bank in Fort Collins, Colo., provides a 
model of how a species can be protected through such storage. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Russian wheat aphid attacked crops in the United States  
in the early 1990s, for example, scientists at the National Seed 
Bank grew plants from their more than 44,000 varieties of wheat, 
collected from countries where the wheat grows naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, one was found that resisted the aphid. This  
characteristic then was bred into U.S.-grown wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff at the National Seed Bank go on missions around the world  
to gather samples of genetically diverse seed, and now Smith's 
staff has begun to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent visitor to the temporary bank at Wakehurst Place would  
have seen seeds gathered in Burkina Faso drying in cloth sacks, 
next to dried-out samples of the plants they can produce. 
</P>
<P>
	The samples will be on display in the seed bank's visitor  
center, where researchers at work will be visible through glass 
laboratory walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Underground will be a library, a lecture room and accommodations  
for visiting researchers, along with cold storage rooms that can 
hold seeds from more than 25,000 plant species. 
</P>
<P>
	Research leader Loren Wiesner notes that while groups have  
collected wild seeds to protect particular species, no one has ever 
tried to freeze-dry an entire habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	By going places seed collectors have never gone before, to  
drylands on five continents, Smith says he hopes to raise awareness 
so more people join in the fight to save plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tricky, but doable, I think,'' he says. ``Biologists  
started this fuss. They need to develop a solution.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Says He Would Bite Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mike Tyson might bite again.  
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion says if a referee fails to  
protect him in his next bout he would be forced to take matters 
into his own mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do it again under those circumstances,'' he said in  
Sunday's Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear in a 1997 title  
fight. He contends referee Mills Lane allowed him to be butted, and 
he would react the same way if cut and bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what the reality is,'' he said. ``Listen, I hate to cry  
and I hate to sound like sour grapes, but no one ever listens to 
me. No one ever hears what I have to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, coming off a Maryland jail sentence, fights Orlin Norris  
Oct. 23 in Las Vegas and doesn't expect help from the referee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's having a rough fight and there is some foulness going  
on, the referee is going to be paralyzed and not act,'' he told the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody ever has any sympathy or pity for me. In retaliation,  
I'll fight back because nobody is fighting for me. I have to defend 
myself. It is just human nature to defend yourself. I just never 
sold out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Holyfield bout, Tyson spit out his mouthpiece and bit off  
the top of his opponent's right ear. Minutes later, he bit 
Holyfield's left ear. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost his boxing license for 15 months and apologized for his  
conduct. He returned to the ring in January, knocking out Francois 
Botha in the fifth round.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Sen. John  
McCain said Sunday that recent events in Congress show lawmakers 
are tainted by the current campaign finance system. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us have been corrupted by the process where big money  
and big influence -- and you can include me in that list -- where big 
money has bought access, which has bought influence,'' McCain said 
on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, the Arizona senator cited a proposal by House  
Republicans to tinker with a tax credit for the working poor. 
Spreading the Earned Income Tax Credit payment over a year rather 
than paying out a lump sum would save $8.7 billion in fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lately, we've got hundreds of billions of dollars in special  
tax breaks for special interests. So, what do we decide -- how do we 
decide to save money? Go after the Earned Income Tax Credit, which 
is for lower income working Americans who have no representation in 
Washington,'' said McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain last week joined a second GOP presidential hopeful, Texas  
Governor George W. Bush, in condemning the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain long has supported banning the unlimited soft money  
contributions corporations and other organizations now can make to 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier interview on ``This Week'', Christian Coalition  
leader Pat Robertson said he could not support McCain for president 
because McCain's position on campaign finance religious group's own 
ability to make campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``That particular initiative would actually gut the Christian  
Coalition and a number of other citizen groups,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Elizabeth Dole said Sunday she is  
unique among next year's candidates for president and commander in 
chief: She is the only one to have led a branch of the armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole headed the Coast Guard in the 1980s as President Reagan's  
secretary of transportation. The Coast Guard is under the 
Transportation Department during peacetime but in war comes under 
the Pentagon's control. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on ``Fox News Sunday'' to explain why she would be a  
better commander in chief than another GOP presidential hopeful, 
Sen. John McCain, a former Navy pilot and prisoner of war, Dole 
said: 
</P>
<P>
	``You may be speaking of gender, and let me say that I think  
there are a lot of men who are not prepared to be commander in 
chief. I think you have to look at what sort of experience I have, 
and whether I'm prepared to be president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She made clear she was not belittling McCain's military bona  
fides: ``Of course he does have that experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her experience, she added, ``includes a great deal of  
foreign policy in terms of each of the positions I've held. ... 
I've served as the first woman to head a branch of the armed 
forces, the United States Coast Guard when I was secretary of 
transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she also has plenty of executive experience, which is  
what the presidency is about. 
</P>
<P>
	She entered government as President Nixon's consumer adviser in  
1971 and after her 4 1/2 years in Reagan's Cabinet served as President 
Bush's secretary of labor. She resigned as president of the 
American Red Cross to make her White House run. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christian Coalition leader Pat Robertson said  
Sunday his organization would not support a Republican presidential 
candidate who chose a pro-choice running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the kiss of death,'' Robertson said on ABC's  
``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he believes conservative Christian voters would  
not even be swayed on that point by a GOP candidate with a strong 
chance of beating the Democratic nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great many people would stay home and wouldn't vote, or  
they'd vote to a third party,'' Robertson said.

	Robertson, the religious broadcaster who commands a grassroots  
army of 2.1 million Christian activists, has said he will not 
endorse any presidential candidate during the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he has made some preferences clear, and on Sunday again  
said he thinks Texas Gov. George W. Bush would make ``an acceptable 
candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, however, was not exempt from Robertson's admonishment  
about appointing a pro-choice running mate. ``I would promise him 
he would lose the election,'' said Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, another GOP presidential contender,  
said abortion should not be the defining issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the choice for running mates should have a  
litmus test associated with it,'' McCain said on ``This Week'' 
after Robertson's appearance. ``I think we should look at their 
overall record.''

<HEADLINE> Soaring Swiftly Wins Flower Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Soaring Softly, a model of consistency since  
being switched to the turf March 1, used a powerful stretch run for 
a one-length victory in the $500,000 Flower Bowl Handicap at 
Belmont Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was Soaring Softly's sixth in seven career starts on the  
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Coretta, who held a brief lead in midstretch, finished second,  
7 3/4 lengths ahead of Mossflower. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third graded stakes win for Soaring Softly. She took  
the New York Handicap July 17 and the Sheepshead Bay May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old filly was reserved toward the rear of the field  
by Jerry Bailey as Heritage of Gold set pedestrian fractions. Then, 
Bailey got Soaring Softly rolling and she wore down the leaders 
through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Soaring Softly carried 118 pounds over 1 1/4 miles in 2:01 2-5 on  
the firm inner turf course and earned $300,000 for Joan G. and John 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned $8.10, $3.60 and $2.70. Coretta paid $4.10 and $3  
and Mossflower was $3.10 to show.

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Danielle Fotopoulos scored two goals as  
the U.S. women's soccer team beat South Korea 5-0 Sunday in its 
opening match of the U.S. Women's Cup '99 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil got two goals and an assist from Roseli and beat Finland  
3-1 in the first game of the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Fotopoulos scored from 10 yards out on a pass from Tisha  
Venturini in the 82nd minute and then scored again in the 90th 
minute after Tiffeny Millbrett found her unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the 23rd of the year for the team, breaking its  
1998 record for wins. 
</P>
<P>
	The team lived up to its status as World Cup champions by  
dominating every aspect and outshooting South Korea 35-2 overall 
and 17-1 in shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon MacMillan found Cindy Parlow on a corner kick in the  
10th minute to open the scoring. Parlow, who at 5-foot-11 is 5 
inches taller than South Korea's tallest defender, headed the ball 
past Ho Jung Jung. 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan got her second assist of the game when she sent a pass  
to the feet of Mia Hamm, who scored on a hard shot from 8 yards out 
in the 36th minute. It was the 112th career goal for Hamm, who 
missed a 6-0 victory over Brazil last month with a strained 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett made it 3-0 just before halftime on an assist by Julie  
Foudy. 
</P>
<P>
	A rowdy sellout crowd of 23,101 watched the United States  
improve its record to 101-8-8 in five years under coach Tony 
DiCicco. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans kept chanting ``USA'' as the host team dominated play and  
kept South Korea inside its half of the field for most of the game. 
Many of the spectators had their faces and hair painted red, white 
and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jung finished with 12 saves, while Tracy Ducar of the United  
States needed to make just one, on a weak header by Yun Je Choi in 
the 17th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Roseli lifted a long shot over the head of goalkeeper  
Satu Kunnas and it went just under the crossbar with seconds left 
in the first half to put Brazil up 2-0. Roseli scored again in the 
78th minute, making it 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians outshot Finland 30-6 and led 15-4 in shots on  
goal.

	The second round of the tournament will be at Kansas City, Mo.,  
on Thursday when Brazil plays South Korea and Finland plays the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole: Woman Can Lead Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If she wins the presidency, Republican  
Elizabeth Dole said Sunday, her sex will have no bearing on her 
ability to serve as commander in chief. She said she already has 
been the only woman to lead a branch of the armed forces, the Coast 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyway, Dole said on ``Fox News Sunday,'' being president is  
about executive experience, of which she said she has plenty. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole headed the Coast Guard in the 1980s as President Reagan's  
secretary of transportation. The Coast Guard is in the 
Transportation Department during peacetime but in war comes under 
the Pentagon's control. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain why she would be a better commander in chief  
than another GOP presidential hopeful, Sen. John McCain, a former 
Navy pilot and prisoner of war, Dole said: 
</P>
<P>
	``You may be speaking of gender, and let me say that I think  
there are a lot of men who are not prepared to be commander in 
chief. I think you have to look at what sort of experience I have, 
and whether I'm prepared to be president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she said ``of course (McCain) does have that  
experience,'' but added: ``My experience includes a great deal of 
foreign policy in terms of each of the positions I've held. ... 
I've served as the first woman to head a branch of the armed 
forces, the United States Coast Guard when I was secretary of 
transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's first government job was as President Nixon's main  
consumer adviser. She was President Bush's secretary of labor and 
resigned as head of the American Red Cross to run for president.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Said Plotting Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Allies of Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic plan to provoke violence at street protests to 
create a pretext for a crackdown on opponents, an opposition leader 
warned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning came as more than 15,000 demonstrators turned out in  
Belgrade on Sunday for the 13th consecutive day of protest rallies. 
Several thousand more gathered in the northern town of Novi Sad, 
Serbia's second largest city, also demanding Milosevic's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are secret plans... to stage an incident in which a  
number of policemen would be hurt, to put the blame on opposition, 
reshape public opinion and then move to arrest protest leaders, ban 
the rallies and introduce a form of emergency situation,'' Zoran 
Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party and a central figure in the 
anti-Milosevic rallies, said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally ended with strong anti-Milosevic speeches given by  
politicians and leading intellectuals, including members of the 
influential Academy of Arts and Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't remove Milosevic, we will forever remain hostages  
of his culture of death'' said psychologist and opposition activist 
Zarko Trebjesanin. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday and Thursday, riot police beat protesters when they  
tried to hold a larger protest march. Dozens, including five 
policemen, were injured then and several opposition activists were 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic, who has always advocated peaceful protests, claimed he  
knew of the plan from insiders close to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that people in the police and the army are alert to  
this... Milosevic applied such tactics in (the wars) in Croatia, 
Bosnia in Kosovo ... to provoke violence, push people into 
bloodshed and then play the peacemaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Party, part of the umbrella group Alliance For  
Change, has been in the forefront of organizing the daily rallies 
in major Serbian towns designed to force the president to resign 
after he led the country into the disastrous war in Kosovo against 
NATO and ethnic Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	After gathering at the capital's main square Sunday, the  
Belgrade protesters set on a march while riot police formed cordons 
along their route, keeping the march within the city center. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Sunday, another top opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic,  
was slightly injured in a car crash southwest of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling with his wife and several members of his Serbian  
Renewal Movement, Draskovic's car crashed into a truck. His close 
aide, security adviser and two bodyguards were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Borivoje Borovic, the party's lawyer and Draskovic's close  
associate, hinted at foul play. But there was no immediate evidence 
to support this. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accident happened under strange circumstance,'' Borovic  
told the independent Beta news agency. ``The truck suddenly shifted 
to the left side of the road and there was no evidence that it 
tried to brake, as if it was directly targeting the cars.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Answering Big Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- It started with a single voice  
echoing off the cement courtyard, then swelled to a chorus of 
first-graders repeating the same question. ``Who is George Bush?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Queued in a wiggly line, the College Heights Elementary School  
students were curious about George -- the campaigning Texan whose 
visit had prompted an extra recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is George Bush?'' the giggling children chanted in  
singsong voices. ``Who is George Bush?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a question their elders soon may need answered about the  
man far ahead of the field for the Republican presidential 
nomination, and leading the polls for the White House election 13 
months away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush himself appears in no hurry to fill in the blanks.  
</P>
<P>
	Pressed on policy, the two-term governor says he will provide  
answers on his own timetable. He has dealt with education and 
defense plans in a Bush administration. Taxes and other 
installments to come, he says, and abruptly refuses to talk about 
them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a likable, playful, funny man with a knack for putting  
people at ease in social settings, though he can be abrupt when the 
occasion is more serious. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he is a humble man. ``If the people don't want me to be  
president, so be it,'' he says, with variations, when asked about 
his prospects. But there also is a Texas swagger in his style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing pretty well,'' he grinned to reporters in San Jose,  
Calif., of the record $56 million his campaign has raised this 
year. No gloating; no need -- the numbers are there. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, no ornate orator, is at his campaign best with small  
groups of voters and their families. He likes to gently rib people, 
making them feel they are in on the joke. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Grand Rapids, Mich., school, he asked for a show of hands  
among third-graders: How many good readers? 
</P>
<P>
	All 25 raise their hands. ``Tell the truth!'' Bush chides,  
drawing guilty giggles from the children. 
</P>
<P>
	When situations get more serious, so does Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	His eyes were moist with tears as he left a campaign tour in  
Michigan to return to the site of the Sept. 15 shootings at a Fort 
Worth, Texas, church. And he sometimes speaks emotionally about his 
father, especially when it comes to his 1992 loss to President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a ``death by a thousand cuts,'' says Bush, who was an  
adviser to his father in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	That campaign left the younger Bush with his own scars. When a  
questioning reporter interrupts a monologue, Bush often counters 
with a dagger stare and a snap. ``Ah, ah,'' he'll say, and 
insisting on finishing. 
</P>
<P>
	When the questions are repeated attempts to get at something he  
does not want to address, he shuts them down. ``I gave you my 
answer,'' he snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	But no candidate takes more questions. In nearly every city he  
visits, Bush meets with reporters in open-ended sessions that last 
15 to 30 minutes. He also holds lengthy one-on-one sessions with 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	During his trip to California and Michigan, the governor  
conducted three news conferences in three days. He answered more 
than 30 questions about 14 issues -- guns, missile defenses, the Pat 
Buchanan threat, Y2K among them. 
</P>
<P>
	He can deliver a quick response, as in his criticism of the  
House Republican plan to delay payments to the working poor to save 
money in the 2000 budget. Bush said they should not be trying to 
balance the budget on the backs of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders did not like it. But Bush is not playing to  
them; the votes he needs now are in the primary election states. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been missteps. He mishandled explanations about his  
abortion record early in the campaign and, this summer, questions 
about whether he had ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, most of Bush's answers in recent days were  
well-practiced lines worded broadly enough to keep him out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clinton, Bush has a knack for offering something to both  
sides both sides of an argument. He says he is for an increase in 
the minimum wage (a Democratic cause), but only if states can opt 
out of it (succor for the GOP). 
</P>
<P>
	That chanted schoolyard question still is unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Exercise May Help Cancer Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even during treatment, Lance Armstrong kept up  
his training. 
</P>
<P>
	During the fall and winter of 1996 and 1997, after surgery to  
remove a cancerous testicle, the world-class cyclist received 
chemotherapy. Between bouts of chemotherapy, even as he was losing 
muscle, he rode. After therapy, he rode some more. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, a fully recovered Armstrong won the most prestigious  
event in cycling -- the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	And, although researchers can't say whether Armstrong's training  
during treatment helped him beat the disease, they do say studies 
increasingly indicate that physical activity can help cancer 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on my expertise, what would I recommend if my mum was  
diagnosed with breast cancer? I would recommend exercise,'' said 
Kerry S. Courneya,a researcher at the University of Alberta, 
Edmonton. The Canadian scientist's review of 24 studies on exercise 
and cancer was published in Annals of Behavioral Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies have limitations, Courneya said. But, taken  
together, they indicate that staying active while cancer is in an 
early stage can help people retain quality of life and retard the 
loss of strength and endurance that accompanies the disease and its 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cancer patients, even though they are on chemotherapy or  
during radiation, show many of the same types of fitness benefits 
that many of the regular population would show,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are many forms of cancer, and the research does  
not cover all of them, so any conclusions must be limited to the 
types of cancers studied, Courneya cautioned. Most of the studies 
involved breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new research looks so promising that the American Cancer  
Society is revising its exercise recommendations, according to 
Colleen Doyle, director of nutrition and physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be there wasn't anything out there, so we would  
tell people, `Conserve your energy,''' Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, while the research indicates exercise can be helpful, there  
still are people who should not do it, Doyle said. These include 
people whose cancer has spread to the bone, or who have lost bone 
density as a side effect of cancer treatment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, treatment may result in nerve damage that can make a  
person prone to falls, and certain medications can affect major 
organs in ways that limit activity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will certainly recommend that people talk to their health  
care providers before they do anything,'' Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies were too varied, and the numbers of people involved  
in each were too small, for Courneya to estimate the size of the 
benefits. But the scope of the benefits ranged from increased 
flexibility to decreased fatigue, depression and anxiety, the 
review found. 
</P>
<P>
	Those quality of life issues are very important to cancer  
patients. Restoring himself to health was less than 10 percent 
physical, Armstrong told a congressional hearing last week. ``The 
big part of it is the psychological factor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benefits do not require intense exercise to achieve, Courneya  
said, adding that moderate activity such as brisk walking was 
sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The way in which activity can improve the lives of cancer  
patients is not understood, Courneya said. However, moderate 
activity can improve immune functions that could fight help to 
fight cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	And exercise can reduce estrogen levels, which could help breast  
cancer patients because estrogen is considered to promote tumor 
growth, he said. Breast cancer patients who are obese also have 
worse odds, and exercise can help people to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The field is too new to be able to tell if people who exercise  
will live longer than those who do not exercise, said Dr. Anne 
McTeirnan of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
However, the Fred Hutchinson center, the University of Southern 
California and the University of New Mexico are setting up a study 
to follow 1,200 women with breast cancer, and activity is one of 
the factors that will be examined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise can help cancer patients get more out of life, provided  
the amount and type of exercise is calibrated to the patient's 
condition, said Pamela Massey, director of rehabilitation services 
at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Breast cancer patients who have had a mastectomy, for instance,  
might get a special focus on improving the strength and flexibility 
of their shoulder muscles, she said. A person with an advanced 
cancer might be encouraged to use a wheelchair, although not to the 
point of getting worn out, she said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Unveils New Campaign in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore brought his retooled  
campaign to New Hampshire on Sunday, calling himself the underdog 
in the presidential primary race against Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race has changed and it's now a two-person race that is  
close and hard-fought,'' Gore told reporters after a closed-door 
pep talk with supporters. ``I have always thought if Bradley passed 
the threshold of credibility and competence, then it would narrow 
dramatically and he did that, and so it's narrowed dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spoke to key supporters from around the state at his Dover  
headquarters. From outside, loud cheering was heard several times 
during his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	When the media was allowed in, Gore was moving through the room,  
shaking hands and joking with supporters and posing for photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said he seemed like a new person. Others said he was the  
same Al Gore they had seen before, but one who gets a bad shake 
from the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, he didn't look different,'' said Mary Frost of Gilford.  
``I have always thought he gave a very warm passionate approach. 
I've always wondered why people could label him as wooden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the media,'' said a companion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be, because he is very warm,'' Frost agreed. ``He  
listens to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staffers took pains in previous New Hampshire visits to  
keep the candidate away from reporters, but Sunday, after his 
private meeting, he entertained a series of ``exclusive'' 
television interviews, then answered a handful of questions in an 
impromptu news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore repeated his challenge for a series of debates with Bradley  
soon; to wait until January would leave too little time before the 
primaries begin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (Texas Gov. George) Bush is the nominee on the Republican  
side ... Democrats are going to have to win on the issues and we 
need to get a head start and draw people toward a good healthy 
discussion of ideas,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Allman Brothers' Graves Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACON, Ga. (AP) -- Duane Allman's and Berry Oakley's relatives  
are so adamant about protecting their grave sites, they bought the 
land immediately surrounding them and claim it's private -- no 
trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want anyone (kicked) out of Rose Hill, but don't  
deface the graves. Don't have sex on the graves,'' said Lars 
Anderson, an attorney for two relatives of the two Allman Brothers 
Band founders. 
</P>
<P>
	They died in separate motorcycle accidents in the early 1970s.  
</P>
<P>
	Macon Mayor Jim Marshall say the cemetery is public property and  
the hundreds of people who flock to the graves each month are 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also why criminal trespassing charges against a Macon  
Telegraph photographer arrested while taking photos of the graves 
were dropped Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall said the city is considering allowing a fence around  
the graves and a sign to tell visitors what they may and may not 
do.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Gore Aide Abused Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tony Coelho, Vice President Al Gore's campaign  
chairman, approved questionable contractor payments, hired his 
niece for a job and made the government liable for a $300,000 
personal loan while directing the U.S. pavilion at the 1998 world's 
fair in Portugal, State Department investigators found. 
</P>
<P>
	Their report said Coelho and his staff also misused $210,000 in  
donated airline tickets, hired two stepsons of the U.S. ambassador 
to Portugal and had the government reimburse $26,000 in 
questionable expenses to a consultant who worked in Coelho's New 
York City office. Coelho's rental of a chauffeur-driven Mercedes 
``was especially troublesome'' because the cost exceeded a $500 
ceiling while a fleet of six vans for the pavilion were underused. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report was released by the Center for  
Public Integrity, a nonprofit organization that tracks government 
fraud, waste and abuse and ethical conflicts involving public 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said Coelho's actions may have violated federal laws  
governing use of federal funds for international expositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho got strong support in a statement issued by Kiki Moore,  
Gore's campaign press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Coelho does a great job as general chair of Gore 2000,''  
the statement said. ``Day in and day out he makes a tremendous 
contribution. Under Tony's leadership, the campaign will continue 
to advance an agenda that will improve the lives of America's 
working families -- fighting to protect Social Security and preserve 
Medicare, making health care available to all of our children and 
calling for revolutionary change in our public schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Brand, Coelho's personal lawyer, said his client did not  
violate any laws in a job that did not pay him a salary. ``He 
devoted two years of his life and spent substantial amounts of his 
own money,'' Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand acknowledged ``there may have been management lapses'' as  
in many government contract programs, but contended most of the 
negative conclusions were aimed at United States Information Agency 
officials rather than Coelho personally. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations surfaced at a difficult time for the Gore  
campaign. Reeling from Democratic presidential challenger Bill 
Bradley's surge in the polls and fund raising, Gore several days 
ago shook up his campaign and moved it to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho, then House Democratic whip, left Congress in 1989 amid  
questions about his personal financial dealings. A legendary 
fund-raiser, Coelho once headed his party's congressional 
money-raising operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho was appointed U.S. commissioner general for the world's  
fair in Lisbon in June 1996, with responsibility for fund raising, 
as well as the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. 
pavilion. The expo was estimated to cost $8 million, but the figure 
jumped to $9.8 million and ``will likely cost more'' because of 
pending lawsuits, the inspector general said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law says government funds should not be spent unless  
``expressly authorized and appropriated'' for pavilions at the 
international fair. The report said no authorization was granted 
for Expo 98, ``yet U.S. government funds accounted for over 80 
percent of the total S. pavilion funding...'' The report concluded 
the USIA ``may have violated the spirit, if not the letter'' of 
that law. 
</P>
<P>
	That agency, the report said, turned over control of the  
operation to Coelho who, the Center for Public Integrity reported, 
lived in an $18,000-a-month luxury apartment billed to the USIA and 
used free donated airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general said Coelho obtained a personal loan of  
$300,000 from a Portuguese bank so a private foundation could 
construct a memorial wall in the shape of a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan was listed on pavilion records as a liability and the  
foundation had not made any payments as of December 1998. The U.S. 
government could be obligated to pay for the sculpture, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering some of the specific questions raised in the report,  
Brand said the $300,000 loan ``was paid off with donations from 
people donating to the memorial (sculpture), including a large 
contribution from Tony himself. The government was never involved 
nor was any of its money at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho's niece was hired by his deputy, Brand said, adding, ``I  
think USIA was aware of it and said it did not violate the nepotism 
statute.'' Hiring the ambassador's stepsons did not violate any law 
or rule, Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Mercedes, Brand said, ``Maybe that was a  
screw-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report and further information developed by the center said  
that Coelho and his staff: 
</P>
<P>
	--Directed the USIA to reimburse a New York contractor $26,000  
even though officials ``could not find a legal basis'' for expenses 
such as travel, office space and relocation. The contractor was 
project manager for the pavilion. Other ``questionable payments'' 
initiated by Coelho included dinner for Portuguese guides, laundry 
services, the luxury apartment, and a dry-run reception that cost 
$294 for food and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hired his niece, Debra Coelho, in violation of USIA  
regulations, at $2,500 a month as an assistant to his deputy. He 
also hired two stepsons of Gerald McGowan, the U.S. ambassador to 
Portugal, at inflated salaries. One stepson received $2,700 a month 
and the other $3,200 a month. The contract ``did not identify any 
duties'' for McGowan's stepsons, the IG said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Did not ``adequately manage and control'' use of airline  
tickets, hotel accommodations and other lodging, free Expo tickets, 
motor vehicles, computers and VIP gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaborating on the IG's report, the center reported that Coelho  
also was involved in business ventures in Portugal with at least 
three corporate underwriters of the U.S. Pavilion. Ethics rules 
prohibit special government employees from working on matters that 
would affect their financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The center also described Coelho's efforts to gain public  
funding after private fund raising failed. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Coelho first secured support of a friend, then-Navy  
Secretary John Dalton. A House-Senate conference report strongly 
suggested that the service participate as a sponsor of the U.S. 
exhibit on ocean research and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho then worked out a pledge from the National Institute of  
Environmental Health Sciences. As in the Navy's case, a paragraph 
in a conference report urged NIEHS ``to lend its expertise and 
provide technical assistance'' to the exposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the Expo opened, the IG said the two agencies --  
armed with the legislative encouragement -- kicked in some $6.5 
million, or 82 percent of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Wilson, the institute's deputy director, said the agency  
originally wanted to contribute $500,000 -- not the $4 million 
donated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the origin of the idea of our involvement,''  
Wilson told the center. ``It's safe to say it wasn't an 
institute-developed idea.''

<HEADLINE> Mustang Ranch May See Reincarnation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A federal agency is thinking about reopening  
the Mustang Ranch -- not as the notorious brothel it was for years 
but as a tourist attraction and research center for wild horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The property was forfeited to the federal government this summer  
after guilty verdicts against the brothel's parent companies and 
manager in a federal fraud and racketeering trial. The women who 
worked there were evicted and the brothel was padlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Bureau of Land Management is exploring a plan to convert  
the main pink stucco ranch building into an interpretive center for 
its Wild Horse and Burro Adoption Center, which has outgrown its 
Palomino Valley facility 15 miles northeast of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an idea that's easy to make jokes about, but it's one  
that also makes sense,'' said John Singlaub, manager of the BLM's 
Carson district office. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau is charged with managing the West's estimated 44,000  
wild horses, about half of which are located in Nevada. It captures 
some of the animals and puts them up for adoption to ease 
overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The interpretive center could include historical exhibits, a  
wild horse research center and an equestrian center, said Bob 
Abbey, BLM director in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothel is located along the Truckee River just south of  
Interstate 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostitution is legal in 12 of Nevada's 17 counties, including  
Storey County where the Mustang Ranch opened 32 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Seed Bank Is 'Botanical Seatbelt' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The small flower that lived on the banks of the  
Slapton Lea in the southwest English county of Devon slowly faded 
out until none were left. But thanks to the Millennium Seed Bank, 
the corrigiola litoralis was not lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at the bank germinated the seeds, then created a  
habitat by the river that would let the flower thrive. And today, 
thrive it does. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Smith, the seed bank's director, hopes the taxpayer-funded  
project will serve as an impetus for a worldwide movement to save 
plant species by storing their seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	He likens the bank to a ``botanical seatbelt.''  
</P>
<P>
	``If you are unfortunate enough to have a crash, it doesn't have  
to be as damaging as it might have been,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	A $127 million building is at the center of the project. Set to  
open next summer in Wakehurst Place in Sussex, south of London, it 
will store the seeds of 10 percent of the world's flora and fauna, 
as well as those of all of Britain's wild plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith chose to focus the seed bank's collection efforts on  
drylands, which are in jeopardy because of population growth. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 inches of rain falls in drylands annually, about six  
times the amount of desert rainfall. But growing populations 
deplete the land's resources during dry spells, turning it into a 
desert-like habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith says he opted to concentrate on drylands because other  
habitats can be protected through political efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	To save the rainforests, activists can involve local governments  
in protecting them from loggers, he notes. But the drylands are 
being destroyed by people who have always made their homes there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to imagine the politician who could sell the slogan  
`more species, lower standard of living,''' Smith says wryly. 
</P>
<P>
	The seeds collected from the drylands will be dried and then  
frozen, a method that Smith says will preserve them for decades, if 
not centuries. Seeds can be removed from cold storage and 
germinated if they are needed for research or become extinct in the 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has a very different purpose than Britain's seed  
bank, the National Seed Bank in Fort Collins, Colo., provides a 
model of how a species can be protected through such storage. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Russian wheat aphid attacked crops in the United States  
in the early 1990s, for example, scientists at the National Seed 
Bank grew plants from their more than 44,000 varieties of wheat, 
collected from countries where the wheat grows naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, one was found that resisted the aphid. This  
characteristic then was bred into U.S.-grown wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff at the National Seed Bank go on missions around the world  
to gather samples of genetically diverse seed, and now Smith's 
staff has begun to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent visitor to the temporary bank at Wakehurst Place would  
have seen seeds gathered in Burkina Faso drying in cloth sacks, 
next to dried-out samples of the plants they can produce. 
</P>
<P>
	The samples will be on display in the seed bank's visitor  
center, where researchers at work will be visible through glass 
laboratory walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Underground will be a library, a lecture room and accommodations  
for visiting researchers, along with cold storage rooms that can 
hold seeds from more than 25,000 plant species. 
</P>
<P>
	Research leader Loren Wiesner notes that while groups have  
collected wild seeds to protect particular species, no one has ever 
tried to freeze-dry an entire habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	By going places seed collectors have never gone before, to  
drylands on five continents, Smith says he hopes to raise awareness 
so more people join in the fight to save plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tricky, but doable, I think,'' he says. ``Biologists  
started this fuss. They need to develop a solution.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Deals With Revenue Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian government's economic  
team faces a tight deadline to come up with a package of taxes and 
spending cuts to compensate for revenue lost after court rulings 
declared two new taxes unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform-minded government of President Fernando Henrique  
Cardoso needs to make up almost $1.3 billion in revenue after the 
Supreme Court stuck down a tax on civil service pensions and a 
higher top tax bracket for active workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The taxes were part of package of fiscal adjustments promised by  
Brazil last year in its agreement with the IMF to qualify for $41.5 
billion credit line to shore-up its ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange dropped 2 percent on news of the  
court decision and the dollar strengthened against the real, but 
government reassurances Friday allowed markets to stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that domestic and international investors will  
know that we have this commitment and the question will resolve 
itself over time,'' Finance Minister Pedro Malan told reporters 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan and his team are expected to have the new compensatory  
package of tax increases and budget cuts ready by week's end, local 
media reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from the rejected taxes would have covered less than 10  
percent of the $10.5 billion deficit which the system is expected 
to generate next year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it was held by the government to be an important step  
toward badly needed pension reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's 918,000 retired civil servants receive benefits many  
times greater than private sector retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	The average monthly pension of those retired from the federal  
judiciary is about $2,783 a month, compared with $126 a month for 
private sector retirees.

<HEADLINE> Davis' Injury Bad News for Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos have plenty of  
problems. Their woes intensified with an injury to 1998 NFL MVP 
Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	While the severity of Davis' right knee injury wasn't  
immediately known, Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said after Sunday's 
21-13 loss to the New York Jets it looked as if Davis might have 
torn his anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it happened, they said there was some looseness in his  
knee,'' Shanahan said. ``We're going to keep our fingers crossed 
that it's not an ACL. But at this time, it looks like it could 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was scheduled for tests Monday morning. A ruptured ACL  
would mean his season is over. A partially torn ACL would sideline 
Davis at least for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who got off to a slow start after leading the NFL in  
rushing last season with 2,008 yards, was hurt in the first quarter 
during an interception return. Broncos offensive tackle Matt Lepsis 
made a diving tackle to cut down Victor Green at the sideline, but 
Lepsis also caught Davis on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was helped by trainers on the sideline, and then limped to  
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, San Diego defeated Kansas City 21-14 despite losing  
quarterback Jim Harbaugh and wide receiver Jeff Graham on 
consecutive plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh left with a bruised right elbow late in the first  
quarter, and the Chargers didn't crack the 100-yard mark until the 
third period. They finished with just 132 yards, and netted only 3 
yards on two possessions in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first play after Harbaugh was hurt, backup Erik Kramer  
threw a long pass to Graham. The pass was broken up by Eric 
Warfield, and Graham hit his head on the turf. He was diagnosed 
with a concussion, but he came back late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden was carried off  
the field on a stretcher with a neck injury after diving into a 
pile for a loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogden sustained a severe neck ``stinger,'' but had full motion  
in his arms and legs, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 315-pound Ogden was injured at the end of the  
first half of a 19-13 overtime victory over the Atlanta Falcons. A 
bad snap in the shotgun formation sent quarterback Stoney Case 
scurrying for the ball at the Baltimore 20. Case recovered, but 
Ogden rolled over a pile of players and landed on top of Falcons 
lineman Lester Archambeau. Medical officials strapped Ogden to a 
backboard, stabilizing his neck, before being placed on the 
stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the half, the Falcons lost quarterback Tony Graziani,  
who sustained a concussion on a hit by Ray Lewis. Graziani, in the 
game because of Chris Chandler's hamstring injury, did not return 
and was replaced by third-stringer Danny Kanell. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans quarterback Billy Joe Hobert, driven off the field  
after being hit in the head twice on a touchdown run, suffered a 
neck sprain and cervical ``stinger.'' X-rays were negative, and 
Hobert will be re-evaluated Monday. He was replaced by Billy Joe 
Tolliver, and the Saints lost 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert was hit in the head and left shoulder by Chicago Bears  
linebacker Sean Harris as he crossed the goal line. He continued 
running and took a helmet-to-helmet hit on the top of his head from 
Bears linebacker Rico McDonald. His head snapped to the side from 
the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert rolled over on his back, grimacing, and lay on the field  
for almost 15 minutes while he was examined by medical personnel 
from both teams. He was moving his hands and feet when he was on 
the ground, and he was opening and closing his fingers while he 
left the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville RB Fred Taylor reinjured his hamstring and sat out  
the second half of the Jaguars' 17-3 victory over Pittsburgh. The 
same injury forced him to miss the Tennessee game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same game Davis was injured, Jets cornerback Otis Smith  
fractured his left shoulder, and Jets linebacker Chad Cascadden did 
not return after suffering a knee injury in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota kick returner David Palmer sat out the second half  
with bruised ribs, but the Vikings went on to defeat Tampa Bay 
21-14.

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Campaign Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his ``close  
friend'' Tony Coelho will stay on as his campaign chairman despite 
a government report finding questionable financial management while 
Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the 1998 world's fair in 
Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Coelho is doing a terrific job. He's my close friend, and  
he's going to continue doing a great job,'' Gore said on CBS's 
``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is staying, and I haven't seen this report, but I know  
him,'' the vice president added. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he did not think Americans would see the report on  
Coelho as relevant to the campaign for the 2000 Democratic 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``People that I talk to are not interested in inside baseball,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's inspector general found potential  
improprieties in Coelho's work as U.S. commissioner general for the 
world's fair in Lisbon, a post to which he was appointed in June 
1996. The job, with the United State's Information Agency, included 
fund-raising for, as well as the design, fabrication and operation 
of the U.S. pavilion at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by investigators found Coelho improperly used $210,000  
in donated airline tickets, unnecessarily kept an expensive 
chauffeur-driven Mercedes and hired his niece for a $2,500-a-month 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Coelho also obtained a personal loan of $300,000  
from a Portuguese bank for a private foundation to use for a 
memorial sculpture, listing it as a liability on the USIA's 
records. The U.S. government could be responsible if the loan is 
not paid, the inspector general said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho's personal lawyer, Stanley Brand, has said his client did  
not violate any laws in a job that did not pay him a salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand acknowledged ``there may have been management lapses'' as  
in many government contract programs, but contended most of the 
negative conclusions were aimed at USIA officials rather than 
Coelho personally.

<HEADLINE> Missile Interceptor Passes Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- U.S. military officials  
lauded a prototype national missile defense system after it 
intercepted and destroyed an unarmed missile Saturday on a 
16,000-mph collision course over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first test of the ``kill vehicle'' missile's ability  
to destroy a target by smashing into it. The system ``did 
everything it was supposed to do, and it did it perfectly,'' said 
Sheryl Irwin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manila, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the test  
was ``certainly a positive development for us'' and demonstrated 
``the kind of technology we are capable of developing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An unarmed Minuteman missile carrying a dummy warhead and a  
decoy balloon was launched just after 7 p.m. from this coastal base 
on a flight over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 minutes later, the kill vehicle missile was launched  
from the Marshall Islands. The two missiles hurtled toward each 
other at a combined speed of about 16,000 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes later, 3,000 miles from California and about 140  
miles above the ocean, they met. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a great, big old bright flash,'' said Irwin, who  
watched from a Pentagon room crowded with anxious military 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw it explode, and there was a loud roar -- a very happy  
one that went up from the room. It proves that this technology is 
working and we can move forward with the program,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minuteman's vapor cloud, lit in rainbow colors by the  
setting sun, could be seen for hundreds of miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The defender was the Raytheon-built Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle,  
a 55-inch-long, 120-pound device carried aloft on a booster rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is designed to destroy missiles launched by rogue  
states or terrorists, not a multimissile barrage from a major 
nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have faulted the test plan as unrealistic and too  
limited to make a sound decision, while peace activists who 
demonstrated outside the base a week ago denounced the testing as 
preparation for war. No protesters appeared for the launch at the 
base, located 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The test is the first of three before a readiness review  
scheduled by the Pentagon for June. To proceed with broader 
testing, at least two of the tests must result in an interception. 
A White House decision on initial deployment is expected after the 
June review.

<HEADLINE>  Reds, Brewers Begin 8 Hours Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- While the New York Mets were saving their  
playoff lives, the Cincinnati Reds could only wait -- and wait, and 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Steady sheets of rain pounded County Stadium in Milwaukee at the  
scheduled 4 p.m. EDT start time of Cincinnati's season finale 
against the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than eight hours of solid rain, the majors' last  
scheduled game in the 1999 regular season got underway at 9:52 p.m. 
EDT, a delay of 5:47. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds needed to win to avert a stunning collapse in the  
season's final weekend and force a one-game playoff with the Mets 
on Monday at Cinergy Field. Cincinnati controlled its own playoff 
destiny two days earlier, but consecutive losses to the lowly 
Brewers let the Mets back in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cal Eldred finally threw the first pitch to Pokey Reese, a  
crowd of perhaps 500 die-hard fans, bundled up in winter coats, 
roared their approval. The Brewers, who thought the game would be 
the last ever played at County Stadium before July's crane accident 
at Miller Park, sold more than 55,000 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 45 degrees at gametime, and some players wore stocking  
caps in the dugouts. Many of the players' frosty breath could be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The grounds crew applied drying agents to both the infield and  
the outfield, and the NL, desperate to finish the season on time, 
approved the game's start. But the field was far from being in 
shape, with inches of standing water throughout the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Right fielder Dmitri Young lost his footing and took a nasty  
spill near the foul line in the first inning, though he suffered 
nothing worse than soaked uniform pants. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's victory over Los Angeles on Sunday clinched the NL  
Central title for the Astros (97-65). The win closed out Cincinnati 
from the division title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds, who looked battered when they left the field Saturday  
after their 10-6 loss to the Brewers, watched the Mets-Pirates and 
Dodgers-Astros games on clubhouse televisions. The Brewers showed 
the game on the stadium's video screen for the few thousand fans 
who braved the elements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds weren't anxious to play the game after the delay,  
particularly given the swampy nature of the outfield. Cincinnati 
manager Jack McKeon ventured into the outfield with umpires several 
times during the rain delay to test the turf, and appeared to be 
trying to convince crew chief Dana DeMuth that the game should be 
called. 
</P>
<P>
	A few Brewers players wandered out into the steady downpour  
about an hour before the scheduled start time to sign autographs 
for several hundred fans wearing ponchos and slickers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins-White Sox game 90 miles south in Chicago finished in a  
1-1 tie called after 6 1/2 innings because of a rain.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges OPEC To Cut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries should cut production further to raise the oil price to 
more than $33 a barrel, Iraq's parliamentary speaker said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article published in the Al-Thawra newspaper, Sadoun  
Hammadi, who is also an economist, accused OPEC member states of 
flooding the market with oil to please the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important issue that should be discussed at the OPEC  
summit in Venezuela is production ceilings and prices,'' Hammadi 
wrote in the paper, which is controlled by the ruling Baath Party. 
OPEC is due to meet in Venezuela in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oil price should be $33.71 per barrel, which is a just and  
reasonable price,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In London on Friday, North Sea Brent crude oil futures settled  
at $23.67 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The price fell to below $10 a barrel in February as the world  
experienced a glut of oil. OPEC and non-OPEC members subsequently 
agreed on a series of production cutbacks which raised the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was reported as telling his  
Cabinet last week that the price was still too low and accused the 
United States of manipulating the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would certain OPEC members abandon the policy of flooding the  
market with oil to suit the interest of big industrial countries 
(such as) the United States?,'' Hammadi asked in a clear reference 
to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has long accused Saudi Arabia of exporting more than it  
should.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen early Monday  
following the release of a central bank survey showing further 
optimism about Japan's economy. Tokyo stock prices slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 104.64 yen on the foreign exchange  
market, down 1.30 yen from its level of 105.94 late Friday in Tokyo 
and also below its late Friday level of 104.96 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 25.28 points,  
or 0.14 percent, to 17,687.28. On Friday, the index climbed 107.10 
points, or 0.61 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar fell against the yen after  
Japan's central bank said Monday that business confidence at major 
manufacturing companies improved sharply during the past three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	In its closely-watched quarterly ``tankan'' survey, the Bank of  
Japan said sentiment among large manufacturers had brightened over 
the last survey to a figure of minus 22 from minus 37, it's biggest 
improvement since November 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan measures the percentage of firms seeing business  
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen. 
The bank surveyed 9,275 companies for the latest report. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 112.84 yen Monday morning,  
down 0.60 yen from its level late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, share prices fell after opening higher, on  
concern that the yen's rise may hurt Japan's nascent economic 
recovery, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan ``figure was better than expected, but basically the  
Japanese economy is not so strong,'' said Yoshihiko Kuroichi, 
manager of the research department at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters as their products become  
more expensive overseas, and thus less competitive. Gains by the 
yen also reduce the value of foreign revenue when repatriated to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.01 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,514.07. 
The TOPIX closed up 8.25 points, or 0.55 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed  
at 10,273.00 points, down 63.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6350 percent from Friday's finish of 1.6750 percent. Its price 
rose 0.35 point to 100.56.

	Koreans Protest Alleged U.S. Killings  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Waving signs and chanting, a South  
Korean student group rallied in downtown Seoul today, demanding 
that the United States punish those responsible for the alleged 
mass killings of civilians by U.S. forces at the start of the 
Korean War. It was the first public reaction from South Korea's 
largest student group regarding last week's news report on the 
alleged killings in July 1950. Last week, The Associated Press 
reported accounts by American veterans that their unit killed a 
large number of civilians at No Gun Ri, South Korea, during the 
early days of the Korean War. The villagers say 400 died.

evicted from their homeland. Craig Sanders, who is leading a U.N. 
assessment mission in West Timor, told The Associated Press that 
some refugees could be taken back on U.N.-chartered flights as 
early as Wednesday. Aid agencies say the majority of the 230,000 
refugees taken to West Timor -- many of them against their will --

elections today, moving into second place, according to preliminary 
results. The results, broadcast by Austrian television gave the 
Freedom Party of Joerg Haider 28.4 percent, a gain of 6.5 
percentage points. That allowed them to overtake the centrist 
People's Party, in second place going into the elections. They had 
27.8 percent, with 33 percent of the votes counted. The Socialists 
remained first, with 32.8 percent. But they lost heavily -- 5.3

</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Warren  
Sapp is forced to sit out today's game with the Minnesota Vikings 
because of his broken left hand. ``The doctors said it would be 
better for him to wait for Green Bay'' next week, team spokesman 
Reggie Roberts said. Sapp, the NFC defensive player of the month 
for September, broke two bones in his left hand last week against 
Denver, although he returned to play the second half.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Delays Scandal Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch says  
he can't testify this month at a congressional hearing into Olympic 
bidding scandals, but he is willing to do so later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Sunday he would testify in December after the IOC  
votes on a series of reform measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch sent a letter to Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who had  
requested that he appear at an Oct. 14 hearing into excesses 
related to Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton has threatened to subpoena Samaranch if he declines to  
appear at the Oct. 14 hearing of the House commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigation. Samaranch declined to appear at a 
similar hearing in the Senate in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Samaranch said the IOC ``will fully cooperate''  
with Upton. But he said he was too busy at the moment pushing 
through reforms prompted by the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that I work full time to generate the required  
consensus,'' he said. ``My primary responsibility in these 
circumstances must rest with the need to ensure that our reforms 
proceed as planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was prepared to appear before Upton's  
committee any time after the Dec. 11-12 session where the full IOC 
will vote on the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from my inability to come to the United States earlier,  
this would also provide the most suitable opportunity to give you 
the best and most complete information, not only on what went 
wrong, but also and above all, on what remedies are being put into 
place,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, a Spaniard, said he will need a Spanish interpreter  
at the hearing ``to avoid any misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would welcome a visit by Upton to IOC  
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would ask the two IOC members in the United  
States, Anita DeFrantz and Jim Easton, and IOC director general 
Francois Carrard to testify at the Oct. 14 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton has called the hearing to investigate a ``culture of  
corruption'' surrounding Atlanta's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to Congress last month detailed gifts,  
travel, favors and offers of college scholarships and job 
assistance to IOC members and their families from the Atlanta bid 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the report proved ``votes were for sale'' and accused  
the IOC of fostering a corrupt bid culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said he wanted Samaranch to ``explain exactly how the IOC  
awards the games,'' based on some of the ``outrageous revelations'' 
related to the Atlanta bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's new ethics commission said last week it would review  
the Atlanta report to determine whether any IOC members had 
committed improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who headed an inquiry that led to  
the expulsion or resignation of 10 IOC members in the Salt Lake 
City scandal, said Saturday he saw no evidence in the Atlanta 
report that merited sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at hearings called by Sen. John  
McCain in April in the wake of the vote-buying scandal stemming 
from Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Samaranch sent DeFrantz to represent him. The  
hearing turned into a forum for IOC bashing. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has scheduled another hearing for Oct. 20, this time on  
the problem of performance-enhancing drugs in Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has not traveled to the United States since the Salt  
Lake City scandal broke late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other IOC members could face questioning by FBI agents  
investigating the Salt Lake City scandal.

<HEADLINE> JFK Administration Reunites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a class reunion of sorts, dozens of members of  
John F. Kennedy's administration gathered Sunday to celebrate the 
20th anniversary of the library and museum built in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time so many Kennedy staffers, from administrative  
assistants to the president's inner circle, were under one roof was 
the 35th president's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very moving experience,'' said Theodore Sorensen, 71,  
former special counsel to Kennedy. ``This was a very special 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A panel discussion featuring Sorensen, former assistant attorney  
general Burke Marshall and historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., 
focused on their former boss' achievements, from avoiding nuclear 
disaster to fostering loyalty and honesty in his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Decrying ``the new cynicism about American politics,''  
Schlesinger recalled Kennedy's ability to inspire both a nation and 
a young group of staffers he called on for help in running the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a youthful time, a youthful administration, a young  
president,'' said Stewart Udall, 79, former Secretary of the 
Interior. ``At a time when there's so much gridlock and stupidity 
in Washington, it might be productive for the younger generation to 
recreate and understand what happened (during Kennedy's tenure).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forum, part of a monthlong series of events to commemorate  
the 20th anniversary of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, was 
attended by more than 40 members of the administration and hundreds 
of members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles U. Daly, executive director of the library and former  
staff assistant to Kennedy, said the reunion was meant to be a 
festive occasion to celebrate the president's legacy and give the 
public ``a sense of what it was like then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the faces have changed a bit,'' he said. ``But it was  
very gratifying.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges OPEC To Cut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries should cut production further to raise the oil price to 
more than $33 a barrel, Iraq's parliamentary speaker said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article published in the Al-Thawra newspaper, Sadoun  
Hammadi, who is also an economist, accused OPEC member states of 
flooding the market with oil to please the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important issue that should be discussed at the OPEC  
summit in Venezuela is production ceilings and prices,'' Hammadi 
wrote in the paper, which is controlled by the ruling Baath Party. 
OPEC is due to meet in Venezuela in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oil price should be $33.71 per barrel, which is a just and  
reasonable price,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In London on Friday, North Sea Brent crude oil futures settled  
at $23.67 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The price fell to below $10 a barrel in February as the world  
experienced a glut of oil. OPEC and non-OPEC members subsequently 
agreed on a series of production cutbacks which raised the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was reported as telling his  
Cabinet last week that the price was still too low and accused the 
United States of manipulating the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would certain OPEC members abandon the policy of flooding the  
market with oil to suit the interest of big industrial countries 
(such as) the United States?,'' Hammadi asked in a clear reference 
to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has long accused Saudi Arabia of exporting more than it  
should.

<HEADLINE> Koch Brothers Head Back to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- The latest chapter of the battle between the  
Koch brothers heads to a federal court Monday with allegations that 
Koch Industries, the country's leading crude purchaser, stole oil 
from the Indians and independent producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Koch is suing the company his father built and his older  
brother, Charles, now runs. The civil lawsuit claims the company 
based in Wichita, Kan., stole millions of dollars by underreporting 
the amounts of oil purchased from federal leases and Indian lands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Osage Nation, from which Koch gets most of the oil it  
obtains from Indian lands, isn't joining Bill Koch's lawsuit. Chief 
Charles Tillman said the tribe couldn't prove any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side will say how much potential liability is faced by  
Koch Industries, the nation's second-largest privately held company 
with $30 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second time in just over a year that Bill Koch  
(net worth $650 million) has taken his older brother Charles, (net 
worth $3.4 billion), to federal court. Last year in Topeka, Kan., 
Bill Koch unsuccessfully claimed he was cheated out of more than $1 
billion when he sold his stake in Koch Industries back in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection in the most recent case begins Monday in federal  
court in Tulsa. The trial is expected to last months. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the lawsuit alleges Koch Industries routinely  
instructed employees to underreport the amount of oil they collect 
from producers' tanks. The lawsuit alleges Koch received 5.3 
million barrels, or more than $133 million, of oil without paying 
for it between 1981 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of history behind this case and the parties  
involved,'' said Jay Rosser, spokesman for Koch Industries. ``The 
fact of the matter is that it will be up to a court and a jury to 
evaluate the facts here. And when that's said and done, we're 
confident our integrity will be affirmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea that Oklahoma producers were not aware they were being  
ripped off makes the merits of the Koch case shaky, said Dewey 
Bartlett Jr., president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum 
Association. The OIPA represents some 1,200 oil and gas producers 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the American Petroleum Institute's manual on  
standards for measuring crude oil, it is ``impossible'' to measure 
oil without error because of the variables involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Koch Industries is relying in part on company  
records that show millions of dollars in ``overages,'' or the 
amount of oil the company actually took in but did not pay for. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch Industries officials concede the company made about $10  
million in profit per year from the overages. But they say that was 
only a small amount of the company's overall intake. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the time period this suit addresses, Koch purchased and  
transported more than 20 million gallons of crude oil each day,'' 
Rosser said. ``Contrary to the implications of the suit, very, very 
little of that oil came from federal or Native American lands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, several former Koch employees say they were trained  
to alter information on how much oil was collected, according to 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Dubose, former division manager of Koch Oil Co.'s  
southeastern region, said he was promoted because he changed the 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is how you got promoted with Koch,'' Dubose said in an  
interview with The Associated Press. ``They wouldn't use the word 
steal, but they would insinuate to change the numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dubose is expected to testify in the Tulsa federal trial. What  
the jury will not hear about is a 1987 U.S. Senate investigation 
that concluded Koch stole oil by deliberate mismeasurement from 
Indian-owned lands in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge barred the report from the trial because Bill  
Koch was ``involved to some degree'' with the committee's 
investigation, the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FBI agent in charge of the investigation said he never  
talked to Bill Koch during the probe. Jim Elroy said investigators 
set up surveillance on certain Indian leases, including several in 
eastern Oklahoma. Koch employs about 1,000 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Elroy said they would first observe Koch employees taking gauge  
measurements. Then they would take their own measurements and 
compare figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that they were recording numbers other than the  
numbers they were observing,'' Elroy said. ``When we confronted 
them, they stated that they were trained to do this -- they were 
required to make alterations in the company's favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elroy currently works for the San Diego law firm that filed the  
lawsuit on behalf of Bill Koch. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 85 percent of the oil Koch purchased from Indian  
lands was bought from the Osage Nation in eastern Oklahoma. Chief 
Tillman said they reviewed their records and have not found any 
suspicions of Koch Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillman and others in the oil industry said they will casually  
be paying attention to the trial but do not expect anything more 
than a family fight.

<HEADLINE> Talent Infusion Lifts Alabama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- While the program festered in its own  
disillusion and disappointment, Alabama coach Mike DuBose and his 
staff kept hammering away at the only real solution to the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	They kept recruiting.  
</P>
<P>
	They won commitments, large and small, signing blue-chip  
prospects from the back roads of Mississippi, taking fliers on some 
risky junior-college talent, even coming out on top in a few 
head-to-head recruiting battles against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	That, as much as luck or fate, was the reason No. 12 Alabama  
pulled one of the major upsets of the year Saturday, defeating the 
No. 8 Gators 40-39 in overtime and ending their 30-game winning 
streak at The Swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems the talent gap between Alabama (4-1, 3-0 Southeastern  
Conference) and Florida (4-1, 2-1) has shrunk since NCAA-imposed 
scholarship reductions during the mid-1990s stripped the Tide of 
numbers and put DuBose in a difficult situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Take, for example, Andrew Zow, the Crimson Tide quarterback who  
came to Alabama from Lake Butler, Fla., only 40 miles up the road 
from Gainesville. A knee injury as a senior in high school made him 
a marginal prospect for the Gators, who envisioned him as a 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	Zow showed them, throwing for 336 yards and two scores in  
possibly the best performance by an Alabama quarterback since Jay 
Barker led the Tide to its last national title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't play to get back at somebody,'' Zow said. ``I come to  
play for the University of Alabama and my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a high school star in Starkville, Miss., receiver Freddie  
Milons had to choose between Alabama and Florida. He decided to go 
to Alabama, where he could make an immediate impact, instead of 
Florida, where he would have had to wait his turn. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems Milons' instincts were correct. He caught 10 passes for  
119 yards against the Gators to become the first Alabama player to 
surpass 100 yards receiving in consecutive games since Ozzie 
Newsome in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a big game for this program,'' Milons said. ``We beat  
Florida, at home. We ended their 30-game home winning streak. We 
were the major underdog, but we shocked everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, they shocked the Gators.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida had become the power of the SEC after a decade of  
stockpiling talent, much the way Alabama did in the days of Bear 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	If Florida didn't sense Alabama's resurgence before the game, it  
surely did afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Florida's first loss at home since October 1994, when  
Terry Bowden and Auburn won 36-33 at The Swamp. One big difference: 
the Tigers had beaten Florida the previous year in Auburn. This 
latest loss seemed to take the Gators by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see the same fire and intensity as I saw against  
Tennessee,'' Florida defensive lineman Gerard Warren said, 
referring to a 23-21 victory two weeks ago. ``Maybe some guys 
underestimated them and didn't take them as seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the defeat, Florida remains on track for a berth in  
the SEC title game at Atlanta and a possible rematch with the 
Crimson Tide. The Gators still hold the tiebreaker over Tennessee 
and will get to Atlanta by winning the rest of their conference 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Spurrier would like to think his team will learn something  
from its mistakes in a rematch. Three turnovers resulted in 17 
points for Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the final error: a miss on the extra point in overtime by  
Jeff Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	It was made all the more painful when Alabama's Chris Kemp  
missed as well, but an offsides penalty gave him a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it, and DuBose, whose job appeared in jeopardy two weeks  
ago, won his second straight game against a team in the Top 25.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole: Woman Can Lead Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If she wins the presidency, Republican  
Elizabeth Dole said Sunday, her sex will have no bearing on her 
ability to serve as commander in chief. She said she already has 
been the only woman to lead a branch of the armed forces, the Coast 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyway, Dole said on ``Fox News Sunday,'' being president is  
about executive experience, of which she said she has plenty. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole headed the Coast Guard in the 1980s as President Reagan's  
secretary of transportation. The Coast Guard is in the 
Transportation Department during peacetime but in war comes under 
the Pentagon's control. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain why she would be a better commander in chief  
than another GOP presidential hopeful, Sen. John McCain, a former 
Navy pilot and prisoner of war, Dole said: 
</P>
<P>
	``You may be speaking of gender, and let me say that I think  
there are a lot of men who are not prepared to be commander in 
chief. I think you have to look at what sort of experience I have, 
and whether I'm prepared to be president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she said ``of course (McCain) does have that  
experience,'' but added: ``My experience includes a great deal of 
foreign policy in terms of each of the positions I've held. ... 
I've served as the first woman to head a branch of the armed 
forces, the United States Coast Guard when I was secretary of 
transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's first government job was as President Nixon's main  
consumer adviser. She was President Bush's secretary of labor and 
resigned as head of the American Red Cross to run for president.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Players Lobby for Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The last-place Chicago Cubs ended the season  
sticking up for manager Jim Riggleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old adage is, Jimmy didn't throw one pitch, he didn't  
throw one ball,'' Mark Grace said Sunday after the Cubs finished 
with a 9-5 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. ``He was the same guy 
that was runner-up for manager of the year last year. He didn't 
just forget what to do. It's our fault, from Sammy (Sosa) to me to 
the 25th guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs finished 30 games behind division winner Houston at  
67-95 and only Florida, with three fewer victories, was worse. It 
was their poorest showing since 1980, not counting the strike 
shortened seasons in 1994 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love what I'm doing, and as much as I love it, I don't think  
anyone could enjoy managing anymore than I do,'' said Riggleman, 
374-419 in five years with the Cubs. ``As I've said many times 
before, it's not the cure for cancer, the way to world peace. There 
are a lot of tough things going on in the world, and whether the 
manager comes back is pretty low on the list of priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight game, Cubs general manager Ed Lynch  
chatted with Riggleman in the visitors' clubhouse. In August, Lynch 
tried to quell rumors that Riggleman would be fired by committing 
to the manager though the end of the season. Any evaluation, he 
said, would come after the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Both had their contracts extended one year in August 1998 by  
Cubs president Andy MacPhail. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Trachsel, who lost Sunday and finished 8-18, also said  
Riggleman wasn't to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not the reason we had this kind of season,'' Trachsel  
said. ``We have to look at ourselves for the reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace left no doubt that he wanted to see Riggleman return.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a better team next year -- I don't  
think the changes need to be made in the dugout,'' Grace said. 
``They need to be made between the lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two games into the season, the Cubs were in first place with a  
.500 record. They remained tied for the lead for only three games, 
before falling into third after a 9-3 loss to Pittsburgh on May 10. 
They didn't move above .500 until May 1, 21 games in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs were one game back of the lead in the NL Central three  
times. But after beating Arizona 5-3 on June 8 to close within one 
for the last time, the Cubs lost 10 of 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who closed the year with his 63rd home run, said he would  
like to see Riggleman back in the clubhouse next year. But he said 
the decision wasn't his to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to play with Riggs. He's been a great guy with me,''  
Sosa said. ``But, if something happens from now on, I don't have 
any control over it.''

<HEADLINE> India Likely To Sign Nuclear Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India will sign the sweeping nuclear  
test ban treaty after a new parliament is seated this month, a top 
aide to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee indicated 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consensus is building in the country about our stand on the  
CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) and after the parliament 
meets, we will be in a position to take concrete steps,'' Brajesh 
Mishra, India's national security adviser, told the private STAR 
television network. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing  
last year, and assured the U.N. General Assembly in New York last 
October that India would not be the cause of any delay in the 
adoption of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	But his government fell earlier this year when he lost a  
parliament vote. According to most exit polls and voter surveys 
after elections ended Sunday, Vajpayee is set to return to power at 
the head of his 22-party alliance this month. 
</P>
<P>
	India has long called the treaty discriminatory, saying it would  
help the declared nuclear powers retain their superiority over 
other nations. India itself carried out nuclear tests in May last 
year, provoking Pakistan to launch tit-for-tat explosions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Facing Test-Ban Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As it presses for Senate ratification of a  
nuclear test ban treaty, the Clinton administration must overcome 
Republican anxiety over the CIA's inability to verify low-level 
underground nuclear explosions in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends the shortcomings in the CIA's  
monitoring capabilities give reason to ratify the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who control the Senate, disagree. They also contend  
the treaty, signed by 154 countries, is flawed in other ways and 
would amount to unilateral disarmament by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice last month, U.S. intelligence saw signs of activity in  
Russia that could have indicated secret testing. The CIA was unable 
to say with certainty exactly what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know that there was any testing going on,'' White  
House Chief of Staff John Podesta said Sunday on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' He added: ``This is really an argument for the treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the fall of the Soviet Union, President Bush signed a  
limited testing moratorium to take effect Oct. 1, 1992, for nine 
months. President Clinton continued the moratorium -- the country's 
last test was in September 1992 -- then signed the comprehensive 
global treaty in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, a plank in the 1992 Democratic Party platform, went  
to the Senate for ratification in 1997. It languished in the Senate 
until last week, when Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
unexpectedly scheduled a full Senate vote for Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling for the 67 votes necessary for ratification, the  
White House began a campaign this weekend to boost the treaty, 
complaining of a sneak attack by Lott in giving only 10 days to 
make a case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said Sunday that Lott opposes  
the treaty for several reasons. The ``verifiability issue'' is one, 
he said, ``but that's not the primary one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testing is vital to maintenance of nuclear stockpiles,  
Czwartacki said. It is not wise ``to unilaterally disarm at a time 
when North Korea is making strides in its nuclear program, and 
China, through ill-gotten means, also is making progress in its 
program,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this administration chooses not to test, that is a decision  
they will make. But why would we want to handcuff future 
administrations?'' 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet is scheduled to give secret briefings  
in Congress and testify in private hearings this week. He is likely 
to be grilled on the low-level testing question. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. intelligence official said Sunday the CIA repeatedly has  
discussed with lawmakers the difficulty in monitoring such tests. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said  
ratifying the treaty would ``give us more tools to verify, and it 
will constrain others from testing,'' partly because of the 
political pressure that 150 signatories bring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States does not test and has no plans to, Leavy  
said. ``This treaty bans other countries. It is about preventing 
nuclear war.''

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Teams Drop to 0-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From the Super Bowl to 0-8.  
</P>
<P>
	Just nine months after starring in the title game, the Denver  
Broncos and Atlanta Falcons each fell to 0-4 Sunday, the first time 
in a non-strike season that conference champions began the next 
season so poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, which also might have lost 1998 NFL MVP Terrell Davis  
with a knee injury, was beaten by the New York Jets 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, whose own All-Pro running back, Jamal Anderson, is  
already out for the season with a wrecked knee, lost to Baltimore 
19-13 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	And they both lost at home.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of in shock right now,'' Broncos linebacker Glenn  
Cadrez said. ``We've got to stick together and get one win and go 
from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rematch of last year's AFC championship game was sloppy,  
with the Jets ultimately capitalizing on five Denver interceptions 
and a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggling Jets (1-3) rallied from a 13-7 deficit with two  
fourth-quarter touchdowns: Curtis Martin's 2-yard run and Rick 
Mirer's second TD pass of the game, a 16-yarder to Dedric Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver coach Mike Shanahan feared the worst with Davis,  
scheduled to have tests on his knee Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it happened, they said there was some looseness in his  
knee,'' Shanahan said. ``We're going to keep our fingers crossed 
that it's not an ACL. But at this time it looks like it could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFC champion Falcons dropped to 0-4 when Stoney Case threw a  
54-yard pass to Justin Armour in overtime. With 49 seconds left in 
regulation, Atlanta coach Dan Reeves decided not to let Morten 
Andersen try a 53-yard field goal that could have won the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The host Falcons went three-and-out to open overtime, then Case  
found Armour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons played without starting quarterback Chris Chandler  
(pulled hamstring). Backup Tony Graziani left with a concussion in 
the second period. They also lost Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan, 
who was ejected after Case hooked up with Patrick Johnson on a 
52-yard touchdown for Baltimore (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson danced over Buchanan and as he was about to spike the  
ball, Buchanan put Johnson in a bear hug and slammed him into the 
ground. Buchanan also punched Johnson in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere Sunday, it was Minnesota 21, Tampa Bay 14;  
Jacksonville 17, Pittsburgh 3; Dallas 35, Arizona 7; New England 
19, Cleveland 7; Chicago 14, New Orleans 10; St. Louis 38, 
Cincinnati 10; the New York Giants 16, Philadelphia 15; San 
Francisco 24, Tennessee 22; San Diego 21, Kansas City 14; and 
Washington 38, Carolina 36. 
</P>
<P>
	At night, Seattle edged Oakland 22-21.  
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo visits Miami on Monday night. Green Bay, Detroit and  
Indianapolis were off this week. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Seahawks 22, Raiders 21    	
</P>
<P>
	Todd Peterson kicked three field goals, including the winner  
from 45 yards with 10:07 left. Michael Husted was short on a 
61-yard attempt at the final buzzer for Oakland (2-2) as Seattle 
(3-1) took over first place in the AFC West. Charlie Rogers had a 
68-yard punt return for the hosts. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Vikings 21, Buccaneers 14    	
</P>
<P>
	Randy Moss, the 1998 Offensive Rookie of the Year, was at his  
finger-pointing, chest-thumping, touchdown-catching best. Moss tied 
his career-high with a 61-yard catch for a touchdown, added a 
27-yard score and had a 21-yard reception against triple coverage 
that set up Andrew Glover's TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put up 21 points in the first quarter, that's  
exciting,'' said Moss, who earlier in the week criticized offensive 
coordinator Ray Sherman's game plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss had only nine catches for 123 yards heading into the game,  
but had four for 120 vs. the usually stingy Tampa Bay defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice to get back in a groove again,'' said Randall  
Cunningham, who was 26-for-34 for 296 yards and three TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	But that groove didn't last long for the Vikings (2-2). Visiting  
Tampa Bay (2-2) shut them down after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still missing that fire,'' Moss said.  
</P>
<P>
                         *Rams 38, Bengals 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Cincinnati, Az-Zahir Hakim tied a Rams record by scoring four  
touchdowns, three on passes from Kurt Warner, the fourth on an 
84-yard punt return. Warner, a former Arena Football passer, became 
the first quarterback in the last 50 years to throw three touchdown 
passes in each of his first three starts. He went 17-for-21 for 310 
yards, improving his passer rating to 125. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaac Bruce had six catches for 152 yards for the Rams (3-0).  
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals (0-4) became the first NFL franchise to lose 100  
games in the 1990s, breaking their tie at 99 with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Redskins 38, Panthers 36    	
</P>
<P>
	At Washington, Brett Conway kicked a 31-yard field goal with six  
seconds remaining in a seesaw game that Carolina led 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins (3-1), winning their third straight, also blew a  
35-24 fourth-quarter lead. The winning drive came after an instant 
replay challenge by Washington coach Norv Turner reversed a fumbled 
punt return by Brian Mitchell at the Redskins 19 with 4:19 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Johnson, the league's most efficient passer, completed 20  
of 33 passes for 337 yards and four touchdowns. Michael Westbrook 
and Albert Connell each caught two TDs. Westbrook had eight 
receptions for 140 yards and Connell added five for 134. 
</P>
<P>
	Tshimanga Biakabutuka scored on runs of 60, 1 and 45 yards for  
Carolina (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
                         *49ers 24, Titans 22    	
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Garcia, replacing Steve Young, threw for two touchdowns and  
ran for a third in San Francisco's 19th straight win at home under 
coach Steve Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfred Tubbs' fourth-quarter interception of Neil O'Donnell led  
to Garcia's second touchdown pass. And after Tennessee scored nine 
points in the last 3:38, Lee Woodall burst through the line to 
tackle Eddie George and foil a 2-point conversion that would have 
tied it. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Chargers 21, Chiefs 14    	
</P>
<P>
	San Diego (2-1) intercepted Elvis Grbac four times, two of them  
leading to touchdowns. Cornerback Darryll Lewis, starting in place 
of the injured Terrance Shaw, had two pickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Jim Harbaugh left with a bruised right elbow, and  
the Chargers didn't reach the 100-yard mark until the third 
quarter. They finished with just 132 yards, but 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Kramer threw two touchdown passes for the host Chargers.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs (2-2) led 14-0 after Grbac's two TD passes.  
</P>
<P>
                       *Cowboys 35, Cardinals 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Host Dallas got some revenge against the team that knocked it  
out of last season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Raghib Ismail's 63-yard touchdown catch sparked the Cowboys  
(3-0), then defensive end Greg Ellis went 98 yards with a fumble 
return. Elis also had an 87-yard interception return TD two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (1-3) continued to struggle, falling behind 21-0 for the 	
second time this season and committing five turnovers. Jake Plummer 
threw three more interceptions, increasing his league-worst total 
to 12. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Jaguars 17, Steelers 3 	
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville (3-1) won for the first time in five visits to  
Pittsburgh as its defense got two safeties to outscore Pittsburgh's 
stumbling offense. The Steelers (2-2) have lost four straight at 
home, their longest streak since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Both safeties came on hits against Kordell Stewart. Mark Brunell  
also threw a short touchdown pass and Mike Hollis hit two field 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Patriots 19, Browns 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Terry Glenn overcame two costly first-half fumbles with a  
club-record 13 receptions for 214 yards at Cleveland. He turned a 
short pass into a 54-yard TD on the first play of the fourth 
quarter as New England (4-0) finally pulled away from the expansion 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland (0-4) took its first lead of the season on a 64-yard  
hookup by rookies Tim Couch and Kevin Johnson. But they couldn't 
stop Drew Bledsoe, who was 28-for-42 for 389 yards. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Bears 14, Saints 10    	
</P>
<P>
	Shane Matthews found Curtis Conway for two touchdowns in the  
last 1:48. A 6-yard pass with seven seconds left won it as Saints 
coach Mike Ditka threw his clipboard in disgust. It's the first 
time Chicago (2-2) has beaten Ditka, who played for the Bears and 
was their coach for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Williams, who wasn't supposed to play because of a  
hyperextended right elbow, rushed for 84 yards for visiting New 
Orleans (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
                        *Giants 16, Eagles 15    	
</P>
<P>
	New York (2-2) fumbled six times, but Philadelphia (0-4) grabbed  
only two of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles scored on two field goals by Norm Johnson and Bobby  
Taylor's 18-yard interception return. They also got a safety when 
Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn lateraled off an interception and 
the ball went into the end zone, where teammate Phillippi Sparks 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Giants' Brad Daluiso kicked three field goals and Kent  
Graham, before being benched with three interceptions, hit Ike 
Hilliard for a 9-yard score.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti CEO: Restructuring Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Olivetti's chief executive insisted in an  
interview published Sunday that the Italian government doesn't have 
the right to block Telecom Italia's financial restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to our legal consultants, the legal assumptions for  
the application of the `golden share' don't exist,'' Roberto 
Colaninno told Milan daily Corriere della Sera. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government's small stake in former state monopoly  
Telecom, of around just under 4 percent, carries special veto 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's treasury minister has indicated the ministry might  
invoke its ``golden share'' veto to block the restructuring if 
necessary to protect small investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said Olivetti SpA, a former typewriter and computer  
maker turned telecommunications company, intends to go ahead with 
the controversial plan for Telecom Italia SpA, object of Olivetti's 
successful hostile takeover bid this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that the project is good and in the interests  
of shareholders,'' he said. ``But it, I have to say, remains an 
open proposal. It can always be improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said he will propose measures aimed at convincing the  
market and stockholders of the plan's merits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, announcement of the plan sent Telecom Italia's share  
prices plunging on the Milan stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti wants to pass control of Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM),  
Italy's largest, and highly profitable, cellular phone company from 
Telecom Italia to Tecnost and compensate with stock in Tecnost. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including the treasury minister, say the proposed  
restructuring risks crippling Telecom Italia by robbing it of its 
most profitable arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti now owns 70 percent of Tecnost and Tecnost holds a 52.1  
percent stake in Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno also denied rumors that there is a plan to link  
Olivetti with industrial holding company Montedison SpA and 
eventually bring Telecom Italia and Montedison electricity unit 
Edison SpA together. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the chief executive wouldn't rule it out as a  
hypothesis.

<HEADLINE> Radio City Restoration Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a $70 million restoration, the  
once-neglected Radio City Music Hall is reopening with a 
star-studded gala. 
</P>
<P>
	From its newly woven 3,000-pound gold silk curtain to freshly  
cleaned Depression-era artwork, hidden for decades under layers of 
grit and grime, the landmark theater has been restored to its 
former Art Deco grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sparkling jewel once again,'' said Bob Russo, chairman  
of the restoration committee and general manager of Madison Square 
Garden, whose parent company Cablevision has a 25-year lease on the 
building and owns Radio City Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	The theater reopens Monday night with a benefit featuring Billy  
Crystal, Ann-Margret, Sting, Tony Bennett, 98 Degrees, Ann Miller 
and Raquel Welch. The show will be taped and aired on NBC on Dec.1. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first major renovation since the building opened Dec.  
27, 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we essentially have is a new building in the old skin,  
but it's a pure restoration,'' Russo said. ``We took painstaking 
efforts to recreate the original designs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months of work included replacing six miles of faded neon  
lights on the hall's marquee, rewiring 1,500 chandeliers and 
re-insulating walls to improve the acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
	All 5,901 seats were reupholstered. Wall covering was recreated  
by a textile mill following the design on a scrap of the original 
that was found buried behind faded wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 20 art experts, using Q-tips, tiny scalpels and cotton  
squares, cleaned layers of smoke and grime from the 60-by-40 foot 
``Fountain of Youth'' mural painted by Ezra Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became a rather dark, nondescript place,'' Russo said. But  
now, he said, ``I think what will strike visitors most is how 
bright it really is.''

 *Raymond Alf    	
</P>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Raymond Alf, a revered teacher who  
inspired students with his unusual teaching styles and founded the 
Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology, died Monday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Alf taught math and biology at Webb Schools and was known for  
his strange teaching methods, such as swinging from pipes to 
demonstrate the evolutionary feat. 
</P>
<P>
	Alf, who began at Webb as a tutor in 1929, led hundreds of  
students on field trips around the western United States to collect 
fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1940s, after Alf and his student had accumulated  
about 20,000 pieces -- pig skulls to alligator jaws and dinosaur 
tracks -- he began pushing for a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 years later the museum bearing his name was opened on  
the Webb campus and has since drawn scores of professional 
paleontologists and educated a legion of students.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Alastair Hetherington, editor of The Guardian for  
nearly 20 years and later head of the British Broadcasting Corp. in 
Scotland, died Sunday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	As editor of The Guardian from 1956 to 1975, Hetherington  
oversaw the move of the venerable Manchester Guardian to the 
renamed newspaper's present base in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Hetherington joined the Manchester Guardian in 1950 after four  
years at The Glasgow Herald, and served as assistant editor and 
foreign editor. In 1971, he was named Journalist of the Year in the 
National Press awards. 
</P>
<P>
	He became head of BBC Scotland in 1975 and held the post three  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hetherington wrote a half dozen books including, ``A Walker's  
Guide to Arran,'' the Scottish island where he had a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, four children and three  
stepchildren.

 *Akio Morita    	
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Akio Morita, the entrepreneur, engineer and savvy  
salesman who helped give new meaning to the words ``Made in 
Japan,'' died Sunday of pneumonia, Sony Corp. said. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Morita co-founded Sony in a bombed-out department store after  
World War II. He was the last of a generation of Japanese 
industrialists that included carmaker Soichiro Honda and 
electronics rival Konosuke Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Morita's guidance, Sony was instrumental in changing  
Japan's image from a maker of slipshod products to a world leader 
in high-quality automobiles and electronics. In the process, his 
company became a multibillion dollar conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the central Japanese city of Nagoya on Jan. 26, 1921,  
Morita retired as Sony's chairman in 1994. A year earlier he had 
suffered a stroke that left him weakened and in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanned, snowy-haired Morita, who took up water-skiing in his  
60s, also pioneered new behavior for corporate Japan. He pushed his 
engineers to take risks with new products and criticized lavishly 
paid American executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He caused a stir in 1989 by co-authoring ``The Japan That Can  
Say 'No''' with current Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara, then refusing 
to authorize an English translation. In it, Morita criticized U.S. 
corporate culture as overindulgent.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Wayne Sevier, a longtime National Football  
League special teams coach, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 
58. 
</P>
<P>
	Sevier was with the San Diego Chargers three times, including  
for the final 15 games of last season. He was not retained when 
Mike Riley took over as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers held a moment of silence for Sevier prior to their  
home game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pfizer CEO Donates $35M to Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Edmund T. Pratt Jr. is giving $35 million to  
endow the Duke University School of Engineering, which will be 
named in honor of the retired Pfizer Inc. chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift is the second largest in Duke's history, surpassed only  
by the Durham school's original gift of $40 million by cigarette 
magnate James B. Duke in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt's gift was announced Sunday after being accepted by the  
school's board of trustees over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's engineering school was organized in 1939. It has 108  
faculty members, 935 undergraduate students and 289 graduate 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt, 72, graduated from Duke magna cum laude in 1947 with a  
bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He received a master's 
degree in business administration from the University of 
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for a two-year Navy stint during the Korean War, Pratt  
worked for IBM Corp. until 1962, when he became President Kennedy's 
assistant secretary of the Army for financial management. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined pharmaceutical maker Pfizer as corporate controller in  
1964. By the time Pratt retired in 1992, the company's annual 
revenues were nearly $7 billion a year and the company's operations 
had spread to 140 countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
	OSAKA, Japan (AP) -- Two-time European champion Alina Kabaeva of  
Russia, already winner of the all-around individual championship, 
scored a perfect 10.0 Sunday in winning the ribbon event and added 
the ball title in the individual apparatus final at the World 
Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10.0 was Kabaeva's sixth at the championships. Kabaeva, 16,  
won more medals than any other gymnast during the six-day meet -- 
four golds and two silvers. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic bronze medalist Elena Vitrichenko of Ukraine also won  
two events Sunday. Vitrichenko, the all-around champion in the 
previous championships at Berlin in 1997, captured the rope and the 
hoop -- each one with a perfect mark, outscoring Kabaeva. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Russia won five golds. Ukraine had the two won by  
Vitrichenko, and Greece also won two in the team apparatus finals -- 
one for the ball, the other in the combination of hoops and 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships served as a qualifier for the 2000 Olympics.

<P>
	PARIS (AP) - Ready-to-wear clothes for spring 2000 flew down the  
runway in dashes of hot or pastel colors at Balmain's show Sunday 
at the beginning of a hectic fashion week. 
</P>
<P>
	Designed by Gilles Dufour, lately of Chanel as Karl Lagerfeld's  
assistant, the clothes were light and bright. 
</P>
<P>
	Casual, sometimes sexy looks came out with airy little skirts,  
uneven hemlines and splatter prints. They were topped by pretty, 
small sweaters in pastel stripes, sometimes with scattered sequins. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweaters could be worn by the small gaggle of aristocratic  
Balmain clients who attended the show. But they looked bemused 
rather than thrilled, and would probably prefer Balmain couture -- 
still by Oscar de la Renta. 
</P>
<P>
	Other brief dresses had a castaway look with their torn-edged  
hems. Pinks, blues and lavenders came out with corals in tailored 
little jackets with unfinished edges and silk skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was Claudia Schiffer, former Chanel top model. She  
looked great in her two-piece light beige chiffon with a touch of 
flounces, plus a sprinkling of rhinestone spangles. Schiffer did 
not parade in any of the hot-pants-style bikinis or monokinis, 
sporting various jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	Long and shorter or uneven-hem chiffons in all pastel colors of  
the rainbow, but especially strong shades like emerald, grass green 
and salmon, ended the young and colorful show on a high note. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was also upbeat at Ines de la Fressange's show. But it  
was all an act: the former Chanel model was fired a few months ago 
by the majority shareholders of her company and was not around for 
her last show. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, crowds turned out to see the collection she had  
planned. 
</P>
<P>
	For daytime, her sleek pinstriped suits with sequined leaf  
motifs were peppy and distinctive, yet classical enough for fairly 
conservative dressers. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding Latin spice to the show were hot-colored silk and  
mixed-fabric knotted blouses, bras and short skirts, plus some 
titillating bikinis with little beaded fringes. 
</P>
<P>
	She put her own silvery tree-like logo on some of the appealing  
evening wear. And the little black dress got an update with a red 
sequined hip belt and high hip slit. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was sparked with live entertainment, songs from  
actress-singers Gabrielle Lazure and Yolanda Graves -- in attractive 
Ines de la Fressange evening gear. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a better-than-ever offering, so fashion followers hope  
she'll find new backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Altieri put on a lively show for Pierre Cardin, borrowing  
some of the master's tricks like looped panels used as skirt 
fringes, adding modern art touches like squares of transparent 
tunic dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardin himself introduced Altieri, who's been doing the  
ready-to-wear for several seasons. ``He's worked at the house for 
24 years, said Cardin, ``and has now personalized the collection, 
which is truly his own, and young and fresh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The little skirt suits in crisp white and yellow linen with  
paneled skirts like maypole ribbons looked good enough to buy for a 
spring gala lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all flowing, mainly in whites and pastel colors, though  
not everybody with money might like to show off the navel like an 
exotic belly-dancer, as some of the bright chiffon evening wear and 
taffeta ballgowns did. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of flesh was revealed in younger designer Stella  
Cadente's collection, looking a bit sticky rather than chic on the 
short, undistinguished models. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of topless views were available in the shiny and lurex  
looks, such as a fringed capelet over silvery hip pants. And of 
course the bare midriff was de rigueur here, as in other spring 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
	The oddest idea was the body wig, like something out of Dick  
Tracy in the 1950s, such as Gravel Gertie would have worn. Cadente 
showed wig-like white hair as a bosom fringe or as a skirt, with 
ostrich feathers thrown in for the festive evening notes. Tracy 
would have loved it.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 4, Crew 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Edwin Gorter scored two goals and  
the Miami Fusion remained in contention for an MLS playoff bid with 
a 4-1 victory over the Columbus Crew on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Gutierrez and Jay Heaps also scored for the Fusion in the  
first half. Gorter closed the scoring with his second goal in the 
89th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus' only goal was Jeff Cunningham's penalty kick in the  
83rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moves the Fusion (12-19) into fourth place in the  
Eastern Conference with 26 points, one more than New England. Miami 
closes its season at home Saturday against Colorado, while New 
England finishes at D.C. United on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The top four teams in each conference advance to the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbus (19-12), which already has clinched second place in the  
Eastern Conference and a playoff spot, played without starters 
Brian McBride, Brian Maisonneuve and Mike Lapper as head coach Tom 
Fitzgerald rested them for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion took advantage of the depleted roster, especially in  
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorter scored his third goal of the season in the 22nd minute  
when Miami defender Brian Kamler sent him a crossing pass just 
inside the right penalty area. Gorter took two dribbles and 
unloaded a left-footed shot, which goalkeeper Matt Napoleon 
deflected with one hand but couldn't stop from going in the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami continued applying pressure and took a 2-0 lead in the  
34th minute when Gutierrez took a pass from Jim Rooney, dribbled to 
beat Crew defender Todd Yeagley and blasted an 18-yard shot for his 
sixth goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 42nd minute, Heaps scored his third goal of the season.  
Gorter fed Eric Wynalda with a pass deep inside the left box. 
Wynalda headed the pass toward the right goal post, where a 
streaking Heaps knocked it in.

<HEADLINE> White House Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Looking beyond his tenure in the Oval Office,  
President Clinton wondered aloud about following Ronald Reagan's 
path in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If President Reagan could be an actor and become president,''  
he told a Hollywood crowd gathered at the home of director Rob 
Reiner. ``Maybe I could become an actor. I've got a good pension, I 
can work for cheap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner had just offered up a 1990s version  
of their 2,000-year-old man routine for Clinton's enjoyment, and 
the president could not resist a few quips of his own. Blame it on 
the long days on the fund-raising trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 2 a.m. on my body clock and I'm reduced to being Gray  
Davis' straight man,'' Clinton said, referring to the famously dull 
California governor who, speaking before Clinton, bragged that Al 
Gore was his ``charisma consultant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton revealed that he was a big fan of the comedy practiced  
by Brooks and Reiner. ``I have a videotape of 'Blazing Saddles' and 
I watch it every six months whether I need to or not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he had an idea for a comeback film for Brooks, creator of  
``The Producers,'' a spoof of Hollywood storytellers that includes 
a production called ``Springtime for Hitler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All the Republicans, they've been fighting over what to do  
about Pat Buchanan now that he's got this interesting 
interpretation of World War II,'' Clinton said. ``I suggested that 
Mel might put him in a remake of 'The Producers.' That would be a 
good thing to do with Pat Buchanan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	After a breakfast with friends on Sunday, Clinton stopped by the  
home of film mogul Lew Wasserman, and spent several minutes looking 
over memorabilia in Wasserman's screening room. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the mementos: Wasserman's 1974 Oscar, a photo album from  
Jimmy Stewart's 1949 ``stag party'' and dozens of bound books 
containing photographs Wasserman collected over his long career. 
</P>
<P>
	One picture showed Lou Gehrig checking out the sleeve of Babe  
Ruth's baseball uniform. Another showed a young Bette Davis sitting 
coyly on a grassy slope. There also were framed photos of President 
Lyndon Johnson, and Wasserman hugging Johnson's wife, Lady Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton attended a luncheon fund-raiser that brought  
in $500,000 for Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., at the home of 
businessman Richard Ziman. He was addressing a $250,000 dinner for 
the DNC as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had a late-night fund-raiser over dessert to benefit the  
Democratic National Committee before a late departure to Washington 
aboard Air Force One to prepare to go head-to-head with Congress 
over the patients' bill of rights and the budget this week. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan's name kept coming up during Clinton's three-day  
fund-raising swing through Nevada and California. The trip raised 
$2.5 million for Democrats' campaigns in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks suggested that he was the greatest actor that ever lived,  
and that he turned in his most stunning performance at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you didn't know any better, you would think he was the  
president,'' he said. ``He fooled Gorbachev!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton invoked the Reagan-Bush years to draw a distinction  
between his economic policies and the GOP, saying ``Mr. Reagan and 
Mr. Bush brought in the supply-side economics, which defied 
arithmetic and quadrupled the debt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to have a senior senator (from Arkansas) named Dale  
Bumpers who had a great line about supply-side economics,'' Clinton 
said. ``'If you'll let me write $2 billion worth of hot checks I'll 
show you a good time, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest single event over the weekend was an $850,000 dinner  
Saturday night for House candidates put on by Access Now for Gay 
and Lesbian Equality -- the highlight of which was a lively number 
by the Gay Men's Chorus trumpeting the role of homosexuals in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	One-liners from the song -- such as ``You can't have New York  
without Queens'' -- tickled the president's fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was back there, feverishly trying to write down all those  
lines,'' he told the crowd. ``If someone would furnish me with the 
lyrics of that song, I would be eternally grateful.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs on Sunday signed  
7-foot, 265-pound center Todd Lindeman, who played in the CBA the 
last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindemann averaged 8.0 points and 5.5 rebounds for the  
Connecticut Pride over 141 games the last three seasons. Terms of 
the contract were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gregg Popovich had been expected to bring another big man  
to training camp, but Ruben Garces, the player the Spurs initially 
wanted and signed last Friday, failed his physical. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, the defending NBA champions, have 19 players in camp,  
13 signed to guaranteed contracts.

	PM's Party Said Leading India Vote  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A coalition led by Hindu nationalists  
probably won India's parliamentary elections that ended Sunday, 
exit polls predicted. Two exit polls conducted by television 
networks at the end of the world's biggest election said the 
Bharatiya Janata Party, headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee, would return to power with help from 21 parties in its 
campaign alliance. The main rival Congress Party -- led by 
Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi -- and its allies placed second, but with too few seats to 
form a government.

	29 Chechens Said Killed by Russia  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- A nighttime Russian bombing raid on a  
Chechen town killed 28 civilians, many of them children, residents 
and Chechen officials said today. Russian military officials in the 
neighboring territory of Dagestan refused to comment on the air 
raid. Russia has been bombing Chechnya for the past two weeks and 
has been moving troops several miles inside Chechnya's border in an 
attempt to create a security zone around the rebellious territory. 
Russia began the raids after Muslim militants from Chechnya invaded 
neighboring Dagestan in August and September, seeking to create an 
Islamic state in southern Russia.

	Gore Prepared for Tight Race  
</P>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore brought his retooled  
campaign to New Hampshire today, calling himself the underdog in 
the presidential primary race against Bill Bradley. ``The race has 
changed and it's now a two-person race that is close and 
hard-fought,'' Gore told reporters after a closed-door pep talk 
with supporters. Gore repeated his challenge for a series of 
debates with Bradley soon; to wait until January would leave too 
little time before the primaries begin, he said.

	West Bank-Gaza Link Delayed  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- In the first major setback in the revived peace  
process, Israelis said Sunday that only technical issues delay the 
opening of a land link for Palestinians between the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip. Palestinians insisted issues of principle are at 
stake. The passage is to provide the first unfettered route for 
Palestinians between the two areas. Palestinians say the delay is 
due to Israel's insistence that it issue the passes and maintain 
power of arrest along the route.

	United May Bid for Air Canada  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines's parent, UAL Corp., and German  
airline Lufthansa are preparing a bid to buy 35 percent or more of 
the outstanding shares of Air Canada, the Chicago Tribune reported 
in today's editions. The bid, which could come as early as 
tomorrow, could block the merger of Air Canada and Canadian 
Airlines proposed by investment firm Onex Corp. That combination is 
being backed by American Airlines and its parent, AMR Corp. AMR 
owns 25 percent of Canadian Airlines and would own 15 percent of 
the new carrier.

	NYC Art Exhibit Attracts Thousands  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The curious gathered in long lines for a second  
day to see the art exhibit Mayor Rudolph Giuliani found so 
offensive he cut the museum's funding, a decision he defended again 
today. The museum -- which usually gets little notice -- is basking 
in the attention. More than 9,200 people viewed ``Sensation'' 
yesterday, its first day. It was the largest opening in the 
museum's 175-year history. More than 4,000 showed up today, waiting 
in line for up to 90 minutes and paying $9.75 for tickets.

The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 25.28 points to 
17,687.28. On Friday, the index climbed 107.10 points, or 0.61 
percent. Friday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average

	49ers Hand Titans Their First Loss  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Looking much like Steve Young, Jeff Garcia  
threw for two touchdowns and ran for another as the 49ers held off 
Tennessee 24-22 today, knocking the Titans from the ranks of the 
unbeaten. It was San Francisco's 19th straight win at home. The 
49ers continued a pattern of success when they've had to play 
without their starting quarterback, improving to 7-1 in eight games 
without Young since 1996 as the backups fit right into San 
Francisco's West Coast offense.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- While the New York Mets were saving their  
playoff lives, the Cincinnati Reds could only wait and watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Steady sheets of rain pounded County Stadium in Milwaukee at the  
scheduled 4 p.m. EDT start time of Cincinnati's season finale 
against the Brewers. As of 6:45 p.m., it had been raining steadily 
for six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both teams desperately wanted to finish their seasons on  
time, a foreboding forecast suggested a delay until Monday was 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds needed to win the game to avert a stunning collapse in  
the season's final weekend. Cincinnati controlled its own playoff 
destiny two days earlier, but consecutive losses to the lowly 
Brewers let the Mets back in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's victory over Los Angeles on Sunday clinched the NL  
Central title for the Astros (97-65). It also meant the Reds 
(95-66) must beat Milwaukee to force a one-game playoff with New 
York (96-66) on Monday at Cinergy Field. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Cincinnati-Milwaukee game was postponed, it was to be  
rescheduled for 2:05 p.m. EDT Monday. And if that occurred and the 
Reds won, there was to be a one-game playoff between New York and 
Cincinnati for the wild-card slot at Cinergy Field on Tuesday at 
2:05 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event the Reds and Mets needed to play Tuesday, Game 1 in  
each NL playoff series would be pushed back a day until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The best weather forecasts available to the Brewers suggested  
intermittent rains until Monday morning, but there appeared to be a 
window of calm about 8 p.m. EDT when the game might be able to get 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds, who looked battered when they left the field Saturday  
after their 10-6 loss to the Brewers, watched the Mets-Pirates and 
Dodgers-Astros games on clubhouse televisions. The Brewers showed 
the game on the stadium's video screen for the few thousand fans 
who braved the elements. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL said the Brewers would decide whether to cancel the game.  
Milwaukee sold over 54,000 tickets to the game, which was expected 
to be the last ever played in County Stadium before a July crane 
accident at Miller Park delayed the new stadium's opening for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Between innings, the video screen flashed the message, ``The  
Weather Situation continues to be monitored. All efforts will be 
made to play today's game. Thank you for your patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reds manager Jack McKeon ventured into the outfield to test the  
turf about an hour after the game's scheduled start time, and he 
waved when fans in the left-field stands cheered him. 
</P>
<P>
	A few Brewers players wandered out into the steady downpour  
about an hour before the scheduled game time to sign autographs for 
several hundred fans wearing ponchos and slickers.

<HEADLINE> Composites Making Their Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KETTERING, Ohio (AP) -- Researchers working at the National  
Composite Center here are hoping their area will soon get a 
distinctive new name like California's Silicon Valley. They like 
Composite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Composites, they say, are the material of the future.  
</P>
<P>
	These days, less and less wood and steel are going into doors,  
shingles, golf clubs, utility poles, truck beds and highway 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Materials made of fiber, resins and plastics -- especially  
glass-fiber and carbon-fiber materials -- are being used instead. 
These new materials can be made lighter, sometimes stronger, and 
they don't rust. 
</P>
<P>
	New uses are popping up all the time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a person who wants to build a composite storm  
shelter,'' said Mark Brandt, vice president of the National 
Composite Center's commercial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Yeager, a senior engineer at the center in this Dayton  
suburb, said composite material is not the ``flash in the pan'' 
some had predicted 10 years ago. ``It is here to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At present, it's impossible to say how much composite material  
is produced or sold each year because it is used in such diverse 
products and industries. Its advocates says it can be just as 
strong -- and even cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Dick's sporting goods store in Dayton stocks a few  
composite fishing rods that sell for $11.99. By contrast, aluminum 
poles cost $99.99, and graphite poles range from in price from 
$19.99 to $89.99. 
</P>
<P>
	How much more the industry grows depends on whether composites  
become accepted in such everyday fixtures as street signs, fences 
and guardrails, and whether they find their way into big-ticket 
items such as military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Center officials recently announced that they have successfully  
made a tail cone and fighter aircraft panel out of carbon-fiber 
composites. They said the parts can be up to 85 percent chearper 
than composite parts made through conventional processes. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Composite Center was set up with state funding in  
1996 to commercialize composite materials developed at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and expand the region's industrial 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	The private, not-for-profit center was born after economic  
development officials became concerned about the erosion of local 
jobs in the military and auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The center recruited scientists from Wright-Patterson who had  
been working on composites for years and then moved them into a 
vacated Defense Department warehouse. State and federal grants 
supply 80 percent of the center's funding; the rest comes from 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike universities and other groups working on composites, the  
center has the room and equipment to actually develop manufacturing 
processes and produce prototypes, according to its president, Louis 
Luedtke. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hope that within the next few years the region will  
become known as the largest center for development of composites in 
the country. That's when it will truly be Composite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The center, which employs about 25 people, is a modest presence  
today. It's housed in a squat, gray building several blocks long. 
Its centerpiece is a 1,000-ton injection-molding press that stamps 
out molds for composite truck beds. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeager pauses during a tour of the building to jump on top of an  
overturned truck bed with all of her 115 pounds to demonstrate its 
strength. The bed bends but doesn't break. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeager said automakers are interested in the truck bed because  
the federal government is requiring them to increase gas mileage. 
</P>
<P>
	``One way to do that is get weight out of the vehicle,'' she  
said. ``You get the weight out by using composite materials and not 
giving up strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. plans to offer a composite plastic cargo  
bed as an option on its 2001 Chevrolet Silverado full-sized pickup. 
And Ford Motor Co. plans to have a composite bed standard on its 
Explorer Sport Trac that's scheduled to go on sale early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	A designer model ranch house in Cupertino, Calif., features  
composite shingle siding that looks like wood, but won't fade, rot 
and is fire-resistant. An Arizona company says its composite 
utility poles could render the wooden variety virtually extinct. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, the state Legislature recently approved funding to  
build 100 highway bridges with composite decks in the next six 
years. Each of the state's 88 counties will get at least one 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Composite bridges show the potential for two to three times  
the life of a current cement bridge,'' said Yeager. ``Concrete 
bridges are very susceptible to weather conditions,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandt said the center has gotten inquiries from people  
interested in using composites for motorcycle fenders, crash-test 
dummies, inserts for shoes, and even bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
	``They go all over the map,'' he said. ``We try to help them  
figure out how to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Glowinski, executive director of the American Wood  
Council, said many composites include wood fibers and that 
woodmakers are using composites to improve their own products. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think our industry will see this as a threat, but an  
opportunity,'' Glowinski said. ``Our industry is well involved in 
the development of composite material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Jeanes, senior vice president of marketing for the  
American Iron and Steel Institute, said he doesn't see composites 
replacing iron and steel on a widespread basis at this time. But he 
acknowledged that composites are being used in certain areas, such 
as the construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Composites is having a presence there, but it seems more  
appropriate to filling in little niche components,'' said Jeanes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said the steel industry is interested in how the  
benefits of composites can be applied to steel to make it a better 
product.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Second Ice Age Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Understandably, the Atlanta Thrashers were a bit  
nervous for their first NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were squeezing splinters out of our sticks,'' coach Curt  
Fraser said. ``Once we relax and get more comfortable, we'll be 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers began the city's second ice age Saturday night,  
losing to the New Jersey Devils 4-1, 19 years after the Flames 
played their final game in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The result didn't seem to matter much to the hockey-starved  
crowd of 18,545, at least half of them adorned in white Thrashers 
sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	They cheered the Zamboni driver. They cheered when the mascot  
swooped in from the ceiling on a cable during loud pregame 
festivities. They cheered when the announcer proclaimed, ``Atlanta, 
you now live in a hockey town.'' They cheered when former Flames 
coach Bernie Geoffrion dropped the ceremonial first puck. They 
cheered when Kelly Buchberger scored the first goal. They cheered 
at the end when the seconds ticked off the clock, even though their 
team had been stymied by Martin Brodeur's goaltending and two goals 
by Bobby Holik. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good day. A lot of things we planned went off without  
a hitch, except the game,'' general manager Don Waddell said. 
``When the people stood up to cheer with 20 seconds left, that was 
incredible. I think that shows the fans are ready for this and will 
be very supportive of this club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even from the top row of the new $213 million Philips Arena, the  
view was just fine for Hockey Night in Atlanta, Part II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised,'' said Ted Charette, sipping on a beer in his  
$10 seat. ``I had heard a lot of talk that there wasn't a bad seat 
in the house. I get to bear witness to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Season-ticket holder Alan Cowart dug deep in his closet and  
pulled out an old Atlanta Flames sweater to wear to the Thrashers 
first game. It didn't fit after 19 years in mothballs, so he passed 
it off to his wife, Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be a great atmosphere at those Flames games,''  
Cowart said. ``We could have the same sort of thing now, but the 
people have got to be patient. They're trying to build from the 
ground up. We've got to give it time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by the raucous crowd, the Thrashers dominated play in  
the first period, outshooting the Devils 15-7. But Brodeur kept it 
scoreless with several outstanding saves, including a stop on Steve 
Staios from in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers seemed to burn themselves out in that opening  
period and began making mistakes. The Devils, who had the best 
record in the Eastern Conference last season, capitalized on just 
about every one. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of good things happened,'' said 35-year-old Ray Ferraro,  
one of the few prominent Thrashers on a roster filled with 
nondescript players. ``Unfortunately, a couple of mistakes cost us 
big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchberger, the Thrashers' captain, scored the first goal in  
team history at 11:26 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrik Stefan, the top overall pick in the entry draft, fed a  
pass to Buchberger, who blasted a shot past Brodeur's glove as the 
goalie came sliding across the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor, no question,'' said Buchberger, whose goal cut  
the Devils' lead to 2-1. ``It would have been nicer if we had won 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any hope of a comeback faded at 6:31 of the third when Sergei  
Brylin restored a two-goal lead for the Devils. About six minutes 
later, Holik ended the scoring with his second goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good learning experience for us,'' Fraser said. ``We  
can build off this.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis sprained  
his right knee in the first quarter of Sunday's game against the 
New York Jets and was taken to the locker room for further 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who has gotten off to a slow start after leading the NFL  
in rushing last season with 2,008 yards, was hurt during an 
interception return by Jets safety Victor Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos offensive tackle Matt Lepsis made a diving tackle to cut  
down Green at the sideline, but Lepsis also caught Davis, who was 
trailing the play, on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was helped by trainers on the sideline and then limped to  
the locker room.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Wins With New Crew Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- New crew chief, more success for Jeff  
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Whitesell, who replaced master crew chief Ray Evernham  
last Wednesday on the Hendrick Motorsports team, gambled and won 
Sunday's NAPA AutoCare 500 at Martinsville Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen laps from the end of the 500-mile race on the tight  
half-mile oval, all of the leaders except Gordon pitted for fresh 
tires under the last of eight caution flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he made that decision, Whitesell -- who had been the  
team's engineer and was Evernham's hand-picked successor -- said, 
``Track position. That's always important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who now has a series-high six victories this season,  
made the gamble work, pulling away on the restart on lap 482 and 
holding off hard-charging Dale Earnhardt by less than two 
car-lengths at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``That answers a lot of questions, doesn't it?'' Gordon said as  
he celebrated the 48th victory of his career. ``Brian Whitesell did 
a great job. I'm proud of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon also gave credit to Evernham, who had been his crew chief  
for every race since the three-time Winston Cup champion was Rookie 
of the Year in 1993 before leaving to start his own team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team kept faith in themselves and in one another,''  
Gordon said. ``But we wouldn't be here today if it weren't for Ray 
Evernham. He's the one who orchestrated these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitesell agreed, saying, ``The reason we're here is Ray  
Evernham. He taught us how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who averaged 72.624 mph, led only twice for a total of  
29 laps. The first time he led was on lap 416, but Kenny Wallace 
took over the top spot four laps later and Earnhardt passed him for 
the lead on lap 431. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old, seven-time champion appeared on the way to his  
third victory of the season until Chad Little spun in turn four on 
lap 475, bringing out the last yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, bothered by a stomach flu that he said weakened him  
badly late in the race, was third on the final restart, quickly 
passing Bobby Labonte for second on lap 483 and going after Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have overdrove the car trying to catch him at first,''  
Earnhardt said. ``He played the cards right. I got to him too 
late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he knew Earnhardt was catching him at the end, Gordon,  
who had last pitted for tires on lap 419, said, ``That wasn't a 
pretty sight. I never drove a race car smoother than that in my 
life. I had to take care of those tires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Bodine finished third, followed by Rusty Wallace, who made  
up a lost lap on the final yellow, and brother Kenny, Mike Skinner, 
Kyle Petty and Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner, who led 138 laps, and Labonte, who led 120, both fell  
out of contention after their final stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte made the biggest gain in the series championship Sunday,  
vaulting past Mark Martin into second, although he trails leader 
Dale Jarrett by 251 points with six races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett lost two laps early, getting caught in the pits when a  
yellow flag came out. He came back to finish one lap down in 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin had a terrible day, bouncing off the wall twice and wound  
up 16th, three laps behind. He fell 276 points behind Jarrett and 
25 in back of Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the excitement in the early part of the race was caused  
by Kenny Irwin and rookie Tony Stewart, former short track rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart spun Irwin out twice in the early going, bringing out  
the first two caution flags. On the ensuing restart, Irwin 
retaliated, slammed into Stewart and also took out Brett Bodine. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart threw the heat shields from his race shoes at Irwin's  
windshield and reached into the car to take a swipe at his rival as 
Irwin went by under caution the next time around. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected that NASCAR would reprimand both drivers after  
reviewing the videotapes Monday.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 65th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 65th home run Sunday,  
moving past Ted Williams and Willie McCovey into 10th place on the 
career list with 522. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire connected in the first inning on a 2-2 fastball from the  
Cubs' Steve Trachsel, who allowed McGwire's record-setting 62nd 
home run last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has a two-homer lead over Chicago's Sammy Sosa, who hit  
a three-run homer off Larry Luebbers in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive by McGwire, estimated at 461 feet, was his fourth  
straight to straightaway center, and a kid wearing a McGwire jersey 
wound up with the ball following a scramble. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also homered in the first inning Saturday and has two  
homers in the closing three-game series. He has six homers in the 
last seven games, reminiscent of last year, when he hit five in the 
final three to wind up with a record 70. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire saluted the Cardinals' owners box on his way to the  
dugout and then made a curtain call. He has 147 RBIs, matching the 
career high he set last year.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Change Campaign Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging ``a close, hard-fought race''  
with Bill Bradley, Vice President Al Gore said Sunday he welcomes 
the chance ``to change the way I campaign'' and talk directly to 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was inevitable that if my opponent crossed the threshold of  
credibility and competence, which he did, then it would narrow and 
tighten and become a hard fought close contest. It has now reached 
that stage,'' Gore said on CBS's ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Bradley gaining in public opinion polls, Gore shook up his  
campaign last week, moving its headquarters to Tennessee from the 
nation's capital and challenging Bradley to a series of debates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to change the way I campaign, and instead of having  
these events that are planned out, just have open meetings and talk 
to people directly about the choices we face,'' Gore said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president called the prospect of a real contest against  
Bradley for the Democrat's 2000 presidential nomination, ``a 
healthy development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a close, hard fought race and frankly, I welcome that,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Debates on national issues are needed to ``elevate'' the contest  
Gore said, and would allow him and Bradley to highlight their 
differences without ``grenades being tossed back and forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore nevertheless took advantage of the immediate opportunity to  
pounce on one difference between the two candidates: their 
reactions after Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to help rally the troops, the forces of what I regard  
as progress, and Senator Bradley choose that moment to say that he 
was going to leave the public arena, said it was broken and said 
that he might even run as an independent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley left the Senate in 1996 after three terms.  
</P>
<P>
	That jab on Sunday led Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser to question  
whether ``the vice president's focus on narrow political tactics 
and positioning and negative campaigning,'' undermined the 
credibility of Gore's call for an issue-focused campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling to rescue his troubled campaign, Gore now must fend  
off the unexpectedly strong challenge from Bradley and convince 
voters he can handle Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The dual assignment became a political imperative for Gore with  
the recognition that Bradley is gaining strength in key states -- 
New Hampshire, New York and California -- and is outdistancing the 
vice president in raising money. To get to Bush -- or whoever the 
Republican nominee is -- Gore has to get past Bradley first. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's move to Tennessee appears intended to pare down his  
bloated campaign and symbolically distance himself from Washington 
insiders and the taint of ``Clinton fatigue'' -- the weariness with 
scandals and battles of President Clinton. But after Gore's seven 
years in the White House and service in both the House and Senate, 
it will be difficult to see him as an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're sort of thrashing around,'' Vanderbilt  
University political scientist Erwin Hargrove said. ``Probably a 
lot of people don't want to move out here. But he realized he was 
running low on money. He realized that he was neck-and-neck with 
Bradley. He realized he had to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Sunday he is ``counting on Clinton fatigue fatigue.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are tired of the questions about that because  
they want to turn the page and look to the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With layers of consultants, pollsters, staff and conflicting  
advice, Gore was slow to accept the threat posed by Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sat around and said, 'Oh, no, we're the vice president.  
Everything's fine, Bradley can't raise any money,'' said Democratic 
media strategist Jim Duffy. ``And the thing was just decaying. And 
it's not like this is new. There were polls three and four months 
ago saying Bradley's moving up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also has been surprised by Bush, not only with his  
remarkable fund raising, but also with some politically savvy 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Bush broke with House Republicans, criticizing  
their plan to delay income-support payments for poor working 
families. Gore had planned to pounce on Bush for the GOP plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Sunday that he still intends to hold Bush accountable  
for his support of a big tax cut proposed by congressional 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's driving all of these irresponsible slashing cuts  
for the working poor,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling for strong footing, Gore has decided to call himself  
the underdog -- even though by many measures he remains the 
Democratic front-runner, with much better name recognition than 
Bradley, endorsements from more than 100 Democratic members of 
Congress and support from many organized Democratic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow that is lacking,'' Hargrove said. ``It may be lacking  
because the national polls do not reflect that sort of thing. The 
payoff for lining up every conceivable Democratic group is in the 
primaries. But he can't abide and tolerate this sort of getting 
nowhere in the polls.''

<HEADLINE> USA 5, South Korea 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- United States forward Tiffeny Milbrett  
said that without knowing much about South Korea, the World Cup 
champions had to rely on what worked in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had to impose our game on the other team and give our  
fans something to cheer about. I think we did that today,'' 
Milbrett said after a rowdy sellout crowd of 23,101 fans watched 
the U.S. women's soccer team shut out the South Koreans 5-0 in the 
first round of the U.S. Women's Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans kept chanting ``USA'' as the host team dominated and kept  
South Korea inside its half of the field for most of Sunday's game. 
Many of the spectators had their faces and hair painted red, white 
and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett, who became the third American to score 20 goals in a  
year, put the U.S. team up 3-0 just before halftime on an assist by 
Julie Foudy. 
</P>
<P>
	The team put on an offensive show to get its 23rd victory of  
1999, breaking its year-old record for wins in a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a team that wants to attack and has tremendous  
attacking personalities, and we want them to attack,'' U.S. coach 
Tony DiCicco said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which improved to 101-8-8 in five years under DiCicco,  
dominated in every aspect, outshooting South Korea 35-2 overall and 
17-1 in shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle Fotopoulos had two goals, with the first coming from 10  
yards out on a pass from Tisha Venturini in the 82nd minute and the 
second in the 90th minute after Milbrett found her unguarded near 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco said using an extra midfielder allowed his team to push  
the ball up quickly and pressure the inexperienced South Koreans 
into making mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the best flank midfielder in the world with Kristine  
Lilly, and this system gives us an opportunity to use her out 
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon MacMillan found Cindy Parlow on a corner kick in the  
10th minute to open the scoring. Parlow, who at 5-foot-11 is 5 
inches taller than South Korea's tallest defender, headed the ball 
past South Korean goalkeeper Ho Jung Jung. 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan got her second assist of the game when she sent a pass  
to the feet of Mia Hamm, who scored on a hard shot from 8 yards out 
in the 36th minute. It was the 112th career goal for Hamm, who 
missed a 6-0 victory over Brazil last month with a strained 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Jung finished with 12 saves, while Tracy Ducar of the United  
States needed to make just one, on a weak header by Yun Je Choi in 
the 17th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil got two goals and an assist from Roseli and beat Finland  
3-1 in the first game of the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Roseli lifted a long shot over the head of goalkeeper  
Satu Kunnas and it went just under the crossbar with seconds left 
in the first half to put Brazil up 2-0. Roseli scored again in the 
78th minute, making it 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians outshot Finland 30-6 and led 15-4 in shots on  
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The second round of the tournament will be at Kansas City, Mo.,  
on Thursday when Brazil plays South Korea and Finland meets the 
United States.

<HEADLINE>  Journeyman Beats Julio Cesar Chavez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- If Julio Cesar Chavez needed any further reason  
to retire, Willy Wise gave it to him Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The journeyman boxer made Chavez look like the aging fighter he  
is, battering him for 10 rounds to win a lopsided decision and 
putting plans by Chavez to fight for a title again in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, fighting for the 108th time as a pro, was slow and  
couldn't counter the faster Wise, who boxed him at will from all 
angles to score an upset decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very surprised at how poorly I performed,'' Chavez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chavez went into the fight on the comeback trail, planning to  
use Wise as a tuneup to get a title fight against WBC super 
lightweight champion Kostya Tszyu. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 37-year-old, former three-time champion may have lost  
his chance at another title fight with a performance that put a 
spotlight on his failing reflexes inside the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no excuses. He beat me really good,'' Chavez said.  
``Willy Wise was a great fighter tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, though, did offer an excuse. He said he trained poorly  
for the fight and planned to keep fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prepared for a very easy fight, but in the ring it wasn't  
easy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise (24-6-4) had only seven knockouts as a pro, but it was Wise  
who was banging shots to the head of Chavez late in the eighth 
round before the former champion wobbled back to his corner on 
shaky legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez was cut on the nose in the fifth round, and after each of  
the late rounds sat on his stool until the bell rang, with his 
mouthpiece hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez won only one round on one scorecard, two on a second and  
three on a third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had him every round,'' Wise said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second fight for Chavez since he was beaten in  
September 1998 for a second time by Oscar De La Hoya. He fell to 
102-4-2 in a pro career that began in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, though, Chavez' record is 12-4-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 146 1/2 pounds, received $400,000 for the bout, while Wise,  
146, of Westbury, N.Y., got $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a woman's bout, Christy Martin earned $100,000 by stopping  
Daniella Somers in the fifth round of their scheduled 10-round 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin (38-2-2) dominated from the opening bell, controlling the  
fight with big right hands. Referee Kenny Bayles finally stopped 
the fight after one of those big right hands turned Somers around 
and left her hanging on the ropes at 1:37 of the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it was this easy,'' Martin said. ``I knew I  
had her from the very first punch I threw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, of Orlando, Fla., weighed 140 to 138 1/2 for Somers, of  
Belgium. Somers fell to 9-3.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Wins With New Crew Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- New crew chief, more success for Jeff  
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Whitesell, who replaced master crew chief Ray Evernham  
last Wednesday on the Hendrick Motorsports team, gambled and won 
Sunday's NAPA AutoCare 500 at Martinsville Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen laps from the end of the 500-mile race on the tight  
half-mile oval, all of the leaders except Gordon pitted for fresh 
tires under the last of eight caution flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he made that decision, Whitesell -- who had been the  
team's engineer and was Evernham's hand-picked successor -- said, 
``Track position. That's always important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who now has a series-high six victories this season,  
made the gamble work, pulling away on the restart on lap 482 and 
holding off hard-charging Dale Earnhardt by less than two 
car-lengths at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``That answers a lot of questions, doesn't it?'' Gordon said as  
he celebrated the 48th victory of his career. ``Brian Whitesell did 
a great job. I'm proud of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon also gave credit to Evernham, who had been his crew chief  
for every race since the three-time Winston Cup champion was Rookie 
of the Year in 1993 before leaving to start his own team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team kept faith in themselves and in one another,''  
Gordon said. ``But we wouldn't be here today if it weren't for Ray 
Evernham. He's the one who orchestrated these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitesell agreed, saying, ``The reason we're here is Ray  
Evernham. He taught us how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who averaged 72.624 mph, led only twice for a total of  
29 laps. The first time he led was on lap 416, but Kenny Wallace 
took over the top spot four laps later and Earnhardt passed him for 
the lead on lap 431. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old, seven-time champion appeared on the way to his  
third victory of the season until Chad Little spun in turn four on 
lap 475, bringing out the last yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, bothered by a stomach flu that he said weakened him  
badly late in the race, was third on the final restart, quickly 
passing Bobby Labonte for second on lap 483 and going after Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have overdrove the car trying to catch him at first,''  
Earnhardt said. ``He played the cards right. I got to him too 
late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he knew Earnhardt was catching him at the end, Gordon,  
who had last pitted for tires on lap 419, said, ``That wasn't a 
pretty sight. I never drove a race car smoother than that in my 
life. I had to take care of those tires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Bodine finished third, followed by Rusty Wallace, who made  
up a lost lap on the final yellow, and brother Kenny, Mike Skinner, 
Kyle Petty and Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner, who led 138 laps, and Labonte, who led 120, both fell  
out of contention after their final stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte made the biggest gain in the series championship Sunday,  
vaulting past Mark Martin into second, although he trails leader 
Dale Jarrett by 251 points with six races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett lost two laps early, getting caught in the pits when a  
yellow flag came out. He came back to finish one lap down in 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin had a terrible day, bouncing off the wall twice and wound  
up 16th, three laps behind. He fell 276 points behind Jarrett and 
25 in back of Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the excitement in the early part of the race was caused  
by Kenny Irwin and rookie Tony Stewart, former short track rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart spun Irwin out twice in the early going, bringing out  
the first two caution flags. On the ensuing restart, Irwin 
retaliated, slammed into Stewart and also took out Brett Bodine. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart threw the heat shields from his race shoes at Irwin's  
windshield and reached into the car to take a swipe at his rival as 
Irwin went by under caution the next time around. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected that NASCAR would reprimand both drivers after  
reviewing the videotapes Monday.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Second Ice Age Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Understandably, the Atlanta Thrashers were a bit  
nervous for their first NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were squeezing splinters out of our sticks,'' coach Curt  
Fraser said. ``Once we relax and get more comfortable, we'll be 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers began the city's second ice age Saturday night,  
losing to the New Jersey Devils 4-1, 19 years after the Flames 
played their final game in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The result didn't seem to matter much to the hockey-starved  
crowd of 18,545, at least half of them adorned in white Thrashers 
sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	They cheered the Zamboni driver. They cheered when the mascot  
swooped in from the ceiling on a cable during loud pregame 
festivities. They cheered when the announcer proclaimed, ``Atlanta, 
you now live in a hockey town.'' They cheered when former Flames 
coach Bernie Geoffrion dropped the ceremonial first puck. They 
cheered when Kelly Buchberger scored the first goal. They cheered 
at the end when the seconds ticked off the clock, even though their 
team had been stymied by Martin Brodeur's goaltending and two goals 
by Bobby Holik. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good day. A lot of things we planned went off without  
a hitch, except the game,'' general manager Don Waddell said. 
``When the people stood up to cheer with 20 seconds left, that was 
incredible. I think that shows the fans are ready for this and will 
be very supportive of this club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even from the top row of the new $213 million Philips Arena, the  
view was just fine for Hockey Night in Atlanta, Part II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised,'' said Ted Charette, sipping on a beer in his  
$10 seat. ``I had heard a lot of talk that there wasn't a bad seat 
in the house. I get to bear witness to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Season-ticket holder Alan Cowart dug deep in his closet and  
pulled out an old Atlanta Flames sweater to wear to the Thrashers 
first game. It didn't fit after 19 years in mothballs, so he passed 
it off to his wife, Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be a great atmosphere at those Flames games,''  
Cowart said. ``We could have the same sort of thing now, but the 
people have got to be patient. They're trying to build from the 
ground up. We've got to give it time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by the raucous crowd, the Thrashers dominated play in  
the first period, outshooting the Devils 15-7. But Brodeur kept it 
scoreless with several outstanding saves, including a stop on Steve 
Staios from in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers seemed to burn themselves out in that opening  
period and began making mistakes. The Devils, who had the best 
record in the Eastern Conference last season, capitalized on just 
about every one. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of good things happened,'' said 35-year-old Ray Ferraro,  
one of the few prominent Thrashers on a roster filled with 
nondescript players. ``Unfortunately, a couple of mistakes cost us 
big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchberger, the Thrashers' captain, scored the first goal in  
team history at 11:26 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrik Stefan, the top overall pick in the entry draft, fed a  
pass to Buchberger, who blasted a shot past Brodeur's glove as the 
goalie came sliding across the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor, no question,'' said Buchberger, whose goal cut  
the Devils' lead to 2-1. ``It would have been nicer if we had won 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any hope of a comeback faded at 6:31 of the third when Sergei  
Brylin restored a two-goal lead for the Devils. About six minutes 
later, Holik ended the scoring with his second goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good learning experience for us,'' Fraser said. ``We  
can build off this.''

<HEADLINE> Bank of Japan Sees Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In some good news for Japan's economy, the central  
bank said Monday that business confidence at major manufacturing 
companies improved sharply during the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	In its closely-watched quarterly ``tankan'' survey, the Bank of  
Japan said sentiment among large manufacturers had brightened over 
the last survey to a figure of minus 22 from minus 37, it's biggest 
improvement since November 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan measures the percentage of firms seeing business  
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen. 
The bank surveyed 9,275 companies in September for the latest 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The result exceeded analysts' expectations. Economists surveyed  
by the Dow Jones Newswires had forecast the index for large 
manufacturers would come to a minus 27 in the latest survey. 
</P>
<P>
	And large manufacturers are also optimistic that conditions will  
improve by the time of the next survey. They see sentiment 
advancing to a figure of minus 16 by December. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment also improved in all categories of company surveyed,  
from big non-manufacturers to small manufacturers. And all see 
further improvement by December. 
</P>
<P>
	The improved sentiment comes on the heels of two straight  
quarters of growth in Japan's economy and a drop in the jobless 
rate from a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's gross domestic product -- the measure of all goods and  
services produced within its borders -- expanded 2.0 percent for the 
first quarter of the year after more than a year of recession. It 
followed that up with a gain of 0.2 percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the government announced that the unemployment rate  
fell to 4.7 percent in August from a record high of 4.9 percent the 
previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy has been struggling to emerge from its deepest  
downturn in a half century. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, the yen strengthened on the results of the  
tankan report. The U.S. dollar was quoted at 104.64 yen, down 1.30 
yen from late Friday in Tokyo. Tokyo stocks moved slightly lower on 
fears of a stronger yen, falling 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities fear that if the yen becomes too strong the  
country's budding economic recovery could be endangered as profits 
at big exporters suffer. A stronger yen makes Japanese products 
more expensive in overseas markets.

<HEADLINE> Walker Wins Batting Title Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Larry Walker won his second straight National  
League batting title Sunday, but he wasn't in much of a mood to 
celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Walker's major league-leading .379 average, the Colorado  
Rockies finished last for the first time in their seven-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing, I guess,'' Walker said of his  
accomplishment. ``In the same breath, it's a bad thing. It's all 
right to have a batting title then keep playing, but to win the 
batting title and go home, it doesn't mean as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who had season-ending knee surgery Thursday, finished 43  
points ahead of Arizona outfielder Luis Gonzalez. Boston's Nomar 
Garciaparra hit .357 to win the AL batting crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's margin of victory was the largest for an NL batting  
champion since Stan Musial of St. Louis hit .376 to finish 43 
points ahead of Philadelphia's Richie Ashburn in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothered by elbow problems early in the season and knee problems  
late, Walker put up impressive numbers in 127 starts. He hit 37 
home runs with 115 RBIs, 108 runs scored and 11 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, I was out there and able to do most of the  
things I am capable of doing, whether it was running the bases or 
chasing down balls,'' Walker said. ``I was hurt to the effect I 
didn't make myself look bad out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His home numbers were straight out of a video game; he hit .461  
with 26 homers and 70 RBIs in 66 games at Coors Field, compared to 
a modest .286 average with 11 home runs and 45 RBIs in 61 road 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker took control of the batting race during a three-game  
series against Philadelphia in late August. Phillies outfielder 
Bobby Abreu trailed Walker by seven points (.357 to .350) entering 
the weekend but trailed by 14 when it was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had those situations last year when Tony Gwynn came to town,  
and the year before when we had to battle with him head-to-head,'' 
Walker said. ``It helps to have them right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting .366 after the Philadelphia series, Walker hit .513  
(20-for-39) in September to raise his average 13 more points before 
having surgery to repair cartilage in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to return by the start of spring training  
</P>
<P>
	Walker hit .363 to win his first batting crown last year and  
finished at .366 when he was the National League MVP in 1997. He is 
first player to hit .360 or better in three consecutive seasons 
since Hall of Fame outfielder Al Simmons did it for the 
Philadelphia A's from 1929-31.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Going Wireless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Amazon.com is making it easier for  
customers to shop anywhere and anytime the mood strikes them. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after moving to offer online shoppers just about anything  
they could want to buy -- from yard sale trinkets to buffalo steaks 
-- Amazon planned to announce today it will become one of the first 
e-commerce companies to sell its products through new wireless 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is timed to coincide with this week's nationwide  
release of 3Com Corp.'s new Palm VII, a hand-held computer that 
will provide wireless Internet access to allow users to read 
e-mail, shop and browse popular Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week, we announced our new zSHOPS, which was about  
anything. This is about anywhere,'' said Warren Adams, an Amazon 
executive who lead the `Amazon Anywhere' initiative. ``Now our 
customers can have their shopping mall in their pockets instead of 
having to be at their desktop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Amazon in just a few years has become an Internet  
shopping powerhouse, going from selling books to electronics and 
toys, as well as hosting auctions, in a bid to become a one-stop 
shopping site for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been announcing several new initiatives to raise  
consumer awareness of the site ahead of the holiday shopping season 
during which online commerce sales are expected to rise sharply 
over last year. Amazon's stock soared last week after it announced 
zSHOPS, which lets almost anyone sell online, regardless of product 
size and quantity or location. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon's always been about convenience and selection and  
taking the friction out of the shopping experience,'' Adams said. 
``We want to make sure you can shop whenever you want, for whatever 
you want, wherever you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To accomplish its goal, Amazon announced it had acquired  
Convergence Corp., a software firm specializing in wireless 
technology, for $23 million in Amazon's stock. The company 
developed the software that must be downloaded, initially to the 
Palm device, and later to other wireless devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Amazon and other companies are hedging their bets  
by building software to allow consumers to shop without being 
connected to a fixed phone or cable line. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, worldwide sales of hand-held computers are expected to  
exceed 5.7 million units in 1999, a 47 percent increase over 1998, 
according to research firm Dataquest. The market is projected to 
grow more than 30 percent through 2003, when sales are expected to 
reach 21 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Hand-held computers initially allowed users just to keep  
schedules and take notes. The small boxes could, in turn, be 
plugged into desktop computers to synchronize information. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices have been improving over the past few years. While  
other attempts have been made to provide wireless Internet access, 
3Com's is notable because the Palm organizer is already highly 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Palm VII is a bit pricey. It will cost $499 under a  
$100 price cut effective today. And users must sign up for Palm's 
Internet service provider Palm.net, which costs about $10 a month. 
Heavy users of the service would pay more -- as much as $100 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm VII reformats Web pages to fit the smaller screen using  
a technology known as Web clipping that limits the content 
somewhat. Still, Web sites as diverse as the sports site ESPN.com, 
Moviefone.com, package deliver United Parcel Service and the online 
brokerage ETrade Group Inc. have signed on to provide content to 
the new Palm organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon's application on the Palm VII also will allow people to  
check on the status of auction items, although they will not be 
able to bid in the first version. zSHOPS also will not be available 
in the first version.

<HEADLINE> Indians Lose Home Field Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- With three straight losses to Toronto,  
Cleveland lost its chance for 100 wins and home-field advantage 
throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say we had a very good season, considering all we had  
to go through,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said after Sunday's 
9-2 defeat. ``We'll see what we can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking its first World Series title since 1948, the Indians  
open the best-of-5 first round Wednesday at home against Boston. If 
they advance to the league championship series, they would have the 
home-field advantage against Texas but not against New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove isn't yet saying who will start the opener against  
Pedro Martinez (23-4), but it's likely to be Bartolo Colon (18-5). 
</P>
<P>
	``Boston is dangerous in a five-game series,'' Cleveland's  
Travis Fryman said. ``They are well managed, have a great, great 
pitcher and have had to overcome hurdles to get here. They are 
going to be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman and catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., two key Cleveland starters,  
tested injured knees the final weeks of the season, and both said 
Sunday they feel ready now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Game 1 is always important. If you can knock out their best  
pitcher right away, you can relax more,'' Alomar said. ``We want to 
go out and minimize our mistakes. Every mistake in the postseason 
is huge. Hopefully, we can control that, win three games and move 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians beat Boston 3-1 in the first round last year, then  
lost to the Yankees 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like we have to play Boston every year,'' Alomar  
said. ``The bottom line is we just have to go out and play good 
baseball.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Watch out, NFL, the real Randy Moss is back.  
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro receiver was at his finger-pointing, chest-thumping,  
touchdown-catching best Sunday, leading the Minnesota Vikings past 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss tied his career-high with a 61-yard catch for a touchdown.  
He added a 27-yard score and also had a 21-yard reception against 
triple coverage that set up Andrew Glover's TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put up 21 points in the first quarter, that's  
exciting,'' said Moss, who earlier in the week criticized offensive 
coordinator Ray Sherman's game plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss had only nine catches for 123 yards heading into the game  
but had four for 120 vs. the usually stingy Tampa Bay defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice to get back in a groove again,'' said Randall  
Cunningham, who was 26-for-34 for 296 yards and three TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	But that groove didn't last long for the Vikings (2-2). Tampa  
Bay (2-2) shut them down after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still missing that fire,'' Moss said.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere Sunday, it was Baltimore 19, Atlanta 16; Jacksonville  
17, Pittsburgh 3; Dallas 35, Arizona 7; New England 19, Cleveland 
7; Chicago 14, New Orleans 10; St. Louis 38, Cincinnati 10; and the 
New York Giants 16, Philadelphia 15. 
</P>
<P>
	In late games, it was the New York Jets at Denver, Kansas City  
at San Diego, Carolina at Washington, Tennessee at San Francisco, 
and Oakland at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo visits Miami on Monday night. Green Bay, Detroit and  
Indianapolis were off this week. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Ravens 19, Falcons 13, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	The NFC champions dropped to 0-4 when Stoney Case threw a  
54-yard pass to Justin Armour in overtime after Falcons coach Dan 
Reeves passed on having Morten Andersen try a 53-yard field goal 
with 49 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons went three-and-out to open overtime, then Case found  
Armour behind cornerback Ronnie Bradford and safety Eugene 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons played without starting quarterback Chris Chandler  
(pulled hamstring). Backup Tony Graziani left with a concussion in 
the second period. They also lost Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan, 
who was ejected after Case hooked up with Patrick Johnson on a 
52-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson danced over Buchanan and as he was about to spike the  
ball, Buchanan jumped to his feet, put Johnson in a bear hug and 
slammed him into the ground. Buchanan also punched Johnson in the 
back of the head before an official pulled him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting Baltimore improved to 2-2.  
</P>
<P>
                         *Rams 38, Bengals 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Cincinnati, Az-Zahir Hakim tied a Rams record by scoring four  
touchdowns, three on passes from Kurt Warner, the fourth on an 
84-yard punt return. Hakim had touchdown catches of 9 and 51 yards 
in the first half and an 18-yarder in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, a former Arena Football passer, became the first  
quarterback in the last 50 years to throw three touchdown passes in 
each of his first three starts. He went 17-for-21 for 310 yards, 
improving his passer rating for the season to 125. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaac Bruce had six catches for 152 yards for the Rams (3-0).  
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals (0-4) became the first NFL franchise to lose 100  
games in the 1990s, breaking their tie at 99 with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Cowboys 35, Cardinals 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Host Dallas got some revenge against the team that knocked it  
out of last season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Raghib Ismail's 63-yard touchdown catch sparked the Cowboys  
(3-0), then defensive end Greg Ellis went 98 yards with a fumble 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (1-3) continued to struggle, falling behind 21-0 for the  
second time this season and committing five turnovers. Jake Plummer 
threw three more interceptions, increasing his league-worst total 
to 12. Dallas has now beaten Arizona in 17 of the last 19 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis' game-sealing score was his second in two games. He also  
had an 87-yard interception return in a 24-7 victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Jaguars 17, Steelers 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville (3-1) won for the first time in five visits to  
Pittsburgh as its defense got two safeties to outscore Pittsburgh's 
stumbling offense. The Steelers (2-2) have lost four straight at 
home, their longest streak since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Both safeties came on hits against Kordell Stewart. Mark Brunell  
also threw a short touchdown pass and Mike Hollis hit two field 
goals. But both offenses struggled. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Patriots 19, Browns 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Terry Glenn overcame two costly first-half fumbles with a  
club-record 13 receptions for 214 yards at Cleveland. He caught a 
short pass from Drew Bledsoe and turned it into a 54-yard TD on the 
first play of the fourth quarter as New England (4-0) finally 
pulled away from the expansion Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland (0-4) took its first lead of the season on a 64-yard  
hookup by rookies Tim Couch and Kevin Johnson. But they couldn't 
stop Bledsoe, who was 28-for-42 for 389 yards. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Bears 14, Saints 10    	
</P>
<P>
	Shane Matthews found Curtis Conway for two touchdowns in the  
last 1:48. Matthews connected with Conway on a 7-yard pass with 
seven seconds left, bringing Bears fans, who had been booing a 
quarter earlier, to their feet. Offensive tackle Blake Brockermeyer 
went to the corner of the end zone and screamed at the fans in 
celebration as Saints coach Mike Ditka threw his clipboard in 
disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time Chicago (2-2) has beaten Ditka, who played  
for the Bears and was their coach for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Williams, who wasn't supposed to play because of a  
hyperextended right elbow, rushed for 84 yards for visiting New 
Orleans (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
                        *Giants 16, Eagles 15    	
</P>
<P>
	They don't get much uglier than this, although the Giants (2-2)  
certainly will take it. 
</P>
<P>
	New York fumbled six times, but Philadelphia (0-4) grabbed only  
two of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles scored on two field goals by Norm Johnson and Bobby  
Taylor's 18-yard interception return. They also got a safety when 
Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn lateraled off an interception and 
the ball went into the end zone, where teammate Phillippi Sparks 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Giants' Brad Daluiso kicked three field goals and Kent  
Graham, before being benched with three interceptions, hit Ike 
Hilliard for a 9-yard score.

<HEADLINE> NL Playoffs a Jumbled Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	To David Cone, Omar Vizquel and most everyone else in the AL  
playoffs, these matchups look extremely familiar. 
</P>
<P>
	New York vs. Texas, Boston vs. Cleveland. For the second  
straight year, and third time overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes for an interesting playoff,'' said Cone, who helped  
pitch the Yankees to the World Series championship last year. ``All 
four teams legitimately think they have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the AL was all set -- Game 1 was at Yankee Stadium on  
Tuesday night, Game 1 was at Jacobs Field on Wednesday night -- the 
NL picture was jumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston clinched the NL Central on Sunday, but New York and  
Cincinnati will have a one-game playoff at 7:05 p.m. EDT Monday at 
Cinergy Field for the wild-card spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets beat Pittsburgh 2-1 and the Reds, after weathering a  
rain delay of five hours, 45 minutes at Milaukee, beat the Brewers 
7-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, this much was certain: Greg Maddux will throw the first  
pitch for Atlanta in the best-of-5 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were to open the first round Tuesday at Turner Field  
against either the Astros or Reds. Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine and 
John Smoltz, if necessary, were to follow in Atlanta's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our pitching staff is in great shape,'' Braves manager Bobby  
Cox said. ``It's as healthy as it's been all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Bank One Ballpark, Randy Johnson was to start for Arizona  
against either the Mets or Houston. The Big Unit and the 
second-year Diamondbacks play Game 1 on Tuesday at 11:09 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know a lot about the National League clubs,'' Arizona  
manager Buck Showalter said. ``You don't hear the players saying, 
`If this happens or that happens.' We know we will be playing a 
quality opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late start time at Arizona was partly to make sure all games  
in the first round are televised -- ESPN, Fox and NBC will take 
turns showing them. 
</P>
<P>
	At Yankee Stadium, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez (17-9) will  
pitch the opener against Texas' Aaron Sele (18-9). 
</P>
<P>
	Texas will be trying to avenge last year's three-game sweep --  
and a four-game playoff loss in the opening round in 1996 -- to the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last postseason, the hard-hitting Rangers scored only one run in  
the entire series against New York and batted just .141. They have 
since added Rafael Palmeiro to a lineup that includes Juan Gonzalez 
and Ivan Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great deal of respect for that organization, for the  
job Joe Torre has done,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``They 
are a professional team. But they had the season of the century 
last year. They're 15, 16 games less this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte is scheduled to start Game 2 for the Yankees on  
Thursday, followed by Roger Clemens and, if necessary, Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to come down to pitching,'' Torre said Sunday.  
``That's the only way you can stop their kind of offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, the Yankees hope their past will benefit them in the  
present. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience makes you better,'' Torre said. ``When you go  
into postseason play year after year, there are things you take to 
the table with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who became the first team in the majors to score  
1,000 runs since 1950, will face Pedro Martinez in the opener. He 
led the majors in wins (23) and ERA (2.07) and topped the AL with 
313 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez won Game 1 at Jacobs Field last year, but the Indians  
came back to win the next three and chase Boston. In 1995, 
Cleveland completed a three-game sweep of the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping the third time is the charm against these guys,''  
Boston's Mike Stanley said. ``It's frustrating to continue to play 
them and keep losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vizquel knows it won't be easy against Martinez and the Red Sox.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the matchup is going to be interesting,'' the  
Cleveland shortstop said. ``I really think Boston is the toughest 
team to play right now because they have been in the wild-card race 
and playing under pressure.''

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia OKs Timor Refugees Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUPANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia will let the United Nations  
fly refugees home to East Timor from their squalid camps, U.N. 
officials said Sunday, offering hope to more than 100,000 people 
evicted from their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Sanders, who is leading a U.N. assessment mission in West  
Timor, told The Associated Press that some refugees could be taken 
back on U.N.-chartered flights as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata  
welcomed the news, which she said was the first tangible result of 
her meeting last month with Indonesia's president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the return actually happens, it will bring an end to the  
ordeal of thousands of miserable people,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid agencies say the majority of the 230,000 refugees taken to  
West Timor -- many of them against their will -- would return if 
given a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Indonesian militias went on a bloody rampage in East Timor  
after the province voted overwhelmingly to break away from 
Indonesia, which ruled the former Portuguese colony since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	During a UNHCR visit to the Gor refugee camp on Saturday, West  
Timor's governor, Piet Alexander Tallo, announced to 10,000 
refugees that they would be able to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was instant and spontaneous applause,'' Sanders said.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the refugees are in camps controlled by the same  
militias who wreaked havoc on East Timor, and concerns remain about 
their safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups also are concerned about the Indonesian  
demand for an advance list of all the refugees wanting to return to 
East Timor, fearing that those who register may face retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	In East Timor, international peacekeepers sweeping the area near  
the West Timor border say they have found an empty wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 soldiers were deployed late last week in the western  
districts, in the largest and most dangerous mission of the 
2-week-old peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Mark Kelly said the troops have seen no one since  
encountering 40 refugees in the early stages of the operation and 
an armed militia group that scattered at the sight of the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Commanders of the largest pro-Indonesia militia met in West  
Timor Sunday and encouraged their men to keep fighting to block 
East Timor's independence, the Antara news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain committed to holding the red and white flag in East  
Timor,'' said Joao da Silva Tavares, head of the Pro-Integration 
Warriors, referring to the Indonesian flag. ``We are ready to die 
for integration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Australian intelligence reports say up to 4,000 militia  
had gathered near the border by last week, possibly to stage 
guerrilla strikes across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	David Wimhurst, chief of the U.N. mission in Dili, told  
Australia's Channel Nine that Indonesian help was essential in 
delivering supplies in East Timor, and in reaching refugees in West 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparations were under way for a major food distribution  
Tuesday in which families would receive enough rice to last a 
month, Wimhurst said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Answering Big Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- It started with a single voice  
echoing off the cement courtyard, then swelled to a chorus of 
first-graders repeating the same question. ``Who is George Bush?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Queued in a wiggly line, the College Heights Elementary School  
students were curious about George -- the campaigning Texan whose 
visit had prompted an extra recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is George Bush?'' the giggling children chanted in  
singsong voices. ``Who is George Bush?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a question their elders soon may need answered about the  
man far ahead of the field for the Republican presidential 
nomination, and leading the polls for the White House election 13 
months away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush himself appears in no hurry to fill in the blanks.  
</P>
<P>
	Pressed on policy, the two-term governor says he will provide  
answers on his own timetable. He has dealt with education and 
defense plans in a Bush administration. Taxes and other 
installments to come, he says, and abruptly refuses to talk about 
them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a likable, playful, funny man with a knack for putting  
people at ease in social settings, though he can be abrupt when the 
occasion is more serious. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he is a humble man. ``If the people don't want me to be  
president, so be it,'' he says, with variations, when asked about 
his prospects. But there also is a Texas swagger in his style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing pretty well,'' he grinned to reporters in San Jose,  
Calif., of the record $56 million his campaign has raised this 
year. No gloating; no need -- the numbers are there. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, no ornate orator, is at his campaign best with small  
groups of voters and their families. He likes to gently rib people, 
making them feel they are in on the joke. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Grand Rapids, Mich., school, he asked for a show of hands  
among third-graders: How many good readers? 
</P>
<P>
	All 25 raise their hands. ``Tell the truth!'' Bush chides,  
drawing guilty giggles from the children. 
</P>
<P>
	When situations get more serious, so does Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	His eyes were moist with tears as he left a campaign tour in  
Michigan to return to the site of the Sept. 15 shootings at a Fort 
Worth, Texas, church. And he sometimes speaks emotionally about his 
father, especially when it comes to his 1992 loss to President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a ``death by a thousand cuts,'' says Bush, who was an  
adviser to his father in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	That campaign left the younger Bush with his own scars. When a  
questioning reporter interrupts a monologue, Bush often counters 
with a dagger stare and a snap. ``Ah, ah,'' he'll say, and 
insisting on finishing. 
</P>
<P>
	When the questions are repeated attempts to get at something he  
does not want to address, he shuts them down. ``I gave you my 
answer,'' he snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	But no candidate takes more questions. In nearly every city he  
visits, Bush meets with reporters in open-ended sessions that last 
15 to 30 minutes. He also holds lengthy one-on-one sessions with 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	During his trip to California and Michigan, the governor  
conducted three news conferences in three days. He answered more 
than 30 questions about 14 issues -- guns, missile defenses, the Pat 
Buchanan threat, Y2K among them. 
</P>
<P>
	He can deliver a quick response, as in his criticism of the  
House Republican plan to delay payments to the working poor to save 
money in the 2000 budget. Bush said they should not be trying to 
balance the budget on the backs of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders did not like it. But Bush is not playing to  
them; the votes he needs now are in the primary election states. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been missteps. He mishandled explanations about his  
abortion record early in the campaign and, this summer, questions 
about whether he had ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, most of Bush's answers in recent days were  
well-practiced lines worded broadly enough to keep him out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clinton, Bush has a knack for offering something to both  
sides both sides of an argument. He says he is for an increase in 
the minimum wage (a Democratic cause), but only if states can opt 
out of it (succor for the GOP). 
</P>
<P>
	That chanted schoolyard question still is unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Mash One Wins Oak Tree Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Mash One, ridden by David Flores, stayed  
just off the pace most of the way and rallied in the stretch Sunday 
to win the $300,000 Oak Tree Turf Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazy Lode, with Gary Stevens aboard, finished second in 1 1/4-mile  
race on turf for 3-year-olds and up. Favorite Bonapartiste finished 
third, 2 1/4 lengths behind Lazy Lode. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the first three finishers carried 124 pounds. The winner  
was timed in 1:59. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazy Lode, who won Hollywood Turf Cup at Hollywood Park last  
December, has won five of his 21 starts and earned $812,325. 
Majorien has five wins in 18 races and earnings of $406,467. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonapartiste, a 5-year-old French-bred son of Kendor, finished  
second behind Military in last year's race. Bonapartiste, who has 
won six of 25 starts and earned $529,779, was ridden by Chris 
McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayarshan, ridden by Brice Blanc, came in fourth. Majorien,  
ridden by Pat Day, took fifth place. Docksider, shipped from Great 
Britain and making his United States debut, took sixth.

<HEADLINE> Record Year for Home Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Home runs sailed over fences at a record pace  
this year, even though Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa didn't set any 
individual marks. 
</P>
<P>
	With only Sunday's rain-delayed Cincinnati at Milwaukee game  
remaining, there were 5,524 homers in 2,426 games, a record average 
of 2.28 and up from 2.05 last year. The previous high of 2.19 was 
set in 1996, when 4,962 homers were hit in 2,227 games. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire beat Sosa 65-63 in the individual home-run race, the  
third- and fourth-highest single-season totals behind McGwire's 70 
and Sosa's 66 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty proud of myself as far as how I overcame a lot of  
things and to put up the numbers I put up this year,'' McGwire 
said. ``It just goes to show you the mind is a lot stronger than 
people think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head matchup, each homered on the regular-season's  
final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a happy man, not disappointed,'' Sosa said. ``I had a  
great year. For me, that's something to be happy about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. won his third straight AL home-run  
title and fourth overall, beating Rafael Palmeiro of Texas 48-47. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen players hit 40 or more homers, matching last year's  
total but still four short of the record set in 1996. A record 45 
players hit 30 or more homers, two more than the previous high set 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Larry Walker won his second straight National League  
batting championship. Walker, who started only 111 games because of 
injuries, hit .379, the highest NL average for a full season since 
Arky Vaughan hit .385 for Pittsburgh in 1935. Tony Gwynn hit .394 
in the strike-shortened 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's 42-point victory over Philadelphia's Bobby Abreu was  
the biggest in the NL since 1948, when Stan Musial hit .376 and 
finished 43 points ahead of Richie Ashburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good, I guess. In the same breath, it's a bad thing,''  
Walker said. ``It's all right to have a batting title, then keep 
playing. But to win the batting title and go home, it doesn't mean 
as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Nomar Garciaparra won his first AL batting title,  
hitting .357 to finish eight points higher than New York's Derek 
Jeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra has a sore right wrist and hasn't played since  
Thursday, but says he'll be ready for Boston's playoffs opener 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice but it hasn't really sunk in yet. I don't think  
maybe it'll sink in until after everything is all over,'' 
Garciaparra said. '' Myself and the team are focused on what's to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's Manny Ramirez had 165 RBIs, the highest total in the  
major leagues since Jimmie Foxx had 175 for Boston in 1938 and 
matching the 12th-highest total ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-eight players had 100 or more RBIs, eight more than the  
previous record, also set in '96. McGwire led the NL with 147 RBIs, 
matching his 1998 total and became the first player to play a full 
season and finish with more RBIs than hits (145). 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland scored 1,009 runs, the most in the majors since Boston  
scored 1,027 in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Craig Biggio hit its 56th double Sunday, the highest  
in the majors since Detroit's George Kell had 56 in 1950 and most 
in the NL since Joe Medwick had 56 for St. Louis in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Randy Johnson led the majors in strikeouts for the  
sixth time, fanning 364, the fourth-highest season total ever. He 
struck out 10 or more 23 times, matching the record Nolan Ryan set 
with the California Angels in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Pedro Martinez won his first AL strikeout title with  
313 and won his first AL ERA title at 2.03 -- he won the NL ERA 
title two years ago for Montreal. Martinez also led the major 
leagues in wins, going 23-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Mike Hampton had the most victories in the NL, beating  
Los Angeles on Sunday to finish 22-4, one win ahead of teammate 
Jose Lima. Johnson won the NL ERA title at 2.48. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Mariano Rivera led the AL with 45 saves and  
Montreal's Ugueth Urbina led the NL with 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Tony Womack won his third straight NL steals title,  
swiping 72, and Seattle's Brian Hunter won the AL title with 44 -- 
the fewest for an AL champion since Baltimore Luis Aparicio won 
with 40 in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero had 19 errors, matching the  
post-World War II high for outfielders of 19, by Lou Brock (1966) 
and Chili Davis (1988). After making nine errors in April, Guerrero 
avoided becoming the first outfielder to reach 20 since Bob Johnson 
of the 1935 Philadelphia Athletics.

<HEADLINE> High Court To Decide Hawaii Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Harold ``Freddy'' Rice sees his family as a  
microcosm of the islands' racially mixed population: Diverse, but 
not always equal. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and raised on the islands, Rice is a white rancher whose  
great-grandfather was governor of Kauai under the last island 
queen, Lili`uokalani. In Hawaii's melting pot, two of his 
grandchildren are considered Hawaiian -- and therefore eligible for 
special state and federal benefits. Three are not. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do I tell my grandchildren, that some of them are  
different? Some are privileged, some need assistance, some can't go 
to (Hawaiians-only) Kamehameha Schools?'' Rice said. ``When you see 
it in your own family it becomes real obvious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the last three years, Rice has been challenging a state law  
giving Hawaiians special race-based voting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the 62-year-old rancher will break from tending  
cattle on his Big Island spread to listen to arguments before the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, the arguments have drawn the attention of  
those on either side of the debate involving minority groups and 
affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential implications could be great for all native  
peoples in the United States,'' said Jon Van Dyke, a University of 
Hawaii constitutional law professor. ``There's not much logic in 
differentiating Native Americans from native Hawaiians. So if 
Hawaiians can't be given special rights, it would be hard to 
justify them for other Native Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briefs in support of the state have been filed by the National  
Congress of American Indians, the Alaska Native Federation, the 
Justice Department, and Alabama, California, Nevada, New Mexico, 
Oklahoma and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting Rice were Robert Bork, the conservative commentator  
and former Supreme Court nominee, and The Campaign for a 
Color-Blind America, a Texas-based organization that has backed 
legal challenges of voting districts drawn on racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are elections held by the quasi-state Office of  
Hawaiian Affairs, established in 1978 to run a $300 million trust 
that benefits the islands' estimated 200,000 residents of Hawaiian 
blood. The office oversees a wide variety of economic, social, 
health and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	State law says only residents who descend from those islanders  
living here prior to 1778, when British Capt. James Cook made the 
first Western contact, can serve on the office's board of nine 
trustees, or vote in OHA elections. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of the state's population have some Hawaiian  
blood, according to the OHA. 
</P>
<P>
	After being denied a ballot to vote for the board, Rice sued  
Gov. Ben Cayetano, claiming the elections violate the 14th 
Amendment's guarantees of equal protection and the 15th Amendment's 
guarantees against racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Ezra disagreed, saying Hawaiians enjoy  
a special trust relationship with the federal government that 
justifies the voting requirements. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals concurred, saying the voting restriction ``is not primarily 
racial, but legal and political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike American Indians, native Hawaiians are not a recognized  
tribe. 
</P>
<P>

Coffin.

	Gore Brings Retooled Campaign to N.H.  
</P>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore brought his retooled  
campaign to New Hampshire today, calling himself the underdog in 
the presidential primary race against Bill Bradley. ``The race has 
changed and it's now a two-person race that is close and 
hard-fought,'' Gore told reporters after a closed-door pep talk 
with supporters. Gore repeated his challenge for a series of 
debates with Bradley soon; to wait until January would leave too 
little time before the primaries begin, he said.

	West Bank-Gaza Link Delayed  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- In the first major setback in the revived peace  
process, Israelis said Sunday that only technical issues delay the 
opening of a land link for Palestinians between the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip. Palestinians insisted issues of principle are at 
stake. The passage is to provide the first unfettered route for 
Palestinians between the two areas. Palestinians say the delay is 
due to Israel's insistence that it issue the passes and maintain 
power of arrest along the route. ``We consider these points 
degrading and humiliating towards the Palestinian people and the 
Palestinian Authority,'' negotiator Jamil Tarifi said Sunday.

	Report: UAL Eyes Air Canada  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines reportedly is preparing a  
counterbid to an offer backed by rival American Airlines for 
control of Canada's largest air carrier. United's parent, UAL 
Corp., and German airline Lufthansa are preparing a bid to buy 35 
percent or more of the outstanding shares of Air Canada, the 
Chicago Tribune reported in Sunday's editions. The bid, which could 
come as early as tomorrow, could block the merger of Air Canada and 
Canadian Airlines proposed by investment firm Onex Corp. That 
combination is being backed by American Airlines and its parent, 
AMR Corp. AMR owns 25 percent of Canadian Airlines and would own 15 
percent of the new carrier.

	India Likely To Sign Nuclear Treaty  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India will sign the sweeping nuclear  
test ban treaty after a new parliament is seated this month, a top 
aide to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee indicated 
Sunday. ``Consensus is building in the country about our stand on 
the CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty),'' Brajesh Mishra, India's 
national security adviser, told the private STAR television 
network. Vajpayee announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear 
testing last year, and assured the U.N. General Assembly in New 
York last October that India would not be the cause of any delay in 
the adoption of the treaty.

Adding injury to insult, the Broncos lost Terrell Davis, last 
year's rushing leader in the NFL, to a potentially serious knee 
injury. The severity of the injury wasn't immediately known, but 
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said it ``looks like an ACL. ... It 
doesn't look good.'' The Jets (1-3) rallied from a 13-7 deficit 
with two fourth-quarter touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Said in Good Financial Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Despite a drop in ticket revenues and an increase  
in player salaries, analysts say the Arizona Diamondbacks are 
financially sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks earned $21.1 million from baseball operations,  
but reported a $30.3 million net loss related to writeoffs of 
player salaries for the year that ended Dec. 31, The Arizona 
Republic reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next couple of years will tell the tale,'' said Randy  
Vataha, president of Game Plan LLC, a Boston investment banking 
firm that specializes in professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the simplest way to look at it is if you throw out the  
depreciation and amortization, they made about a $15 million net 
profit, so it looks pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing general  
partner, called on the team's limited partners to ease a cash 
crunch the team blamed on dwindling attendance, including a 
9,000-seat falloff in season ticket sales and skyrocketing player 
contracts. He sought $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the team's 1998 financial statement, however, analysts  
said the cash call did not signify a deep-rooted problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is a business of seasonal cash flows,'' said Andrew  
Zimbalist, a professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who 
is an expert in the economics of professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix Newspapers Inc., the parent company of The Republic, is  
a limited partner in the Diamondbacks and increased its investment 
during the recent cash call from $6 million to $7 million.

<HEADLINE> Talent Infusion Lifts Alabama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- While the program festered in its own  
disillusion and disappointment, Alabama coach Mike DuBose and his 
staff kept hammering away at the only real solution to the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	They kept recruiting.  
</P>
<P>
	They won commitments, large and small, signing blue-chip  
prospects from the back roads of Mississippi, taking fliers on some 
risky junior-college talent, even coming out on top in a few 
head-to-head recruiting battles against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	That, as much as luck or fate, was the reason No. 12 Alabama  
pulled one of the major upsets of the year Saturday, defeating the 
No. 8 Gators 40-39 in overtime and ending their 30-game winning 
streak at The Swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems the talent gap between Alabama (4-1, 3-0 Southeastern  
Conference) and Florida (4-1, 2-1) has shrunk since NCAA-imposed 
scholarship reductions during the mid-1990s stripped the Tide of 
numbers and put DuBose in a difficult situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Take, for example, Andrew Zow, the Crimson Tide quarterback who  
came to Alabama from Lake Butler, Fla., only 40 miles up the road 
from Gainesville. A knee injury as a senior in high school made him 
a marginal prospect for the Gators, who envisioned him as a 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	Zow showed them, throwing for 336 yards and two scores in  
possibly the best performance by an Alabama quarterback since Jay 
Barker led the Tide to its last national title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't play to get back at somebody,'' Zow said. ``I come to  
play for the University of Alabama and my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a high school star in Starkville, Miss., receiver Freddie  
Milons had to choose between Alabama and Florida. He decided to go 
to Alabama, where he could make an immediate impact, instead of 
Florida, where he would have had to wait his turn. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems Milons' instincts were correct. He caught 10 passes for  
119 yards against the Gators to become the first Alabama player to 
surpass 100 yards receiving in consecutive games since Ozzie 
Newsome in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a big game for this program,'' Milons said. ``We beat  
Florida, at home. We ended their 30-game home winning streak. We 
were the major underdog, but we shocked everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, they shocked the Gators.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida had become the power of the SEC after a decade of  
stockpiling talent, much the way Alabama did in the days of Bear 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	If Florida didn't sense Alabama's resurgence before the game, it  
surely did afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Florida's first loss at home since October 1994, when  
Terry Bowden and Auburn won 36-33 at The Swamp. One big difference: 
the Tigers had beaten Florida the previous year in Auburn. This 
latest loss seemed to take the Gators by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see the same fire and intensity as I saw against  
Tennessee,'' Florida defensive lineman Gerard Warren said, 
referring to a 23-21 victory two weeks ago. ``Maybe some guys 
underestimated them and didn't take them as seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the defeat, Florida remains on track for a berth in  
the SEC title game at Atlanta and a possible rematch with the 
Crimson Tide. The Gators still hold the tiebreaker over Tennessee 
and will get to Atlanta by winning the rest of their conference 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Spurrier would like to think his team will learn something  
from its mistakes in a rematch. Three turnovers resulted in 17 
points for Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the final error: a miss on the extra point in overtime by  
Jeff Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	It was made all the more painful when Alabama's Chris Kemp  
missed as well, but an offsides penalty gave him a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it, and DuBose, whose job appeared in jeopardy two weeks  
ago, won his second straight game against a team in the Top 25.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges OPEC To Cut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries should cut production further to raise the oil price to 
more than $33 a barrel, Iraq's parliamentary speaker said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article published in the Al-Thawra newspaper, Sadoun  
Hammadi, who is also an economist, accused OPEC member states of 
flooding the market with oil to please the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important issue that should be discussed at the OPEC  
summit in Venezuela is production ceilings and prices,'' Hammadi 
wrote in the paper, which is controlled by the ruling Baath Party. 
OPEC is due to meet in Venezuela in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oil price should be $33.71 per barrel, which is a just and  
reasonable price,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In London on Friday, North Sea Brent crude oil futures settled  
at $23.67 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The price fell to below $10 a barrel in February as the world  
experienced a glut of oil. OPEC and non-OPEC members subsequently 
agreed on a series of production cutbacks which raised the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was reported as telling his  
Cabinet last week that the price was still too low and accused the 
United States of manipulating the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would certain OPEC members abandon the policy of flooding the  
market with oil to suit the interest of big industrial countries 
(such as) the United States?,'' Hammadi asked in a clear reference 
to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has long accused Saudi Arabia of exporting more than it  
should.

<HEADLINE> 'Dr. Death' Begins Trial in SAfrica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A physician dubbed ``Dr.  
Death'' by the media goes on trial Monday, when prosecutors start 
unpeeling layers of mad chemistry, killings, drug dealing and fraud 
surrounding the apartheid era's chemical and biological warfare 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wouter Basson -- a heart surgeon who continues in private  
practice -- faces charges that he killed 16 people, supplied poison 
to kill 200 and defrauded the white minority government of more 
than $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of Basson's secret program began emerging in 1992. Other  
governments -- including the United States, Britain and Switzerland 
-- apparently knew about the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The 274-page indictment said Basson supplied muscle relaxants --  
which caused victims to suffocate by paralyzing their lungs -- to 
clandestine forces set up to eliminate the apartheid state's 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those Basson is accused of killing were five unidentified  
men who were tied to trees and smeared with a jelly-like ointment 
that was meant to kill them. When the men didn't die, they were 
injected with an overdose of the muscle relaxants, the indictment 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodies of victims were often thrown into the ocean from  
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Basson also allegedly supplied substances used in the early  
1980s to kill more than 200 members of a rebel group that fought 
South African rule in Namibia. Because those killings occurred 
outside South Africa, Basson could only be charged with conspiracy 
to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges include Basson's arrest in 1997 for possessing 1,000  
tablets of the popular drug Ecstasy, part of more than 1,900 pounds 
of it produced at government expense and privately sold by the 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony last year before the Truth and Reconciliation  
Commission, one scientist described how Basson set up a military 
front company to produce cigarettes laced with anthrax, 
poison-laced chocolate and whiskey, and sugar containing 
salmonella. The intended victims included former President Nelson 
Mandela, shortly after he was released from 27 years in prison in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an extensive project and very good work was done in  
this project,'' Basson told the panel. He did not apply for amnesty 
and refused to answer many questions because of the pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain tried to keep Mandela's  
soon-to-be-elected government from obtaining the chemicals and 
asked the white rulers to destroy them before the first all-race 
vote in 1994, the panel heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss federal prosecutors announced last month that they were  
probing charges of espionage and illegal export of materials and 
technology to the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Basson, who has continued to work for the Defense Department,  
was recently suspended pending the outcome of the trial, said Col. 
John Rohlth, a defense spokesman. His legal costs will be paid by 
the government, the Sunday Independent newspaper reported in 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	South African prosecutors investigated the case for two years,  
and expect the trial to last at least 18 months.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Sammy Sosa homered for the first time in 18  
at-bats, hitting No. 63 shortly after Mark McGwire hit his 65th in 
the Cubs-Cardinals game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit a three-run shot to left in the third inning off St.

about a half-hour after McGwire homered for the sixth time in seven 
games in the first inning.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Facing Test-Ban Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing almost insurmountable odds, the Clinton  
administration is trying to round up Senate votes to ratify the 
global treaty signed three years ago to ban nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to fight very hard for it. It's the right thing  
for America, and it's the right thing for the world,'' White House 
chief of staff John Podesta said Sunday. ``I think the United 
States has a chance to lead here to begin to put this regime into 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Podesta said on  
CNN's ``Late Edition,'' ``We'll inhibit the modernization programs 
that can go on and prevent nuclear weapons from being developed by 
rogue states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said  
ratification would ``give us more tools to verify, and it will 
constrain others from testing,'' partly because of the political 
pressure that more than 150 signatories bring. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
said Lott believes that ``to unilaterally disarm at a time when 
North Korea is making strides in its nuclear program, and China, 
through ill-gotten means, also is making progress in its program, 
now is not the time to ratify this ill-conceived treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this administration chooses not to test, that is a decision  
they will make,'' said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said. ``But 
why would we want to handcuff future administrations?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott surprised the administration last week by setting a Senate  
vote on the treaty for Oct. 12 . He said Democrats had been 
campaigning for a vote, and so he decided to let them have one. A 
two-thirds majority is needed for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's pro-treaty drive, announced Saturday by  
national security adviser Sandy Berger, faces daunting odds. Even 
if all 45 Democratic senators approve the treaty, 22 Republicans 
would have to join them to provide the needed margin should all 100 
senators vote. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fall of the Soviet Union, President Bush signed a  
limited nine-month testing moratorium to take effect Oct. 1, 1992. 
President Clinton continued the moratorium -- the country's last 
test was in September 1992 -- then signed the worldwide treaty in 
1996. So far 154 countries have signed it, but only 47 have 
ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty went to the Senate in 1997 for ratification, which  
the administration considers necessary to bring other countries on 
board. It languished in the Senate until Lott set the vote last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	One major flaw that Republicans find in the treaty is the CIA's  
inability to verify low-level underground nuclear explosions in 
other countries. The administration contends the CIA's monitoring 
shortcomings give reason to ratify, but Republicans disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice last month, U.S. intelligence saw signs of activity in  
Russia that could have indicated secret testing. The CIA was unable 
to say with certainty exactly what was happening, but NSC spokesman 
Leavy said, ``We have no data to indicate a nuclear explosion has 
taken place in Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really an argument for the treaty'' because of the  
increased monitoring it would bring, including possible on-site 
monitoring of cheaters, Podesta said.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Technicalities Delay Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- In the first major setback in the revived peace  
process, Israelis said Sunday that only technical issues delay the 
opening of a land link for Palestinians between the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians insisted issues of principle are at stake.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``safe passage,'' which had been scheduled to open Sunday,  
is to provide the first unfettered route for Palestinians between 
the two areas, and is key to smoothing peace talks revived last 
month by Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians say the eleventh-hour delay is due to Israel's  
insistence that it issue the magnetic card passes and maintain 
power of arrest along the route running from the northern Gaza 
Strip to the southern West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider these points degrading and humiliating towards the  
Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority,'' negotiator 
Jamil Tarifi said Sunday. ``If Israel maintains their position, 
safe passage is meaningless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami insisted that the  
differences were ``technical,'' and said he was certain the 
Palestinians would come to understand why Israel needs to maintain 
the power of arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israel's sovereignty should be under no discussion and our  
right to guarantee the security of the passage is unquestionable,'' 
he told The Associated Press. ``I trust that we will find a way to 
iron out our differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the only differences remaining are over the passes,  
telling Israel radio only that the differences were ``technical'' 
and uninteresting. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli newspapers have reported that Israel wants to control  
distribution of the magnetic cards in order to prevent forgeries by 
militants planning attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A security adviser to Barak, Danny Yatom, predicted the opening  
would take place within days. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns by Israeli security officials that Palestinian  
militants might leave the road and carry out attacks against 
Israelis have delayed the arrangement for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Israeli peace activists demonstrated against a  
decision to confiscate 5,750 acres of land near the West Bank 
village of Idna. Palestinians claim the land for agricultural use; 
the hard-line government defeated by Barak in May designated the 
land for Jewish settlement expansion. The activists urged Barak to 
reverse that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jerusalem's Old City on Sunday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak  
swore the city would remain united under Israeli sovereignty and 
accessible to all peoples. Speaking at a ceremony to celebrate

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire is Darkhorse's Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire still offers a ray of hope  
for dark horse presidential candidates -- if they can hang on long 
enough to get here, political analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated with watching Texas Gov. George W. Bush run away with  
all the cash, Former Vice President Dan Quayle last week became the 
latest Republican to abandon the race, four months before the 
first-in-the-nation presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that prompted some speculation that the day of the  
underdog is over, several New Hampshire analysts disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Hampshire is still the dark horse state, where somebody  
could sneak up on the front-runner,'' said Dayton Duncan, author of 
a book on the primary's history. ``It's still possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since its first primary, New Hampshire has been the place where  
lesser-known candidates could get a boost. It was 1952 when 
Tennessee Sen. Estes Kefauver beat President Truman, a defeat that 
eventually forced the incumbent from the Democratic race. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen years later, Eugene McCarthy's anti-Vietnam War  
sentiments helped secure him a second-place finish in New Hampshire 
-- good enough to persuade President Johnson not to seek 
re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best example is Jimmy Carter, who came to New  
Hampshire a peanut farmer and little-known Georgia governor, but 
left a winner in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in their wildest imaginations would say Jimmy Carter  
would be the Democratic nominee, let alone the next president,'' 
Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But those kinds of upsets can't happen if candidates drop out  
before the primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers say there are two reasons why the 2000 primary could  
mark the demise of the dark horse: cash and the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush pads his $56 million war chest, other Republican  
candidates are competing for what amounts to loose change. 
</P>
<P>
	And the crowded primary season means candidates won't have much  
time to raise more money after New Hampshire. More than half the 
states, representing three-fourths of party convention delegates, 
will hold primaries and caucuses between Feb. 1 and March 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``The front-loading of the system has had a bad effect,'' said  
Duncan. ``Candidates have dropped out before people have had a say 
because the press, the polls and the race for money have become 
more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But cash doesn't necessarily buy success in New Hampshire, notes  
Clark Hubbard, a University of New Hampshire political science 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing to do is look at the 1996 primary: Steve Forbes  
outspent everyone and he came in fourth,'' he said. The winner, Pat 
Buchanan, ``was outspent by the three people who came in behind 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hubbard and Duncan point to Arizona Sen. John McCain as  
evidence of a still-viable dark horse candidate on the Republican 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smartest thing McCain did was not go to the ridiculous  
Iowa straw poll. Two of the people who did (Quayle and Lamar 
Alexander) are gone now,'' said Duncan. ``If John McCain had 
entered the Iowa poll and finished sixth, seventh or eighth, would 
he be getting the coverage he is today? I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard agreed that McCain appears to be doing well heading  
toward New Hampshire, but he wonders whether that will last. 
McCain, second to Bush in Republican fund raising, has brought in 
only $9.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``McCain can still be considered a contender,'' Hubbard said.  
``But would it be possible for McCain or another dark horse to win 
in New Hampshire and get that semi-mythical momentum thing going? I 
don't know, but I find that a lot less likely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on the Democratic side, Hubbard said the fact that Vice  
President Al Gore is now calling himself the underdog shows just 
how much a dark horse candidate can shake things up. Recent polls 
show former Sen. Bill Bradley running nearly even with Gore in key 
primary states, and Bradley raised more money than Gore in the past 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at Bill Bradley. He clearly was a dark horse -- not  
anymore. Now he's a serious contender,'' Hubbard said.

<HEADLINE> Ravens OT Ogden Leaves on Stretcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden  
was carried off the field on a stretcher with a neck injury after 
diving into a pile for a loose ball Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogden sustained a severe neck burn but had full motion in his  
arms and legs, the team said. He was taken to a hospital for 
X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 315-pound Ogden was injured at the end of the  
first half in the game against the Atlanta Falcons. A bad snap in 
the shotgun formation sent quarterback Stoney Case scurrying for 
the ball at the Baltimore 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Case recovered, but Ogden rolled over a pile of players and  
landed on top of Falcons lineman Lester Archambeau. It also 
appeared that Ogden may have taken a blow to the head from another 
Atlanta player. 
</P>
<P>
	While medical officials cared for Ogden, his teammates huddled  
on the sideline in prayer. He was strapped to a backboard, his neck 
stabilized, before being placed on the stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the half, the Falcons lost quarterback Tony Graziani,  
who sustained a concussion on a hit by Ray Lewis. Graziani was not 
expected to return.

<HEADLINE> Tax Credit Provides Crucial Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tax credit for the working poor that House  
Republicans want to convert from a lump sum to monthly payments 
provides crucial annual savings for people trying to get ahead, a 
study finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the 1998 earned income tax credit recipients questioned in  
the draft Syracuse University study said they planned to save at 
least a portion of their annual check so they could move to a 
better neighborhood, pay tuition or buy or repair a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The EITC appears to be our most effective federal program for  
leading low-income families on a path toward true economic 
independence,'' said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Center 
for Policy Research at Syracuse. ``The EITC is what makes these 
expenditures possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans want to spread the tax credit payment over a  
year, saving $8.7 billion in fiscal 2000 and pushing the cost of 
the credit into the following budget year. That would help balance 
the 2000 budget without dipping into Social Security accounts or 
breaking self-imposed spending caps. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has pledged to veto appropriations bills that  
change the payments. GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush 
has joined Democrats in questioning whether such a chance might 
harm the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Created in 1975, the credit is intended to keep people working  
and to offset the payroll taxes they contribute for Social Security 
and Medicare. Last year, taxpayers earning between $10,000 and 
$31,000 were eligible, depending on number of children. The average 
1998 claim was $1,459 for 19.4 million taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the GOP arguments for making 12 payments over the year is  
that poor people actually need more help making monthly ends meet 
and that the single payment is more difficult for people to manage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's something that helps families in need to get  
their money on a monthly basis instead of one cash drop sometime in 
the spring,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Syracuse study suggests otherwise. It was based on  
interviews with 826 Chicago-area EITC recipients who used a free 
tax clinic to do their returns in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of that group expected a refund when they came  
into the clinic and had definite ideas of what to do with it, the 
research shows. Three-quarters said they would use the money to pay 
bills or meet household expenses, but 49 percent of those added 
they would save some money for bigger purchases, tuition or moving 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``These uses suggest that the EITC also plays a large role in  
improving social mobility, a finding we did not expect,'' Smeeding 
said. ``There is a large and growing recognition of the program and 
the potential payoff for working households.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that many working people use their annual  
payments to open their first checking or savings account at a 
financial institution. Without such accounts, Smeeding said working 
poor are ``less likely to be able to effectively prioritize'' how 
to use a large check. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the study recommends that the federal government  
consider using electronic transfers of the payments to banks or 
other financial institutions so that recipients are encouraged to 
open those accounts 
</P>
<P>
	``Checking and savings accounts offer the possibility for having  
both precautionary savings and for asset building,'' Smeeding said. 
</P>
<P>
	But recipients seemed less interested in paying off credit card  
debt. About 25 percent of the group had credit cards and 80 percent 
of them had debt averaging $2,400, yet Smeeding found that only 18 
percent listed paying off the cards as a priority for their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the study concluded that the credit enables working poor  
to meet most of their pressing consumption needs and also set aside 
money for ``upward mobility.'' Without it, four out of 10 
recipients would be unable to reach their goals or would experience 
a significant delay.

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Campaign Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his  
campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is ``doing a great job'' and will 
stay on despite a government report that found questionable 
financial management while Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the 
1998 world's fair in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is staying, and I haven't seen this report, but I know him  
and he is going to continue doing the terrific job that he's been 
doing as my campaign chair,'' Gore said on CBS's ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called Coelho a ``close friend'' and said he did not think  
Americans would see the charges as relevant to the campaign for the 
2000 Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing a great job as my campaign chair and he'll continue  
doing a great job as my campaign chair,'' Gore said, adding, 
``People that I talk to are not interested in inside baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's inspector general found potential  
improprieties in Coelho's work as U.S. commissioner general for the 
world's fair in Lisbon in June 1996. The job, with the United 
State's Information Agency, included fund-raising for, as well as 
the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. pavillion at the 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by investigators, made public Saturday, found Coelho  
improperly used $210,000 in donated airline tickets, unnecessarily 
kept an expensive chauffeur-driven Mercedes and hired his niece for 
a $2,500-a-month job. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Coelho also obtained a personal loan of $300,000  
from a Portuguese bank for a private foundation to use for a 
memorial sculpture, listing it as a liability on the USIA's 
records. The U.S. government could be responsible if the loan is 
not paid, the inspector general said.

<HEADLINE> Hobert Leaves Game After Collisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- New Orleans quarterback Billy Joe Hobert was  
carted off the field with a neck injury in the second quarter 
Sunday after being hit twice in the head on a touchdown run. He was 
concious and moving his hands and feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports were that Hobert suffered a neck stinger, and  
precautionary X-rays were being done at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert was hit in the head and left shoulder by Bears linebacker  
Sean Harris as he crossed the goal line. He continued running, and 
took a vicious, helmet-to-helmet hit on the top of his head from 
Bears linebacker Rico McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert rolled over on his back, grimacing, and lay on the field  
for almost 15 minutes while he was examined by medical personnel 
from both teams. Numerous Saints and Bears players patted Hobert's 
hands and chest as he was put on the cart. Fans, who were silent 
while he was on the ground, yelled encouragement as he was driven 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert was moving his hands and feet when he was on the ground,  
and he was opening and closing his fingers while he left the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert was 8-of-13 for 76 yards, and his 2-yard TD run gave New  
Orleans a 7-0 lead. He also was sacked twice for a loss of 29 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert, 28, is in his seventh NFL season, his third with the  
Saints. He was replaced by Billy Joe Tolliver.

<HEADLINE> Official Launch of Goodwill Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- A chamber quartet played under  
threatening skies and American track star Michael Johnson and 
Australian swimmer Grant Hackett showed up a few minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing could dampen Ted Turner's enthusiasm when he helped  
officially launch the 2001 Goodwill Games on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of a better backdrop for the first Goodwill  
Games of the new millennium than Brisbane,'' Turner said on the 
third day of a fly-in visit with his wife, Jane Fonda, to help 
publicize the games to be held Aug. 29-Sept. 9, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, vice-chairman of Time Warner and the founder of the  
Goodwill Games, followed up on a decision by the International 
Olympic Committee over the weekend to allow Sydney to fly the 
Australian Aboriginal flag during next year's 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in a huddle with the officials and we are going to  
fly the Aboriginal flag at the Goodwill Game events as well,'' 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,300 athletes will compete in 14 sports at the  
invitation-only event, the first time the Goodwill Games will be 
held outside the United States or Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Queensland state government is contributing about $20  
million to the Goodwill Games, which it hopes will inject about 
$130 million into the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got my international start at the Goodwill Games, so they  
have always been very important to me,'' said Johnson, who broke 
the 400-meter world record at the world track and field 
championships in Seville, Spain, in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Johnson said earlier in his visit that next  
year's Sydney Olympics, where he will try to repeat his gold medal 
double in the 200 and 400 meters, will be his last Olympics, and 
that the Goodwill Games will mark the end of his competitive 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who has won five Goodwill Games gold medals, and  
Hackett, the world 1,500 meters champion, are acting as official 
ambassadors for the Games. Johnson has competed in all four 
previous Goodwill Games.

<HEADLINE> Author Defends His Reagan Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's biographer said Sunday that  
ideological bias is the reason some conservatives have criticized 
his portrayal of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideological loyalty is a form of sentimentality,'' author  
Edmund Morris said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt whatsoever that Reagan was a great man and a  
great president, but some of his conversations, as you may possibly 
have noticed yourself, in private (were) quite astonishingly 
banal,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris has been criticized by conservative columnists, including  
columnist George Will, for writing in his book that Reagan seemed 
to him, at times during private interviews, to be ``an apparent 
airhead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, however, said that since his book was published, three  
of Reagan's four adult children -- although not Reagan's politically 
outspoken daughter Maureen Reagan -- have affirmed its overall 
portrayal of their father. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've in fact said to me separately that this is the man  
that they remember,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he believed political allegiances largely accounted  
for attacks on the book: ``There is a basic inability of the 
political mind, the ideological mind ... to comprehend that a great 
man can be fallible in private, can sometimes be comically fallible 
in private.''

<HEADLINE> Calm Urged in Debt-Laden Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- President Jamil Mahuad urged his  
countrymen to remain calm in the face of demands by foreign 
creditors for immediate repayment of $1.4 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday creditors rejected Ecuador's pleas for more time to  
renegotiate $6 billion in U.S.-guaranteed Brady bonds and instead 
demanded immediate repayment of $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	This small Andean nation, mired in its worst economic crisis in  
70 years, defaulted on the bonds Thursday, missing a $44.5 million 
interest payment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must remain calm, tranquil and firm,'' Mahuad said Saturday  
in his weekly radio message to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was possible to keep negotiating with Ecuador's  
creditors even if they initiated civil suits in the United States 
to obtain repayment 
</P>
<P>
	``Ecuador will pay what its economy will permit it to pay,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the creditors do initiate collections suits, the government  
``is in a position to confront this process,'' Mahuad said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary  
Nicholas Brady, were issued in 1994 to restructure bad loans 
resulting from the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. They 
are partly backed by U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador became the first beneficiary of the bonds to default.  
</P>
<P>
	Ecuadorean government spokesman Carlos Larreategui said late  
Friday that his country expected the demand for repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that despite Friday's demands, the government would  
forge ahead with its economic recovery plan ``for which we've 
already received backing from international organizations'' like 
the International Monetary Fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuadorean financial experts, however, warned that Ecuador could  
expect creditors to back up their demand for repayment with legal 
reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consequences are grave because it could mean the seizure  
of accounts, cutting off of oil purchases and the blockage of 
imports,'' financial analyst Jorge Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by investors Friday gave impatient bondholders a  
``clear mandate'' to accelerate the repayment schedule, according 
to Andy Tuck, spokesman for Chase Manhattan Corp., which is the 
agent for creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bondholders know Ecuador does not have the money to repay the  
first phase of $1.4 billion discount bonds. But they did not want 
to go along with Ecuador's plan for renegotiating its payments out 
of fear of setting a precedent for other countries that owe 
billions in Brady bonds, New York analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials have urged Ecuador to develop a new economic  
strategy and reach a comprehensive accord with creditors before 
receiving an IMF loan of $400 million that could lead to $1.3 
billion in overall international aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF accord reached last week hinges on Ecuador passing  
austerity measures and tax increases, but Ecuador's Congress is 
dominated by opposition parties that oppose those changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's total public debt is $13 billion and is expected to  
top 117 percent of the country's gross domestic product by the end 
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Change Campaign Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging ``a close, hard-fought race''  
with Bill Bradley, Vice President Al Gore said Sunday he welcomes 
the chance ``to change the way I campaign'' and talk directly to 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was inevitable that if my opponent crossed the threshold of  
credibility and competence, which he did, then it would narrow and 
tighten and become a hard fought close contest. It has now reached 
that stage,'' Gore said on CBS's ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Bradley gaining in public opinion polls, Gore shook up his  
campaign last week, moving its headquarters to Tennessee from the 
nation's capital and challenging Bradley to a series of debates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to change the way I campaign, and instead of having  
these events that are planned out, just have open meetings and talk 
to people directly about the choices we face,'' Gore said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president called the prospect of a real contest against  
Bradley for the Democrat's 2000 presidential nomination, ``a 
healthy development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a close, hard fought race and frankly, I welcome that,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Debates on national issues are needed to ``elevate'' the contest  
Gore said, and would allow him and Bradley to highlight their 
differences without ``grenades being tossed back and forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore nevertheless took advantage of the immediate opportunity to  
pounce on one difference between the two candidates: their 
reactions after Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to help rally the troops, the forces of what I regard  
as progress, and Senator Bradley choose that moment to say that he 
was going to leave the public arena, said it was broken and said 
that he might even run as an independent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley left the Senate in 1996 after three terms.  
</P>
<P>
	That jab on Sunday led Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser to question  
whether ``the vice president's focus on narrow political tactics 
and positioning and negative campaigning,'' undermined the 
credibility of Gore's call for an issue-focused campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling to rescue his troubled campaign, Gore now must fend  
off the unexpectedly strong challenge from Bradley and convince 
voters he can handle Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The dual assignment became a political imperative for Gore with  
the recognition that Bradley is gaining strength in key states -- 
New Hampshire, New York and California -- and is outdistancing the 
vice president in raising money. To get to Bush -- or whoever the 
Republican nominee is -- Gore has to get past Bradley first. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's move to Tennessee appears intended to pare down his  
bloated campaign and symbolically distance himself from Washington 
insiders and the taint of ``Clinton fatigue'' -- the weariness with 
scandals and battles of President Clinton. But after Gore's seven 
years in the White House and service in both the House and Senate, 
it will be difficult to see him as an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're sort of thrashing around,'' Vanderbilt  
University political scientist Erwin Hargrove said. ``Probably a 
lot of people don't want to move out here. But he realized he was 
running low on money. He realized that he was neck-and-neck with 
Bradley. He realized he had to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Sunday he is ``counting on Clinton fatigue fatigue.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are tired of the questions about that because  
they want to turn the page and look to the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With layers of consultants, pollsters, staff and conflicting  
advice, Gore was slow to accept the threat posed by Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sat around and said, 'Oh, no, we're the vice president.  
Everything's fine, Bradley can't raise any money,'' said Democratic 
media strategist Jim Duffy. ``And the thing was just decaying. And 
it's not like this is new. There were polls three and four months 
ago saying Bradley's moving up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also has been surprised by Bush, not only with his  
remarkable fund raising, but also with some politically savvy 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Bush broke with House Republicans, criticizing  
their plan to delay income-support payments for poor working 
families. Gore had planned to pounce on Bush for the GOP plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Sunday that he still intends to hold Bush accountable  
for his support of a big tax cut proposed by congressional 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's driving all of these irresponsible slashing cuts  
for the working poor,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling for strong footing, Gore has decided to call himself  
the underdog -- even though by many measures he remains the 
Democratic front-runner, with much better name recognition than 
Bradley, endorsements from more than 100 Democratic members of 
Congress and support from many organized Democratic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow that is lacking,'' Hargrove said. ``It may be lacking  
because the national polls do not reflect that sort of thing. The 
payoff for lining up every conceivable Democratic group is in the 
primaries. But he can't abide and tolerate this sort of getting 
nowhere in the polls.''

	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A US Airways Express plane carrying 25  
people was struck by lightning and forced to make an emergency 
landing Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-turboprop plane, en route from Tampa to Pensacola, was  
hit by lightning shortly after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Two generators were knocked out, forcing the plane to continue  
on battery power, said Gainesville Fire Rescue spokesman Stuart 
Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane didn't dive or anything, but it kind of seemed like  
anything could happen,'' said passenger Barbara Cox. ``They just 
started telling us what we would have to do and to prepare for the 
worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, which carried 22 passengers and three crew members,  
landed safely at Gainesville Regional Airport. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers were loaded into taxicab vans or rental cars for the  
trip to Pensacola, said David Trovillion, US Airways Express

<HEADLINE> Protest Vs. Alleged U.S. Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Waving signs and chanting, a South  
Korean student group rallied in downtown Seoul on Sunday, demanding 
that the United States punish those responsible for the alleged 
mass killings of civilians by U.S. forces at the start of the 
Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first public reaction from South Korea's largest  
student group, called Hanchongryon and known for its anti-U.S. 
views, regarding last week's news report on the alleged killings in 
July 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. government must punish people responsible for the  
massacre!'' a group of 40 students chanted, pumping their clenched 
fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, The Associated Press reported accounts by American  
veterans, corroborating those of South Korean villagers, that their 
unit killed a large number of civilians at No Gun Ri, South Korea, 
during the early days of the Korean War. The villagers say 400 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP also found once-classified documents showing that U.S.  
commanders ordered their troops to shoot civilians as a defense 
against disguised enemy soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the rally in Seoul's main railroad plaza, the students  
demanded that the United States apologize to South Korea and the 
victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police stood around the protesters but did not intervene.  
No clashes were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are beasts wearing masks of human beings!'' the  
group said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanchongryon has led violent street protests in the past, but  
its influence has decreased sharply in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The government outlawed the group because it supported the  
withdrawal of 37,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea as well as 
other key demands made by communist North Korea. The group says the 
U.S. military presence increases tension on the divided Korean 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Aging South Koreans who said they survived the killings said  
Friday that they would not allow anti-American sentiment to affect 
their search for the truth behind No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they recognized the importance of friendly relations  
between Washington and Seoul and understood the valuable security 
role the United States plays in deterring threats from the 
communist North. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Koreas are still technically at war because no peace  
treaty was signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Their 
border is the world's most heavily militarized. 
</P>
<P>
	After the AP report, the U.S. and South Korean governments  
promised thorough investigations into the No Gun Ri killings. Both 
governments had previously dismissed the survivors' claims.

<P>
	BARABOO, Wis. (AP) -- The daughter of environmentalist Aldo  
Leopold still lives in a house built with trees she planted with 
her father on the property where he wrote ``A Sand County Almanac'' 
50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Father gave us a sense of wonder that has been with us for a  
lifetime,'' Nina Leopold Bradley told The Janesville Gazette in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She is 82 now, a botanist who lives down the road from the  
chicken coop where the Leopold family stayed on weekends when they 
visited the 80-acre property in southern Wisconsin. The federal 
government wants to turn a nearby tract into a wildlife refuge 
named after Leopold. 
</P>
<P>
	The chicken coop that became the family's home is on the  
National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like her father did up until his death in 1948, Leopold  
Bradley takes time to record the natural events of the preserve:

the first pasqueflower to bloom in spring.

<HEADLINE> Necaxa 2, Alajuela 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Necaxa of Mexico scored two second-half goals,  
including the game-winner while shorthanded, and beat Alajuela of 
Costa Rica 2-1 Sunday night to win the CONCACAF Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory makes Necaxa CONCACAF's representative at the FIFA  
Club World Championships at Brazil in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third-place game, Major League Soccer's D.C. United and  
Chicago Fire played to a 2-2 tie. CONCACAF rules state that if the 
third-place game ends in a tie, there is no penalty kick shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Vazquez scored the tournament-winning goal for Necaxa in  
the 66th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Necaxa's Agustin Delgado dribbled up the left side and centered  
a ball that Alajuela goalkeeper Alvaro Mesen and Edgar David Oliva 
of Necaxa got to at the same time. The ball bounced in front of the 
goal and left Vazquez with a wide open net. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did we win? Because we have a great spirit and great  
competitive atmosphere in the team. We have 11 players on the field 
who never give up and always keep fighting,'' Necaxa coach Raul 
Arias Rosas said. ``We gave away the lead but never quit and earned 
the win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alajuela took a 1-0 lead in the 35th minute when Josef Miso was  
tripped inside the penalty box by Necaxa's Salvador Cabrera. Miso 
was awarded a penalty kick and beat Necaxa goalkeeper Hugo Pineda 
to the lower left of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pineda got his revenge on Miso in the 59th minute when he  
stopped a penalty kick off the foot of Miso. Miso was again tripped 
inside the penalty box and had a chance to give Alajuela a 2-1 lead 
but Pineda made a diving one-handed save. 
</P>
<P>
	Necaxa played the final 34 minutes down a man after German Villa  
was ejected for punching Alajuela's Wilmer Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Necaxa tied the game two minutes into the second half when Oliva  
made a precise pass to Alex Aguinaga who scissor-kicked the ball 
past a surprised Mesen. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguinaga was named MVP of the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	The third-place game saw United score in the second minute on  
the way to a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	A.J. Wood scored the early goal, taking a short pass from Chris  
Albright, controlled it with his right foot and beat Chicago 
goalkeeper Greg Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
	United made it 2-0 in the 50th minute when Antonio Otero  
out-fought Sutton for the ball just outside the net and kicked in a 
loose ball for the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago tied it with two goals in a 9-minute span.  
</P>
<P>
	Ante Razov scored on a free kick from 23 yards out in the 71st  
minute, and Jesse Marsch scored in the 80th minute. Paul Dougherty 
passed the ball to Marsch who dribbled up the left side and beat 
United goalkeeper Mark Simpson.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Delays Scandal Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said  
Sunday he can't testify this month at a congressional hearing into 
Olympic bidding scandals, but is willing to do so later in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would testify in December after the  
International Olympic Committee votes on a series of reform 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go but only in the right moment,'' he said. ``I  
have to go there with some solution in my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch sent a letter to Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who had  
requested that he appear at an Oct. 14 hearing into excesses 
related to Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton had threatened to subpoena Samaranch if he declined to  
appear before the House commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigation. Samaranch declined to appear at a similar hearing in 
the Senate in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Samaranch said the IOC ``will fully cooperate''  
with Upton. But he said he was too busy at the moment pushing 
through reforms prompted by the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that I work full time to generate the required  
consensus,'' he said. ``My primary responsibility in these 
circumstances must rest with the need to ensure that our reforms 
proceed as planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was prepared to appear before Upton's  
committee any time after the Dec. 11-12 session where the full IOC 
will vote on sweeping reforms, including new rules on age limits, 
terms of office and the bidding and site selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from my inability to come to the United States earlier,  
this would also provide the most suitable opportunity to give you 
the best and most complete information, not only on what went 
wrong, but also and above all, on what remedies are being put into 
place,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, a Spaniard, said he will need a Spanish interpreter  
at the hearing ``to avoid any misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would welcome a visit by Upton to IOC  
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would ask the two IOC members in the United  
States, Anita DeFrantz and Jim Easton, and IOC director general 
Francois Carrard to testify at the Oct. 14 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton has called the hearing to investigate a ``culture of  
corruption'' surrounding Atlanta's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to Congress last month detailed gifts,  
travel, favors and offers of college scholarships and job 
assistance to IOC members and their families from the Atlanta bid 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the report proved ``votes were for sale'' and accused  
the IOC of fostering a corrupt bid culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said he wanted Samaranch to ``explain exactly how the IOC  
awards the games,'' based on some of the ``outrageous revelations'' 
related to the Atlanta bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's new ethics commission said last week it would review  
the Atlanta report to determine whether any IOC members had 
committed improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who headed an inquiry that led to  
the expulsion or resignation of 10 IOC members in the Salt Lake 
City scandal, said Saturday he saw no evidence in the Atlanta 
report that merited sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at hearings called by Sen. John  
McCain in April in the wake of the vote-buying scandal stemming 
from Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Samaranch sent DeFrantz to represent him. The  
hearing turned into a forum for IOC bashing. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has scheduled another hearing for Oct. 20, this time on  
the problem of performance-enhancing drugs in Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has not traveled to the United States since the Salt  
Lake City scandal broke late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other IOC members could face questioning by FBI agents  
investigating the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, the IOC executive board said it was speeding up  
plans for creation of an international anti-doping agency. The 
agency will be set up by the end of this month, rather than the end 
of the year as previously projected. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it will seek equal representation on the agency  
from governments, sports bodies and athletes in order to make it 
``independent and based on consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's plans have come under harsh attack from White House  
drug policy adviser Barry McCaffrey, who says the agency should be 
fully independent from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch took a conciliatory line, saying, ``I respect  
(McCaffrey) very much. I think he has taken care of the drug 
problem in the U.S. If he wants one day to cooperate with us, (the 
door) will be open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Salt Lake City organizers received IOC approval for their  
proposal to set aside for Utah residents 20 percent of the tickets 
for the 2002 Winter Games. SLOC has 887,000 tickets available for 
the public. It hopes to generate $180 million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC approved Salt Lake City's pictograms for the games.  
The pictograms will incorporate the city's crystal snowflake logo 
and have a Western theme. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Image building and hiring more qualified people for key  
positions became top priorities for organizers of the Athens 2004 
Games. Panagiotis Thomopoulos, head of the Athens organizing 
committee, said the group has to work on its image to dispel the 
frequent reports of delays and internal bickering. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC said it was considering scaling back the  
commercialization of the games. The executive board said it would 
consider imposing a cap on marketing revenues and reducing the 
share of funds going to organizing committees and national Olympic 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Olympic and Greek sports officials said a commission would be  
created to review proposals to hold an Olympic Youth Festival in 
Greece every four years. The festival would be held at ancient 
Olympia, birthplace of the Olympics, and begin in 2004 when Athens 
will host the summer games.

<HEADLINE> Brewers To Stay in County Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- There's no proper name for those dollops of gum  
and tar that collect on sidewalks and pavement, where they flatten 
and turn black after being walked upon by thousands of pairs of 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of those black spots adorn the concrete walkways and  
underground passageways of Milwaukee County Stadium. Sometimes, it 
seems they're the only things holding together the creaky, smelly 
building which opened in 1953 and was scheduled for demolition this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was supposed to be County Stadium's final day of life.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller Park, half-completed behind the old outfield bleachers,  
was supposed to open in April 2000 and usher the Brewers into 
prosperity and change in the new century, freeing the franchise 
from the stigma of playing in one of the league's oldest, most 
outdated stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place has memories for a lot of people, but they're not  
because of the stadium,'' said 71-year-old Brewers fan Harold Moss. 
``The memories are for the baseball that was played here. It's like 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Not many people will miss County 
Stadium when it's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of a 1,400-ton crane and the deaths of three  
workers at the Miller Park construction site in July changed 
everything. The resulting cleanups and delays prevented the stadium 
builders, already on a tight schedule, from having a chance to open 
the new stadium on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the team made it official: the Brewers and their  
fans were sentenced to one more year in County. 
</P>
<P>
	As generations of Wisconsin baseball fans already know,  
conditions and amenities at County Stadium have never been great -- 
and since the Brewers expected this to be their last season in the 
building, the stadium's caretakers left undone many maintenance 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Unpainted seats were left unpainted. Plumbing and wiring were  
checked but not replaced. Lines for concession stands and restrooms 
remained as long as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell they really gave up on this place,'' said  
Brewers fan Joyce Carvalo of Greenfield. ``It was never that nice, 
but now it's really gone to hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's final game was a sellout well before the accident.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the stadium staying open another year, those tickets  
became ordinary. The Brewers guaranteed purchasers the chance to 
buy seats for next season's actual final game, and fans can 
exchange their tickets for a brick from County Stadium when it's 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps fittingly, the bad weather that prompted the Brewers to  
build a retractable-roof stadium surfaced again Sunday. A steady 
all-day downpour greeted the portion of the sellout crowd that 
actually came to the park. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 3 p.m. start time was delayed by sheets of rain, some  
fans left -- but some stayed, stubbornly watching the rain fall on 
the tarpaulin covering the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Brewers' opponents, the Cincinnati Reds, were in  
contention for a playoff berth -- and since the Brewers couldn't 
really afford to return the revenue generated by a sellout -- the 
teams were determined to play, no matter how long they had to wait. 
</P>
<P>
	And Milwaukee baseball fans will wait with them. They're used to  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting for years,'' said Darwin Benson, rain  
dripping from his mustache and the bill of his Brewers cap. ``This 
is nothing.''

	Austria Far-Right Party Makes Gains  
</P>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- For the first time in postwar Austria,  
nationalist Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party appeared today 
to have won second place in parliamentary elections, positioning 
him for negotiations on participating in the next government. 
According to today's results, Haider won 27.2 percent of the vote, 
a stunning increase of more than 5 percentage points from the last 
election. That's the Freedom Party's best showing since its 
founding in 1945.

	Myanmar Closes Border With Thailand

<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Myanmar closed its border with Thailand  
and reinforced its border forces after five armed rebels, who had 
held diplomats and others hostage at the Myanmar Embassy, were 
released, newspapers said today. Thailand also put its border 
patrol on alert as a precautionary measure after the young Myanmar 
militants were picked up by helicopters and set free within one 
mile of the frontier yesterday, the Bangkok Post said. The group, 
which held 38 Myanmar and foreign hostages for 26 hours, were 
believed to have sought sanctuary with the Karen National Union, a

	16 Die in S. Africa Bus Crash  
</P>
<P>
	KEI CUTTINGS, South Africa (AP) -- Sixteen people died in a bus  
accident today, the latest in a series of crashes that have also 
killed foreign tourists. The bus skidded off a rain slicked road 
and down a 30 yard river bank in Eastern Cape Province, injuring at 
least 50 people, said Inspector John Fobian, police spokesman. Last 
week, 26 British tourists died when their bus driver lost control

	Mother Launches Anti-Harassment Ads  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The mother of Matthew Shepard, the gay college  
student who was beaten and left for dead, launched a public service 
announcement today aimed at curbing anti-gay taunting. It begins 
airing this month on MTV. Shepard died Oct. 12, 1998, days after he 
was beaten unconscious and tied to a ranch fence outside Laramie, 
Wyo. Two men were accused of luring the 21-year-old student out of 
a bar, driving him to a remote prairie and then robbing and 
pistol-whipping him.

	Amazon.com Going Wireless  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A week after moving to offer online  
shoppers just about anything they could want to buy -- from yard 
sale trinkets to buffalo steaks -- Amazon.com is giving customers a 
chance to place their orders from just about anywhere they go. 
Amazon planned to announce tomorrow it will become one of the first 
e-commerce companies to sell its products through new wireless 
devices. The move is timed to coincide with this week's nationwide 
release of 3Com Corp.'s new Palm VII, a hand-held computer that 
will provide wireless Internet access to allow users to read 
e-mail, shop and browse popular Web sites.

	Mets and Astros Win  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets assured themselves at least a  
tie for the NL wild card today, and the Houston Astros won their 
third straight NL Central title. New York won when Melvin Mora 
scored on Brad Clontz's ninth-inning wild pitch for a 2-1 victory 
over the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Astros routed the Los Angeles 
Dodgers 9-4 as Mike Hampton became the NL's only 22-game winner in 
the Astrodome's final regular-season game. If the Cincinnati Reds 
win today, the Mets would meet them in a one-game playoff tomorrow 
in Cincinnati.

	Ravens Defeat Falcons 19-13 in OT  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The defending NFC champions reached a new low  
today, becoming the first Super Bowl team in a non-strike year to 
start 0-4, losing to the Baltimore Ravens 19-13 in overtime. The 
end was stunning -- Stoney Case throwing a 54-yard touchdown pass to 
Justin Armour just 2:29 into the extra period. The Falcons might 
have won in regulation if coach Dan Reeves had let Morten Andersen 
try a 53-yard field goal with 49 seconds left. Instead, Reeves 
chose to punt, saying he didn't want to give the Ravens good field 
position if the kick failed.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Trade Daigle to Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Lightning have traded former  
No. 1 draft pick Alexandre Daigle to the New York Rangers for 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Daigle, who went unclaimed in last week's waiver draft, had been  
assigned to the Lightning's AHL affiliate in Providence, R.I., on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot center, drafted first overall by the Ottawa Senators  
in 1993, had six goals and six assists in 32 games for the 
Lightning last season after his trade from Philadelphia on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators had high hopes for Daigle, giving him a  
$12.5-million, five-year deal at the age of 18. He played parts of 
five seasons with the Senators before his trade to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the jump to the NHL directly from his junior club, but  
did not live up to expectations. His best season was 1996-97, when 
he scored 26 goals for the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old from Montreal is scheduled to earn $1 million  
this season.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The mother of Matthew Shepard, the gay college  
student who was beaten and left for dead, launched a public service 
announcement Sunday aimed at curbing anti-gay taunting. 
</P>
<P>
	It begins airing this month on MTV.  
</P>
<P>
	In the announcement, high school boys in a locker room shout  
anti-gay insults. Then Judy Shepard says: ``The next time you use 
words like these, think about what they really mean.'' A photo of 
her son flashes on the screen with the dates 1976-1998. Then the 
words ``Murdered'' and ``Hate'' are followed by a shot of Mrs. 
Shepard with her head bowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't let there be a next time,'' she says quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	Shepard died Oct. 12, 1998, days after he was beaten unconscious  
and tied to a ranch fence outside Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men were accused of luring the 21-year-old student out of a  
bar, driving him to a remote prairie and then robbing and 
pistol-whipping him. Russell Arthur Henderson, 21, pleaded guilty 
and was sentenced to life in prison. Aaron James McKinney, 22, is 
scheduled to go on trial Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard's public service announcement is designed to get  
viewers to ``think maybe there is a connection between their casual 
use of words like `faggot' and `homo' and a culture of intolerance 
that sometimes manifests itself in anti-gay violence,'' said Jim 
Anderson, spokesman for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of the music network's ``Take a Stand Against  
Violence'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard spoke Sunday to about 600 students and educators  
who attended GSLEN's three-day conference in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	She also accepted the group's Pathfinder award for her efforts  
to end anti-gay harassment and bias in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard's efforts helped persuade California legislators to  
outlaw the harassment of gay students and teachers in public 
schools. The legislation was signed by Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Radio City Restoration Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a $70 million restoration, the  
once-neglected Radio City Music Hall is reopening with a 
star-studded gala. 
</P>
<P>
	From its newly woven 3,000-pound gold silk curtain to freshly  
cleaned Depression-era artwork, hidden for decades under layers of 
grit and grime, the landmark theater has been restored to its 
former Art Deco grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sparkling jewel once again,'' said Bob Russo, chairman  
of the restoration committee and general manager of Madison Square 
Garden, whose parent company Cablevision has a 25-year lease on the 
building and owns Radio City Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	The theater reopens Monday night with a benefit featuring Billy  
Crystal, Ann-Margret, Sting, Tony Bennett, 98 Degrees, Ann Miller 
and Raquel Welch. The show will be taped and aired on NBC on Dec.1. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first major renovation since the building opened Dec.  
27, 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we essentially have is a new building in the old skin,  
but it's a pure restoration,'' Russo said. ``We took painstaking 
efforts to recreate the original designs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months of work included replacing six miles of faded neon  
lights on the hall's marquee, rewiring 1,500 chandeliers and 
re-insulating walls to improve the acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
	All 5,901 seats were reupholstered. Wall covering was recreated  
by a textile mill following the design on a scrap of the original 
that was found buried behind faded wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 20 art experts, using Q-tips, tiny scalpels and cotton  
squares, cleaned layers of smoke and grime from the 60-by-40 foot 
``Fountain of Youth'' mural painted by Ezra Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became a rather dark, nondescript place,'' Russo said. But  
now, he said, ``I think what will strike visitors most is how 
bright it really is.''

<HEADLINE>  Pope Declares Six More Blessed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II put three priests and  
three monks on the road to possible sainthood Sunday, adding to the 
record number of Catholics he has declared blessed during his 
papacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatifying five Italians and a Belgian during a ceremony in St.  
Peter's Square, John Paul raised to 938 the number of faithful to 
whom he has accorded that honor since he became pope in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff, who has declared 284 Catholics to be saints, is  
intent on singling out exemplary Catholics of the past as models 
for the faithful as the Church moves toward its third millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul, 79, who has often tired in long ceremonies recently,  
held up fairly well throughout Sunday's beatification, which lasted 
more than two hours. At the end of the ceremony, he waved his hand 
in blessing as he was driven in an open-topped vehicle around the 
tens of thousands of people in the square. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's beatification ceremony, marking the last formal step  
before possible sainthood for the six honored, was the last one 
scheduled before the Church celebrates 2000 as a Holy Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those beatified Sunday was Edward Poppe, a Belgian who  
died in 1924 and whom the pope called a model for fellow priests. 
Also beatified were two priests who founded orders of nuns, 
Ferdinando Maria Baccilieri, who died in 1893, and Arcangelo 
Tadini, who died in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	The three monks honored were Mariano Da Roccacasale, who died in  
1866, and two monks who worked in this century, Diego Oddi and 
Nicola Da Gesturi. John Paul praised them for their spirituality 
and simplicity.

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Sammy Sosa may not have won the home run race,  
but he is number one in the hearts of his countrymen, including the 
president of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonel Antonio Fernandez threw out the first pitch at Busch  
Stadium Sunday and watched Sosa hit his 63rd homer for the Chicago 
Cubs. But Fernandez also had to watch Mark McGwire hit his 65th 
home run for the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez said he wanted to tell Sosa and the other players from  
the Dominican Republic on both teams how important they are in 
their home country. He met with Dominican players from both teams 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering that he and Mark McGwire are the only two players  
in baseball history to ever hit more than 60 home runs in two 
straight seasons, we are very proud of him and what he has done,'' 
Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a national hero and a national source of pride, we love  
him very much.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brewers To Stay in County Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- There's no proper name for those dollops of gum  
and tar that collect on sidewalks and pavement, where they flatten 
and turn black after being walked upon by thousands of pairs of 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of those black spots adorn the concrete walkways and  
underground passageways of Milwaukee County Stadium. Sometimes, it 
seems they're the only things holding together the creaky, smelly 
building which opened in 1953 and was scheduled for demolition this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was supposed to be County Stadium's final day of life.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller Park, half-completed behind the old outfield bleachers,  
was supposed to open in April 2000 and usher the Brewers into 
prosperity and change in the new century, freeing the franchise 
from the stigma of playing in one of the league's oldest, most 
outdated stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place has memories for a lot of people, but they're not  
because of the stadium,'' said 71-year-old Brewers fan Harold Moss. 
``The memories are for the baseball that was played here. It's like 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Not many people will miss County 
Stadium when it's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of a 1,400-ton crane and the deaths of three  
workers at the Miller Park construction site in July changed 
everything. The resulting cleanups and delays prevented the stadium 
builders, already on a tight schedule, from having a chance to open 
the new stadium on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the team made it official: The Brewers and their  
fans were sentenced to one more year in County. 
</P>
<P>
	As generations of Wisconsin baseball fans already know,  
conditions and amenities at County Stadium have never been great -- 
and since the Brewers expected this to be their last season in the 
building, the stadium's caretakers left undone many maintenance 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Unpainted seats were left unpainted. Plumbing and wiring were  
checked but not replaced. Lines for concession stands and restrooms 
remained as long as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell they really gave up on this place,'' said  
Brewers fan Joyce Carvalo of Greenfield. ``It was never that nice, 
but now it's really gone to hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's final game was a sellout well before the accident.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the stadium staying open another year, those tickets  
became ordinary. The Brewers guaranteed purchasers the chance to 
buy seats for next season's actual final game, and fans can 
exchange their tickets for a brick from County Stadium when it's 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps fittingly, the bad weather that prompted the Brewers to  
build a retractable-roof stadium surfaced again Sunday. A steady 
all-day downpour greeted the portion of the sellout crowd that 
actually came to the park. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 3:05 p.m. CDT start time was delayed by sheets of rain,  
some fans left -- but some stayed, stubbornly watching the rain fall 
on the tarpaulin covering the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Brewers' opponents, the Cincinnati Reds, were in  
contention for a playoff berth -- and since the Brewers couldn't 
really afford to return the revenue generated by a sellout -- the 
teams were determined to play, no matter how long they had to wait. 
When the game began after a wait of 5 hours, 47 minutes, only about 
500 of the 55,000-plus who bought tickets were in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati won 7-1, forcing a wild-card playoff against the New  
York Mets on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting for years,'' said Darwin Benson, rain  
dripping from his mustache and the bill of his Brewers cap. ``This 
is nothing.''

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy,'' the revenge drama  
starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones, held onto No. 1 for its 
second weekend in release, earning $17.2 million to edge out the 
debut of ``Three Kings,'' according to estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy'' has earned $47.4 million so far and had only  
a 26 percent drop-off in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three Kings'' came in at No. 2, earning an estimated $16.3  
million for the weekend. The Gulf War action thriller stars George 
Clooney, Ice Cube and Mark Wahlberg as soldiers seeking a cache of 
Iraqi gold who get entangled with local rebels. Industry experts 
said it had the best chance of unseating Judd and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``American Beauty'' the dark and funny depiction of suburban  
angst from Dreamworks, climbed to third place, earning $8.1 million 
despite showing in only 706 theatres. It averaged $11,473 per 
screen, leaving all other top 10 contenders in the dust in 
per-screen earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The film stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as a suburban  
couple who, along with an entourage of complex characters, deal 
with issues ranging from infidelity to homophobia to mid-life 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamworks' Jim Tharp said the studio is considering upping the  
number of theatres showing it to 1,200 or 1,300 this week, based on 
the strong showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other debuting films did middling business during the weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Joan Hart's film debut, ``Drive Me Crazy,'' opened at  
No. 6, just below powerhouse supernatural thriller ``The Sixth 
Sense,'' in its ninth week. ``Sense'' earned an estimated $7.2 
million, while ``Crazy'' made $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Muppet movie ``Elmo In Grouchland'' came in at No. 8 with $3.3  
million, about what studio executives expected for a movie aimed at 
the under-10 set. And ``Mystery, Alaska,'' about a hopeful hockey 
team from the boondocks, started at No. 9 with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Film analyst of Robert Bucksbaum, from Reel Source Inc., called  
``Sixth Sense's'' showing phenomenal and said the top five films 
will probably stay around into the Christmas season. ``Beauty'' 
should stay in theatres into spring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $17.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Three Kings,'' $16.3 million.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The one-game playoff between Reds and New York  
Mets will be played at 7:05 p.m. EDT Monday night at Cincinnati's 
Cinergy Field, five hours later than originally scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The National League made the switch at about 11 p.m. EDT Sunday  
night because the Reds' game at Milwaukee started at 9:52 p.m EDT 
after a rain delay of 5 hours, 47 minutes. Cincinnati's 7-1 win, 
which forced the playoff, didn't end untul after 12:30 a.m. EDT 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati and New York are each 96-66. If Cincinnati is the  
wild card, the Reds would open the first round of the postseason at 
Atlanta and Houston would open at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Mets are the wild card, they would open the postseason at  
Arizona and the Astros would open at Atlanta. Teams from the same 
division cannot meet in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last one-game playoff, the Chicago Cubs beat the San  
Francisco Giants 5-3 to win last year's NL wild card.

<HEADLINE> Exercise May Help Cancer Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even during treatment, Lance Armstrong kept up  
his training. 
</P>
<P>
	During the fall and winter of 1996 and 1997, after surgery to  
remove a cancerous testicle, the world-class cyclist received 
chemotherapy. Between bouts of chemotherapy, even as he was losing 
muscle, he rode. After therapy, he rode some more. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, a fully recovered Armstrong won the most prestigious  
event in cycling -- the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	And, although researchers can't say whether Armstrong's training  
during treatment helped him beat the disease, they do say studies 
increasingly indicate that physical activity can help cancer 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on my expertise, what would I recommend if my mum was  
diagnosed with breast cancer? I would recommend exercise,'' said 
Kerry S. Courneya,a researcher at the University of Alberta, 
Edmonton. The Canadian scientist's review of 24 studies on exercise 
and cancer was published in Annals of Behavioral Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies have limitations, Courneya said. But, taken  
together, they indicate that staying active while cancer is in an 
early stage can help people retain quality of life and retard the 
loss of strength and endurance that accompanies the disease and its 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cancer patients, even though they are on chemotherapy or  
during radiation, show many of the same types of fitness benefits 
that many of the regular population would show,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are many forms of cancer, and the research does  
not cover all of them, so any conclusions must be limited to the 
types of cancers studied, Courneya cautioned. Most of the studies 
involved breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new research looks so promising that the American Cancer  
Society is revising its exercise recommendations, according to 
Colleen Doyle, director of nutrition and physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be there wasn't anything out there, so we would  
tell people, `Conserve your energy,''' Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, while the research indicates exercise can be helpful, there  
still are people who should not do it, Doyle said. These include 
people whose cancer has spread to the bone, or who have lost bone 
density as a side effect of cancer treatment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, treatment may result in nerve damage that can make a  
person prone to falls, and certain medications can affect major 
organs in ways that limit activity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will certainly recommend that people talk to their health  
care providers before they do anything,'' Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies were too varied, and the numbers of people involved  
in each were too small, for Courneya to estimate the size of the 
benefits. But the scope of the benefits ranged from increased 
flexibility to decreased fatigue, depression and anxiety, the 
review found. 
</P>
<P>
	Those quality of life issues are very important to cancer  
patients. Restoring himself to health was less than 10 percent 
physical, Armstrong told a congressional hearing last week. ``The 
big part of it is the psychological factor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benefits do not require intense exercise to achieve, Courneya  
said, adding that moderate activity such as brisk walking was 
sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The way in which activity can improve the lives of cancer  
patients is not understood, Courneya said. However, moderate 
activity can improve immune functions that could fight help to 
fight cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	And exercise can reduce estrogen levels, which could help breast  
cancer patients because estrogen is considered to promote tumor 
growth, he said. Breast cancer patients who are obese also have 
worse odds, and exercise can help people to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The field is too new to be able to tell if people who exercise  
will live longer than those who do not exercise, said Dr. Anne 
McTeirnan of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
However, the Fred Hutchinson center, the University of Southern 
California and the University of New Mexico are setting up a study 
to follow 1,200 women with breast cancer, and activity is one of 
the factors that will be examined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise can help cancer patients get more out of life, provided  
the amount and type of exercise is calibrated to the patient's 
condition, said Pamela Massey, director of rehabilitation services 
at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Breast cancer patients who have had a mastectomy, for instance,  
might get a special focus on improving the strength and flexibility 
of their shoulder muscles, she said. A person with an advanced 
cancer might be encouraged to use a wheelchair, although not to the 
point of getting worn out, she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Facing Test-Ban Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As it presses for Senate ratification of a  
nuclear test ban treaty, the Clinton administration must overcome 
Republican anxiety over the CIA's inability to verify low-level 
underground nuclear explosions in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends the shortcomings in the CIA's  
monitoring capabilities give reason to ratify the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who control the Senate, disagree. They also contend  
the treaty, signed by 150 countries, is flawed in other ways and 
would amount to unilateral disarmament by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice last month, U.S. intelligence saw signs of activity in  
Russia that could have indicated secret testing. The CIA was unable 
to say with certainty exactly what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know that there was any testing going on,'' White  
House Chief of Staff John Podesta said Sunday on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' He added: ``This is really an argument for the treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the fall of the Soviet Union, President Bush signed a  
limited testing moratorium to take effect Oct. 1, 1992, for nine 
months. President Clinton continued the moratorium -- the country's 
last test was in September 1992 -- then signed the comprehensive 
global treaty in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, a plank in the 1992 Democratic Party platform, went  
to the Senate for ratification in 1997. It languished in the Senate 
until last week, when Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
unexpectedly scheduled a full Senate vote for Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling for the 67 votes necessary for ratification, the  
White House began a campaign this weekend to boost the treaty, 
complaining of a sneak attack by Lott in giving only 10 days to 
make a case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said Sunday that Lott opposes  
the treaty for several reasons. The ``verifiability issue'' is one, 
he said, ``but that's not the primary one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testing is vital to maintenance of nuclear stockpiles,  
Czwartacki said. It is not wise ``to unilaterally disarm at a time 
when North Korea is making strides in its nuclear program, and 
China, through ill-gotten means, also is making progress in its 
program,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this administration chooses not to test, that is a decision  
they will make. But why would we want to handcuff future 
administrations?'' 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet is scheduled to give secret briefings  
in Congress and testify in private hearings this week. He is likely 
to be grilled on the low-level testing question. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. intelligence official said Sunday the CIA repeatedly has  
discussed with lawmakers the difficulty in monitoring such tests. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said  
ratifying the treaty would ``give us more tools to verify, and it 
will constrain others from testing,'' partly because of the 
political pressure that 150 signatories bring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States does not test and has no plans to, Leavy  
said. ``This treaty bans other countries. It is about preventing 
nuclear war.''

<HEADLINE> Jailed Man Finds Brighter Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Antonio Rivera strutted through the door dripping  
with gold: gold necklaces, gold rings, gold earring. He talked in 
slang laced with vulgarities and an edge, the kind acquired during 
a life of dealing drugs and doing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, he found Alex Montaner. And his future.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was searching for a new life, one with a respectable job  
that would help him be a better father. Montaner gave him GRACE -- 
Gang Retirement and Continued Education. The program trains 
troubled teens and ex-cons for 30 days in basic workplace and life 
skills, then helps them find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later at age 26, the man who once commanded a  
$19,000-a-week drug trade says he is content making $13.50 an hour 
plus commissions selling plastic guardrails. He has a 1995 Camaro 
and three-bedroom house in the suburbs. He also has commitments to 
get his high school equivalency diploma and to marry the mother of 
his 7-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	On the job, he wears a polo shirt with the company logo and  
slacks and dress shoes, and talks eloquently of his turnaround. 
Away from it, he's a family man who preaches his story to gang 
members and other troubled kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you sit down and look at it, being involved in gangs only  
leads to two places -- death or prison,'' he says. ``I know that 
what I'm doing I'm doing right. I proved myself, and I believe 
others can, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This from a guy who once expected to die young, and violently. A  
ninth-grade dropout, Rivera was on the streets all night at age 12, 
running with a gang by 13 and peddling marijuana at 15 and crack 
cocaine at 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, Rivera collected a scar from a stab wound on his  
back along with five guns, convinced ``I've got to get them before 
they get me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he kept it all secret from Nevia Nieves, a single mother who  
was on welfare and who feared for her four children in a 
neighborhood where the staccato of gunfire often had her diving for 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would spend hours on my knees crying out to God that when  
the phone would ring, I wouldn't be called out to identify my 
boys,'' she says now. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it all imploded, and Rivera spent more than four years in  
prison on drug and weapons charges. It gave him plenty of time to 
think -- chiefly about his son, whose image and that of the boy's 
mother are tattooed on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided to change.  
</P>
<P>
	But when he searched for a job after prison, he found employers  
had no interest in an ex-con who wore jeans, T-shirts and lots of 
cologne to job interviews. Rejected and dejected, he was tempted to 
return to the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he met Montaner and impressed him with his dedication to  
being a responsible family man. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter GRACE, a program that teaches ex-gang members and ex-cons  
to write resumes, resolve conflicts without a gun, shake hands the 
conventional way rather than street way of rapid-fire grasps. They 
learn how to use an alarm clock, how not to wear tilted hats to job 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some of their street skills get put to use. Through their  
dealings of drugs and guns, one-time kings of the streets are 
versed in business concepts like hierarchies, marketing and sales, 
security and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of skills that go into being a leader on the  
street,'' Montaner says. ``If you redirect that energy into the 
workforce, it can be positive and productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first, he says, ``They have to learn work ethics. We teach  
life skills in addition to work readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera spent $300 for his first suit, a gray-and-black number  
that made him feel awkward until ``people told me I looked good in 
it. That gave me motivation.'' He bought dress shoes for $70. 
</P>
<P>
	GRACE refined his speech through language classes that he says  
``helped get the ghetto out of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a struggle because words at first came out that I  
didn't want to -- cussing words and things like that,'' he says. 
``Changing the way I spoke didn't come overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today? ``He speaks like a very well-educated man. He has the  
vocabulary; it was just a matter of using it,'' says Angie Reyes of 
the Detroit Hispanic Development Corp., GRACE's parent 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The temptation to revert to his former life has been tempered,  
he says, because most of his old friends are either in prison or 
facing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's his ultimate motivation: his son, Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
	``He loves his son with all his being,'' Rivera's mother says.  
``He has hurt like a parent now, so he understands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera works at Ideal Shield in the Hispanic Manufacturing  
Center, a coalition of companies that has about 380 workers -- 20 
percent, or about 75 of them ex-gang members or felons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't give guys 86 chances,'' Ideal owner Frank Venegas  
says. ``But once they get the taste of money and the chance to be 
legitimate, it's absolutely incredible what you come up with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adds brother Loren Venegas, Rivera's boss: ``It definitely takes  
managing and coaching, which we all get in some way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it pays off: ``We do customer surveys and they come back,  
`Great working with Antonio.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting to work by 8 a.m. each workday hasn't been a struggle  
for the guy who in prison had to be up by 6:30 a.m. And Rivera's 
worked hard, winning a promotion from production to sales and not 
disappointing, once using his Spanish at a Chicago trade show to 
win a contract from a Hispanic who didn't speak English. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, his bride-to-be, Nancy Castro, says Rivera is making up  
lost time with her and their son. ``That's all he looks forward to 
-- to seeing his son every day,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera says it's been a challenge. ``But with everybody helping  
me and my striving forward, I'm doing OK. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's falling into place.''

<HEADLINE> Rescue Saves 8 Sailers During Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYPORT NAVAL STATION, Fla. (AP) -- For the eight men aboard the  
Gulf Majesty, the situation was as bad as it could be. Then it got 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to avoid Hurricane Floyd, the crew of the oceangoing  
tugboat headed east from Florida, pulling a barge destined for 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to outrun it, but it was faster than we were,''  
said Kim Brooks, 45, of Daytona Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	With seas as high as a four-story building and wind gusting to  
60 mph, the 150-foot tug began taking on water, its engine room 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	They notified the Coast Guard, cut loose their 750-foot barge,  
and abandoned ship at 7:40 a.m. on Sept. 15. Five of them clambered 
onto a bright orange life raft, but before the other three could 
join them, the rope holding the raft to the Gulf Majesty snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men on the tug had no choice but to jump into the  
ocean. The tug sank 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	About 140 miles away, waves broke across the flight deck of the  
aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy as it and other Navy ships 
dashed out to sea to avoid Floyd and its 155 mph wind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard alerted the Kennedy of the tugboat's sinking  
about 300 miles east of Jacksonville. The Guard had a fix on the 
tug's emergency locator beacon but had no ships in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,052-foot-long carrier turned back into the storm. Two of  
the Kennedy's SH-60 Seahawk helicopters were sent into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty hairy when we left the ship. There were 35- and  
45-knot winds and 20- to 35-foot swells,'' said Lt. Ruben Ramos, a 
chopper copilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Guided by the emergency beacon, it took more than an hour to fly  
to where the tug sank. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of expected to find eight guys in a life raft,'' said  
Lt. Cmdr. Joseph D'Angelo, a pilot . ``When we got there and it was 
three guys in the water, we were shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The three men in the water -- Tim Chambers, 39, of Lakeland;  
Gerald Keeth, 41, of St. Marys, Ga.; and David Lytie, 43, of Houma, 
La. -- were wearing orange life jackets but had to gulp for air as 
waves crashed over them. 
</P>
<P>
	They held onto a broken broomstick to stay together and Keeth  
had a death grip on the emergency locator beacon, about the size of 
a large flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves buffeted them like rag dolls in a washing machine.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a number of times I doubted they would find us,''  
Keeth said. 
</P>
<P>
	After four hours in the water, they heard a helicopter and set  
off smoke flares. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	D'Angelo had told the swimmers on both search crews to jump into  
the ocean only as a last resort, but as he hovered over the three 
men there was no choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``After four hours in the water, we didn't know how strong they  
were,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the conditions, one of the rescue swimmers, Petty  
Officer 3rd Class Shad Hernandez, jumped into the churning sea and 
fought his way through the waves. 
</P>
<P>
	He fastened rescue belts around the three men. Two were hoisted  
up and then he rode up with the third man. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went real quick. I was in the water only 11 minutes,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopters had to return to the Kennedy for fuel before  
resuming the search for the five men on the raft. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the second Seahawk spotted the barge, made sure none  
of the crew members were on board, then finally found the orange 
raft. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we looked up and saw the guys from the helicopter, the  
way I looked at it was angels of God when they were coming down,'' 
said Kim Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, Brooks; John Dalton, 30, of Slidell, La.; Mark  
Davis, 46, and Sid Hebert, 41, both of Slidell, La., and Dirk 
Savoie, 41, of Houma, La., had been on the raft for eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was writhing in pain, having hurt his back as they rode  
up and down monstrous waves that sometimes folded the life raft in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was the end. It just kept getting rougher and  
rougher,'' said Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
      	``It was worse than a roller coaster,'' Dalton said.	    *------ 	
</P>
<P>
	Two more swimmers, Petty Officer 3rd Class Shawn Whitfield and  
Petty Officer 3rd Class Timothy P. Lemmerman, went into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did get kind of nervous right when I hooked up and they  
kicked me out of the helicopter,'' Whitfield said. ``I felt a 
little queasy, but I looked back down and I saw the survivors and 
everything cleared again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were extremely happy. The look on their faces was just  
ecstatic,'' Whitfield said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, all eight men were reunited aboard the Kennedy,  
banged up but otherwise uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no doubt about going and no doubt about doing it,''  
said D'Angelo, whose crew was welcomed back as heroes. ``We train 
for it.''

<HEADLINE> Report: UAL Eyes Air Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A high-stakes battle may be developing between  
United Airlines and rival American Airlines over Canada's largest 
air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	United's parent, Elk Grove Township-based UAL Corp., and German  
airline Lufthansa are preparing a bid to buy 35 percent or more of 
the outstanding shares of Air Canada, the Chicago Tribune reported 
in Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid, which could come as early as Monday, could block the  
merger of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines proposed by 
Toronto-based investment firm Onex Corp. That combination is being 
backed by American Airlines and its parent, AMR Corp. AMR owns 25 
percent of Canadian Airlines and would own 15 percent of the new 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL spokesman Matthew Tiraca on Sunday said the company would  
not comment on the report. United Airlines is the world's largest 
air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada spokeswoman Nicole Couture-Simard said the Tribune  
report is based on speculation and ``we are not commenting on 
speculation. We're not denying, we are simply not commenting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Onex has offered $1.2 billion in cash and stock and would assume  
$2.7 billion in debt to take over the Canadian carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada has rebuffed the offer as an American plot to take  
over the Canadian airline industry. Canadian Airlines, which is 
going broke, has not responded to the offer and may be waiting for 
Air Canada to sweeten a bid to buy the smaller carrier's 
international routes, its most profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune reported that UAL Chairman Jim Goodwin last week  
briefed United's pilots on the plan under which UAL and Lufthansa 
reportedly will each buy 10 percent of Air Canada's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A Canadian bank, reportedly the Bank of Montreal, would buy up  
to 15 percent of the airline's shares, according to the Tribune. 
The Bank of Montreal owns Chicago's Harris Bank. Harris is the 
stock transfer agent for UAL. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL is 55 percent owned by three employee groups, with the  
airline's pilots owning the biggest stake. The arrangement obliges 
the airline to consult with the pilots and the machinists in any 
major undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
	A bidding war for a share of Air Canada would be a battle not  
only between United and American, but between two airline 
alliances: the United/Lufthansa-dominated Star Alliance, of which 
Air Canada is a member, and the American-dominated OneWorld 
Alliance, to which Canadian Airlines belongs. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL receives about $200 million annually as a result of Air  
Canada's membership in the Star Alliance, while Lufthansa receives 
about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	American, meanwhile, receives about $120 million from Canadian  
because of its membership in the OneWorld Alliance. Canadian has 
said it will shut down next spring unless it has an infusion of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	If Onex wins its bid to merge the two carriers, it has pledged  
that the new carrier will join American's OneWorld Alliance.

<HEADLINE> Report: NatWest Planning Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- National Westminster Bank is drawing up plans for  
a radical breakup in an effort to stave off the hostile takeover 
bid by the Bank of Scotland, a published report said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's advisers, J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson,  
were drawing up preliminary plans for a disposal program and a 
capital reduction that would enable NatWest to hand back up to $8 
billion to shareholders but leave the core retail and commercial 
bank intact, The Sunday Telegraph said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, NatWest was seeking a ``white knight'' to scuttle the  
takeover bid by the much smaller Bank of Scotland, but it appears 
to have changed course. 
</P>
<P>
	The new strategy, the newspaper said, is to show NatWest is  
worth at least $24 share, compared with the $20.22 a share value of 
the Bank of Scotland offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, bank chairman, Sir David Rowland, has begun an urgent  
search for a heavyweight recruit to take charge of the bank's 
retail operations and restore investor confidence in NatWest's 
management, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers have drawn up a list of potential businesses to be  
disposed of, including Ulster Bank, Gartmore, the fund manager, and 
Greenwich NatWest, the structured finance and capital markets 
business, The Sunday Telegraph said. Those properties reportedly 
could fetch as much as $5.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, NatWest also may look to raise money from its  
property portfolio, including its huge branch network, the 
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> India Likely To Sign Nuclear Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India will sign the sweeping nuclear  
test ban treaty after a new parliament is seated this month, a top 
aide to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee indicated 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consensus is building in the country about our stand on the  
CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) and after the parliament 
meets, we will be in a position to take concrete steps,'' Brajesh 
Mishra, India's national security adviser, told the private STAR 
television network. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing  
last year, and assured the U.N. General Assembly in New York last 
October that India would not be the cause of any delay in the 
adoption of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	But his government fell earlier this year when he lost a  
parliament vote. According to most exit polls and voter surveys 
after elections ended Sunday, Vajpayee is set to return to power at 
the head of his 22-party alliance this month. 
</P>
<P>
	India has long called the treaty discriminatory, saying it would  
help the declared nuclear powers retain their superiority over 
other nations. India itself carried out nuclear tests in May last 
year, provoking Pakistan to launch tit-for-tat explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants India and its hostile neighbor Pakistan  
to sign the CTBT and take steps toward reconciliation after 52 
years of rivalry. India and Pakistan have fought three wars. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which calls for an outright ban on nuclear testing,  
has been signed by 152 nations, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It must be signed and ratified by the 44 countries with nuclear  
powers before it can go into effect. Forty-one of those 44 states 
have signed, while India, Pakistan and North Korea have not. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of blocking the global pact, U.S. Senate  
Republican leaders in Washington have reversed course. The Senate 
is scheduled to debate ratification of the CTBT on Oct. 6.

<HEADLINE>  Sapp Sits Out Showdown Vs. Vikings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Warren  
Sapp was forced to sit out Sunday's game with the Minnesota Vikings 
because of his broken left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors said it would be better for him to wait for Green  
Bay'' next week, team spokesman Reggie Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp, the NFC defensive player of the month for September, broke  
two bones in his left hand last week against Denver, although he 
returned to play the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year pro anchors the NFL's top-ranked defense had 16  
tackles in three games, and shared the league lead in sacks with 
four entering Sunday. He tied a team record with three sacks in 
Tampa Bay's victory over Philadelphia in Week 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony Dungy held the two-time Pro Bowl selection out of  
contact work in practice all week but remained hopeful that Sapp 
would play Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Ponders Impact of Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALUN, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo is owned by Ford. Stora has merged  
with a Finnish competitor. Ericsson is threatening to pack up and 
move out. 
</P>
<P>
	Globalization is sweeping over Sweden's business flagships, and  
unsettling the people of this small, industrious nation. Swedes are 
questioning their competitive edge and many are worrying about what 
it might mean for their generous cradle-to-grave welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very unfortunate for Sweden,'' said Per Westerberg,  
chairman of parliament's industry committee. ``If Sweden is to make 
it, we'll have to be competitive when it comes to taxes and rules, 
education and infrastructure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a dilemma. Many fear the high taxes and tariffs that pay  
for social programs and give Sweden an enviable living standard 
could become a threat to that very prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	LM Ericsson, a global telecommunications giant, has moved much  
of its key management abroad, and warns that the whole company may 
leave unless the business climate improves. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, competitive needs have forced other Swedish  
corporations to join forces with outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo, often seen abroad as a synonym for Swedish solidity, was  
taken over by Ford this year. The Stora forestry products company, 
one of the world's oldest businesses, merged with Finland's Enso. 
The tradition-steeped Orrefors crystal concern now belongs to 
Danish Royal Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
	If the trend continues, the 8.8 million Swedes could see their  
industrial prowess eroded because of diminished clout in 
decision-making and lost jobs for subcontractors, said H.G. 
Wessberg at the Swedish Federation of Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, he said, is the risk of losing research and development  
programs that keep Sweden on the leading edge of technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all Swedes see gloom in globalization. They say foreign  
ownership and investment are an economic boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Outsiders are looking to Sweden, with its political stability,  
efficiency and a highly educated work force. The Swedish economy is 
booming, due in part to its unusually high concentration of 
multinational businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1990 to 1996, direct foreign investment in Sweden, which  
includes buyouts and new businesses, more than doubled, said Peter 
Akinder, adviser to Industry Minister Bjoern Rosengren. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone, foreign companies invested $18 billion in  
Sweden, and Swedish companies invested about as much abroad, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had an explosion. This year, we'll likely set a  
record,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past five years, the number of foreign-owned  
companies in Sweden, which joined the European Union in 1995, 
increased by 1,200. Now, 334,000 Swedes work for foreign companies, 
an increase of 120,000 over the same period, according to the 
government statistics agency, SCB. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend is good for Sweden, Akinder argues. ``It has brought  
the business sector competence, capital and more efficient 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some companies are leaving, especially because of a double  
tax on stock dividends. Swedish companies are taxed for all profits 
-- including those paid out in dividends -- and then shareholders are 
taxed for the same dividends. 
</P>
<P>
	That tax was a factor in the decision by the big Swedish bank  
Nordbanken to merge with Finnish Merita. MeritaNordbanken, one of 
northern Europe's major banking groups, is now registered in 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the main reason that the merged StoraEnso forestry  
products company is registered in Finland, said Bjoern Haegglund, 
the group's deputy chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger has put us in a solid, strong position,'' he said.  
``If the international competition gets tougher, it's clear you 
have to get sharper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann-Christine Strandell, senior economist at Nutek, Sweden's  
national board for industrial and technical development, said more 
companies are reacting to international market forces, without 
regard to Swedish political interests. 
</P>
<P>
	In such places as Falun, a town in central Sweden where Stora  
was a cornerstone for seven centuries, such cold business moves are 
met with disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun long dreamed of playing host to the Winter Olympics,  
counting on Stora for backing. Now the company headquarters and the 
dream are gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people are a bit bitter about the sale,'' said Ruth  
Trued, a real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The copper mine where Stora was founded centuries ago is now a  
tourist attraction, with an adjacent museum. The museum director, 
Tommy Forss, said he understood the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's sad that the cradle for the world's oldest business  
no longer is the hub around which the operations are centered,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Campaign Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his  
campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is ``doing a great job'' and will 
stay on despite a government report that found questionable 
financial management while Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the 
1998 world's fair in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is staying, and I haven't seen this report, but I know him  
and he is going to continue doing the terrific job that he's been 
doing as my campaign chair,'' Gore said on CBS's ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called Coelho a ``close friend'' and said he did not think  
Americans would see the charges as relevant to the campaign for the 
2000 Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing a great job as my campaign chair and he'll continue  
doing a great job as my campaign chair,'' Gore said, adding, 
``People that I talk to are not interested in inside baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's inspector general found potential  
improprieties in Coelho's work as U.S. commissioner general for the 
world's fair in Lisbon in June 1996. The job, with the United 
State's Information Agency, included fund-raising for, as well as 
the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. pavillion at the 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by investigators, made public Saturday, found Coelho  
improperly used $210,000 in donated airline tickets, unnecessarily 
kept an expensive chauffeur-driven Mercedes and hired his niece for 
a $2,500-a-month job. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Coelho also obtained a personal loan of $300,000  
from a Portuguese bank for a private foundation to use for a 
memorial sculpture, listing it as a liability on the USIA's 
records. The U.S. government could be responsible if the loan is 
not paid, the inspector general said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Kenyans Win Half-Marathon Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALERMO, Sicily (AP) -- Paul Tergat overcame a collision and used  
a strong kick to pass Hendrick Ramaala in the final stages to win 
the World Half-Marathon Championship for the first time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tergat, a five-time world cross country world champion, nearly  
lost the race in the closing yards when he bumped into a race 
official who went on the course to point the Kenyan toward the 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Tergat was timed in 1 hour, 1 minute, 50 seconds, for the 13.1  
miles. South Africa's Ramaala, who led until 100 yards remained, 
had the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tesfaye Jifar of Ethiopia was third, a second back.  
</P>
<P>
	Tegla Loroupe, also of Kenya, won her third straight women's  
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Loroupe, who broke her world record for the marathon last  
weekend at Berlin, led all the way, finishing at 1:08:48. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Mizuki Noguchi was second at 1:09:12, followed by  
Catherine Ndereba of Kenya at 1:09:23. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramaala's second-place finish led South Africa to the men's team  
title. Kenya won the women's title. The United States finished 10th 
in both the men's and women's team scoring.

<HEADLINE> Radio City Restoration Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a $70 million restoration, the  
once-neglected Radio City Music Hall is reopening with a 
star-studded gala. 
</P>
<P>
	From its newly woven 3,000-pound gold silk curtain to freshly  
cleaned Depression-era artwork, hidden for decades under layers of 
grit and grime, the landmark theater has been restored to its 
former Art Deco grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sparkling jewel once again,'' said Bob Russo, chairman  
of the restoration committee and general manager of Madison Square 
Garden, whose parent company Cablevision has a 25-year lease on the 
building and owns Radio City Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	The theater reopens Monday night with a benefit featuring Billy  
Crystal, Ann-Margret, Sting, Tony Bennett, 98 Degrees, Ann Miller 
and Raquel Welch. The show will be taped and aired on NBC on Dec.1. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first major renovation since the building opened Dec.  
27, 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we essentially have is a new building in the old skin,  
but it's a pure restoration,'' Russo said. ``We took painstaking 
efforts to recreate the original designs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months of work included replacing six miles of faded neon  
lights on the hall's marquee, rewiring 1,500 chandeliers and 
re-insulating walls to improve the acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
	All 5,901 seats were reupholstered. Wall covering was recreated  
by a textile mill following the design on a scrap of the original 
that was found buried behind faded wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 20 art experts, using Q-tips, tiny scalpels and cotton  
squares, cleaned layers of smoke and grime from the 60-by-40 foot 
``Fountain of Youth'' mural painted by Ezra Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became a rather dark, nondescript place,'' Russo said. But  
now, he said, ``I think what will strike visitors most is how 
bright it really is.''

<HEADLINE> Author Defends His Reagan Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's biographer said Sunday that  
ideological bias is the reason some conservatives have criticized 
his portrayal of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideological loyalty is a form of sentimentality,'' author  
Edmund Morris said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt whatsoever that Reagan was a great man and a  
great president, but some of his conversations, as you may possibly 
have noticed yourself, in private (were) quite astonishingly 
banal,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris has been criticized by conservative columnists, including  
columnist George Will, for writing in his book that Reagan seemed 
to him, at times during private interviews, to be ``an apparent 
airhead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, however, said that since his book was published, three  
of Reagan's four adult children -- although not Reagan's politically 
outspoken daughter Maureen Reagan -- have affirmed its overall 
portrayal of their father. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've in fact said to me separately that this is the man  
that they remember,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he believed political allegiances largely accounted  
for attacks on the book: ``There is a basic inability of the 
political mind, the ideological mind ... to comprehend that a great 
man can be fallible in private, can sometimes be comically fallible 
in private.''

<HEADLINE> Controversy Over Salt Company Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL VIZCAINO BIOSPHERE RESERVE, Mexico (AP) -- The Japanese need  
more salt than any nation on Earth. The Baja California peninsula 
of northern Mexico has the lagoons, sunshine and wind conditions 
needed to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
	But the area where a Japanese firm operates the world's largest  
salt evaporation plant -- and where they are planning to build 
another $150 million plant -- is also Latin America's largest 
biosphere reserve and the winter refuge of the gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan has shocked many environmentalist groups in the United  
States and Mexico, raised red flags at the office of Mexico's 
environmental prosecutor, and caused dismay among the population of 
Punta Abreojos, near the proposed new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're afraid we won't be able to make a living anymore,'' said  
Antonio Zuniga, secretary-general of the Punta Abreojos fishing 
cooperative, which provides the community of 1,000 people with 
electricity and drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're planning to build a dock where we do most of our  
fishing, and the discharges of brine on the open sea could kill the 
lobsters, fish, shrimp, abalone and oysters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exportadora de Sal, known as ESSA, is outgrowing its factory in  
the Ojo de Liebre lagoon just south of the city of Guerrero Negro, 
in the middle of the peninsula that stretches south from 
California. Its new plant would be built along a pristine lagoon 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes salt by evaporating seawater in salt flats  
near the ocean. Brine -- extremely salty water -- is a byproduct. 
Marine animals can be affected by sudden changes in the salinity of 
ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 environmental audit disclosed 298 deficiencies in the  
plant, ranging from unauthorized discharges of brine to the dumping 
of almost 300 industrial batteries in the lagoon. Rather than fine 
the company, authorities decided to give ESSA the chance to clean 
up its act. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the expansion plan has become a public-relations nightmare  
for ESSA, a joint venture between Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. and the 
Mexican Commerce Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups have launched an international campaign to  
prevent the expansion. In July, 34 of the world's most 
distinguished scientists signed an open letter protesting the 
expansion plans that appeared in several newspapers across the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council is leading  
a letter-writing campaign to Mitsubishi Chairman Hiroaki Yano and 
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. Writes Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a 
senior NRDC attorney: ``If Mitsubishi has its way, the whales of 
San Ignacio may soon return to their last unspoiled breeding 
grounds only to find an industrial wasteland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA claims the project would not pose a danger to marine  
wildlife and would provide a much-needed boost to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalist groups say the company is pressuring the  
government into approving the project and point to a possible 
conflict of interest: The Mexican government, which is responsible 
for enforcing environmental laws, owns 51 percent of ESSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Azuela, Mexico's environmental prosecutor, denied any  
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can categorically state that during the administration of  
President Ernesto Zedillo, environmental authorities have never 
been pressured into not imposing a fine, or imposing a lesser 
fine,'' Azuela said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government rejected the expansion project in 1995, but later  
decided to let the company appeal. ESSA is now working on an 
environmental impact study it says will prove the project is safe 
to the delicate environment of the biosphere reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA has said it will scrap the project if Mexico's  
environmental authorities find it poses a danger to the biosphere 
reserve, which UNESCO declared a World Heritage Site in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't want to be involved here or anyplace else  
in a project that would have environmental danger,'' said James E. 
Brumm, executive vice president for Mitsubishi International. 
``It's not something that we want to be known for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brumm said Mitsubishi and the Mexican government are in close  
agreement on developing the expansion project. Commerce Ministry 
officials declined to comment on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups are concerned with the possible effects on  
the gray whale, which migrates every year from the Arctic waters of 
the Bering Sea to mate and give birth in the warm waters of the 
peninsula. The spectacle draws hundreds of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine wildlife experts hired by ESSA to work on the  
environmental impact study have expressed doubts as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton D. Winant, a professor at the Scripps Institution of  
Oceanography in San Diego, said he would have no qualms about the 
project -- were it not located at a World Heritage Site. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Scripps professor and ESSA consultant, Paul Dayton, said  
the increased ship traffic represented a risk that could lead to 
the deaths of some whales. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is also under review by a congressional committee,  
members of which are skeptical about its long-term impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is it that the government previously said the project was  
illegal and is now reconsidering ESSA's proposal?'' congressman 
Jorge Gonzalez of the Green Party said at a recent hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA's operations and future expansion plans have also drawn  
concern from UNESCO. A team of UNESCO representatives made a 
three-day trip to the biosphere reserve in August to gauge the 
environmental impact of the salt plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation, which will present its conclusions in November,  
could declare the area an endangered World Heritage Site, an act 
which would put more pressure on the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of growing public pressure, ESSA has announced it  
has modified its project to minimize the possibility of 
environmental damage. But that's hardly any relief to the community 
of Punta Abreojos. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've made some changes, but it doesn't change the fact that  
it's going to affect the environment,'' Zuniga said. ``It could 
really affect our livelihood, and we're scared, because the damage 
it can cause would outweight any economic benefits.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Campaign Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his  
campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is ``doing a great job'' and will 
stay on despite a government report that found questionable 
financial management while Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the 
1998 world's fair in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is staying, and I haven't seen this report, but I know him  
and he is going to continue doing the terrific job that he's been 
doing as my campaign chair,'' Gore said on CBS's ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called Coelho a ``close friend'' and said he did not think  
Americans would see the charges as relevant to the campaign for the 
2000 Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing a great job as my campaign chair and he'll continue  
doing a great job as my campaign chair,'' Gore said, adding, 
``People that I talk to are not interested in inside baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's inspector general found potential  
improprieties in Coelho's work as U.S. commissioner general for the 
world's fair in Lisbon in June 1996. The job, with the United 
State's Information Agency, included fund-raising for, as well as 
the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. pavillion at the 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by investigators, made public Saturday, found Coelho  
improperly used $210,000 in donated airline tickets, unnecessarily 
kept an expensive chauffeur-driven Mercedes and hired his niece for 
a $2,500-a-month job. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Coelho also obtained a personal loan of $300,000  
from a Portuguese bank for a private foundation to use for a 
memorial sculpture, listing it as a liability on the USIA's 
records. The U.S. government could be responsible if the loan is 
not paid, the inspector general said.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Announces First 3 Starters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Omar Daal  
will start the first three games of the playoffs for Arizona, and 
Brian Anderson is looking more and more like the probable starter 
if there is a Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter also decided Sunday on but one of the  
non-pitchers who will be on the 25-man roster. Among those left off 
was first baseman Travis Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed Johnson (17-9), the major league strikeout  
leader and NL leader in ERA, will start Tuesday's opener against 
New York or Houston. Stottlemyre (6-3) will go in Wednesday's Game 
2 and the lefty Daal (16-9) will start Game 3 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said he will announce Monday whether Anderson (8-2) or  
Andy Benes (13-12) will be the fourth starter. Anderson started 
Sunday's regular-season finale against San Diego and seemed the 
most likely choice after throwing five shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Johnson, Anderson has been Arizona's top pitcher down  
the stretch. He's 6-0 in his last nine starts. In one of the 
no-decisions during that stretch, against Pittsburgh on Sept. 14, 
he allowed one hit in seven innings. On Sunday, he gave up three 
hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to start, but at the same time if I'm going to  
relieve, start, whatever, the bottom line is get the next hitter 
out in whatever role it's going to be,'' Anderson said. ``It's 
something that's completely out of my control. All I can do is 
control what I do on the field and if that's good enough to start, 
awesome. If it's not, awesome. I'll go in the bullpen and do the 
best I can there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter will wait until Monday to decide whether catcher  
Damian Miller will be on the roster. Miller, who has a hairline 
fracture in his right wrist, did some throwing and swung the bat 
before Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Miller said his wrist felt good.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he feels great today, you've still got to wait until  
tomorrow to see how it is,'' Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Miller can't go, the roster spot would go to catcher Rod  
Barajas, who played all but the last few weeks with Double-A El 
Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter will use 11 pitchers and 14 position players. He said  
the last two pitching spots will be filled from among Benes, Darren 
Holmes and Armando Reynoso. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserves among the position players are shortstop Andy Fox,  
outfielder Bernard Gilkey, utility player Lenny Harris, first 
baseman Greg Colbrunn and outfielder Turner Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	The relief pitchers assured roster spots are closer Matt Mantei,  
Gregg Olson, Dan Plesac, Greg Swindell and Bobby Chouinard. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said he left off Lee largely because the first baseman  
has yet to fully recover from a severely sprained left ankle. Lee, 
the starter for much of the season, was in a 3-for-43 slump at the 
time he was injured Aug. 15 and had lost his job to rookie Erubiel 
Durazo. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he understood but still was disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're here all year long and it comes to crunch time and you  
get let go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said it made more sense to go with Ward, signed after  
Pittsburgh released him in late August. Ward initially signed with 
Arizona's Triple-A team and joined the Diamondbacks Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a healthy player, can play all three outfield positions  
and he's a switch-hitter,'' Showalter said. ``He's done well in his 
short time here, and he's a little better equipped to pinch hit 
physically and experience-wise right now than Travis. If Travis was 
a healthy player, I don't think we'd be having this conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eight starters are third baseman Matt Williams, second

<HEADLINE> Weather May Trim Pumpkin Crop / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Call it Mother Nature's idea of trick or  
treat. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaming the dry, hot summer weather, Texas Agriculture  
Commissioner Susan Combs says the state's pumpkin crop could be 
smaller than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Production estimates are down 25 percent to 30 percent in some  
Texas fields, and some fields that were planted early had to be 
replanted because of hail and wind damage. Those may be late in 
maturing, with pumpkins not reaching full color. 
</P>
<P>
	About 95 percent of the state's pumpkin crop is sold for  
jack-o'-lanterns and other Halloween decorations. The best 
jack-o'-lantern pumpkins weigh between 15 pounds and 30 pounds, 
have bright orange rinds and well-defined ribbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar pumpkins, weighing two to five pounds with sweeter and  
more tender meat, are favored by consumers for pumpkin pies, the 
state Agriculture Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said pumpkin pie lovers also might want to try a  
white pumpkin, which has a pale orange interior and is more 
flavorful and less stringy than traditional orange varieties. Those 
can be found at farmers' markets and garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Texas pumpkins are a sure sign fall has arrived,'' Ms. Combs  
said last week. ``But to make sure this year is a 'treat' instead 
of a 'trick,' be sure to shop early to get your pick of the 
harvest.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio's Catholic bishops, noting the  
beating that farmers have been taking from the weather and low 
commodity prices, issued a plea for prayer and promised increased 
lobbying on behalf of the state's rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these perilous times, we encourage ongoing public support  
for the hardworking and caring individuals who derive their income 
from the land,'' the bishop's wrote in a letter sent to parish 
leaders last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A report last year raised the bishops' concerns about the  
growing concentration and industrialization of agriculture in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody thinks about where food comes from or what happens to  
farmers,'' said Jim Tobin, associate director of the Catholic 
Conference of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, which represents the six Roman Catholic dioceses  
as well as the Byzantine, Romanian and Ukrainian Catholic churches 
in Ohio, pledged to seek solutions to problems facing farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bishops commended Gov. Bob Taft for his $5 million proposal  
last month to help farmers hurt by the drought to look for new 
sources of water and buy hay to get them through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also urged state and federal officials to do more.  
</P>
<P>
	``Additional state and federal resources should be made  
available to help compensate for crop and livestock losses, as well 
as provide for emergency feeding needs, water assistance and tax 
relief,'' the bishops wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Issues of commodity pricing, labor compensation, farmland  
preservation, environmental safety and retooling and marketing 
assistance for small and moderate-size farmers should also be 
explored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the church would like to act as an intermediary,  
Tobin said. For example, church workers could act as go-betweens 
for farm operators and migrant workers in disputes over health, 
safety, housing and wages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the answers, but there really needs to be some  
serious dialogue,'' Tobin said.

<HEADLINE> Soccer League Calls for Silent Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A noise ban forced thousands of parents and  
coaches in the Northern Ohio Girls Soccer League to keep their 
cheers and criticisms to themselves on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents silently sucked lollipops, waved signs, even put  
duct tape over their mouths to stay quiet. Goals and saves were met 
by smiles and nods of approval -- even from the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a league-wide effort to put the sport back into  
perspective -- a daylong ban on cheering the league called ``Silent 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids had a ball. They were able make decisions on their  
own without being questioned or yelled at,'' said Carl Pavlovich, a 
coach and board member for the league, which has 3,800 girls, ages 
8 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
	When the league came up with the idea, it was the first Fred  
Engh, president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports, had ever 
heard of. And he loved it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents have lost perspective of what youth sports are all  
about,'' he said. ``This is a wake-up call, a giant time-out for 
adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rowdy parents have disrupted games and frustrated young players.  
On Sept. 27, the father of a high school soccer player was charged 
with punching one of his son's opponents during a game in suburban 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials don't plan to make silence a policy, but they  
are considering another day of silent games in the spring.

<HEADLINE>  29 Chechens Said Killed by Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- A nighttime Russian bombing raid on a  
Chechen town killed 28 civilians, many of them children, and 
destroyed more than 50 homes, anguished residents and Chechen 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are the Russians bombing us? We are not terrorists,'' said  
a tearful Lechi Tovbulatov, 58, who described losing his wife and 
two children in the Saturday night airstrikes on the town of 
Urus-Martan. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents cleared away the debris from the damaged homes on  
Sunday, and as they sifted through the wreckage, they occasionally 
found body parts of those killed in the raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen of the 28 killed were children, and more than 100  
people were injured, many of them seriously, according to residents 
and Chechen officials. Urus-Martan, 15 miles southwest of the 
Chechen capital Grozny, is one of the biggest towns in the 
breakaway southern republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian military officials in the neighboring territory of  
Dagestan refused to comment on the air raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been bombing Chechnya for the past two weeks and has  
been moving troops several miles inside Chechnya's border in an 
attempt to create a security zone around the rebellious territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia began the raids after Muslim militants from Chechnya  
invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, seeking to 
create an Islamic state in southern Russia. The militants have also 
been blamed for a series of bombings in Russia last month that 
killed about 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military insists it is targeting only suspected  
guerrilla bases and support facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bomb strikes are made only after the double checking of  
coordinates, in fact they are checked several times before making a 
strike,'' said Sergei Pryganov, a spokesman for the Russian 
military press center in neighboring Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said more than 400  
civilians have died and more than 1,000 have been injured in the 
air raids. He also said the territory's feeble economy has been 
further damaged, with hospitals, brick plants, oil refineries and 
an oil pipeline all hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chechnya will not give up a single square meter of land,''  
Maskhadov told a news conference Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov has been unable to restore order to Chechnya since  
winning election as president in 1997, and said the Russian 
airstrikes would make it even more difficult to disarm militants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Show us terrorist bases and we will destroy them on our own,''  
he said. But, he added, ``when an axe hangs over Chechnya, I cannot 
disarm people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya's military headquarters said Russian warplanes bombed  
northern Chechnya on Sunday, striking the villages of Naur and 
Shelkovsk. There was no immediate word on casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has been effectively independent since 1996, when  
Russian troops withdrew at the end of a two-year war.

<HEADLINE> Britney Spears Explains Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Singer Britney Spears says that a growth spurt,  
not breast implants, have contributed to her increased proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first signed with the record label, we took a lot of  
photos, and those were the pictures that got used. I weighed 105 
pounds; I weigh 130 now. I went through a major growth spurt,'' 
Spears, 17, tells the Oct. 9 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Spears, whose ``Baby One More Time'' album has sold more than 5  
million copies, says the rumors bothered her for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some interviews I would just start crying,'' she says.  
``I'd be like, 'Why are you being so rude to me?' After a while 
people stopped staying stuff. But for a while it got really 
tough.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Share Rhythmic Gymnastics Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSAKA, Japan (AP) -- Two-time European champion Alina Kabaeva of  
Russia, already winner of the all-around individual championship, 
scored a perfect 10.0 Sunday in winning the ribbon event and added 
the ball title in the individual apparatus final at the World 
Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10.0 was Kabaeva's sixth at the championships. Kabaeva, 16,  
won more medals than any other gymnast during the six-day meet -- 
four golds and two silvers. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic bronze medalist Elena Vitrichenko of Ukraine also won  
two events Sunday. Vitrichenko, the all-around champion in the 
previous championships at Berlin in 1997, captured the rope and the 
hoop -- each one with a perfect mark, outscoring Kabaeva. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Russia won five golds. Ukraine had the two won by  
Vitrichenko, and Greece also won two in the team apparatus finals -- 
one for the ball, the other in the combination of hoops and 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships served as a qualifier for the 2000 Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Landscape Architects Push Greenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Shortly after the Civil War, Frederick Law Olmsted  
designed the nation's first greenway, an uninterrupted corridor of 
parkland stretching from Boston Common to a 520-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
	It was linked by stately Commonwealth Avenue, marshy,  
reed-filled fens, parks, riverways and a Harvard-run arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
	Olmsted called it The Emerald Necklace.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, 200 landscape architects want to create an emerald necklace  
stretching from the Maine woods to the Long Island Sound. They 
formally announced their plan last month in the Back Bay Fens to 
honor Olmsted, the father of their profession, on the 100th 
anniversary of the American Society of Landscape Architects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's particularly fitting to hold the unveiling here since  
Olmsted's emerald necklace design was the nation's first to link 
individual parks over several miles and this plan is the first to 
link greenways in a network over several states,'' said Barry W. 
Starke, president of the Landscape Architects Society, which held 
its annual meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past century, the six New England states have preserved  
19,011 miles of parks and trails. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Chapter of the society wants to add to that 19,300  
miles of greenways and trails and another 8 million acres of 
protected land -- nearly 20 percent of New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, called ``New England Greenway Vision Plan,'' took  
more than a year to create by a team comprised of landscape 
architects, government officials, greenway advocates from each of 
the six New England states and students from three schools of 
landscape architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	The group concluded that one way to create a New England-wide  
emerald necklace would be for all the states to emulate 
Massachusetts' Rivers Protection Act of 1996, which protects 200 
feet on both sides of every flowing river -- or about 20 percent of 
the land in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The law gives Massachusetts four times as much protected green  
space as Maine and at least double that of any other New England 
state. It also provides an ideal network of potentially 
interconnected green space. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greenway Vision Plan would also transform old railroad beds  
and canals into trails. Canals that once connected Northampton to 
New Haven, Conn., Sebago Lake to Portland, Maine, and Worcester to 
Providence, R.I., could do so again in the form of trails. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan notes that only 283 miles of New England's old railroad  
beds have been converted to hiking and biking trails, leaving 2,764 
miles that could become greenways. 
</P>
<P>
	Local property owners often oppose the creation of bike paths,  
but eventually become their biggest boosters, according to Rhode 
Island Lt. Gov. Charles Fogarty, who came to Boston for the 
Greenway Vision Plan announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogarty said he wishes he could spend more time riding his old  
10-speed along the 14.5-mile East Bay Bike Path in Providence. The 
path attracts 2,500 bikers on a typical summer day and has prompted 
enthusiasts to push at least 15 proposals for more such paths. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greenway Vision Plan supports existing proposals for more  
green space, such as a plan by a group called RESTORE: The North 
Woods to establish a new 3.2 million acre Maine Woods National Park 
surrounding Baxter State Park in northcentral Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Protecting open space requires money, and the group depends on  
federal highway money to fund many of its proposals. Since 1991, 
the federal government has required states to spend 10 percent of 
their highway money on projects such as bikeways, scenic highways 
and preservation of historic sites. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the landscape architects claim their proposal will  
double the region's tourist industry without harming the 
environment.

<HEADLINE>  Ripken Hopes To Return Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken returned to Camden Yards on Saturday  
for the first time since season-ending surgery nine days ago and 
said he hopes to resume baseball activities by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleasantly surprised. ... I don't want to get ahead of  
myself, but the plan is to spend four, maybe six weeks to let the 
soft tissue heal,'' said the Baltimore star, who underwent surgery 
to a nerve irritation in his lower back on Sept. 23 in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll slowly start a general exercise program. Then I'll pick  
up a bat and a baseball, I would assume, maybe Dec. 1 or late 
November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, speaking publicly for the first time since the  
procedure, said his decision was made with his offseason 
rehabilitation regimen in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not too far off my regular schedule,'' the third  
baseman said. ``I have a full offseason to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By opting for surgery 11 days before the end of the season,  
Ripken temporarily halted his pursuit of 3,000 hits. He is nine 
hits shy of that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken hit his 400th home run Sept. 2 and batted a career-high  
.340 in 86 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great year and it was a discouraging year,'' said  
Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's father, Cal Sr., died late in spring training. Later,  
the Orioles star went on the disabled list for the first two times 
in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, it was uplifting and also the worst,'' he added. ``I  
rediscovered a swing I hadn't had. ... I'd like to what would have 
happened if I had that swing over 650 at-bats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken left the Orioles after experiencing pain in his back  
Sept. 21 in Texas and traveled the next day to Cleveland, where Dr. 
Henry Bohlman performed the 2 1/2-hour procedure after Ripken briefly 
deliberated his options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I've been worn down. ... The fact that I'm walking  
around and feeling good are good indicators. I don't have a fear of 
trying it again. The only way you find out is to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his pain may be subsiding, Ripken has maintained a sense  
of humor through his ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to see the scar?'' he asked reporters, pulling up his  
black warmup jersey to reveal a six-inch scar on the middle of his 
lower back, just above his waistline.

<HEADLINE> Desert Said Bad for Allergies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Terri Cast slumps in the chair of her  
doctor's office, nine dots the color of roses blossoming across her 
arm. ``I itch. I itch!'' she complains, jutting a finger at one 
spreading splotch, demanding to know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the hall, Lonnie Kelly sits amazingly still as a doctor  
thrusts an instrument up her nose and asks, ``Still having the 
allergies?'' ``Oh yeah,'' she responds, her watery eyes shooting 
him a look of, ``What are you, nuts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few doors down, Anne Abbott Gee, a set of blotches identical  
to Ms. Cast's decorating her arm, munches on a chocolate chip 
cookie as she waits 20 minutes to be sure she doesn't stop 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	To think people once fled to Tucson to escape pollen.  
</P>
<P>
	As early as 1929, a brochure for a local sanatorium promised  
treatment for sinusitis and other respiratory ailments, 
proclaiming, ``The desert is God's great health-giving 
laboratory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's crap,'' sniffs Mrs. Kelly, a Tucson resident since  
1976. ``My kids didn't have allergies before we came here, my 
husband never had allergies until we came here. Everybody I know 
who's come here from somewhere else has developed allergies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days, for some, a visit to the allergist's office comes as  
frequently as a stop at the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	A twice-weekly newspaper column dispenses advice on avoiding  
allergenic plants and substances. 
</P>
<P>
	A respiratory radio show optimistically titled ``Breathing  
Easy'' is broadcast weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always hear, 'Hey, the desert's great for your sinuses,'''  
says Ms. Cast, who had hoped the desert landscape would alleviate 
her allergies when she moved here from Tennessee in February. 
Instead she found herself surrounded by pollen-producing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of green stuff out here. There's millions of  
plants,'' she says. ``I don't know what all the stuff is, but 
there's a lot of green stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, those who flocked here for health reasons over the  
decades are among those to blame for the sneezing and wheezing of 
today's Tucsonians. 
</P>
<P>
	By the late 1800s, the Southern Pacific Co. had a rail line  
running through Tucson, and with the so-called health-seekers came 
the farmers and ranchers and miners. They came from the East, the 
Midwest, from California and Europe to make the desert their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that meant turning the desolate swath of land into an  
oasis of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to live here, you want to try to make it  
comfortable,'' says Mark Sneller, an allergy researcher who 
examined pollen changes in Tucson from the 1940s through the 1980s. 
``It didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that a lawn 
reflected less heat than hard-packed earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bermudagrass was introduced for pastures and lawns. European  
olive trees, brought to the United States in the 18th century by 
Spanish missionaries, were planted for fruit and shade. Later, 
Tucsonians imported Chinese mulberry trees for shade. 
</P>
<P>
	Few knew the nonnative plants would spawn another species once  
alien to the desert: allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of the natural desert vegetation was  
insect-pollinated, rarely causing allergic reactions, the nonnative 
plants were wind-pollinated and produced large quantities of 
airborne pollen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even while doctors around the world were sending patients here  
when the area was noted for its sanatoriums, it didn't hold weight 
for people with allergies because we were doing everything contrary 
to the elimination of allergies,'' Sneller says. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest extensive report about pollenosis in Arizona was  
published in 1922 and included a list of plants considered capable 
of causing hay fever in the Southwest -- among them Bermudagrass. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1932, another report recognized the olive tree as a potential  
hay fever problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't until the 1960s, when the Tucson population went  
from 45,454 to 212,892 in a decade and trees planted years earlier 
matured, that the pollen counts exploded. The biggest culprits: 
Mulberry, olive and Bermudagrass. 
</P>
<P>
	By the 1980s, pollen counts had increased tenfold compared with  
the 1940s, Sneller says. In 1984, the county outlawed the sale of 
olive and mulberry trees and mandated that Bermudagrass be cut 
regularly, threatening violators with fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucson, one-time haven for health-seekers, became home to the  
first pollen-control ordinance in the nation. Other Southwestern 
cities followed, including Albuquerque, El Paso and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, about half of the 840,000 people who live in the Tucson  
area suffer from allergies -- twice as high as the national average, 
Sneller says. 
</P>
<P>
	And because the pollen ordinance did not require trees already  
in the ground to be removed, the misery continues. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the legacy of the desert pioneers.  
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to take a desert and make it a tropical area,''  
Mrs. Kelly says, pausing to clear her irritated throat before 
finishing. ``It doesn't work.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Wait, Watch Mets Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- While the New York Mets were saving their  
playoff lives, the Cincinnati Reds could only wait and watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Steady sheets of rain pounded County Stadium in Milwaukee at the  
scheduled 4 p.m. EDT start time of Cincinnati's season finale 
against the Brewers. As of 6:45 p.m., it had been raining steadily 
for six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both teams desperately wanted to finish their seasons on  
time, a foreboding forecast suggested a delay until Monday was 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds needed to win the game to avert a stunning collapse in  
the season's final weekend. Cincinnati controlled its own playoff 
destiny two days earlier, but consecutive losses to the lowly 
Brewers let the Mets back in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's victory over Los Angeles on Sunday clinched the NL  
Central title for the Astros (97-65). It also meant the Reds 
(95-66) must beat Milwaukee to force a one-game playoff with New 
York (96-66) on Monday at Cinergy Field. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Cincinnati-Milwaukee game was postponed, it was to be  
rescheduled for 2:05 p.m. EDT Monday. And if that occurred and the 
Reds won, there was to be a one-game playoff between New York and 
Cincinnati for the wild-card slot at Cinergy Field on Tuesday at 
2:05 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event the Reds and Mets needed to play Tuesday, Game 1 in  
each NL playoff series would be pushed back a day until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The best weather forecasts available to the Brewers suggested  
intermittent rains until Monday morning, but there appeared to be a 
window of calm about 8 p.m. EDT when the game might be able to get 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds, who looked battered when they left the field Saturday  
after their 10-6 loss to the Brewers, watched the Mets-Pirates and 
Dodgers-Astros games on clubhouse televisions. The Brewers showed 
the game on the stadium's video screen for the few thousand fans 
who braved the elements. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL said the Brewers would decide whether to cancel the game.  
Milwaukee sold over 54,000 tickets to the game, which was expected 
to be the last ever played in County Stadium before a July crane 
accident at Miller Park delayed the new stadium's opening for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Between innings, the video screen flashed the message, ``The  
Weather Situation continues to be monitored. All efforts will be 
made to play today's game. Thank you for your patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reds manager Jack McKeon ventured into the outfield to test the  
turf about an hour after the game's scheduled start time, and he 
waved when fans in the left-field stands cheered him. 
</P>
<P>
	A few Brewers players wandered out into the steady downpour  
about an hour before the scheduled game time to sign autographs for 
several hundred fans wearing ponchos and slickers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins-White Sox game 90 miles south in Chicago finished in a  
1-1 tie called after 6 1/2 innings because of a rain.

<HEADLINE> Falcons QB Injured Vs. Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons, already playing without  
starting quarterback Chris Chandler, lost second-stringer Tony 
Graziani in the second quarter of Sunday's game against the 
Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziani suffered a concussion on a brutal hit by linebacker Ray  
Lewis with 6:49 remaining in the half. The quarterback wasn't 
expected to return after completing 9 of 13 passes for 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis blitzed up the middle at full speed, his helmet driving  
into Graziani's chest a split-second after the quarterback 
delivered an incomplete pass. Graziani landed hard on the 
artificial turf, remaining there for several minutes before he 
finally staggered off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler missed his second game with a pulled hamstring, forcing  
the Falcons to use third-teamer Danny Kanell.

<HEADLINE> Allman Brothers' Graves Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACON, Ga. (AP) -- Duane Allman's and Berry Oakley's relatives  
are so adamant about protecting their grave sites, they bought the 
land immediately surrounding them and claim it's private -- no 
trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want anyone (kicked) out of Rose Hill, but don't  
deface the graves. Don't have sex on the graves,'' said Lars 
Anderson, an attorney for two relatives of the two Allman Brothers 
Band founders. 
</P>
<P>
	They died in separate motorcycle accidents in the early 1970s.  
</P>
<P>
	Macon Mayor Jim Marshall say the cemetery is public property and  
the hundreds of people who flock to the graves each month are 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also why criminal trespassing charges against a Macon  
Telegraph photographer arrested while taking photos of the graves 
were dropped Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall said the city is considering allowing a fence around  
the graves and a sign to tell visitors what they may and may not 
do.

<HEADLINE> Ventura To Schwarzenegger: Don't Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura has urged his friend,  
actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, not to run for governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
	``My advice to Arnold, as a friend, is `Continue with your movie  
career, Arnold, don't get involved in it. It won't be worth it to 
you,''' Ventura said Sunday on ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura added that Schwarzenegger is a brilliant and self-made  
man ``who could be good at anything he desires to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But again, my personal advice to him as his friend, I would  
tell him not to do it,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarzenegger said during an interview in the November issue of  
Talk magazine that he had thought ``many times'' about running for 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the California governorship, which is up for grabs in  
three years, would be ``the best thing because you can manage your 
state.'' Schwarzenegger's spokeswoman said last week that he wasn't 
thinking of running for office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian-born Schwarzenegger and Ventura filmed the movie  
``Predator'' together and have been friends for more than a decade.

<HEADLINE> Controversy Over Salt Company Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL VIZCAINO BIOSPHERE RESERVE, Mexico (AP) -- The Japanese need  
more salt than any nation on Earth. The Baja California peninsula 
of northern Mexico has the lagoons, sunshine and wind conditions 
needed to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
	But the area where a Japanese firm operates the world's largest  
salt evaporation plant -- and where they are planning to build 
another $150 million plant -- is also Latin America's largest 
biosphere reserve and the winter refuge of the gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan has shocked many environmentalist groups in the United  
States and Mexico, raised red flags at the office of Mexico's 
environmental prosecutor, and caused dismay among the population of 
Punta Abreojos, near the proposed new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're afraid we won't be able to make a living anymore,'' said  
Antonio Zuniga, secretary-general of the Punta Abreojos fishing 
cooperative, which provides the community of 1,000 people with 
electricity and drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're planning to build a dock where we do most of our  
fishing, and the discharges of brine on the open sea could kill the 
lobsters, fish, shrimp, abalone and oysters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exportadora de Sal, known as ESSA, is outgrowing its factory in  
the Ojo de Liebre lagoon just south of the city of Guerrero Negro, 
in the middle of the peninsula that stretches south from 
California. Its new plant would be built along a pristine lagoon 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes salt by evaporating seawater in salt flats  
near the ocean. Brine -- extremely salty water -- is a byproduct. 
Marine animals can be affected by sudden changes in the salinity of 
ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 environmental audit disclosed 298 deficiencies in the  
plant, ranging from unauthorized discharges of brine to the dumping 
of almost 300 industrial batteries in the lagoon. Rather than fine 
the company, authorities decided to give ESSA the chance to clean 
up its act. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the expansion plan has become a public-relations nightmare  
for ESSA, a joint venture between Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. and the 
Mexican Commerce Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups have launched an international campaign to  
prevent the expansion. In July, 34 of the world's most 
distinguished scientists signed an open letter protesting the 
expansion plans that appeared in several newspapers across the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council is leading  
a letter-writing campaign to Mitsubishi Chairman Hiroaki Yano and 
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. Writes Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a 
senior NRDC attorney: ``If Mitsubishi has its way, the whales of 
San Ignacio may soon return to their last unspoiled breeding 
grounds only to find an industrial wasteland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA claims the project would not pose a danger to marine  
wildlife and would provide a much-needed boost to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalist groups say the company is pressuring the  
government into approving the project and point to a possible 
conflict of interest: The Mexican government, which is responsible 
for enforcing environmental laws, owns 51 percent of ESSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Azuela, Mexico's environmental prosecutor, denied any  
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can categorically state that during the administration of  
President Ernesto Zedillo, environmental authorities have never 
been pressured into not imposing a fine, or imposing a lesser 
fine,'' Azuela said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government rejected the expansion project in 1995, but later  
decided to let the company appeal. ESSA is now working on an 
environmental impact study it says will prove the project is safe 
to the delicate environment of the biosphere reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA has said it will scrap the project if Mexico's  
environmental authorities find it poses a danger to the biosphere 
reserve, which UNESCO declared a World Heritage Site in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't want to be involved here or anyplace else  
in a project that would have environmental danger,'' said James E. 
Brumm, executive vice president for Mitsubishi International. 
``It's not something that we want to be known for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brumm said Mitsubishi and the Mexican government are in close  
agreement on developing the expansion project. Commerce Ministry 
officials declined to comment on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups are concerned with the possible effects on  
the gray whale, which migrates every year from the Arctic waters of 
the Bering Sea to mate and give birth in the warm waters of the 
peninsula. The spectacle draws hundreds of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine wildlife experts hired by ESSA to work on the  
environmental impact study have expressed doubts as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton D. Winant, a professor at the Scripps Institution of  
Oceanography in San Diego, said he would have no qualms about the 
project -- were it not located at a World Heritage Site. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Scripps professor and ESSA consultant, Paul Dayton, said  
the increased ship traffic represented a risk that could lead to 
the deaths of some whales. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is also under review by a congressional committee,  
members of which are skeptical about its long-term impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is it that the government previously said the project was  
illegal and is now reconsidering ESSA's proposal?'' congressman 
Jorge Gonzalez of the Green Party said at a recent hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA's operations and future expansion plans have also drawn  
concern from UNESCO. A team of UNESCO representatives made a 
three-day trip to the biosphere reserve in August to gauge the 
environmental impact of the salt plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation, which will present its conclusions in November,  
could declare the area an endangered World Heritage Site, an act 
which would put more pressure on the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of growing public pressure, ESSA has announced it  
has modified its project to minimize the possibility of 
environmental damage. But that's hardly any relief to the community 
of Punta Abreojos. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've made some changes, but it doesn't change the fact that  
it's going to affect the environment,'' Zuniga said. ``It could 
really affect our livelihood, and we're scared, because the damage 
it can cause would outweight any economic benefits.''

<HEADLINE> Mother Launches Anti-Harassment Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The mother of Matthew Shepard, the gay college  
student who was beaten and left for dead, launched a public service 
announcement Sunday aimed at curbing anti-gay taunting. 
</P>
<P>
	It begins airing this month on MTV.  
</P>
<P>
	In the announcement, high school boys in a locker room shout  
anti-gay insults. Then Judy Shepard says: ``The next time you use 
words like these, think about what they really mean.'' A photo of 
her son flashes on the screen with the dates 1976-1998. Then the 
words ``Murdered'' and ``Hate'' are followed by a shot of Mrs. 
Shepard with her head bowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't let there be a next time,'' she says quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	Shepard died Oct. 12, 1998, days after he was beaten unconscious  
and tied to a ranch fence outside Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men were accused of luring the 21-year-old student out of a  
bar, driving him to a remote prairie and then robbing and 
pistol-whipping him. Russell Arthur Henderson, 21, pleaded guilty 
and was sentenced to life in prison. Aaron James McKinney, 22, is 
scheduled to go on trial Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard's public service announcement is designed to get  
viewers to ``think maybe there is a connection between their casual 
use of words like `faggot' and `homo' and a culture of intolerance 
that sometimes manifests itself in anti-gay violence,'' said Jim 
Anderson, spokesman for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of the music network's ``Take a Stand Against  
Violence'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard spoke Sunday to about 600 students and educators  
who attended GSLEN's three-day conference in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	She also accepted the group's Pathfinder award for her efforts  
to end anti-gay harassment and bias in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard's efforts helped persuade California legislators to  
outlaw the harassment of gay students and teachers in public 
schools. The legislation was signed by Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- At 65, Clive Davis is the man with the Midas  
touch in America's music scene and an ear for what kids want to 
hear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arista Records president invested millions in hip-hop in the  
early '90s, and claims chart-topper Puffy Daddy among his proteges. 
On the folk-pop front, Sarah McLachlan's album ``Surfacing'' has 
sold 7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When Davis took a chance on 1970s guitarist Carlos Santana,  
Santana's new album ``Supernatural'' hit the Top 5. 
</P>
<P>
	And in June, Arista recorded it's most profitable year -- $425  
million in sales and 69 gold or platinum albums. 
</P>
<P>
	``An artist has to be able to fulfill in person the magic on a  
record,'' Davis told Time magazine in this week's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' latest addition to Arista: the Artist formerly known as  
Prince. The Artist's new album debuts next month.

<HEADLINE> China To Deregulate Silver Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- In preparation for eventually loosening controls  
on its gold market, China plans to deregulate its silver market by 
the beginning of next year, the official newspaper China Daily's 
Business Weekly reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central government has always banned free trading in gold,  
silver and other precious metals, keeping it under the control of 
the country's de facto central bank, the People's Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
	Controls on silver trading will be lifted gradually, with just a  
few domestic traders allowed access once a nonferrous metals 
wholesale market opens for business in Shanghai on Jan. 1, 2000, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spot silver transactions will be made only in local currency, it  
added. A futures market will follow two or three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar plan to develop a gold market is likely to follow, the  
report cited Liu Shan'an, deputy director of the Gold Economic 
Development Research Center, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	After decades of scarcity China now has a silver surplus. The  
government opened a market in silver jewelry trading in 1996 to 
help boost demand. It will continue to purchase silver from 
producers until the end of this year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that silver exports would remain under central bank  
control and that the bank planned to begin setting a quota on such 
exports next year.

<HEADLINE> Record Year for Home Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Home runs sailed over fences at a record pace  
this year, even though Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa didn't set any 
individual marks. 
</P>
<P>
	With only Sunday's rain-delayed Cincinnati at Milwaukee game  
remaining, there were 5,524 homers in 2,426 games, a record average 
of 2.28 and up from 2.05 last year. The previous high of 2.19 was 
set in 1996, when 4,962 homers were hit in 2,227 games. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire beat Sosa 65-63 in the individual home-run race, the  
third- and fourth-highest single-season totals behind McGwire's 70 
and Sosa's 66 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty proud of myself as far as how I overcame a lot of  
things and to put up the numbers I put up this year,'' McGwire 
said. ``It just goes to show you the mind is a lot stronger than 
people think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head matchup, each homered on the regular-season's  
final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a happy man, not disappointed,'' Sosa said. ``I had a  
great year. For me, that's something to be happy about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. won his third straight AL home-run  
title and fourth overall, beating Rafael Palmeiro of Texas 48-47. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen players hit 40 or more homers, matching last year's  
total but still four short of the record set in 1996. A record 45 
players hit 30 or more homers, two more than the previous high set 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL batting average rose six points to .268, its highest  
since 1939, when it was .272. The AL average rose four points to 
.275 -- two points below its 1996 figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Larry Walker won his second straight National League  
batting championship. Walker, who started only 111 games because of 
injuries, hit .379, the highest NL average for a full season since 
Arky Vaughan hit .385 for Pittsburgh in 1935. Tony Gwynn hit .394 
in the strike-shortened 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's 42-point victory over Arizona's Luis Gonzalez was the  
biggest in the NL since 1948, when Stan Musial hit .376 and 
finished 43 points ahead of Richie Ashburn. Walker hit .461 with 26 
homers and 70 RBIs in 66 games at Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good, I guess. In the same breath, it's a bad thing,''  
Walker said. ``It's all right to have a batting title, then keep 
playing. But to win the batting title and go home, it doesn't mean 
as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Nomar Garciaparra won his first AL batting title,  
hitting .357 to finish eight points higher than New York's Derek 
Jeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra has a sore right wrist and hasn't played since  
Thursday, but says he'll be ready for Boston's playoffs opener 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice but it hasn't really sunk in yet. I don't think  
maybe it'll sink in until after everything is all over,'' 
Garciaparra said. '' Myself and the team are focused on what's to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's Manny Ramirez had 165 RBIs, the highest total in the  
major leagues since Jimmie Foxx had 175 for Boston in 1938 and 
matching the 12th-highest total ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-nine players had 100 or more RBIs, nine more than the  
previous record, also set in '96. McGwire led the NL with 147 RBIs, 
matching his 1998 total and became the first player to play a full 
season and finish with more RBIs than hits (145). 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland scored 1,009 runs, the most in the majors since Boston  
scored 1,027 in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Craig Biggio hit its 56th double Sunday, the highest  
in the majors since Detroit's George Kell had 56 in 1950 and most 
in the NL since Joe Medwick had 56 for St. Louis in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Randy Johnson led the majors in strikeouts for the  
sixth time, fanning 364, the fourth-highest season total ever. He 
struck out 10 or more 23 times, matching the record Nolan Ryan set 
with the California Angels in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Pedro Martinez won his first AL strikeout title with  
313 and won his first AL ERA title at 2.07 -- he won the NL ERA 
title two years ago for Montreal. Martinez also led the major 
leagues in wins, going 23-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Mike Hampton had the most victories in the NL, beating  
Los Angeles on Sunday to finish 22-4, one win ahead of teammate 
Jose Lima. Johnson won the NL ERA title at 2.48. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Mariano Rivera led the AL with 45 saves and  
Montreal's Ugueth Urbina led the NL with 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Tony Womack won his third straight NL steals title,  
swiping 72, and Seattle's Brian Hunter won the AL title with 44 -- 
the fewest for an AL champion since Baltimore Luis Aparicio won 
with 40 in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero had 19 errors, matching the  
post-World War II high for outfielders of 19, by Lou Brock (1966) 
and Chili Davis (1988). After making nine errors in April, Guerrero 
avoided becoming the first outfielder to reach 20 since Bob Johnson 
of the 1935 Philadelphia Athletics.
