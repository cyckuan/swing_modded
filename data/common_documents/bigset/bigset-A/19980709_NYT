COLUMN: CHARTER HEARING ADDS INSULT TO REVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roughly three hours into Tuesday night's Charter
revision hearing, Joe Blinstrub approached the microphone to sum up
how most of the audience clearly felt about the distinguished panel
of civic leaders on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like everyone to join me in laughing at the commission,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha, ha, ha!'' the crowd obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the purpose of Tuesday's hearing, in the auditorium
of Murry Bergtraum High School in lower Manhattan, was to solicit
ideas from concerned citizens on changing the City Charter. Should
New York hold nonpartisan elections? Should its City Council
members serve full time? Is campaign finance reform necessary?
</P>
<P>
   But no one was biting. The crowd in the auditorium had not
assembled to weigh in on the Charter but to trash the Charter
Revision Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your participation on this commission justly earns you our
disrespect,'' said Michael Farrin, who identified himself as a
community activist.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lederman, by his own account SoHo's most frequently
arrested street artist, said: ``I would like to offer my
condolences to this distinguished panel. You do a great deal of
damage to your own reputations by participating in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Meyers, director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition,
said, ``You can only do one thing honorable and that is resign: Do
not delay!'' The mayor ``expects you to roll over,'' he said.
``Well, bowwow.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's ordeal began at 6:30 p.m. and it was not until
after 10 p.m. that its many well-wishers had used up their allotted
three minutes at the microphone. About 50 people spoke, and with
the exception of one councilman, Andrew Eristoff, and a few
speakers who could only be described as cranks, it was essentially
one continuous assault on the panel's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's 12 appointees had shown up
for the hearing and they sat through it all impassively, never
posing a single question, never challenging a single statement and,
at least as far as this columnist could discern, never taking a
single note.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it makes sense that the commission did not hear much
about actual Charter revision, since, after all, this Charter
Revision Commission was never actually about revising the Charter.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mayor himself made no secret of its members'
resemblance to those little plastic peanuts that you pack glass in.
When he appointed them back in May, he all but openly said that
they were just there to come up with something _ anything, really _
to fill up space on the November ballot and prevent a referendum on
building a new Yankee Stadium. As everyone who cares about such
matters by now knows, this is the first Charter Revision Commission
in city history whose real subject is baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, the commission has not done much to
obscure the absurdity of its situation or encourage a more
respectful attitude by the public. Just this Monday, after holding
its first public hearing, on Staten Island, its chairman, Peter
Powers, a former deputy mayor, issued a statement suddenly altering
its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   No, the commission would not, as it had earlier promised,
consider such sweeping changes as eliminating the public advocate's
office and the Independent Budget Office. There just wasn't enough
time, Powers explained, before the fall deadline for issuing
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the time-pressed commission would consider a series of
even more far-reaching measures, like introducing nonpartisan
elections and eliminating outside employment for City Council
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned much,'' Powers asserted somewhat implausibly,
``and have a better sense of what can be attained during this
initial round of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break in Tuesday's hearing occasioned by a
stenographer's trip to the bathroom, Paul Crotty, the commission's
vice chairman, talked to reporters out in the hall. He brushed
aside concerns that two months was not enough time to come up with
well-considered proposals and, indirectly at least, compared the
commission's work to that of the Founding Fathers. The U.S.
Constitution, too, he said, was the work of a single summer.
</P>
<P>
   Crotty also played down the long line of speakers back in the
auditorium who were still waiting for a turn to insult him. ``There
is an awful lot of this,'' he said, ``that is anti-Giuliani
diatribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had to admit that he was not having fun yet. ``I
don't,'' he acknowledged, ``particularly enjoy the abuse.''

CROATIA'S WORLD CUP RUN STIRS N.Y. IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The temperature inside Scorpio, a bar in Astoria,
Queens, owned by Croatian immigrants, was easily 20 degrees hotter
than the outside Wednesday afternoon, despite the air-conditioning
at full blast. It was not hard to see why.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people were jammed into every nook and cranny of
the European-style coffee bar, which serves cappuccino along with
whiskey and vodka. Every pair of eyes was focused on the
wide-screen television at the front of the bar as patrons watched
their beloved Croatian soccer team play in the semifinals of the
World Cup against France.
</P>
<P>
   The match held special significance for the Croatian immigrants
who started filling the bar on Broadway in Astoria hours before the
match began. This was Croatia's debut at the World Cup, and few had
expected the team to advance so far in its first appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so small a country,'' said Edwin Matesic, an owner of
Scorpio, which opened last year. ``People always thought, `What can
they do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Even the disappointing outcome of the match _ a 2-1 loss that
ended Croatia's charmed streak in the tournament _ did not dampen
the Croats' pride. Matesic and many patrons said the World Cup
semifinal was proof that their tiny nation of 4 million, which
broke from Yugoslavia in a bloody civil war seven years ago, had
finally come into its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are free and people can't look down on us anymore,''
Matesic said. ``And with this World Cup, more people in the world
will know about us.''
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 100,000 people of Croatian heritage in
the New York area, according to Dr. Ruzica Vuskovic, a Queens
physician who is a co-director of the Croatian Institute. Most are
in Astoria and Long Island City, but increasing numbers, especially
of second-generation Croats, are moving to suburbs on Long Island
and in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Croats tend to keep a low profile _ Vuskovic said that a
surprisingly large number of Italian restaurants in the city are
actually run by Croats _ but they have been drawn together by the
World Cup contests, and proudly flaunted their heritage as their
team advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday's stunning victory over powerful Germany was an
especially proud and poignant moment. ``It was the first time in 10
years that I felt like I was home,'' said Vuskovic, who watched
Saturday's match at Scorpio and also managed to slip out of work
early Wednesday to catch the second half of the match at home.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police officers lined Broadway on Wednesday outside
Scorpio and Cafi Valentino, another popular Croatian bar down the
street, to avoid a repeat of the uproar that broke out after the
victory Saturday. A few hundred soccer fans rushed onto the street
and stopped traffic with spirited flag-waving and hearty singing
and shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people can sometimes get a little bit vicious after a
game,'' said Tom Smodlaka, a supervisor for a Manhattan painting
company who took the day off to watch the match. ``But mostly,
we're just happy that after so much trouble in our country that
finally it's time for some beautiful things to happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one stopped traffic when the match Wednesday ended in defeat,
but many fans still marched out of Scorpio to wave the Croatian
flag on Broadway. Some then headed home, while others went back
into the bar to continue to celebrate the semifinal appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We represented every small country in the world,'' said Tom
Voloder, a mechanical engineer from Astoria who had painted his
face with the red and white checkerboard insignia of the Croatian
flag. ``It was a good run and it will be better in 2002. It's a
proud moment for Croatia and for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Matesic spent the day toting a video camera around to capture
the enthusiasm and the booming business the bar was doing. ``My
parents are going to cry when they see the video, to see how good
things are going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matesic, 27, was born in the United States, but returned to
Croatia with his parents when he was 6. He came back alone and
settled in Astoria when he was 18. Both he and his partner, Renato
Miocic, worked as busboys and waiters at restaurants in Manhattan
until they saved up enough money to open Scorpio, an elegant little
bar with exposed brick walls and framed photographs of Croatian
cities.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the match a young man shouted at Miocic that
he should remove some of the furniture in the back so that more
people could squeeze in. Miocic, 33, just nodded. ``What am I
supposed to do?'' he shrugged. ``I can't make the place bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Miocic, like most Croatian immigrants and most soccer followers
around the globe, never expected the Croatian team to get this far
in the World Cup, much less to beat Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected they would get past the first round, but nobody
expected this,'' he said. ``I have never been so excited as now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the D &AMP; F Italian Deli, next door to the Scorpio bar, the
television was also tuned to the soccer match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, our team didn't make it, so you got to cheer for
somebody,'' said Carmelo Perrone, the deli's manager.

AS GATE RISES, STEINBRENNER SOFTENS ON BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Yankees winning games at a historic pace and
drawing fans to Yankee Stadium at a record rate, George
Steinbrenner said Wednesday that gains in attendance could lead to
discussions about keeping the team in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Tampa, Fla., Steinbrenner said that
if the Yankees draw 3 million fans this season and could be
guaranteed similar attendance in the future, he would be willing to
talk about staying in Yankee Stadium after the team's lease expires
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are on pace to draw a franchise-best 2.83 million
fans this season; the franchise record was 2.63 million in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It was a startling concession from Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner, who has complained for almost a decade that he
cannot make money because of traffic and safety concerns in the
Bronx and a dearth of luxury boxes at 75-year-old Yankee Stadium.
With the support of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, he has openly
campaigned for a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the 3 million and then we'll talk about the Bronx after the
season,'' Steinbrenner said. ``That isn't getting me where I want
to be, but maybe it would be worth talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   While Steinbrenner was not specific about what Bronx officials
could do to guarantee 3 million fans, he issued a challenge to
Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer to find a way to make it
worth his while to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Fernando Ferrer want to guarantee we'll get 3 million?''
he said. ``Tell them to put their money where their mouth is. If he
can guarantee we'll get 3 million, then I'll sit down and talk
about the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number still doesn't get me where I need to be, but he
threw that figure out, so I'm calling his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While Steinbrenner offered, for the first time, a starting point
for discussions about keeping the team in the Bronx, any talks
would surely include additional parking, easing the traffic
congestion around the stadium and finding a way to increase the
number of luxury boxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees, who begin the second half of the season Thursday
night in St. Petersburg with a stunning 61-20 record, have
attracted 1,362,987 fans in 39 home dates, an average of 34,948 per
game.
</P>
<P>
   They would have to average 38,977 fans in their final 42 home
dates to exceed 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer, whose office issued a news release this week which
focused on the pursuit of the 3 million mark, was excited about the
new expression of interest in remaining in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yankees have never reached the 3 million mark,
which has long been considered a sort of magic number in
discussions of attendance, the Mets did it in 1987 and 1988 after
winning a World Series championship in 1986. The Toronto Blue Jays
drew 4 million in 1991, 1992 and 1993, and the Colorado Rockies set
the major league record of 4.48 million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly willing to accept that challenge,'' said Ferrer.
``The money is there. Let's build the Metro North station so more
fans can come to the games. Let's promote the players. Let's build
up the Bronx instead of trying to suppress attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   While issuing his challenge, Steinbrenner also scoffed at the
Yankees' 9 percent increase in attendance over last year at this
time, pointing out that they are still ninth out of the 14 American
League teams in attendance. He continued to claim that fans
hesitate to attend night games at the Stadium because of the
``perception'' that it is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all this talk about record numbers,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``I think we'll do 2.6. It's going to have to be very good
just to get us to 2.6, whereas Cleveland and Baltimore will be
about 4 million. The perception, right or wrong, is that people
don't want to come to the Bronx at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer, pointing out that the Stadium is one of the safest
places in New York when the Yankees are playing because of the
heightened police presence there, said, ``The only crime at Yankee
Stadium would be taking them to Manhattan and spending over a
billion dollars to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance data can be used to bolster both sides of the debate.
Those in favor of keeping the Yankees in the Bronx argue that this
season's increase proves that a winning team can thrive in the
Bronx. Provide a dominating club, they argue, and fans will pour
through the turnstiles. If the current facility is improved, and a
new Metro North terminal in the Bronx gives better access,
supporters say, then the figures will increase more.
</P>
<P>
   But those in favor of relocating the Yankees, like Steinbrenner
and Giuliani, can argue that attendance would be even higher if the
games were being played in Manhattan, and that this season is an
aberration because the Yankees have played exceptionally well. Give
the fans a new stadium along the lines of Baltimore's Camden Yards
or Cleveland's Jacobs Field, preferably with a retractable roof, in
a location friendlier to mass transit and they will pour through
the turnstiles. In that case, supporters of a Manhattan stadium
say, the team would not have to win 75 percent of its games to
attract fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location, location, location,'' Steinbrenner said. ``We'd sell
out every night if we played in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner provided statistics that Yankee officials had
compiled documenting the average attendance of five teams with
recently built stadiums, for the 10 years before they moved and the
years since. The teams had all experienced a tremendous spurt in
attendance entering this season, he said, from 41 percent for the
Chicago White Sox to 43 percent for the Texas Rangers, 62 percent
for the Baltimore Orioles, 75 for the Toronto Blue Jays 135 percent
for the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to compete with Cleveland for an American League
Championship and I was competing with Baltimore for the division,''
said Steinbrenner. ``How do I compete when they draw 15,000 to
20,000 more fans a game?''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Yankees have the wealthiest cable television
contract in history for a sports franchise at more than $500
million, Steinbrenner said, ``I also have a payroll that is
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if the fans remain enamored by the
Yankees' pursuit of greatness during the regular season. While the
Yankees are on pace to set a major league record with 122
victories, how appealing will it be to witness No. 79 on a sunny
afternoon in August if beaches and barbecues beckon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they would come,'' Steinbrenner said. ``They've wanted
winners in this city a long time. Look at how the Knicks and the
Rangers draw. They're sold out every game. Location, location,
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer blasted the notion of a potential fall in interest this
summer, saying: ``I don't see any early indication of that. Fourth
of July weekend, when everybody is doing something else, Yankee
attendance was great. That argument goes out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner could use the heftier attendance figures to argue
that this is as impressive as it will get, and that the numbers
actually provide a reason for the Yankees to move. He could say
that 3 million fans is commendable, but that it occurred in a
once-in-a-lifetime season and is still less than a handful of other
teams have drawn. Or, Steinbrenner could see 3 million and then,
surprisingly, see the Bronx in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do 3 million,'' Steinbrenner said several times. ``Say,
`George, we're going to do this for you.' I'm doing my part. Let's
see them do their part. Don't come in with 2.6. It's got to be 3
million.''

EDITORIAL: THE SECRET SERVICE AND THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   In a firm, correct decision, a federal appeals court in
Washington has rejected the Clinton administration's creative
concoction of a new ``protective function privilege'' to prevent
Secret Service officials from testifying before a grand jury in the
Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is pondering whether to pursue an appeal. The
nation and the presidency would be better served if the White House
took its unanimous legal defeat by a three-judge panel as a message
to switch from the obstructionist mode that has needlessly
prolonged Kenneth Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had argued for a broad privilege allowing
agents to avoid testimony in criminal inquiries unless they
recognized a president's actions as criminal at the time they
witnessed or heard about them. In dismissing the privilege claim,
the appeals court recognized the public interest in protecting the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But, echoing the conclusion reached by the lower court, the
appellate judges found the concern that a president would be
inclined to deny his agents adequate proximity to be unlikely in
light of the president's ``profound personal interest in being well
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the court noted that the privilege being asserted
would have the greatest effect when the president was at the White
House or in private meetings, not in public situations when the
greatest threat to his safety arises.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship of trust between the president and his closest
guards is important, and prosecutors should not interfere with it
absent a pressing law enforcement need. But the idea of a broad
Secret Service privilege cuts against the rule of law. So does the
continued lack of cooperation by the White House.

BROADCAST INDUSTRY DRAWS FIRE OVER DIGITAL TV
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only three months before the scheduled rollout of
digital television, members of the Senate Commerce Committee
lambasted the broadcast industry, cable companies and television
manufacturers Wednesday for failing to cooperate on crucial
technical and political issues that threaten a smooth transition to
high-definition TV.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., erupted in
anger and frustration at a hearing called to measure progress in
moving American industries and consumers to digital TV.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who opposed the agreement that started digital
television, reminded broadcasters that the government had given
them what he estimated were billions of dollars' worth of new
broadcast frequencies for high-definition television; in return,
the industry had promised a smooth transition that would enable
them to return their analog channels to the government for resale
by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   That deadline now seems unlikely, broadcasters told senators
Wednesday, because some key technical standards remain unresolved
and because cable operators have refused to guarantee that they
will carry digital broadcasts by local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Th second issue will be taken up on Thursday by the Federal
Communications Commission, which is expected to start the public
comment process that will help it write so-called must-carry rules
requiring cable operators to carry local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators expressed dismay at the price of the new digital
sets, which are expected to go on sale in November. Despite price
tags of between $7,000 and $10,000, they will not be able to pick
up digital cable broadcasts because the cable industry still has
not developed a standard for carrying digital signals.

FRANCE REACHES GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ France finally figured out how to score
goals, although the source of its new-found offense was as big a
surprise as the fact that one had been found.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring just once in its previous two games, the French
registered the biggest triumph in its soccer history, claiming a
spot opposite Brazil in the World Cup final when defender Lilian
Thuram scored twice in a 2-1 victory over Croatia. It will be
France's first appearance in a World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilian saved us,'' said France coach Aime Jacquet. ``It's an
excellent reward for all the work he's put in.... I don't think we
had a wonderful game, but we really played our hearts out. That's
what made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Thuram's defensive prowess and ability to run the wing has been
well-documented, but his nose for the net has been, say, clogged.
He had not scored in 38 previous appearances for Les Bleus.
</P>
<P>
   France's first-half dominance had led to few chances and Croatia
had jumped ahead seconds into the second half on Davor Suker's
fifth World Cup goal. There has rarely been a safer lead, given
France's finishing touch of late. Then Thuram took over.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute after Suker's goal, the Guadaloupe-born right
back stripped Zvonimir Boban of the ball just outside Croatia's
box. He played a give-and-go with Youri Djorkaeff, beating
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic from 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
   His second, in the 69th minute, was more brilliant than the
first. He played the ball from the right wing into Thierry Henry,
whose return pass lacked precision and pace.
</P>
<P>
   That left Croatian defender Robert Jarni with possession, except
he never got to it. As the ball arrived, Thuram stuck his foot
between Jarni's legs and nudged it away. He strided toward the ball
about 22 yards from the net, still out on the right and ripped it
with his left foot past a diving Ladic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost concentration,'' admitted Miroslav Blazevic, Croatia's
coach. ``We weren't careful enough; we weren't attentive enough. We
felt at the time that France was failing, that it lacked strength.
But as so often happens in football, when you score and your
opponent scores immediately afterward, it gives them the strength
to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The triumph, which wasn't secure until goalkeeper Fabien Barthez
parried a deflected Goran Vlaovic shot over his crossbar in the
closing seconds, sparked celebration throughout France. President
Jacques Chirac called it ``truly the most wonderful day in French
sports history.''
</P>
<P>
   It came with a heavy price. Laurent Blanc, sweeper
extraordinaire and scorer of the ``golden goal'' that beat Paraguay
in the second round, was red-carded. He was dismissed in the 74th
minute following an altercation in the Croatian box as Zinedine
Zidane prepared to send in a free kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a catastrophe for the team, but it is for me,'' Blanc
said. ``I'm the only one who's punished and that's good. The whole
team would have been punished if we had lost the match because of
me being sent off. It would have been awful. I would have felt
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanc's departure enabled the Croats, the Cup's Cinderella team,
to attack, something they hadn't done aside from Suker's strike,
which required a perfect Aljosa Asanovic chip and blown offsides
trap by France. But the French defense _ led by Thuram, Marcel
Desailly and Franck Lebouef filling in for Blanc _ limited them to
the just two solid chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``France's victory was deserved,'' Blazevic conceded, ``but I
can't help but feel we could have been there ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And so now the French, losers in three previous World Cup
semifinals, get a shot at mighty Brazil, the reigning champion
seeking a fifth crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the masters of world football... the greatest team in
this World Cup,'' Jacquet praised. ``They are able to dominate
opponents almost at will. But France is at home and that's a
wonderful opportunity. It's a challenge I think we can rise to.''

ABORTION DOCTOR SURPRISED WITH DELIVERY OF 37-WEEK-OLD BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINA LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Police are investigating a Phoenix abortion clinic
where a doctor delivered a full-term baby he had intended to abort.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise birth occurred after an examination by clinic
personnel showed the baby was only in its 23rd week, police said,
and the doctor prepared to abort the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he ended up delivering a 37-week-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley said Wednesday
they had not yet determined whether any crime had been committed in
connection with the incident June 30 at the A-Z Women's Center on
East McDowell Road in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're going to look at this,'' Romley said. ``We
will also do research on the law and reserve judgment until the
investigation is complete.``
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police Sgt. Mike Torres said detectives are still
investigating, but, ``at this point, it doesn't appear anybody will
be charged with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the A-Z Women's Center were not returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's mother is a 17-year-old woman who came to the clinic
June 29 after a home pregnancy test turned up positive, police
said. Police did not reveal her identity.
</P>
<P>
   An ultrasound examination performed at the clinic showed her to
be 23.6 weeks along in her pregnancy; the clinic will abort fetuses
up to 24 weeks, police said.
</P>
<P>
   During the abortion procedure the next day, police said, Dr.
John Biskind realized the fetus was full-term, and delivered a
6-pound, 2-ounce girl. The newborn was taken across the street to
Good Samaritan Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The child, who suffered a skull fracture and two deep
lacerations, will be adopted by a Texas couple, Torres said. She
shows no signs of brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind, who has been licensed in Arizona since 1981, has been
investigated in the past. In 1996, he was censured by the state
Board of Medical Examiners for ``gross neglect/conduct harmful to
patients or the public,'' according to board records.
</P>
<P>
   Another quality-of-care complaint is pending with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the medical community expressed shock Tuesday after
learning of the birth at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing a 37-week gestation and confusing it with a 23-week
pregnancy is unacceptable,'' said Dr. Brian Finkel of the Metro
Phoenix Women's Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of abortion nightmare that anti-abortionists
. . . would like to banter about the press and paint all of us with
this big, broad brush.``
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carolyn Gerster, chairwoman for AZ Right to Life, said,
``Sounds like a grave error was made in estimation of the size.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an ultrasound, there shouldn't be that kind of
discrepancy.``
</P>
<P>
   Gerster said the average weight for a child at 24 weeks is about
2pounds. At 36 weeks, a baby is usually 6{ pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Howard, CEO of Planned Parenthood, said he had never heard
of a case such as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood that something like this could happen is
incredibly small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Howard said this incident may be unusual simply because
most women seeking abortions do so soon after discovering they are
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over 90 percent (of abortions) take place in the first
trimester,'' he said. ``The vast majority wouldn't even be
approaching this point.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Howard said ultrasound techniques are becoming
``increasingly precise,'' the results depend on circumstances. For
example, if a fetus is lying in a certain position, it could skew
the results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with all health care, it's an imprecise science,'' Howard
said. &QL;

SEMON KNUDSEN, 85, PROMINENT AUTO EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.Y., Ohio)   (bl)  
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Semon Knudsen, who had been a high-ranking executive at General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and White Motor Corp., died July 6 at
William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., who was invariably called
by his nickname, Bunkie, grew up in the auto-saturated atmosphere
of Detroit and at General Motors, where his father, William
Knudsen, was named president in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen was, in Detroit parlance, a ``car guy,'' an executive
who pays more attention to developing popular car models than to
finances or administration. At the age of 14, he was already
pressing his father for a car, even though he was still too young
to drive. His father responded by giving him a car _ in hundreds of
pieces, which he assembled himself.
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen's close relationship with his father is the source of
his nickname, according to the family. It derives from a World War
I term for bunk mate or close friend.
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen attended private schools in the Detroit area and went to
Dartmouth College for a year before transferring to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study engineering. After
graduation in 1936, he declined to go to work at GM, taking a job
at an unaffiliated machine shop.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he accepted the inevitable and went to work
for the Pontiac division of GM as chief inspector. But he was
interested in production, and soon became involved in processing
parts and setting up assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   When the car companies retooled their plants to produce arms for
World War II, Knudsen became assistant chief inspector of gun
operations at Pontiac. (Meanwhile, William Knudsen had resigned as
president of GM to direct industrial production efforts for the
duration of the war.)
</P>
<P>
   It was during the war that the younger Knudsen came to the
attention of top GM executives who began to see him less as the
former president's son and more as a talented production engineer.
Among other things, he developed highly technical testing equipment
for air-dropped torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he was given increasingly senior positions at the
Allison and Detroit Diesel engine divisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 he was named vice president and general manager of the
Pontiac division at the unusually young age of 44. The division had
a reputation for producing well-engineered, but unexciting, cars.
He changed the styling of the cars, even removing the ``silver
streak'' chrome trim from the center of the hood and trunk that had
been a Pontiac trademark since 1935.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Pontiac in races to generate some excitement for the
brand and succeeded in raising sales for the division from sixth
place to third.
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen employed some of the same tactics when he was named to
manage GM's largest division, Chevrolet, in 1961. He emphasized the
powerful Super Sport versions of the Chevrolet Impala, Chevelle and
Camaro models and Nascar stock car racing, in which racing engines
and other components are built within standard auto bodies so
spectators can link race winners to showroom models.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet set a sales record by 1965, and Knudsen was appointed
a group vice president for all Canadian and overseas operations.
All domestic nonautomotive operations were later added to his
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he was named an executive vice president with broad
responsibilities for overseas and domestic nonautomotive operations
and reported directly to the chairman. But any dreams he may have
had about following his father as president of the company were
dashed when another executive vice president, Edward Cole, was
chosen instead.
</P>
<P>
   He let it be known that he was thinking of resigning from GM,
and shortly thereafter, Henry Ford II came calling.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor, evidently thought his company
could emulate GM's success by installing a GM executive as his
chief aide. There was even a historical precedent: Knudsen's father
had worked for the first Henry Ford as his production chief until
being dismissed in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen was named president of Ford in February 1968,
temporarily thwarting the ambitions of Lee Iacocca, then a vice
president at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Knudsen arrived at Ford without any internal allies and was
regarded by Ford veterans as an interloper. As a result, his
attempts to make his mark at Ford by restyling new models had
little success.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1984 autobiography, ``Iacocca,'' Iacocca described the
scene at Ford headquarters in Dearborn: ``As a leader, Bunkie
Knudsen had little impact on the company. Among other things, he
failed to bring over any of his top people from GM to help him put
his plans into operation. Nobody at Ford felt much loyalty to
Knudsen, so he was without a power base. As a result he found
himself alone in an alien atmosphere, never really accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories from inside the auto industry at that time had Knudsen
touring Ford's design studios and ordering styling changes, which
were quickly reversed in subsequent visits by executives loyal to
Iacocca. Knudsen was president of Ford for 19 months, until Ford
dismissed him in September 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Iacocca, who went on to become president of Ford and chairman of
Chrysler Corp., said one of Knudsen's transgressions was walking
into Henry Ford's office without knocking on the door.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Ford Motor, Knudsen was named chairman of White
Motor in 1971, a manufacturer of heavy trucks that was based in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived as deregulation was beginning to shake up the
trucking industry and orders for new trucks were scarce. He led the
company through several financial crises before retiring in 1980.
The company filed for bankruptcy later that year, and its heavy
truck operations were sold to Volvo AB.
</P>
<P>
   Knudson was born on Oct. 2, 1912, in Buffalo, N.Y., but spent
most of his early years in the Detroit area. He was married to the
former Frances Anne McConnell for 58 years until her death in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three daughters, Judith Christie and Lisa
Flint of Birmingham, Mich., and Kristina Gregg of Vancouver,
British Columbia; a son, K. Peter, of Harbor Springs, Mich.; two
sisters, Martha McKenney of Bloomfield Hills, and Clara VanderKloot
of Old Lyme, Conn.; 12 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.  &QL;

Its small subject _ the hut _ defines the field of architecture
like a cricket in the grass. Hand-built and homemade, usually
wooden, scraped together with pieces of scrap or engineered with
standard lumber, the hut is barely design. It is as ordinary as a
structure can be. But the hut has an extraordinary ability. It
understands what to bring in, and what to leave out, to craft the
wonder of being.

jet or bargaining with God atop a horse or roaring down the road in
a Lincoln with beer cans rattling around the floorboard. So it is
strange to step out of Mr. Hannah's Jeep Cherokee, with a basket of
bright new tennis balls in the back seat, and onto the driveway of
his modest, Eisenhower-era house in this pretty, antebellum town.

stalwart of the kitchen has started to appear in the weirdest
places, popping up in closets and dresser drawers where sweaters
and mothballs used to be.

   CAMPER (Livingston, Texas) _ For years, whenever vacation time
rolled around, LaVere and Ginny Keller would roll out of Salt Lake
City in their camper truck and explore the West. ``It was pretty
tight quarters, especially when our three daughters were with us,''
he recalled. ``But we loved it. We'd get home, and we'd say,
`Wouldn't it be great if we could just keep going?''' In 1994 they
did just that. The Kellers retired, sold their house, bought a
trailer and a truck to tow it, and took to the road full time. At
Rainbow's End, a camp for up to 400 recreational vehicles here in
the piney woods of East Texas, they joyously described the changes
in their lives _ the 17 states they have toured, the new friends
they have made at RV camps along the way and most of all, the new
freedom.

   KITCHEN-DESIGN (Undated) _ Some modern kitchens may be geared up

anyone? It can be steamed up on the Aga or zapped in the microwave
oven, then served in a room newly commodious with a kitchen sofa,
pillows, even an armchair. The designer has arrived in the kitchen,
bringing an eye for creature comforts and materials once reserved
for more showy parts of the house. The last barrier between rooms
has finally come down. By Julie V. Iovine.

<P>
   DESERT-MOTEL (Desert Hot Springs, Calif.) _ For 15 years Miracle
Manor, a divey 40s motel 10 miles northeast of Palm Springs, seemed
scripted more than operated by Lois Blackhill, a sometimes topless
facialist noted for chanelling a spirit named Omra. Ms. Blackhill

JUDGE GRANTS PAROLE TO ILLEGAL CHINESE IMMIGRANT  (jw) 
 By DAVID CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ Rejecting a government request, an immigration
judge granted parole Wednesday to one of the 23 Chinese men who had
hoped to be smuggled into the United States two months ago but
instead were captured by authorities near a New Jersey beach.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Esmeralda Cabrera set bond at $5,000 for the man, Jiang
Dian Lu, after ruling that Jiang, who did not have a criminal
record, was not a threat to national security. Jules Coven, Jiang's
lawyer, said that his client had relatives in the United States who
would probably be ready to post bond in a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   But it was uncertain when _ or whether _ Jiang, 22, would be
freed. Irene Feldman, an assistant district counsel for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said that the government
would probably appeal. And even if an appeal is rejected, Ms.
Feldman said, the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey has a
warrant to arrest Jiang again, if necessary, as a witness in a
criminal investigation into Chinese smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this gentleman is an absolute flight risk,''
Ms. Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the only other bond hearing decided Wednesday, a lawyer for
Zheng Tian Rong, 29, withdrew Zheng's bond application, saying that
it was pointless to combat the government's stated intentions to
rearrest the immigrants. The other 21 Chinese men, meanwhile, are
expected to seek bond on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the hearings were brief, the legal parrying culminated an
animated session in the latest installment of the government's case
to deport the men to China. At one point, Coven accused the
government of ``using the aliens as pawns''; at another, Cabrera
warned the government: ``Don't play any more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Asylum hearings for the men, who are all from Fujian Province,
are not expected to begin until early August. And though bond
hearings are normally mundane, these hearings have taken on an
extra air of anticipation because of the possibility that some of
the 23 men would be reunited, if only fleetingly, with relatives in
the United States. Some of those relatives are expected to appear
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings Wednesday came less than 24 hours after the U.S.
attorney in New Jersey charged four men with conspiring to smuggle
the 23 Chinese men, whose boat ran aground near Bay Head, N.J., as
well as 27 other Chinese immigrants who landed in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   After transferring the immigrants to Suriname by air or by ship
over the last few months, the smugglers ushered the Chinese onto a
small boat that met a larger boat from Venezuela off Suriname's
coast, according to the criminal complaint. That larger boat, the
Oriental I, then headed north.
</P>
<P>
   On May 29, Nam Jick Cho, 56, of Bayside, Queens, visited a
marina in Point Pleasant, N.J., and tested a small powerboat named
the Oops II, in anticipation of picking up the Chinese men, the
complaint said. Cho and another man then waited in Belmar, N.J.,
for the Oriental I to transfer the men to the Oops II.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 30, according to the government, Cho and the others
heard that the operation had gone awry: instead of landing near
Belmar, a teeming town popular with college students where the
Chinese presumably would not have attracted much attention, the
boat washed up eight miles south near Bay Head, a hushed, affluent
area with Victorian mansions. Tired and bedraggled, the men did not
escape notice.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, the U.S. Coast Guard found the Oriental I about 195
miles east of San Salvador Island in the Bahamas. Among other items
aboard the boat, the Coast Guard found a bank document apparently
showing a wire transfer of $2,000 made out to Cho and directed to
the Korean Exchange Bank in Flushing, Queens, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been little information about the men. All
that Coven would mention about his client, for instance, was that
Jiang was single and had an uncle, a lawful permanent resident, in
Chicopee, Mass., and an aunt, now seeking asylum, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But Ren Rong Pan, the lawyer for Zheng, offered some details
about his client in an interview after the hearings. Zheng, a
29-year-old farmer, grew up poor and illiterate in the town of
Wenlin in Fujian's Changle County. Several years ago, Chinese
officials forced Zheng's wife to have an abortion after she became
pregnant with a second child, in violation of China's one-child
policy, Pan said. More recently, when she became pregnant again,
officials said they would not only perform another forced abortion,
but also a sterilization procedure _ on both Mrs. Zheng and her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng, frightened, took his wife to an uncle's house, then fled
to Hong Kong in February, aided by smugglers. In March, he flew to
Thailand and in May to Suriname.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has suffered a lot,'' Pan said of his client. ``He knew
that he had to go to the United States, but he didn't know how. He
just joined the pack.''

EDITORIAL: ANNALS OF THE NEW YORKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   After six years that seemed like 60 when measured in hoopla, the
Tina Brown era is over at The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement that followed weeks of media chattering about
the magazine's financial losses and recent murmurings about the
editor's personal angst, Ms. Brown told her staff Wednesday morning
that she was moving to a new ``media venture'' launched by Miramax
films. Like many of the events during her term as editor, this news
not only sent tremors through the hushed, off-white corridors of
the magazine, it reverberated throughout the journalism and
literary worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The questions quickly went beyond whether Ms. Brown jumped or
was pushed. The writers and editors she had run off wondered if
there would be a Restoration under some pretender related to the
genteel grandees who arranged the furniture that Ms. Brown burned.
More disinterested readers wondered if a new editor would try to
preserve the magazine's Brownian personality, which held that the
creation of buzz was the highest good. Even those who regard Ms.
Brown as the undisputed queen of buzz are wondering if the
publication can be made profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous of a cluster of British editors taking over
American publications in recent years, Ms. Brown took over the
venerable but creaky corpus of The New Yorker in September 1992 and
rapidly electro-shocked it into something like an editorial St.
Vitus dance.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes her terror tactics worked as she pushed writers to
deliver quickly with pieces that combined daring and a semblance of
the intellectual weight that once typified the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the new vistas included places that the old
New Yorker had wisely avoided. Recent examples included a strange
story on a dominatrix, an inane Brown paean to President Clinton's
sex appeal and a staff and advertisers' breakfast with the
disgraced Clinton adviser Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, The New Yorker shed its otherworldly nature and
steadfast elegance in favor of a tarty breathlessness. It had more
scoops and more glitter, but little time for the timeless pieces
favored by Ms. Brown's perhaps excessively revered predecessors,
Harold Ross and William Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   For all their fustiness, they left a magazine that had a defined
personality and that seemed comfortable at high altitude. Ms. Brown
leaves a magazine regarded by old-guard intellectuals as having
multiple personality disorder and a slowly declining glide path.
</P>
<P>
   On both the commercial and journalistic sides, the new editor
will have to do something more creative than choose between
tradition and buzz. Meanwhile, the image that lingers is not that
of the energetic Tina Brown jetting out the door, but of a huffing,
puffing Eustace Tilley collapsing into his rocker. After all, for
six years, he's been dancing as fast as an old New Yorker can. And
for what? he asks himself.

HALL TO FIGHT LAYOFF  
 SWIMMER TESTS POSITIVE FOR DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Olympic medalist Gary Hall Jr. said Wednesday that he
plans to fight a suspension for a positive drug test that, if
upheld, will cloud his future as a world-class athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was placed on a suspension that was termed ``provisional''
by swimming's international governing body, FINA, which took the
action against him after it reported that he tested positive May 15
for a recreational drug.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in Phoenix, site of the random test, said the substance
is marijuana, which after the 1996 Olympics was placed on a banned
list that includes performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is provisional, according to FINA, until it has
acquired results of an alternate sample and has heard from Hall at
an official hearing. He could be suspended for as long as three
months. Hall also plans to undergo another test next week at the
International Olympic Committee laboratory in Montreal. Phoenix
attorney Edwin Hendricks will represent him, according to his
father, Valley eye surgeon Gary Hall. Hendricks was not available
for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that once I am afforded the opportunity to
present my position, I will be able to prove I did not violate any
FINA rule, and the provisional suspension will be removed,'' Hall
said in a prepared statement from Hawaii. ``The test was allegedly
positive for marijuana, a non-performance-enhancing substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I have requested that another test be performed, to
which I am entitled under FINA rules, it has not yet been
completed. Nor have I been given my right under FINA rules to
appear before a FINA panel.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive test occurred on the first day of the US
West/Nortel Swimfest at Phoenix Swim Club. According to Hall's
statement, he was not competing in a FINA-sanctioned event but in a
non-sanctioned match race. His prize for winning the sprint was
this week's expense-paid trip to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of his impending battle, Hall, 23, won't be
with the U.S. team for the Goodwill Games in New York later this
month because the process is expected to last through at least July
28, when swimming is scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, because of the time required for this due
process to occur, I regret I will not be allowed to compete at the
Goodwill Games,'' said Hall, who won two gold medals for relay legs
and two individual silvers.
</P>
<P>
   He had been training for a Goodwill Games rematch with Russian
Alexander Popov, who narrowly beat him the 50 and 100 freestyle
events at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, Hall's name still was on the Goodwill Games
roster. A spokesman in Colorado Springs said U.S. Swimming has been
notified of Hall's provisional suspension. But U.S. Swimming will
wait on further action because of uncertainty surrounding his case
and others.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Four Chinese women have had provisional suspensions
temporarily lifted because of a legal wrangle over testing for
agents designed to mask performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is still way up in the air,'' the spokesman said.
``Otherwise, it's not appropriate for us to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   If a three-month suspension is handed down, Hall will be banned
from major international competition through 1999, a key year
before the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   It would depend on how FINA times the suspension. If it starts
May 15, date of the test, and ends Aug. 15, Hall likely will be
ineligible for the national championships Aug. 11-15, in Clovis,
Calif. U.S. teams for the 1999 Pan American, Pan-Pacific and
Shortcourse World Championships will be selected at that meet.
</P>
<P>
   Hall will be eligible for World Cup competition, a somewhat
anonymous pro circuit. Without the limelight of big meets that
point to the 2000 Olympics, there is concern about Hall's
motivation to continue training.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches marvel at his talent but complain about his work ethic.
Hall, whose endorsements include Speedo and Gibson guitars, is
known for going his own way. He has a reputation for thumbing his
nose at the sport's various bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   If a three-month suspension sticks, will he continue?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' said his father, a three-time Olympic
swimmer. ``He has to get over this hurdle. I'm very concerned about
him right now. He's not a drug user. He's a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1998 rankings, Hall had a legitimate chance to
beat Popov in at least the 50. For the year, Hall has the world's
second-fastest time, 22.40 seconds, behind fellow American Bill
Pilczuk, who beat Popov at the World Championships in January.
Popov is fourth at 24.43. Popov, however, has the year's best time
in the 100 at 48.74. Hall is fifth at 49.60.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really looking forward to the Goodwill Games,'' his
father said. ``He is devastated by this.'' &QL;

   Oklahoma Abroad &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Rodgers, the daughter of Richard Rodgers, took
three English women she calls ``war babies'' to a preview of Trevor
Nunn's new production of her father's ``Oklahoma!'' at the Royal
National Theater in London. The three _ Lady Astor, Gillian
Warrender and Zoe Hyde-Thomson _ spent World War II in New York and
were classmates of hers at the Brearley School on the Upper East
Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still call them kids even though we're all 67 years old,''
Miss Rodgers said. ``The kids in school were envious of them. We
loved their accents, and they were smarter. When they went home,
they were accused of losing their British accents, of being
Americanized, but they didn't sound that way to us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And the show? Miss Rodgers gave it a thumbs up. ``I wasn't
bored,'' she said, ``but it's three and a half hours. I think
they'll tighten it up in the first act, especially.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning Heads &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now is the time for midsummer silliness, or at least
attention-getting stunts. Yesterday Campari, the Italian aperitif
that is about the same color as weak Sangria, hired a room at Remi,
a restaurant on West 55th Street in Manhattan. Campari's spokesmen
said that the company had hired an artist to paint two ``seminude''
women the color of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   The two women, Zhenya Pizarro and Lana Piryan, were wearing red
bathing suits when artist Joanne Gair, who once painted a pinstripe
suit onto Demi Moore's body for a photograph in Vanity Fair
magazine, went to work, using lipstick (a shade called ``heat
wave'').
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pizarro said the trick was to apply a primer coat of lotion.
``If you don't,'' she said, ``the paint seeps into your pores. I
didn't the first time, and it was, like, a week later and it was
still coming out of my ears.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the bridal bouquet tossed in Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   The event was organized by Bride's magazine and Romance
Classics, a cable network not carried on the New York systems owned
by Time Warner, whose HBO unit has its offices on 42d Street across
from Bryant Park. They expected a crowd of would-be brides to jump
when James Dolan, the chief executive of Cablevision, threw the
bouquet, because the catcher would win a $25,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   It was caught by a man, Anthony Scavone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the prizes was a vacuum cleaner,'' said Scavone, an
actor who went by the park after his physical trainer canceled an
appointment. ``I really needed a vacuum cleaner because I have
cats. I didn't even realize what the grand prize was.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he now consider popping the question? ``I've always been a
little commitment-phobic,'' he said, ``but this is an incentive. I
always thought if I ever was financially secure, I'd consider doing
that. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   A Hamptons Hello &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A postscript: Sean (Puffy) Combs, the party giver and
rap music impresario, has learned the way they do things in East
Hampton, N.Y., where he bought a house last year. There was a
last-minute flurry when a neighbor asked the police whether he had
a permit for his Fourth of July party.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, so his managers called in a lawyer, Michael
Griffith. He said the call about the permit had come from Debra
Lobel, a former East Hampton Town Attorney. Griffith went to her
house. ``I say, `Look, why don't you start a dialogue, meet your
neighbor?''' Griffith recalled. (Ms. Lobel did not return a call
for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Soon Combs was at Ms. Lobel's door. ``On the way over I said,
`What time did you plan to knock off?''' Griffith said. ``He said,
`About 9.' I said, `Tell her it was going to go till early in the
morning, but as an accommodation to her, we'll cut off at 11,'
because I know the town law says you have to cut off at 11.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Combs sent Ms. Lobel a plate of food and a bottle of
champagne. And yes, the party ended on time.

HIP TROUBLES END NICKLAUS' STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Jack Nicklaus ended one of the most durable
streaks in sports on his own terms Wednesday, saying he would not
play in next week's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a deteriorating left hip and an unwillingness to consume
himself in preparation at the expense of his family, Nicklaus, 58,
walked away from a streak of 154 consecutive majors for which he
was eligible, including 146 dating from his first year as a pro in
the 1962 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Putting that accomplishment in perspective, Nick Faldo now owns
the longest active major streak at 44 _ his starting the year
!ital!after!off! Nicklaus won a sixth Masters title at age 46 in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``All good things must come to an end,'' Nicklaus said. ``And
I'd like to have them come to an end on a note that I have played
reasonably well through the ones that I have played up to this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who will play in this week's Ford Senior Players
Championship at TPC of Michigan, said the July 23-26 U.S. Senior
Open at Riviera will be his last tournament before he looks into
medical remedies he said could include a hip replacement.
</P>
<P>
   He intends to play in the future but not without repair of some
kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been playing on borrowed time as it relates to the
level of my game for the last three years,'' he said, ``and I just
felt like maybe I don't want to stretch that any further than I
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I stretched it far enough when I was healthy, and so I
don't want to stretch it beyond that if I can't walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin and Larry Nelson, also former major winners now
playing on the senior tour, said they respected the decision of the
man who tallied 18 major titles in his 37-year streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable somewhere along the line that Jack is going
to have to break the string,'' Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Cal Ripken record,'' he added, referring to the
Baltimore Oriole's consecutive-games streak of 2,566. ``Sooner or
later he's going to miss a game. It's not the end of Jack
Nicklaus.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Nicklaus was smart enough to know what was best for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that whatever decision he made, he feels like it will
be in the best interest of him and the game,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus said timing played as big a role as anything. He had
intended to end the streak after finishing sixth in this year's
Masters, but the U.S. Golf Association offered him an unexpected
exemption to play in a 43rd consecutive U.S. Open three weeks ago
at Olympic Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He played well enough to make the cut _ as he has done 133 times
during the streak _ but his ailing hip prevented him from preparing
as much as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Nicklaus looked again at a schedule that had him
sandwiching two senior majors around a British Open. After
consulting with his wife, Barbara, he made the hard decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this time in my life, I think I would really like to win
the U.S. Senior Championship,'' he said. ``I think that is really
more important to me in the game of golf right now than competing
in the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   He notified British Open officials and said he continues to deal
with the internal aftermath of that streak-ending decision.
</P>
<P>
   Was playing in 154 consecutive majors his proudest achievement?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only one I had left,'' said Nicklaus, who called
his '86 Masters victory the highlight of the streak.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest disappointment of the streak?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being able to play in the 155th,'' he said.

<P>
   Quarterback Dave Brown's mother received a disturbing phone call
the night before the 1992 NFL supplemental draft.
</P>
<P>
   A league official had called to inform Brown that the NFL had
cancelled the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom flipped out,'' said Brown, in his first year with the
Cardinals. ``She said, `What do you mean, you're not going to have
one?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Brown heard the news, he called his agent, Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leigh said it was unconstitutional to cancel it,'' Brown said.
``I would have been hung out to dry. I already had an agent, so I
couldn't go back to school (at Duke). We would have sued the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooler heads prevailed and the NFL held the supplemental draft
for Brown, who was taken in the first round by the New York Giants.
The incident shows how different the supplemental draft is from the
NFL's regular draft, which is a big event held over two days and
broadcast by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Today's supplemental draft, however, is an obscure event. Only a
few teams will participate and most of the 10 players available
won't be picked.
</P>
<P>
   Brown isn't the only Cardinals player who entered the league
through the supplemental draft. Pro Bowl wide receiver Rob Moore
was a first-round pick by the New York Jets in the 1990
supplemental draft. Both entered the draft because they graduated
after the regular draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also chose quarterback Timm Rosenbach in the first
round of the 1989 supplemental draft, but he was out of the league
by 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful player ever taken in the supplemental draft
was University of Miami quarterback Bernie Kosar, a 1985
first-round selection by Cleveland who led the Browns to two AFC
title games.
</P>
<P>
   But few in the NFL like supplemental drafts, including Giants
General Manager Ernie Accorsi, who was running the Browns when they
picked Kosar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pick on (the regular) draft day, you know exactly who
you are picking that player over,'' Accorsi said. ``In a
supplemental draft, you are picking against the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals General Manager Larry Wilson, who picked
Rosenbach, said he wishes supplemental drafts didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are only (there) to appease players,'' he said. ``All
these decisions should be made the time the draft occurs. In 99
percent of the cases, the reasons aren't good why players are
available. You've never scouted them other than on films. It's an
unfair situation for clubs to get into.''
</P>
<P>
   The top player in this year's supplemental draft, Oklahoma State
defensive tackle Jamal Williams, entered the draft because he was
academically ineligible. Navy offensive tackle Mike Wahle, the
second best player in today's draft, was dismissed from school
after failing an NCAA-administered drug test.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the available players are junior college guys _ all
kinds of garbage are in it,'' said Bob Ferguson, Cardinals vice
president of player personnel. ``Half of them were kicked off their
teams. Sure, you get the Dave Browns and Rob Moores every once in a
while, but they are the exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, for the team, the preparation isn't there. It's kind of
disjointed. The coaches are on vacation.'' &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Brown decided to enter the supplemental draft after going
through Duke's spring practice in 1992. Most of the team's best
players had departed, and he needed only one class to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the NFL (regular) draft, teams started calling
me,'' he said. ``They are not supposed to do it, but they do it. I
heard that such and such didn't get a quarterback and needed a
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown knew he would be a No. 1 pick the next year. Going into
his senior season, he was rated the third-best quarterback prospect
behind Drew Bledsoe and Rick Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing he would bypass his senior season, Brown worked
out for 20 teams. He thought he would be picked by Cleveland, which
was looking for a replacement for Kosar, or Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leigh (Steinberg) told the Browns I would be tough to sign, so
they passed on me, and the Giants took me right behind them,''
Brown said. ``Leigh didn't have any quarterbacks in New York and
wanted to get me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a native of Westfield, N.J., wound up joining his
home-town team, the Giants, but was inconsistent as a starter for
nearly four seasons. He was released in the spring and signed as a
free agent to compete for the backup job behind Jake Plummer. &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Moore liked the idea of having his ``own draft.'' So midway
through the spring of 1990, he decided he wanted to apply for the
supplemental draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already had been projected as going 10 to 15 in the regular
draft,'' Moore said. ``If I figured I would have been a
second-rounder or later, I never would have applied for the
supplemental draft. The benefit of the supplemental draft is you
don't get put in the mix with everybody else. It gave me an
opportunity to sit back and watch how the regular draft unfolded.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated in May, making him eligible for the supplemental
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always promised my mom I'd graduate before I left school,''
Moore said. ``I knew if I had to prepare for the (regular draft),
I'd never have graduated.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who grew up in Hempstead, N.Y., not far from the Jets'
practice facility, was picked by his neighborhood team. He was a
starter from the outset but got into a contract dispute with the
club after making the Pro Bowl in 1994 and was traded to the
Cardinals on draft day the next spring. &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals still were reeling from the career-ending hip
injury to quarterback Neil Lomax in 1989 when they drafted
Rosenbach, who was eligible because he graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbach won the starting job his second year and threw for
3,098 yards in 1990. He was expected to be the team's longtime
starter but suffered a serious knee injury in a non-contact drill
the next summer and was lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done some research on him,'' Wilson said of Rosenbach.
``At the time, we thought he might be a first-round pick in the
regular draft. It was a fluke thing what happened to him in
practice. You never can predict those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to him later contradicted what we knew about him
as a player and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbach, slowed by injuries again in 1992, suddenly retired
that summer, saying he had lost his desire to play pro football.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to make a comeback with the New Orleans Saints in March
1995 but suffered a back injury fishing and never played.
</P>
<P>
   He is running a commercial boat in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. &QL;

WITH BROWN'S DEPARTURE, NEW YORKER FACES CRUCIAL DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 (With BROWN-RESIGN, BROWN-HOLLYWOOD.) 
(nk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   ith STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the departure of his high-profile editor, Tina
Brown, S.I. Newhouse Jr. will have to make crucial decisions about
the editorial and advertising future of the loss-plagued New Yorker
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown was credited with making the magazine timely, relevant
and far flashier than it had been under former editors. It is now
up to Newhouse, whose family owns The New Yorker, to decide whether
to seek an editor who will continue that strategy or veer toward a
less timely approach. Also at issue is whether to trim the
magazine's high editorial budget and rethink its strategy of making
expensive efforts to build circulation.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the magazine faces great difficulty because of
increased competition for advertising addressed at affluent
readers. Some of that competition comes from other Conde Nast
publications, like Conde Nast Traveler and Vanity Fair, as well as
niche publications owned by competitors in fields such as travel,
life style, gourmet foods and home decor.
</P>
<P>
   Some even believe that the magazine should return to its past as
a less topical, literary magazine and thus differentiate itself
from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most attention Wednesday, in the advertising industry at
least, focused on the need to make a strong statement of direction
with a new editor, especially now when advertising is being sold
for the all-important fourth quarter, by far the most lucrative
period of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers are relatively easy to replace in this business,''
said Roberta Garfinkle, senior vice president and print media
director at McCann-Erickson New York, part of the McCann-Erickson
World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. ``The much
bigger issue is who will replace Tina,'' she added. ``It's a very
hard spot to fill,'' because of the prominence of The New Yorker
and the publicity recently given its financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Tassaro, senior vice president and director for print
services at the Media Edge, the media services arm of Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc. in New York, said Ms. Brown's resignation ``is
definitely a blow to The New Yorker'' primarily because ``Tina as a
personality became synonymous with The New Yorker'' as a result of
``the enormous buzz'' that she created for the weekly magazine in
media and advertising circles.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Tassaro added, ``The New Yorker is like a phoenix
that will rise from the ashes'' because ``it's a venerable title
with such an incredibly loyal readership.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But at a magazine that does not have a natural advertising niche
_ it is not a fashion or beauty book _ an editor with an identity
can be a lure for skittish buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker's new publisher, David Carey, was appointed only
a month ago. Under both former publishers _ Steven T. Florio and
then his brother Thomas A. Florio _ the magazine raised its
circulation beyond what was seen as the ``natural'' level, the
level a magazine reaches without costly promotion. Under both
Florios, circulation grew, though new subscribers were often
courted with inexpensive subscription rates. At the same time, the
magazine lost advertising pages because many advertisers could no
longer afford the expensive ad prices. Though The New Yorker's
losses have declined over the last several years, it still lost $11
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Conde Nast is folding the magazine into the operations of
its other publications to save money on back-office functions. The
plan is to lower advertising prices once the merger is made.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, well-established writers who are part of The New
Yorker's lure may not remain. Most have one-year contracts, Ms.
Brown said yesterday, adding that when she left Vanity Fair to join
The New Yorker she did not take many writers with her. But even
those who do not join her at the new monthly she plans to start
could well leave The New Yorker if they are unhappy with Newhouse's
editorial choice.
</P>
<P>
   With all the possible changes ahead, Steve Greenberger, senior
vice president and print media director at Grey Advertising, said
he believed that ``The New Yorker needs a push to establish where
it is in the advertising marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina Brown had reached a point where she had done what she
came there for,'' he said, ``and now it's time for the magazine to
stand on its own two feet. The good news is that it could, with the
right marketing.''

TKACHUK CONFIDENT OF PACT EXTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Most people think his future in Phoenix won't last as
long as the beanie baby craze.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk get all warm and fuzzy
inside when he talks about his stalled contract negotiations with
General Manager Bobby Smith?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm optimistic things will get worked out,'' Tkachuk,
the team's leading scorer each of the past three seasons, said
Wednesday from his home in Cape Cod, Mass. ``I'm not worried or
frustrated about it at all. I still believe it will get done in
time. My prediction is I'm going to sign with the Phoenix Coyotes
and be there for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk already has rejected two offers from the team, including
one worth $33 million _ an average of $6.5 million a year. Last
week, Smith pulled it from the table and announced that
negotiations were off indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk and his agent, meanwhile, reportedly want a package
worth $40 million, an average of $8 million a year. If they don't
get it, sources said Tkachuk is prepared to sit for however long it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it wouldn't be smart for the player or for the
team, I know that,'' Tkachuk said. ``It doesn't make any sense, so
let's get a deal done. There's still plenty of time left.''
</P>
<P>
   The raging debate in the Valley is why does Tkachuk deserve $8
million a year when he has two years left on his current contract
(worth $2.8 million next season, $3 million the next), and he never
has led his team out of the first round of the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   The only athletes in the Valley expected to get that kind of
money are Diamondbacks Jay Bell and Matt Williams. Bell will make
$8.1 million for each of the last two years of his five-year, $35
million deal. And Williams will make more than $9 million in the
last two seasons of his five-year extension, which begins next
season. The only Suns player who ever has made that much money is
11-year veteran Kevin Johnson, who was paid $8.4 million for last
season after leading his team to the playoffs nine seasons in a
row. No Cardinal, let alone any NFL player, is even in that
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk said it's simple economics. Salaries are skyrocketing
around the NHL. Top players such as Eric Lindros, Paul Kariya and
Joe Sakic have raised the bar. Jaromir Jagr and Teemu Selanne, he
points out, signed lucrative extensions before their original deals
expired. All have at least made it to the second round of the
playoffs, and Jagr and Sakic have their names on the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on where you put yourself in that category,''
Tkachuk said. ``Players are getting paid more than ever, (and)
teams are taking care of their better players. Ten months ago, we
gave them our offer, and basically, it hasn't changed at all
despite the fact the market was going up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first-round-of-the-playoffs thing, I can understand that
being a fan. But some of these other guys haven't won a Stanley Cup
yet, either, or made it to the second or third round themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk followed up back-to-back 50-goal seasons by scoring 40
last season despite missing 13 games and playing with a fractured
rib in about a dozen others. He said he realizes his public image
may be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people are only hearing one side of the coin,'' he said.
``I know I'm getting portrayed as a bad guy, but I know I'm not.
People don't know what's going on in the marketplace. They don't
understand what's gone on behind the scenes. The only people who
really know are Bobby Smith, myself, (Coyotes owner) Richard Burke
and my agent (Bob Murray).''
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the disagreement, apart from the dollar
amount, is the alleged promise that Smith and Burke made to Tkachuk
in September. Tkachuk and Murray contend they were promised an
extension would get signed, sealed and delivered. Smith and Burke
said the only promise they made was that they would ``try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me to come back and play (after sitting out the
preseason) and they'll get me an extension because it'll look
better after I played at least three years of my contract,''
Tkachuk said. ``They looked me right in the eyes and shook my hand
and promised. I was there. I know what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still willing to negotiate, but by (Smith) saying the
talks are off and the offer's off the table, he's telling me he
doesn't want Keith Tkachuk in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk wouldn't say whether he is prepared to budge from his
original demands. He wouldn't confirm whether he would hold out, as
many expect. He did say that he doesn't want the situation to lead
to a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play in Phoenix. I want to lead that team,'' he
said. ``No way would I ask for a trade. But it's all in Bobby
Smith's hands now. He's going to do what he thinks is best for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only July, and we've still got time to talk. If we can't
reach a deal, then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But
my insides tell me we'll get a deal done. I'm convinced of that.'' &QL;

COYOTES SCHED ULED TO PLAY 10 ROAD GAMES IN DECEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They're playing in a new division inside a new
three-division conference format, but once again the Coyotes will
be road warriors during December.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes will play four of 14 games in December at America
West Arena, according to the 1998-99 schedule released Wednesday by
the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Coyotes played five of 15 games in December at
home and escaped major damage with a 5-5-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we would have liked to see more home games in December,
but we can't complain,'' Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith said.
``Actually, we worked hard to have our schedule changed from the
initial way it looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had us playing 17 of our first 22 at home, which would have
meant coming down the stretch with most of our games on the road.
Giving this schedule a cursory look, I'm pleased with it. We start
the year with a good mix of home and away games, and it's more
balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Coyotes had to play five of their final eight
games on the road while struggling to earn a playoff spot. They
came away with a 5-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, they end the season with eight of their last 13 at
home, as well as five of their last 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, our last 27 games are just about evenly split,''
Smith said. ``It's a lot better than it looked initially. We
avoided a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes opened last season with seven of their first 10
games on home ice. The upcoming season sees an equal split in the
first 10 games. They open the season against the Ottawa Senators at
home on Oct. 11, then host Colorado and Boston before departing on
a five-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes also will host New Jersey on Thanksgiving night,
Dallas on New Year's night and Anaheim on Valentine's Day. They
twice have home dates when the Arizona Cardinals also are at home _
the season opener (Ottawa) and Dec. 20 (New York Islanders).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about playing on Thanksgiving night,'' Coyotes
President Shawn Hunter said. ``It's the third year we've played
that night, and we want it to become a tradition. . . . The same
goes with New Year's night.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new conference alignments necessitated by expansion
(Nashville this year) and future expansion (Atlanta in 1999-2000;
Columbus and Minnesota in 2000-2001), the Eastern and Western
conferences feature three divisions each.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, having been members of the Western Conference's
Central Division in the past, move into the Pacific Division this
season along with Dallas, Anaheim, Los Angeles and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary, Colorado, Edmonton and Vancouver make up the Northwest
Division, with Chicago, Detroit, Nashville and St. Louis comprising
the Central.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule calls for each Western Conference team to play six
times against divisional foes, four times against the teams in
other divisions within their conference, and once each against
teams in the Eastern Conference. But each team will play a minimum
of 12 ``wild card'' games, which were decided on the basis of
promoting geographic and traditional rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   In the Coyotes' case, it means they will play each Eastern
Conference team twice (home and away), with the exception of
Carolina and Toronto. The Coyotes will visit but not host the Maple
Leafs, and they will host but not visit the Hurricanes. &QL;

COMMENTARY: WAITING FOR BROWN DRAKES AT DUSK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a stand of trees a 3-year-old elk grazed, the velvet on his
antlers still plush and unrubbed. His paunch sagged with the weight
of constant feeding, and on his back sat a cowbird, heedless. In
the evening light the seedheads of the grasses across the river,
where the elk stood, seemed unduly ponderous, dense and purple. The
river was the Gibbon, where it bends far away from the highway in a
section of Yellowstone called Elk Park.
</P>
<P>
   I had come to fish with two good friends. The fishing, highly
speculative, would wait until a mayfly called the Brown Drake
appeared, if it appeared at all. Where we sat, the Gibbon flowed
from west to east, its surface as bright as the fading sun. Every
now and then, a lily pad on the far bank would turn on its side and
knife downward through the water in a motion very like the arc a
trout makes when it rises and falls through the surface, feeding. I
held a hand up to the sun and saw caddis flies drifting across the
backlit meadow and the dark timber to the west. The elk lay down in
the tall grass.
</P>
<P>
   In Yellowstone you get used to the happenstance of seeing
wildlife. One year the thermal meadows near the Firehole are full
of bison. The next year at the same time, the flies have already
driven them to higher ground. The highway through Yellowstone, to
which most visitors cling, comes to seem like a path through a set
of loose probabilities _ weather, season, time of day, etc. _ that
determine whether you will come across a moose or a coyote. To the
movements of wild animals, we naturally impute a narrow determinism
_ they are driven by hunger, irritation, danger, courtship. But to
what do the elk impute our love of asphalt?
</P>
<P>
   When darkness began to settle, it looked at first as though the
Brown Drakes would not appear. A few caddis began laying eggs on
the water, slowly stitching their way upstream. Brown Drakes are
very big mayflies. They adhere to the corridor of the river as
tightly as tourists adhere to pavement. They simply appear when the
light is low and the air and water temperature are right.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there they were, fluttering up and down in twos and
threes and then in dozens, knotting and unknotting as they mated.
We waited for the flies to settle onto the water and cause the big
brown trout to feed. The mayflies rose and fell, always a little
nearer to the river's surface. We looked on tensely, trying at once
to watch the insects and all of the visible river, as though it
were an unmoving plane of light. Then they vanished _ who knew
where or why? _ and the Gibbon began to flow again. We walked to
the highway, where a cow elk wearing a radio collar grazed in the
abrupt glow of flashbulbs.

MONSIGNOR'S DRUG ARREST FILLS PRIESTS AND FRIENDS WITH SHOCK
</HEADLINE>
   (bl) 
 By JAMES RISEN c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was the fastest-rising priest from his seminary
class, and his future in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York
seemed unlimited. James White had been the first from his class to
be named monsignor, had served in the highly visible post of
associate pastor at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and had even worked
briefly on the personal staff of Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   And so by 1996, when he was chosen to run an important
pre-seminary program to help college students interested in the
priesthood, Monsignor White was emerging as an important role
model, one of the few prominent black priests in an archdiocese
deeply concerned about expanding its reach within the black
community.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that stellar background has only deepened the sense of
personal tragedy felt by his friends and fellow priests after White
was arrested on misdemeanor drug possession charges Tuesday.
Priests who know White expressed shock Wednesday at the news of his
arrest, saying it seemed completely out of character for the
50-year-old priest they described as quiet and gentle.
</P>
<P>
   Several priests who have known White for years, including some
who were in his seminary class, said they had never seen any
evidence of his involvement with drugs. They added that his arrest
was painful and damaging to the archdiocese, especially since New
York has so few black priests in senior positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really couldn't believe it,'' said Msgr. Howard Calkins,
pastor of Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Mt. Vernon. ``This is a
painful moment. I feel for him. I feel for the Archbishop.''
</P>
<P>
   William Scafidi, pastor of St. Mary's Catholic Church in
Newburgh, N.Y., where Monsignor White previously served as pastor,
said: ``He is an excellent guy; that's why this is so damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   White was arrested along with another man after allegedly buying
cocaine from an undercover officer in the Jackson Heights section
of Queens. He pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor narcotics
possession charge in Queens criminal court Wednesday and was
released on his own recognizance. He agreed to seek drug treatment
and was ordered to appear in court Aug. 18, according to the Queens
district attorney's office. This was White's first arrest, the
prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York,
said that O'Connor planned to speak with White soon but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   White, who is from West Harlem, came late to the priesthood,
spending much of his early career as a brother in the Catholic
order of the Christian Brotherhood. Ordained at the archdiocese's
St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie, Yonkers, in 1983, Monsignor
White was first assigned to Staten Island, where he served as an
associate pastor at St. Clement and St. Michael Church for two
years. After teaching at Cardinal Hayes High School for four years,
he joined the staff at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1989. While
there, he filled in for one of O'Connor's secretaries during one
summer, said Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, White was given his own parish, at St. Mary's Church in
Newburgh, N.Y., which is part of the Archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he was named rector of the St. John Neumann
Seminary Residence in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where
about 40 college students considering the priesthood live and study
before they are ready to enter the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Running the Neumann seminary has placed White in a key post to
help the archdiocese reverse one of the most difficult trends
facing the Roman Catholic Church in the United States _ a chronic
shortage of new priests. But friends and fellow priests said that
his personality seemed well suited to the role. ``He's a good
friend,'' said the Rev. Sam Taylor of Resurrection Catholic Church
in Manhattan. ``He was always there for other people when they
needed him, and maybe that's why they made him rector.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic leaders and priests said they could not recall any
similar cases of a New York priest arrested on drug charges, and
they were struggling to absorb the news. Wednesday night, at Our
Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, the West Harlem parish where White
said his first mass and where his brother taught for years, his
friend, the Rev. Thomas Fenlon, was composing a new church bulletin
that addressed the monsignor's troubles. ``I was just writing in
the bulletin that we support him with our prayers,'' Fenlon said.

FRED GOLDEN, 83, WHO PROMOTED BROADWAY SHOWS FOR 60 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred Golden, a dean among theatrical advertising men
and winner of a special Tony Award in 1988, died July 3 at his home
in Manhattan. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Golden started his career in 1931 as a messenger for the Blaine
Thompson Company, a theater advertising agency that spawned most of
the firms in that business today. To the end he remained close to
the theater, sitting on industry committees, attending functions
and dispensing counsel as one of Broadway's elder statesmen.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his 60-year career he handled the publicity for
more than 1,000 Broadway productions, including classics like ``The
Glass Menagerie,'' ``Kiss Me Kate,'' `` Roberts,'' ``Hello,
Dolly!,'' ``Funny Girl,'' ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' ``Gypsy'' and
``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' He was Frank Sinatra's advertising
representative for many years. Adweek magazine proclaimed him
``Broadway's Star Adman.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Golden was raised in West New York, N.J., the son of
Romanian immigrants who had arrived in steerage. He helped his
father deliver seltzer from a horse cart on weekdays, and if he
behaved, his mother took him on the ferry to Manhattan on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then she splurged and bought standing-room tickets at
the Metropolitan Opera _ $1 for both of them. Thus began his life
in and around the performing arts. When he was a teen-ager, he
worked as an usher at the Met and could not get over the fact that
he was hearing Mozart and getting paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work for the Blaine Thompson agency and rose to
become an owner and partner in the firm. After it was sold he moved
to the Ash-LeDonne agency in 1978 for six years, then joined
Diener/Hauser/Bates to create the Golden Group in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 68, after laboring for the talented and
vainglorious alike behind the scenes, he had his name on a
company's logo. He formally retired 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tony Awards ceremonies in 1988 he was honored by the
League of American Theaters and Producers for ``Lifetime Service to
the Theater.'' Many of those present did not know him, but Broadway
insiders seemed in rare unanimity when voting him that rare special
award.
</P>
<P>
   Golden is survived by his wife, Hope Mansfield Golden; a sister,
Ruth Lev Peck of Fort Lee, N.J., and a stepson, Dr. Scott Smoller
of Plantation, Fla.

SECOND HALF NO VACATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Mlicki took his family to Universal Studios
over the All-Star break, while Eric Young enjoyed a relaxing
fishing outing in Mississippi. But don't expect the Los Angeles
Dodgers to spend a lot of time sharing vacation photos before they
return to action today.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers begin a four-game series against hot San Diego this
afternoon. The National League West-leading Padres are 12{ games
ahead of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It won't get much easier for the Dodgers after the Padres
depart, since their next opponent is rival San Francisco, which
will be in town for a three-game series starting Monday. The NL
wild-card-leading Giants are 8{ games ahead of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the season is just in the infant stage. But
these two series could well set the tone for the Dodgers, who are
hoping to catch both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some work to do,'' said Young. ``Is it impossible? No.
These (two) series are important. There is no ifs, ands or buts
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said, ``These are big games
playing the first-place club and the second-place club. I'm excited
about starting the second half and seeing where we go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Young back?: After doing some running exercises during
Wednesday's voluntary workout, a decision on whether Young will
return to the lineup will be made before today's game. He leads all
National Leaguers with 32 stolen bases, despite being limited to 71
games due to a strained right quadriceps muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to come back. It's important as far as being a
competitor, and I want us to get off to a good (second half)
start,'' said Young, who missed the last five games prior to the
All-Star break. ``But if I come back too soon, it can also hurt me
in the long run, whereas I can go in the (disabled list) for just
another week and be ready for the last two and a half months.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fifth man: Hoffman said he would have an answer today on who
would be the Dodgers' new fifth starter and scheduled to pitch
Sunday against the Padres. There is speculation the Dodgers are
still interested in Seattle ace Randy Johnson (7-8, 5.07) and might
include reliever Antonio Osuna, infielder Wilton Guerrero and
outfielder Roger Cedeno in a deal. Another left-hander on the
trading block is Montreal's Carlos Perez (6-9, 3.69).
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said general manager Tommy Lasorda was working on the
situation. Lasorda was not available for comment Wednesday, since
he was in Washington, D.C., as part of a group supporting a
constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to protect the
U.S. flag from desecration. If the Dodgers do not make a deal,
possible starters include left-handed reliever Mark Guthrie or
left-handed minor-leaguers Gary Rath and Wil Brunson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Etc: Members of the Dodgers' 25-man roster who attended
Wednesday's workout included Young, Mlicki, Eric Karros, Darren
Dreifort, Scott Radinsky, Juan Castro, Adrian Beltre, Wilton
Guerrero and Tom Prince.... The Dodgers are leaning toward sending
Beltre back to minors this week to get him more at-bats. The third
baseman, who would prefer to stay, is batting .194 with a home run
and four RBI in 31 at-bats since being promoted from Double-A San
Antonio on June 24.... Right-hander Ramon Martinez began shoulder
exercises Wednesday. Martinez, who had season-ending shoulder
surgery June 30, said he will begin lifting weights in August. He
also said he will stay with the team and not depart to his native
Dominican Republic during the remainder of the season....
Right-hander Darren Hall pitched two innings for Class-A San
Bernardino at Rancho Cucamonga on Tuesday and said he is ready to
return. The reliever, who has been on the DL since April 8 with a
rotator cuff injury, is not expected to do any more rehab work. The
Dodgers are expected to either recall him or send him to minors
soon.

D-BACKS FOCUS ON 2ND HALF, NOT EARLY-SEASON FAILURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

   Halfway through painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,
Michelangelo didn't climb off the scaffolding and say, ``Oh, my
aching back! That's it! I'm outta here!''
</P>
<P>

   When Mother Nature was creating the parfait-layered colors of

</P>
<P>
   Get the idea? You just can't know how something is going to turn
out when you're in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case of the Diamondbacks as they embark on the
second half of their inaugural season. It doesn't take a seamhead
to figure out they're a long way from even getting a sniff of the
playoffs. It's all there for the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a work in progress,'' Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been things here and there that have been
disappointing, which is to be expected in a situation like this.
But we prefer to dwell on some of the good things that are
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   To see the direction in which the Diamondbacks might be headed,
one must first review where they have been.
</P>
<P>
   The team lost its first five games, 12 out of its first 14 and
31 of its first 39. Since that time, it has played a much more
competitive brand of ball, going 22-27 for a 30-58 mark at the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the improvement,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest improvement has been on offense. The team's batting
average was near .230 for a large part of the first half and now is
at .249. Arizona is in the top five in home runs with 93.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, the pitching has been lukewarm at best.
The staff has been particularly vulnerable to the long ball, having
given up 109 home runs, which is the most in the National League,
and second in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries also have been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Andy Benes, who signed a three-year, $18 million
contract to become the team's No. 1 starter, needs to step it up a
few notches. He is 6-9 with a 4.73 ERA in 19 starts (129 innings).
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has not gotten much bang for its buck in right-hander
Willie Blair, who signed a three-year, $11.5 million free-agent
deal in December. At 3-12, he has the highest number of losses in
the National League. Perhaps Blair has not received enough
offensive support at times, but he also has to start pitching much
better.
</P>
<P>
   Blair still is enough of a commodity that he could provide help
for a contending team down the stretch. A trade by the July 31
deadline is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Brian Anderson, the team's top pick in the expansion
draft, does not have overpowering stuff, but the combination of
good control (he's among the NL leaders in fewest walks per nine
innings) and an aggressive nature has put him at 6-7. But he and
Blair have given up 21 home runs, Benes 19.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jeff Suppan, the No. 2 pick in the expansion draft,
struggled, was sent to Triple-A Tucson, then recalled and sent back
to Tucson during the break for a second round of seasoning. At 1-7,
he has been a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Joel Adamson began the season as the fifth starter,
but suffered a rotator-cuff injury. Left-hander Omar Daal moved
into the rotation from the bullpen and became perhaps the most
consistent starter before going on the disabled list because of a
badly strained hamstring. He's projected to return next week.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen has undergone the most significant change.
Right-hander Felix Rodriguez began as the closer, then struggled
and now is on the DL (hip flexor). Veteran Gregg Olson took over
that role and has been an anchor with 11 saves. He also is a solid
presence in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are Barry Manuel, Scott Brow, Ricky Pickett and Russ
Springer and in their place are Amaury Telemaco, Alan Embree, Aaron
Small and Willie Banks. Showalter said he thinks right-hander
Telemaco, who can start or relieve, and left-hander Embree have
been significant upgrades. Right-hander Clint Sodowsky remains as a
setup man, but he has been hot and cold.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter is going with a three-headed catcher _ Jorge Fabregas,
Kelly Stinnett and Damian Miller. Fabregas began the season as a
starter, suffered an ankle injury and went on the DL and still
hasn't regained his footing. Stinnett has been very solid, and
Showalter is exploring the possibility of using Miller's
athleticism to go beyond the mask at other spots.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for Chicago right-hander Kerry Wood, Diamondbacks
first baseman Travis Lee would be a lock for NL Rookie of the Year.
If he can come close to matching his first-half numbers of .284, 17
homers and 47 RBIs, he might win it, anyway. What has been
overlooked is Lee's defense _ he already is close to being Gold
Glove-caliber. Watching him on a daily basis, there can be no
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter has tried two Andys (Stankiewicz and Fox) and a Tony
(Batista) at second, but the future may be with a Danny (Klassen),
who was called up from Tucson just before the break. After starting
his career as a shortstop, Klassen has been at second for only
about a month, but has made a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the signing of Blair, the critics' biggest target has
been shortstop Jay Bell, particularly since he signed a five-year,
$34 million free-agent deal. Critics have focused on what they say
is a lack of range defensively and an average bat.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bell has fit the critics' pattern, looking his age
(32) or even older on defense with 11 errors. But he also has
played well at times. He has hit only .240 with 11 homers and 37
RBIs and leads the team in strikeouts with 80. He admits he needs
to pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams, who came here in the
well-publicized trade with Cleveland to be near his children and
signed a five-year, $45 million extension that begins next year,
has been hit by nagging injuries _ wrist/hand, back and most
recently, foot. If Williams, hitting .271 with 14 homers and 41
RBIs, can stay healthy and get into one of his hot streaks, he can
carry the team a long way.
</P>
<P>
   The most pleasant surprise in the outfield has been center
fielder Devon White, acquired in a trade with Florida on
expansion-draft day. He was the team's first All-Star
representative after hitting .292 with 13 homers, 49 RBIs and 11
stolen bases and has tracked down virtually everything hit his way.
</P>
<P>
   The second-most pleasant surprise has been David Dellucci, who
was in Tucson for the first month of the season and then came on to
hit .290 with five homers, 31 RBIs, and some above-average glove
work.
</P>
<P>
   The other two outfielders _ Karim Garcia and Brent Brede, have
not panned out. Garcia, in particular, has been one of the biggest
disappointments. He was sent down to Tucson for about a month and
has hit better since his return, but not enough to suit his bosses.
He has a strong throwing arm, but has been shaky on a large
percentage of fly balls hit to him in right field.
</P>
<P>
   The team has turned down some trade offers and is considering
others. General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. and other front-office
personnel worked the rooms at the All-Star Game. The names of Blair
(Cardinals) and White (Giants) have surfaced in the past month or
so, but the Diamondbacks aren't likely to bite unless they can get
a few prospects.
</P>
<P>
   When the season ends, Arizona likely will go after more free
agents, such as Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams and perhaps
Padres right-hander Kevin Brown. There undoubtedly would be a lot
of support in a pursuit of Mariners left-hander Randy Johnson, who
lives in the Valley, but his age (35 in September) and his physical
status would seem to make him a large, 6-foot-7 risk. The question
then would be, would Johnson in that scenario still be better than
a younger pitcher with more potential?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Diamondbacks' potential lies in its farm system,
with pitchers such as John Patterson, Vladimir Nunez, Nick
Bierbrodt, Brad Penny and Ben Ford, catchers Rod Barajas and Mark
Osborne, infielders Junior Spivey and Ron Hartman and outfielders
Mike Stoner, Rob Ryan, Jason Conti and Garry Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the biggest temptations that we fight, trying to
bring those guys along too soon,'' Showalter said. ``They all have
good upsides, but we have to try to be as patient as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The work is not complete by any means. Far from it. &QL;

   PHOENIX - If baseball is truly our national pastime, we should
select a commissioner the way we do the president.
</P>
<P>
   Let the American people decide. Give every man and woman _ and
child _ the opportunity to vote for candidates nominated by the
teams at a convention.
</P>
<P>
   Mistah Chairman, Mistah Chairman, the Atlanta Braves from the
great state of Georgia, the Empire State of the South, home of
Herschel Walker, Jimmy Carter and the `Gawja Peach,' the great Ty
Cobb . . . Atlanta, host to the world at the 1996 Summer Oh-lymic
Games, is pleased as punch to cast its vote for a man who needs no
introduction, a man who stands as tall as a Georgia pine. . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get on with it!'' the Baltimore delegation cries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistah Chairman, the land of the free, and the home of the
Braves, proudly and unequivocally, casts its vote for the Rhett
Butler of his times, the ``next'' commissioner of major league
baseball . . . Ted Turner!!!''
</P>
<P>
   (insert horn-blowing here)
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't happen that way, of course. Baseball takes a Vatican
approach. The appointment is made in private, by the owners, behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the man we thought might become Interim Commissioner
for Life, officially will be named today.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us will sigh and think baseball could have done better.
Count me among those who believe the game hasn't had a ``real''
commissioner since they buried Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. They
had to. He was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Landis was the game's original czar. A fearless leader. Selig, a
decent, kindly man, is not. He is an owner himself, which makes him
one of them. A company man.
</P>
<P>
   It's a thankless job, baseball commissioner. There are three
things in this world everyone knows how to do. Manage a newspaper.
Raise other people's children, and run big-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, I might not serve. But if forced to, and given
complete autonomy, here's my agenda: &QL; 
Eliminate the designated hitter. Batting is a God-given right.
Pitchers like to hit, and in their hearts some even think they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want me to take one, or let 'er rip?'' Andy Benes asked the
other day in Houston before he went to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go for it,'' Buck Showalter said, returning Benes' smile.
``Hit it where the grass don't grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliminate artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   Fine any active major league player who charges money for his
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   No radical realignment.
</P>
<P>
   Do away with home-run porches. If a left-hander can't hit one
330 feet he doesn't deserve a major league home run.
</P>
<P>
   Place a $4 price limit on ballpark suds.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminate any promotions _ notably Bat Night _ that arm fans
with potentially lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Find some reason to suspend George Steinbrenner, again.
</P>
<P>
   Ban spit tobacco. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tell television that weekend Fall Classic games must be played
in the afternoon. Kids shouldn't have to stay up past midnight to
watch the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Change the name of BOB. Suggestions are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Shorten the games. Any pitcher who throws to first more than
three times while attempting to hold a runner on base will be shot.
</P>
<P>
   Halt expansion until the pitching catches up to the hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Commission a study to determine the viability of a revolutionary
rules change that would allow right-handed hitters to run to third
base and then to second, first, and home.
</P>
<P>
   As the game is played now, the left-handed batter has a big
advantage, since he is a yard closer to first base. His swing
starts him in the right direction. The right-handed hitter ends up
facing third. Is this fair?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there might be some confusion if the bases are loaded
and a right-handed hitter is at bat. But this could be worked out,
if baseball put its mind to it. &QL;

BASEBALL SHOWS GLOBAL REACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Baseball delivered an excellent touch during the
pregame ceremonies at Tuesday's All-Star Game in Denver when it
displayed all the national flags of players in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Right there, only four flags away from the stars and stripes,
flapped one of the last reminders of communism, the Cuban flag.
Among the other flags waving in the mile-high winds were those from
Australia, the Dominican Republic, Japan, Panama, Puerto Rico,
Germany, Venezuela, Jamaica and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   No section of the globe outside the United States has had more
of an impact on the game than Latin American countries. To
demonstrate just how far the Latin player has made inroads into the
game, take a moment to remember the seventh inning of the All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   The National League's infield had  &UR; Andres Galarraga (Venezuela)
at first,
 &UR; Fernando Vina (first generation American of Cuban heritage) at
second,  &UR; Edgar
 &UR; Renteria (Colombia) at shortstop and  &UR; Vinny Castilla (Mexico) at
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the number of Latins who were here, and it makes you
so proud to be one of them,'' said Chicago Cubs outfielder  &UR; Sammy
Sosa (Dominican), who did not play because of a sore shoulder. ``It
shows the world of our love for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 55 players who participated in the game, 17 were Latin.
Among the first-year All-Stars of Latin decent were  &UR; Rolando
Arrojo, who became the first Cuban defector to make an All-Star
team, Vina,  &UR; Omar Vizquel (Venezuela),  &UR; Bartolo Colon and  &UR; Ugueth
Urbina (Dominicans) and Renteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are more and more Latins making it to the major
leagues,'' Baltimore's &UR; Roberto Alomar said. ``We're showing we can
play at the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 39 Most Valuable Players, Alomar became the sixth
Latin-born player to win the award and third in the past nine
years. He joins  &UR; Juan Marichal (1965, Dominican), &UR; Tony Perez (1967,
Cuba),  &UR; Dave Concepcion (1982, Venezuela),  &UR; Julio Franco (1990,
Domincan) and
 &UR; Sandy Alomar (Puerto Rico), last year's MVP. &QL; 
Bronx bombs away &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees are having such an incredible season that
already there is talk of possibly winning an insane-sounding 120
games.
</P>
<P>
   With exactly 81 games remaining, the Yankees would finish 101-61
by going 40-41 the rest of the way. And they appear way too good to
play .500 ball the rest of the season, especially with 43 of their
remaining games to be played at Yankee Stadium, which has become
the in place to be in New York this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also should see the return of  &UR; Bernie Williams and
 &UR; Chili Davis before the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've played like a great team, no doubt about that,'' Mets
Manager &UR; 
 &UR; Bobby Valentine said. &QL; 
Shades of bloopers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Minnesota's  &UR; Bob Tewksbury retired St. Louis' hulking
first baseman,
 &UR; Mark McGwire, with a pair of slow-pitch-softball-looking pitches
last week, Cincinnati pitching coach &UR; Don Gullett got to thinking
about a game against the Pirates that featured Reds reliever &UR; Pedro
Borbon, who loved throwing a similar pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing a game in Pittsburgh in 1970 and  &UR; Roberto
Clemente was up in a crucial situation,'' Gullett said. ``Manager
 &UR; Sparky Anderson sent pitching coach  &UR; Larry Shepard to the mound to
give Borbon the message, `Don't throw that blooper pitch to
Clemente. I don't want to see the ball land in one of the three
rivers.' '' &QL; 
Clipped redbirds &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals wound up with the worst interleague
record, something that did not sit well with Manager  &UR; Tony La
Russa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time they have major league meetings, I'm going to
avoid the eyes of any National Leaguer I see,'' said La Russa,
whose Cardinals finished 4-9 against the AL. ``I'm embarrassed that
I'm letting the league down, and I'm embarrassed that these
American League clubs think this is what we are. It's adding insult
to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the Cardinals look worse is that their losses were
against the AL Central, which features only one club (Cleveland)
with a winning record. The rest of the division is a combined 46
games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, expected to strongly compete for the NL Central
title, is floundering under .500, and some of their players are
even ready to admit the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stink,'' said Cardinals outfielder  &UR; Brian Jordan, who leads
the NL in batting and is eligible for free agency after the season.
``No mystery about it. This puts you into a bad attitude. There'll
be some trades made here soon.'' &QL; 
Remember the bird &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is going bonkers over rookie right-hander  &UR; Matt
Anderson, selected first overall in last year's June draft. Already
talk around Motown is creating comparisons to another hard-throwing
right-hander who burst on the scene in 1976 _  &UR; Mark ``The Bird''
Fidrych.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, asked if he knew of Fidrych, replied, ``No. He was
here in 1976? That was the year I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has made quite an impression since being called up less
than two weeks ago. His fastball has already been clocked at 100
mph. The Tigers' closer of the future made several fans out of
Cincinnati hitters last week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dmitri Young swung and missed at three straight pitches from
Anderson, clocked at 99, 99 and 100 mph, then told teammate  &UR; Barry
Larkin, ``I wasn't even close to that last one.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said, ``I got news for you. You weren't close on any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 21, then threw another 100 mph fastball to the next
batter,  &UR; Willie
 &UR; Greene, a good fastball hitter who managed to foul the pitch back
to the screen before turning to Detroit catcher  &UR; Joe Oliver and
saying, ``I'm in trouble.'' &QL;

DODGERS REPORT CARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Whether you like Tom Lasorda or hate him, know
this. If anyone can make something of this Dodgers season, he is
the man.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the hell fire and brimstone that so endeared him to
fans and players for most of his 20 years as manager. This team is
far too smug for that approach. Lasorda, back now as interim
general manager, is gone if he doesn't turn around this dreadful
season and he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter how many Fox people he schmoozes. It might not
even matter how many games the Dodgers (43-44) win the rest of the
way. Many think the firing of manager Bill Russell and executive
vice president Fred Claire was the first step _ and not the last _
in a radical overhaul of the club.
</P>
<P>
   But Lasorda is a fighter and he desperately wants to keep his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he was passed over for the spot when Al Campanis was
fired in 1987, he dreamed of building his own team. He has never
been an interim anything.
</P>
<P>
   He can't go to Rupert Murdoch in November and say, ``Hey, look
at the way I cut San Diego's 13{-game lead in the West to four.''
That isn't going to work the way it did with Peter O'Malley. That
sends him back to kissing babies with someone like Pat Gillick
pulling the strings.
</P>
<P>
   For Lasorda, the future is now, beginning tonight with the
second-half opener against the Padres. The deal to acquire closer
Jeff Shaw from Cincinnati cost the Dodgers two players who could
have helped down the line. Shaw, however, can close out games Scott
Radinsky and Antonio Osuna couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   If Shaw remains the league's top save man the way he was with
the Reds, the Dodgers will pick up some games. Shaw also will build
a confidence in the starting rotation and the team in general.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda now needs to go out and get a fifth starter. The team
needs a winning streak and they aren't going to do that with a hole
in their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda talks a lot about 1983 when the team gained 10 games on
Atlanta in 11 days. What he doesn't say is that feat was the
Halley's Comet of comebacks. The Dodgers also used so much energy
getting back in the race, they fizzled in the final two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And that team was much younger than this.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Dodgers are so banged up, an $18.5 million player might
have trouble finding a training table.
</P>
<P>
   They are hoping to get back shortstop Jose Vizcaino, their
steadiest defensive player and valuable No. 2 hitter. His absence,
due to a badly sprained right ankle, put added pressure on leadoff
man Eric Young, who should have gone on the DL 10 days ago when he
strained his right quad for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions are won at the top of the order. The Dodgers learned
that last year with four hitters with 30 or more home runs, but a
second-place finish in the West. Young is to be applauded for his
grit, a rare virtue on past Dodger teams, but leading the league in
stolen bases is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, who replaced Eric Karros 10 days ago in the
cleanup spot, needs protection. Raul Mondesi, moved to the third
spot during the same shuffling, had a great road trip before the
break. He probably is the best all-around center fielder in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half last year, Mondesi batted .326 with 13 homers
and 39 RBI. But he also batted .251 overall with runners in scoring
position. That can't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, wounded by the demotion from fourth to fifth in the
order, won't have the same opportunities on offense, but the knee
injury that cost him 22 games at the beginning of the season is
much improved.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, the left-handed bat acquired in the May 15 Mike
Piazza trade, had a miserable first half. Even if he recovers
completely from the intestinal infection that zapped much of his
strength, Bonilla is not the same player who drove in 97 runs last
year for the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is coming off surgery to his left wrist and left
Achilles' tendon. Both injuries require at least a year to recover
fully. He also is 35 and is due $15 million over the next 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely the team will change his position unless it moves
Karros. Bonilla is too slow to play the outfield. The Dodgers liked
youngster Adrian Beltre during his brief trial at third, but they
want him playing everyday, which means Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have a favorable schedule in the second half with 14
of their first 18 at home. Between Aug. 7 and Sept. 6, they play 21
of 28 games at Dodger Stadium. They close the season with six
straight and nine of 12 at home.
</P>
<P>
   But will it matter? Will a veteran team respond to this
challenge when most have multi-year contracts? The Baltimore
Orioles, predicted by many to win the American League East are
38-50, 26{ games behind the New York Yankees. Their roster is
filled with potential free agents, anxious for new contracts, but
not anxious enough show they are worth more money.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda has all that to deal with in the final three months of
the season. The big trade for Mike Piazza failed to produce the
leadership they have been missing for years.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he has to allow new manager Glenn Hoffman to establish
a new identity, but it's difficult because Lasorda has waited so
long for this position.
</P>
<P>
   How long will he keep it? It still is worth coming to the
ballpark to find out. Dodger Report Card
</P>
<P>
   !tvspt2! &UR; !dtpost! &LR; OFFENSE &UR; !dtpost!!off! &LR;  &QL; 
It all starts with Eric Young, who leads the NL in stolen bases,
but he's been out of the lineup too much. Gary Sheffield has been
superb but needs support from Bobby Bonilla and Raul Mondesi. With
a hot streak, Eric Karros could get 100 RBI, but he has to realize
that barring an injury to Sheffield he will never be the cleanup
hitter here
again. &UR; !dlim! &LR; C- &UR; !dlim!!dtpost! &LR; !tvspt2!DEFENSE &UR; !off!!dtpost! &LR;  &QL; 
The addition of catcher Charles Johnson and shortstop Jose Vizcaino
plus the switch of Mondesi to center are improvements. But Bonilla
needs to have a consistent second half at third or teams will
expose him. &UR; !dlim! &LR; B &UR; !dlim!!dtpost! &LR; !tvspt2!STARTING
PITCHING &UR; !off!!dtpost! &LR;  &QL; 
No one has stepped up to take Ramon Martinez's place. Ismael Valdes

short on
experience. &UR; !dlim! &LR; C &UR; !dlim!!dtpost! &LR; !tvspt2!BULLPEN &UR; !off!!dtpost! &LR;  &QL; 
Bringing in Jeff Shaw not only means saves, it means putting Scott
Radinsky and Antonio Osuna back where they pitch best, in setup
roles. That also means less quality time for guys like Greg
McMichael, who has allowed eight of his last 10 inherited base
runners to
score. &UR; !d &LR; lim!C &UR; !dlim!!dtpost! &LR; !tvspt2!BENCH &UR; !off!!dtpost! &LR;  &QL;

here. &UR; !dlim! &LR; F &UR; !dlim!!dtpost! &LR; !tvspt2!MANAGER &UR; !off!!dtpost! &LR;  &QL; 
Depends who you are calling the manager. Is it Lasorda, who walks
through the clubhouse trying to pump guys up, or is it Glenn

doesn't connect with these players, Hoffman needs to have a
presence in the 
clubhouse. &UR; !dlim! &LR; INC. &UR; !dlim!!dtpost! &LR; !tvspt2!OVERALL &UR; !off!!dtpost! &LR;

It would be easy for the veterans to mail in the rest of the

close out victories. &UR; !dlim! &LR; C-!end!

LETHBRIDGE'S CUST BUSTS OUT WITH 12-FOR-24 SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Jack Cust, the Diamondbacks' No. 1 pick in the 1997 amateur
draft, accepted congratulations from fans after word spread that
the grand slam he had just hit for Lethbridge happened on his 19th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great story, except that it wasn't true. Not the grand
slam, but the part about his birthday. It seems that Cust turned 19
on Jan. 7, not July 1. Somehow the numbers got transposed, probably
because in Canada the day comes before the month. So 1/7 was
interpreted as July 1 in Lethbridge, Alberta. Get it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they got mixed up,'' he said. ``It was kind of
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so funny, however, is how Cust is treating Pioneer League
pitchers. A week ago, he was hitting .207 with no home runs, no
RBIs and 12 strikeouts in 29 at-bats. But after a 12-for-24 blitz,
he is up to .340 with a homer, nine RBIs and only five more
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Equally as impressive, he has walked 21 times, more than twice
as many times as the next player on the Black Diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to get my swing back,'' he said. ``I just feel
real good the way I'm hitting the ball. I was thinking too much at
the plate. Anyone who plays baseball knows you shouldn't think too
much. You've got a fraction of a second to recognize the pitch and
hit the pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Cust, drafted for his power hitting out of a New Jersey high
school, is playing left field, where his future in the organization
lies. Earlier in the year, he played first base for a couple of
weeks at Class A South Bend after
 &UR; Wyley Steelmon got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't go so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable in South Bend,'' he said. ``I was
pressing a little bit. Here, I'm not worrying about the home runs.
I figure they'll come.''
</P>
<P>
   Cust hit well his first week there, ``but I tried to do too much
after that,'' he said. ``I hit a couple of singles and doubles, and
then I wanted to drive the ball even more. I tried to pull
everything. That's not really my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a year out of high school, Cust is learning to be patient
about his progress. He just wishes his friends would understand
that he won't be joining the Diamondbacks any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask me, `Is it going to be next year? Is it going to be
next year?' '' he said. ``Nobody really understands baseball until
they're part of the game. It's not like basketball, where you see
somebody in college and then they're playing against  &UR; (Michael)
Jordan on Sunday afternoon.'' &QL; 
Sidewinders stuff &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the All-Star break, Tucson had won only twice in
its past nine games. Pitcher  &UR; Vladimir Nunez won both games.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the team's leaders at the break: batting average _  &UR; Mike
Stoner (.375); hits _  &UR; Edwin Diaz (82); homers _  &UR; Rob Ryan (12);
RBIs _ Ryan (46); stolen bases _  &UR; Hanley Frias (13); wins _  &UR; Bob
Wolcott (6); strikeouts _ Wolcott (64); saves _  &UR; Ben Ford (9).
Ryan, an outfielder, replaced  &UR; Danny
 &UR; Klassen in the Triple-A All-Star Game in Norfolk on Wednesday
night. &QL; 
Brief stints &QL; 
High Desert, which has taken over first place in the California
League in the second half, had won four straight through Tuesday,
including a 21-10 victory over Lancaster. The Mavericks had 23
hits.
</P>
<P>
   High Desert right-hander  &UR; Brad Penny leads the California League
with 123 strikeouts and needs 20 more to break the league record
set last year by Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Adam Neubart, a 43rd-round pick from Rutgers in the
June draft, replaced Kevin Sweeney on the Mavs roster. Sweeney went
on the disabled list because of a pulled back muscle. Catcher Rod
Barajas is on the DL (shoulder). Josh McAfee came up from
Lethbridge and Brad Allison was sent down from Tucson. &QL;

RAINBOW FAMILY NET NABS MURDER SUSPECT

   Peace, love, happiness and a suspected murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Those elementscombined unexpectedly Friday at the Rainbow Family
Gathering in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, when the
Rainbows' unarmed peacekeepers captured a suspect wanted in a
brutal Florida murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my long law-enforcement career, this is something I have
never seen happen,'' said Sgt. Jim Morse of the Apache County
Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 25,000 people, and being so unstructured, he must've
figured it was a good place to hide out. He was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, police around the Carnara Lake campsite near
Springerville, Ariz., had been expecting the worst from the
25,000-plus hippies who infused the federal forest with hugs,
drumming and marijuana smoke.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, however, the Rainbows called in sheriff's
deputies, who arrived to find 25 members of the Rainbows' security
team, the Shanti-Sena, standing in a ring around Joseph Giebel, who
was bound in a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies took him to the county jail in Springerville, Ariz.,
where he is being held for questioning by Florida police.
</P>
<P>
   The story started two months ago, when the primary suspect in
the rape and murder of a Jenson Beach woman escaped police.
</P>
<P>
   The case captured Florida headlines: Sherri Lynn Jett was raped,
beaten on the head, back, and arms, and eventually bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   After they learned that Giebel had attended past Rainbow Family
Gatherings, Key West police made a shot in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   They sent a description of the suspect and information to the
Rainbow Family's home page on the Internet, and apparently their
warning was heeded.
</P>
<P>
   When two Apache County sheriff's deputies arrived at the camp at
11 p.m. Friday night, the suspect was already in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Local police aren't guessing as to how the Shanti-Sena, an
unstructured organization that carries no weapons, captured Giebel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire operation was very coordinated,'' Morse said.
``They had already in effect handled this when we arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shanti-Sena are only identified by small badges made of
pieces of bark and other materials. The group, which includes many
military veterans, has policed past gatherings successfully.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the group captured a rapist at the campground,
binding him with duct tape and turning him over to police.
</P>
<P>
   With an ideology of universal love and non-violence, the
gatherings do function like a giant family.
</P>
<P>
   For such a huge crowd with only temporary shelter and limited
utilities, police were surprised that only 109 arrests were made,
largely for drug and alcohol violations.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering ended Saturday. The site is mostly empty now,
except for the Rainbows' cleanup crews, who will work two or three
more weeks to clean and reseed the area. &QL;

SCREENWRITER'S BODY PULLED FROM AQUEDUCT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHERRY JOE CROSBY, JESSE HIESTAND AND BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ The yearlong mystery of missing screenwriter
Gary Devore came to a tragic end Wednesday when his body was found
in his Ford Explorer submerged in 12 to 15 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   An amateur sleuth calling himself ``Dr. Find It'' who had been
relentlessly tracking the disappearance led authorities to Devore's
vehicle, which apparently ran off the Antelope Valley Freeway when
the writer fell asleep and plunged into the California Aqueduct
south of Palmdale, 62 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
Devore's skeletal remains were found in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Devore was on his way home to Carpinteria in Santa Barbara
County northwest of Los Angeles from a visit with actress Marsha
Mason in Santa Fe, N.M., to work on a script when he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   For Devore's wife, the discovery only triggered more questions
and new concerns.
</P>
<P>
   She said she could make no sense of how San Diego resident
Douglas Crawford could solve a mystery that had baffled authorities
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know how the hell he knew. And I want to know who he
is and I want to know why, if he was interested in that
information, he didn't come forward far, far sooner,'' said Wendy
Oates-Devore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know why no one else, when there was a $100,000
reward, could find this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that there were no preliminary indications of
foul play and that dental records will be used to verify Devore's
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford led authorities to the Explorer via e-mail after
conducting his own long-shot search.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by news stories last month on the anniversary of
Devore's disappearance, Crawford recalled the case of an Orange
County woman who disappeared en route to Montana: Three years
later, her car was found in the muddy water of the California
Aqueduct _ but only after another crash occurred at the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford examined Devore's route, concluded that he had fallen
asleep and crashed sometime after his last 1:15 a.m. call to his
wife. He figured there was only one place for a vehicle to
disappear: the California Aqueduct, where it crosses the Antelope
Valley Freeway near Avenue S.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing Devore's likely route from Barstow home to Carpinteria,
Crawford drove south on the Antelope Valley Freeway and stopped
where it crosses the aqueduct.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail Crawford subsequently sent to Devore's publicist
Michael Sands, he wrote: ``I climbed down the embankment to the
aqueduct access road. I first saw the large piece of white metal
laying slightly up the embankment. This appeared to be a hood
re-enforcement for a white Ford, possibly an Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford then found a broken, plastic light cover, imprinted
with a serial number. He took the part to a Ford dealership, to
confirm it came from an Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   When Sands got Crawford's e-mail, he contacted the Santa Barbara
County Sheriff's Department. They discounted the significance of
finding Explorer parts beside the aqueduct while Crawford persisted
in asking for a search.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, CHP officials visited the aqueduct Tuesday with
Crawford, checking the area where he had found the car parts. On
Wednesday, officials returned to the aqueduct with the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department Emergency Services team of six scuba
divers.
</P>
<P>
   The sport-utility vehicle was found with all four wheels on the
ground directly beneath the overpass. The license plate matched
that of Devore's missing vehicle, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised we saw anything,'' diver Larry McCabe said. ``I
didn't know if we were on a wild goose chase. ... I didn't know how
good the information was. I was just hoping we would find
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer was filled with water and covered in mud and algae,
its undercarriage dripping strands of aquatic plants, as it was
slowly pulled from the water. All its windows were smashed, and
major body damage was evident on the driver's side and front end.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that ``partial human remains'' were found in the
driver's seat, with the seat belt fastened. The body was clad in
cowboy boots, western style jeans, a western shirt and a
distinctive large belt buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials defended their work during the past year,
saying they had little evidence and widely varying theories about
Devore's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area has been driven over and flown over by helicopter
and fixed-wing numerous times,'' said Sgt. Michael Burridge of the
Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department, which has been handling the
missing person case filed for the Carpinteria resident. ``I have
been over this bridge numerous times.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Crawford, Burridge added: ``I'm just glad he was
able to read it and give us the ability to put some resolution to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Devore disappeared in the early hours of June 28, 1997, while
driving back to Carpinteria from Santa Fe, where he had been
working on a script at Mason's home.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   He called his wife about 1:15 a.m. to say he had passed Barstow
and would be home in a few hours. He never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his disappearance, Devore had been upbeat because
he had ``broken the back of the script,'' a remake of the 1949
movie ``The Big Steal,'' Sands said Wednesday. Devore would have
made his directorial debut with the RKO film.
</P>
<P>
   When Devore failed to return home, his wife offered a $10,000
reward but later withdrew it for fear that bounty hunters would
kill the screenwriter to collect the money. Later, a $100,000
reward was offered in his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Devore's screen credits include ``Back Roads,'' which co-starred
Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones, ``The Dogs of War'' with
Christopher Walken and ``Running Scared'' with Gregory Hines and
Billy Crystal.
</P>
<P>
   For Oates-Devore, there are still unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the autopsy has been performed and I know that someone
did not put a bullet in him or anything else, then I will be glad
for him that there was no pain for him other than his car,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know this was an accident. I want it proven to me.
At this point, I at least deserve that.''

AS GATE RISES, STEINBRENNER SOFTENS ON BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 15th graf to make it read Yankees rank ninth among major
league teams in attendance, not simply among American League
teams.)  (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Yankees winning games at a historic pace and
drawing fans to Yankee Stadium at a record rate, George
Steinbrenner said Wednesday that gains in attendance could lead to
discussions about keeping the team in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Tampa, Fla., Steinbrenner said that
if the Yankees draw 3 million fans this season and could be
guaranteed similar attendance in the future, he would be willing to
talk about staying in Yankee Stadium after the team's lease expires
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are on pace to draw a franchise-best 2.83 million
fans this season; the franchise record was 2.63 million in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It was a startling concession from Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner, who has complained for almost a decade that he
cannot make money because of traffic and safety concerns in the
Bronx and a dearth of luxury boxes at 75-year-old Yankee Stadium.
With the support of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, he has openly
campaigned for a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the 3 million and then we'll talk about the Bronx after the
season,'' Steinbrenner said. ``That isn't getting me where I want
to be, but maybe it would be worth talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   While Steinbrenner was not specific about what Bronx officials
could do to guarantee 3 million fans, he issued a challenge to
Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer to find a way to make it
worth his while to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Fernando Ferrer want to guarantee we'll get 3 million?''
he said. ``Tell them to put their money where their mouth is. If he
can guarantee we'll get 3 million, then I'll sit down and talk
about the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number still doesn't get me where I need to be, but he
threw that figure out, so I'm calling his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While Steinbrenner offered, for the first time, a starting point
for discussions about keeping the team in the Bronx, any talks
would surely include additional parking, easing the traffic
congestion around the stadium and finding a way to increase the
number of luxury boxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees, who begin the second half of the season Thursday
night in St. Petersburg with a stunning 61-20 record, have
attracted 1,362,987 fans in 39 home dates, an average of 34,948 per
game.
</P>
<P>
   They would have to average 38,977 fans in their final 42 home
dates to exceed 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer, whose office issued a news release this week which
focused on the pursuit of the 3 million mark, was excited about the
new expression of interest in remaining in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yankees have never reached the 3 million mark,
which has long been considered a sort of magic number in
discussions of attendance, the Mets did it in 1987 and 1988 after
winning a World Series championship in 1986. The Toronto Blue Jays
drew 4 million in 1991, 1992 and 1993, and the Colorado Rockies set
the major league record of 4.48 million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly willing to accept that challenge,'' said Ferrer.
``The money is there. Let's build the Metro North station so more
fans can come to the games. Let's promote the players. Let's build
up the Bronx instead of trying to suppress attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   While issuing his challenge, Steinbrenner also scoffed at the
Yankees' 9 percent increase in attendance over last year at this
time, pointing out that they are still ninth among major league
teams in attendance. He continued to claim that fans hesitate to
attend night games at the Stadium because of the ``perception''
that it is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all this talk about record numbers,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``I think we'll do 2.6. It's going to have to be very good
just to get us to 2.6, whereas Cleveland and Baltimore will be
about 4 million. The perception, right or wrong, is that people
don't want to come to the Bronx at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer, pointing out that the Stadium is one of the safest
places in New York when the Yankees are playing because of the
heightened police presence there, said, ``The only crime at Yankee
Stadium would be taking them to Manhattan and spending over a
billion dollars to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance data can be used to bolster both sides of the debate.
Those in favor of keeping the Yankees in the Bronx argue that this
season's increase proves that a winning team can thrive in the
Bronx. Provide a dominating club, they argue, and fans will pour
through the turnstiles. If the current facility is improved, and a
new Metro North terminal in the Bronx gives better access,
supporters say, then the figures will increase more.
</P>
<P>
   But those in favor of relocating the Yankees, like Steinbrenner
and Giuliani, can argue that attendance would be even higher if the
games were being played in Manhattan, and that this season is an
aberration because the Yankees have played exceptionally well. Give
the fans a new stadium along the lines of Baltimore's Camden Yards
or Cleveland's Jacobs Field, preferably with a retractable roof, in
a location friendlier to mass transit and they will pour through
the turnstiles. In that case, supporters of a Manhattan stadium
say, the team would not have to win 75 percent of its games to
attract fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location, location, location,'' Steinbrenner said. ``We'd sell
out every night if we played in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner provided statistics that Yankee officials had
compiled documenting the average attendance of five teams with
recently built stadiums, for the 10 years before they moved and the
years since. The teams had all experienced a tremendous spurt in
attendance entering this season, he said, from 41 percent for the
Chicago White Sox to 43 percent for the Texas Rangers, 62 percent
for the Baltimore Orioles, 75 for the Toronto Blue Jays 135 percent
for the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to compete with Cleveland for an American League
Championship and I was competing with Baltimore for the division,''
said Steinbrenner. ``How do I compete when they draw 15,000 to
20,000 more fans a game?''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Yankees have the wealthiest cable television
contract in history for a sports franchise at more than $500
million, Steinbrenner said, ``I also have a payroll that is
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if the fans remain enamored by the
Yankees' pursuit of greatness during the regular season. While the
Yankees are on pace to set a major league record with 122
victories, how appealing will it be to witness No. 79 on a sunny
afternoon in August if beaches and barbecues beckon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they would come,'' Steinbrenner said. ``They've wanted
winners in this city a long time. Look at how the Knicks and the
Rangers draw. They're sold out every game. Location, location,
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer blasted the notion of a potential fall in interest this
summer, saying: ``I don't see any early indication of that. Fourth
of July weekend, when everybody is doing something else, Yankee
attendance was great. That argument goes out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner could use the heftier attendance figures to argue
that this is as impressive as it will get, and that the numbers
actually provide a reason for the Yankees to move. He could say
that 3 million fans is commendable, but that it occurred in a
once-in-a-lifetime season and is still less than a handful of other
teams have drawn. Or, Steinbrenner could see 3 million and then,
surprisingly, see the Bronx in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do 3 million,'' Steinbrenner said several times. ``Say,
`George, we're going to do this for you.' I'm doing my part. Let's
see them do their part. Don't come in with 2.6. It's got to be 3
million.''

LASORDA MUST FIND WAY TO WIN TO STAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether you like Tom Lasorda or hate him, know
this. If anyone can make something of this Dodgers season, he is
the man.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the hellfire and brimstone that so endeared him to fans
and players for most of his 20 years as manager. This team is far
too smug for that approach. Lasorda, back now as interim general
manager, is gone if he doesn't turn around this dreadful season and
he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter how many Fox people he schmoozes. It might not
even matter how many games the Dodgers (43-44) win the rest of the
way. Many think the firing of manager Bill Russell and executive
vice president Fred Claire was the first step _ and not the last _
in a radical overhaul of the club.
</P>
<P>
   But Lasorda is a fighter and he desperately wants to keep his
job. Long before he was passed over for the spot when Al Campanis
was fired in 1987, he dreamed of building his own team. He has
never been an interim anything.
</P>
<P>
   He can't go to Rupert Murdoch in November and say, ``Hey, look
at the way I cut San Diego's 13{-game lead in the West to four.''
That isn't going to work the way it did with Peter O'Malley. That
sends him back to kissing babies, and someone like Pat Gillick
pulling the strings.
</P>
<P>
   For Lasorda, the future is now, beginning tonight with the
second-half opener against the Padres. The deal to acquire closer
Jeff Shaw from Cincinnati cost the Dodgers two players who could
have helped down the line. Shaw, however, can close out games Scott
Radinsky and Antonio Osuna couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   If Shaw remains the league's top save man the way he was with
the Reds, the Dodgers will pick up some games. Shaw also will build
a confidence in the starting rotation and the team in general.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda now needs to go out and get a fifth starter. The team
needs a winning streak and they aren't going to do that with a hole
in their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda talks a lot about 1983, when the team gained 10 games on
Atlanta in 11 days. What he doesn't say is that feat was the
Halley's Comet of comebacks. The Dodgers also used so much energy
getting back in the race, they fizzled in the final two weeks. And
that team was much younger than this.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Dodgers are so banged up, an $18.5 million player might
have trouble finding a training table.
</P>
<P>
   They are hoping to get back shortstop Jose Vizcaino, their
steadiest defensive player and valuable No.2 hitter. His absence,
because of a badly sprained right ankle, put added pressure on
leadoff man Eric Young, who should have gone on the DL 10 days ago
when he strained his right quad for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions are won at the top of the order. The Dodgers learned
that last year with four hitters who had 30 or more home runs but a
second-place finish in the West. Young is to be applauded for his
grit, a rare virtue on past Dodgers teams, but leading the league
in stolen bases is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, who replaced Eric Karros 10 days ago in the
cleanup spot, needs protection. Raul Mondesi, moved to the third
spot during the same shuffling, had a great road trip before the
break. He probably is the best all-around center fielder in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half last year, Mondesi batted .326 with 13 homers
and 39 RBI. But he also batted .251 overall with runners in scoring
position. That can't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, wounded by the demotion from fourth to fifth in the
order, won't have the same opportunities on offense, but the knee
injury that cost him 22 games at the beginning of the season is
much improved.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, the left-handed bat acquired in the May 15 Mike
Piazza trade, had a miserable first half. Even if he recovers
completely from the intestinal infection that zapped much of his
strength, Bonilla is not the same player who drove in 97 runs last
year for the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is coming off surgery to his left wrist and left
Achilles' tendon. Both injuries require at least a year to recover
fully. He also is 35 and is due $15 million over the next 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely the team will change his position unless it moves
Karros. Bonilla is too slow to play the outfield. The Dodgers liked
youngster Adrian Beltre during his brief trial at third, but they
want him playing every day, which means Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have a favorable schedule in the second half with 14
of their first 18 at home. Between Aug. 7 and Sept. 6, they play 21
of 28 games at Dodger Stadium. They close the season with six
straight and nine of 12 at home.
</P>
<P>
   But will it matter? Will a veteran team respond to this
challenge when most have multiyear contracts? The Baltimore
Orioles, predicted by many to win the American League East are
38-50, 26{ games behind the New York Yankees. Their roster is
filled with potential free agents, anxious for new contracts but
not anxious enough show they are worth more money.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda has all that to deal with in the final three months of
the season. The big trade for Mike Piazza failed to produce the
leadership they have been missing for years.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he has to allow new manager Glenn Hoffman to establish
a new identity, but it's difficult because Lasorda has waited so
long for this position.
</P>
<P>
   How long will he keep it? It still is worth coming to the
ballpark to find out.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   It all starts with Eric Young, who leads the NL in stolen bases,
but he's been out of the lineup too much. Gary Sheffield has been
superb but needs support from Bobby Bonilla and Raul Mondesi. With
a hot streak, Eric Karros could get 100 RBI, but he has to realize
that barring an injury to Sheffield he will never be the cleanup
hitter here again. C-
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The addition of catcher Charles Johnson and shortstop Jose
Vizcaino plus the switch of Mondesi to center are improvements. But
Bonilla needs to have a consistent second half at third or teams
will expose him. B
</P>
<P>
   STARTING PITCHING
</P>
<P>
   No one has stepped up to take Ramon Martinez's place. Ismael
Valdes had two brilliant starts lately but has not shown ace
tendencies. Neither has Chan Ho Park. Darren Dreifort has the tools
but is short on experience. C
</P>
<P>
   BULLPEN
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in Jeff Shaw not only means saves, it means putting
Scott Radinsky and Antonio Osuna back where they pitch best, in
setup roles. That also means less quality time for guys like Greg
McMichael, who has allowed eight of his last 10 inherited base
runners to score. C
</P>
<P>
   BENCH
</P>
<P>
   Except for Matt Luke, this group has not shown up. Jim
Eisenreich acknowledges he has been a flop the past two years. Juan
Castro is solid backup infielder with emphasis on backup. Too many
guys just happy to be here. F
</P>
<P>
   MANAGER
</P>
<P>
   Depends who you are calling the manager. Is it Lasorda, who
walks through the clubhouse trying to pump guys up, or is it Glenn
Hoffman, who has gotten good marks for game management? Lasorda
doesn't connect with these players, Hoffman needs to have a
presence in the clubhouse. INC.
</P>
<P>
   OVERALL
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for the veterans to mail in the rest of the
season. Everyone has a multiyear contract except Johnson. Veterans
blamed the moves for the first-half mediocrity. No one looked in
the mirror. Shaw will add confidence because the team knows he will
close out victories. C-

SHOOTERS FAIL TO SPARK FIRE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Well, so much for a winning streak. For the
third time around, the Sparks failed to figure out the Sacramento
Monarchs, who escaped this time with a 76-71 victory in front of a
Los Angeles franchise-low 4,851 at the Forum on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tangela Smith came off the bench to lead the Monarchs with
career-high 20 points on 7 of 11 from the field, and LaTasha Byears
added 18.
</P>
<P>
   Poor shooting haunted the Sparks, who hit for 36 percent, while
the Monarchs made a 52 percent connection.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were looking to string together some wins during this
four-game home stand after defeating the Eastern Conference leading
Charlotte Sting on Tuesday. But so much for that. The streak ended
at one. The Sparks are in the cellar at 3-8. The Monarchs moved two
spots forward to third in the conference with a 4-8 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Sparks had their chances, but they were denied.
</P>
<P>
   Franthea Price (10 points) made only one of three free throws,
but it gave the Monarchs a 70-69 advantage with 1:25 to go. Then
Lisa Leslie hit a 12-foot baseline shot with 1:04. Byears' layup
returned the lead to Sacramento with 46 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' Pamela McGee was then charged with an offensive foul
to put the ball back to her former team. McGee then picked up her
fifth foul, sending Byears to the charity stripe for two points
with 25 seconds to play as the Monarchs took a three-point lead and
the victory.

FRANCHISE WITHERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Antonio Osuna asks to be traded, Eric Karros
breathes a sigh of relief when he sees his jersey hanging in his
locker and Gary Sheffield has to be talked into playing in the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition dies ponderously. The once-youthful, glowing face of
the organization formerly known as the Dodgers is growing gray and
gaunt in front of our eyes. Those who can bear to look will see in
the first half of the Dodgers' season all the classic stages of a
grave illness as outlined by physician Elisabeth Kubler-Ross some
30 years back.
</P>
<P>
   Denial, anger, bargaining and depression. The Dodgers have been
there, done and felt that. And if they eventually pull the trigger
on the long-discussed deal that would send Ismael Valdes and/or
Wilton Guerrero or some other combination of youth and promise to
Seattle for veteran left-hander Randy Johnson, you'll know they've
reached the fifth and final stage, acceptance of the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   What is dying is an era when players culled from the farm teams
matured into stars, or at least everyday players whose constancy
and consistency anchored the mother club. The Dodgers squad that
will host San Diego today in the first game of the rest of the
season will have 10 faces that didn't grace the opening-day roster.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 percent turnover in a matter of a few months, while
wildly out of character for a franchise heretofore considered as
sleepy as Rip Van Winkle, is consistent with baseball's depraved
new world where everything changes but the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers under previous owner Peter O'Malley kept brushing
off signs the times kept flashing, never more obdurately than when
they had the opportunity to secure the services of catcher Mike
Piazza well into the next millennium. They balked, signing him for
two years instead. Their denial of baseball's evolving economics
cracked open the door that led to Piazza's departure this spring as
well as the window of opportunity for him to become baseball's
first $100-million man.
</P>
<P>
   With new ballparks _ and new teams _ springing up across the
country like concrete mushrooms, more teams have revenues to burn.
Big-name, free-agent ballplayers have been the beneficiaries,
commanding salaries in upwards of $70 million from a few cash-rich
teams while the rest of the league struggles to adapt (or in some
cases, survive).
</P>
<P>
   The result is something only a moving company could love;
players changing addresses more often than people in the
witness-protection program. A USA Today survey found that 60
percent of the players on opening-day rosters were not with the
organization that they first played for. Paul Konerko's abrupt
departure to Cincinnati last week notwithstanding, the Dodgers
remain ahead of the curve, with 11 players on their current 25-man
roster who have bled only Dodger Blue (in addition, there are two
others, Todd Hollandsworth and Ramon Martinez, on the disabled
list).
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Konerko, the reigning minor-league player of the
year, would have been untouchable. A franchise doesn't produce five
consecutive Rookies of the Year, after all, by throwing its top
prospects to the tradewinds. But for all the success of their
first-year players, the Dodgers have been abject failures in the
standings, producing nary a single win in the postseason this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the Dodgers under O'Malley were stuck on
potential for an awfully long while. The same won't be said of the
team under the Fox Group, which has moved swiftly to dispense of
the new in favor of the tried-and-true.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers fail to make up the 13{ games that separate them
from the division-leading San Diego Padres or aren't able to
surpass the five teams currently ahead of them in the wild-card
race, it won't be for a lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox braintrust was angered by Piazza's preoccupation with
making baseball history to the possible exclusion of enhancing
Dodgers lore. So Piazza _ along with Todd Zeile _ was shipped to
Florida for catcher Charles Johnson, infielder Bobby Bonilla and
outfielders Sheffield and Jim Eisenreich. The quartet is nine
months removed from a successful World Series run, which shouldn't
be long enough to have forgotten what it takes in the clubhouse and
on the field to be a champion.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Fred Claire was infuriated by Hideo Nomo's
petulance _ his inability to find the plate no doubt fueled the
flames. So the pitcher was dropped from the roster and traded to
the Mets for pitcher Greg McMichael and Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that the Dodgers added more experience without
getting appreciably older; their opening-day roster averaged 28.8
years (it stands today at 28.5).
</P>
<P>
   The decisions to fire Claire and manager Bill Russell and give
interim manager Glenn Hoffman a broom to clean house if he saw fit
smacked of desperation. It was as though president Bob Graziano
made a Faustian pact (in this case, Tommy Lasorda), trading
steadfastness for the promise of a quick turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   There's no good time to pull the plug on tradition, but now
seems a particularly curious time to do it. With the Padres barely
discernible on the horizon and the organization in a state of flux,
a case could have been made to let the boys play out the summer, if
only so Graziano and Lasorda could discern who are the men among
them. What better way to read talent than by taking it off the
shelf?
</P>
<P>
   A lineup with Konerko, Guerrero, Adrian Beltre, Juan Castro and
Dennis Reyes in it would have afforded Lasorda the chance to
eyeball the future. And had Russell been allowed to play out the
hand he was dealt, his strengths and weaknesses also would have
come into sharper focus.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Dodgers have invested an awful lot in a season
that itself may be on life support.

TYSON TO HAVE EAR OF PANEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Tyson, part III?
</P>
<P>
   The first two parts in this trilogy were as gripping as any
drama in recent boxing history. And the conclusion _ assuming it
happens _ promises to be just as intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, banned from boxing by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission after biting off a portion of Evander Holyfield's ear
last June 28 in Las Vegas, can apply for reinstatement beginning
today.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said he will file the
application with the commission sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after the filing, Tyson would have his hearing
before the commission panel that banned him. If he gets approval _
most believe that he will _ he could be fighting again as soon as
October. Most believe the public will be eager to pay good money _
!ital!a lot!off! of good money _ to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be bigger than ever. Wait and see,'' said Jay Larkin,
head of Showtime sports, which has Tyson under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the most disgusting incident in recent boxing
history might've been the best thing that could've happened to
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter who devastated his opponents early in his career was
mauled by Holyfield _ a 25-1 underdog at one point _ before the
fight was stopped 47 seconds into the 11th round when they met for
the first time on Nov. 9, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In their second bout, which demolished all records with 1.95
million pay-per-view buys, Tyson appeared to be on his way to a
similar fate when ... ``I snapped,'' he said shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson lost the fight but probably saved himself from losing his
drawing power. Even if it's clear he's not the fighter he once was,
he seems to have enhanced his very marketable image as a wild man.
</P>
<P>
   ``As twisted as this sounds, this rejuvenated his career
again,'' said Teddy Atlas, Tyson's one-time trainer and one of his
most vociferous critics. ``It's just like jail (his three-year term
for rape) rejuvenated his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on his way to being over with, to getting knocked out
again by Holyfield. Then he quit in a way that saved him. He could
keep his image, his savage image. And as long as he has that, the
mystique lives.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at 32, what does he have left in the ring?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, according to most observers. Holyfield twice exposed
Tyson for what he is. He has the speed and power of his youth, but
he's small for a heavyweight _ around 5-foot-10, 220 pounds _ and
his skills have deteriorated, as that of many brawlers seem to do
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Tyson's primary weapon _ intimidation _ was lost on
Holyfield and might now be lost on most other capable fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll never again be what he was,'' said respected trainer
Emanuel Steward. ``A big part of what he was was his aura of
invincibility. That's gone now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very difficult for him.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's reinstated, he'll likely face a marginal opponent in his
first fight back and, perhaps early next year, could take on
Holyfield one more time in what might be the most lucrative bout
ever.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem likely the commission will spare him this fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the ear fight, Tyson appears to have done all
the right things. Aside from a harmless romp in professional
wrestling, he has kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   He dumped the characters who handled his career since his
release from prison _ promoter Don King and co-managers John Horne
and Rory Holloway, whom Tyson is suing on charges of they bilked
him out of millions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Finkel, he has hired record-business attorneys
Jeff Wald and Irving Azoff to handle his business affairs. Tyson
reportedly is trying to get into the music business.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected offers to fight overseas, which presumably would've
sabotaged any chance of reinstatement here.
</P>
<P>
   All this, combined with his public apology to Holyfield _ which
Holyfield accepted _ works in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   That Tyson's presence translates into millions of dollars to
Nevada and everyone else associated with his fights could be the
clincher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a year,'' said Finkel, Holyfield's former adviser.
``He's changed the things that probably weren't good for him. He's
led a good family life, he's done charitable work and he's gotten
into no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imposing a lifetime ban or something like that is ridiculous.
The person who was injured has forgiven him. Don't deprive someone
their livelihood for life over an incident that was emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will get an opportunity to state his case.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Carano, the only member of the five-person commission
panel who was not around last year, said he will withhold judgment
until the hearing. At the same time, he !ital!does!off! have an
opinion of the fighter himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing needs Mike Tyson, boxing needs excitement,'' said
Carano, formerly a backup quarterback with the Dallas Cowboys who
is now in hotel marketing in Las Vegas. ``The question now is: Can
boxing stand Mike Tyson?''

HIGHER SCORES HAVE PREDOMINATED

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those rascals at the U.S. Golf Association are sure having a fun
summer. They've already staged two of their big national
championships to identify the planet's best golfer by either
gender, age group, ability to impersonate a walking, shot-making
billboard or just play golf for fun.
</P>
<P>
   And what jokesters they are.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after showing the best male players in the world what
it's like to be thankful for reaching a par-4 in 3 and getting off
the green with a 2-putt, they showed the world's best women players
that golf can still be a game of pluses.
</P>
<P>
   Like plus-32 over par for last-place finisher Kim Bauer to
plus-6, which is where youngsters Se Ri Pak and Jenny Chuasiriporn
found themselves at the end of regulation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pak finally emerged the winner after 20 more holes on Monday in
what was the most exciting women's open in memory. And who knows,
maybe the USGA will wind up being responsible for creating golf's
next great rivalry. Both Pak and Chuasiriporn are 20 and plan to be
around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, with zero fanfare, is living up the the kind of
expectations some set for Tiger Woods, who downplays any talk of a
rivalry with the other young guns of the PGA Tour. She's a rookie
and has already won back-to-back majors on the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   So far the best shot of the year has to be Pak's pitch while
standing knee deep in a water hazard on the 18th playoff hole. And
she's already got a Woods-style endorsement deal with Samsung, the
giant Korean electronics company.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn plans to finish her senior year at Duke University,
though her personality is well-suited for and needed on the ladies
professional tour.
</P>
<P>
   __ The next stop: Up next on the USGA's summer road show is the
U.S. Senior Open at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, tournament officials promised to grow Open-style rough
at Riviera. Look for grass deep enough to swallow small animals and
golf bags.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior Open, July 20-26, will have its usual famous field,
which still includes Jack Nicklaus. He will skip next month's PGA
Championship but plans to play in this week's Senior players
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has a bad left hip, which hurts his game. But it is
still good enough for a sixth place finish at this year's Masters
and 43rd place at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Senior Open features two junior golf clinics hosted
by former champion Dave Stockton and tour pros Jim Dent and Al
Geiberger. The clinics will be from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. July 20
and 21 at Riviera's driving range. The clinics will be limited to
200 participants each day from the L.A. County Sheriff's Youth
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   __ Golf and the law: A survey by Menlo Park-based The
Affiliates, a staffing service specializing in filling legal
positions, found that 20 percent of the attorneys responding listed
golf as their favorite sport, nearly double the amount who liked to
spend time with the wife, kids and pets.
</P>
<P>
   Reading was favored by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wearing out Nike: Camarillo's Chris Zambri is making steady
progress up the Nike Tour money list. This year he's played in 14
events, winning $83,259, good for second place.
</P>
<P>
   The top finisher receives exempt status on the regular tour next
year and the numbers two through 15 earn their tour cards.

FLY-ANGLING TECHNIQUE PROVES VALUABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCLOUD, Calif. _ In hockey, high-sticking is a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On the Upper McCloud River, it's a goal... and one of the surest
ways to put fish on a fly when flows are furious and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   The fly-angling technique involves raising the rod high off the
water to keep the floating line from being grabbed by the current
and giving the bug pattern an unnatural presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't high-stick, you get a `belly' (slack) in your
line, the water catches it and you get drag, which makes your
insect imitation look like a jet skier,'' said fly-angling guide
Terry Edelmann of nearby Cottonwood. ``And fish aren't going to hit
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A sixth-generation Shasta County resident whose family has been
fishing the McCloud in neighboring Siskiyou County for five
generations, Edelmann appreciates more than most the challenges of
high water, volcanic outcrops and strange undercurrents that
characterize the river this year.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his son's trusty sheepdog, Tops (Spot in
reverse), Edelmann would show me the finer points of high-sticking
on a fairly remote and trail-less section of the river. He promised
aqua-colored waters, forests of pine and fir, lots of bushwhacking
and lava rocks ranging in size from five-gallon buckets to
Volkswagens that would make wading nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Though just 31, his goatee and tattered waders _ layered with
patches that might reveal the age of the ancient garment like a
tree's rings _ evoke the image of a much more grizzled resident
angler.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, Edelmann is an appropriate representative of a
community impassioned by the outdoors, whose never-forget attitude
about the catastrophic Cantara chemical spill on the Upper
Sacramento River in July 1991 led to major upgrades to its
decimated fishery. Whose ire is raised by proposals to enlarge
Shasta Dam and Shasta Lake. Whose independent nature and
dissatisfaction with faraway government management of its wild and
precious environs once spawned secessionist notions of forming the
State of Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   But enough with the rhetoric, already. This was fishing. And
Edelmann was, indeed, the man.
</P>
<P>
   A recent cold snap had postponed hatches of salmonflies,
stoneflies, caddis flies, mayflies and other insects that would
normally be airborne by this time of year. My guide would therefore
rely on a bevy of patterns meant to mimic the nymphal, or
waterborne stages of the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   An imitation would be tied to a 9-foot leader that was tapered
down to size 5X and attached to a weight-forward floating fly line,
a 4- to 6-weight rod of 9 feet in length and a matching reel. To
keep the nymph pattern near the bottom where it belongs, micro-size
split shot are added or deleted 6 to 12 inches above it, according
to the river's power. A yarn indicator is tied on to better flag a
bite.
</P>
<P>
   Burgeoning runoff from an El Nino winter was pushing high water
down the McCloud. Slack in the floating line would create drag _ a
fatal flaw. Hence the high-sticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your cast short, and lift that rod over your shoulder,''
Edelmann said with a kindly tone. ``It gives you more line
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Large pockets of water created by the bigger lava rocks make for
tricky casting. The idea is to aim for the top of the pocket, close
to the rock, so that the nymph appears to the trout as if it
floated into the hole, naturally, from upstream. ``If you are going
to parachute a nymph in, you don't want to do it right in the
middle of the pocket so that the fish sees it fall from the sky,''
Edelmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Just when I got off the perfect cast, THWAP, at the head of the
pocket, I would inevitably forget to high-stick and the
presentation would be ruined by the whitewater catching the
floating line and pulling the bug out of the hole. What a drag...
literally.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again I tried to copy Edelmann's style, and again and
again my line came up empty. Apparently he had scared all the trout
off during an exploratory trip two days earlier that produced
several beefy specimens to 17 inches.
</P>
<P>
   He was surprised to see rainbows that size, since the biggest
usually come in the 10-inch range. Along with stocked rainbow,
brown and brook trout, the waters are home to the native McCloud
River redband trout, which are ``wild and colored like no other
fish you've seen unless you've seen them in a book somewhere,''
Edelmann said. The browns run to 18 inches during the fall spawn.
</P>
<P>
   I was satisfied to catch a single 10-inch brookie on a dry fly.
A much fatter rainbow rose to another dry pattern, but, overly
excited by the prospect of landing the day's first ``big one,'' I
set the hook well before the fish got to the surface. The knowledge
that my guide wasn't catching much either eased my feelings of
inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the weather; it snowed the day before and this was
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   High-sticking is awkward and tiring, to be sure, but that's
often what defines truly rewarding adventures, especially here in
Jefferson Territory _ billed as America's greatest concentration of
wilderness areas and wild and scenic rivers.
</P>
<P>
   With that understanding, we knew when we ran into the first
cigarette butt before the firstdecent trout, it was time to call it
a day.

A SPECIAL TRIP, A SPECIAL BOOK
</HEADLINE>

By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are outdoor tales about macho heroes
overcoming obstacles with strength and force of will. Of manly men
who, like knights of old, conquer every enemy, stun the world and
carry off the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Delightfully, ``A Walk in the Woods'' (Broadway Books, $25) by
renowned journalist and author Bill Bryson isn't one of those.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson, who worked for newspapers in the United Kingdom for 20
years and sought to reacquaint himself with his native country
through a hike on the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trial, is like the
best kind of professor. A skillful and comedic communicator, he
keeps readers engaged by describing with far-ranging, ribald and
often hard-edged humor a trek that in many things went as wrong as
it went right.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire outdoorsman uses levity to spice up even such
mundane matters as buying equipment. But it is his discussions
about the people he encounters that shine the brightest.
</P>
<P>
   The 276 pages read like a novel, with two interesting
protagonists, colorful minor characters and great dialogue. The
traveling pair meet Chicken John, famous for getting lost. And
Bryson tells the secondhand stories of some of the folks who have
traversed the AT: a trekker in his 80s, another on crutches, a
blind man with a seeing-eye dog who reportedly fell about 5,000
times and a 350-pound wafflestomper who lost 53 pounds on his
sojourn.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson's companion, Stephen Katz, is a piece of work himself. A
recovering alcoholic and not the fittest of men, he started the
pathway in Georgia with a gigantic pack crammed with junk food and
threw pounds of it away the first day. Unfortunately, this included
many staples, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the hike isn't all laughs. Bryson's serious comments about
appreciation of the outdoors, conservation and problems with the
trail itself are all the more effective because he is not a nature
purist. He's an ordinary fellow who took an extraordinary journey.
</P>
<P>
   A few days into it he wrote, ``The central feature of life on
the Appalachian Trail is deprivation, that the whole point of the
experience is to remove yourself so thoroughly from the
conveniences of everyday life that the most ordinary things... fill
you with wonder and gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he skipped parts of the trail and therefore didn't finish
it, Bryson _ who has the ability to give serious tones to funny
matters _ ``enjoyed the escape from civilization and ached for its
comforts.'' Our rating: Four stars.
</P>
<P>
   __ From the outset, it's easy to figure out where ``In Praise of
Wild Trout'' (The Lyons Press, $20) is headed: The 94 pages compose
another conservation-minded work that will end up talking about
deteriorating habitat, conservation, our sacred trust, etc.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, however, the essays penned by eight contributors
_ good writers all _ often are as unpredictable as the fish
themselves and the preaching is kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of many of the articles is the virtues of wild
and natural trout compared with the stocked, hatchery variety, but
the passages range as far as the waters they explore. Some focus on
personal angling experiences, others are more dry and scientific.
</P>
<P>
   Planted trout ``strike a fly with desperate fury, turn quickly
if they miss and strike it again even harder, as if from an impulse
that is homicidal and suicidal at the same time,'' writes W.D.
Wetherell. Wild trout, on the other hand, show ``not that greedy
boardinghouse grab, but a delicate kind of aristocratic plucking.''
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is not just the act of fishing but the places
where it's done. Datus C. Proper writes of one particularly flat,
brown, treeless, wind-blown site: It's ``the kind of place where
one good, drunken country-western tune on the car radio could
permanently break your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and angler Christopher Camuto expresses how he deals with
death in the wilderness, since ``catch-and-release fishing is an
ecological necessity, not my preference.'' Gutting fish reminds him
``that you cannot really undo what you've done in life, or let the
consequences or your life simply swim away, as if nothing had
happened.'' Killing a trout, he writes, is ``as strange and serious
an act'' as shooting a deer or grouse.
</P>
<P>
   The title notwithstanding, there is some levity: ``I feel about
a busy stream as the villagers felt about the czar: Lord bless him
and keep him _ far from me,'' Proper notes.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the 92 pages edited and with a foreword by acclaimed
New York fly-fisherman Nick Lyons make for a nice collection of
mostly enjoyable essays that will appeal to many avid anglers. Our
rating: Three stars.

VOLUNTEERS UNITE TO PROTECT STREAMS
</HEADLINE>

By KEITH LAIR  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST COVINA, Calif. _ Bill Reeves remembers fishing the San
Gabriel River's West Fork in the 1940s, when he could reel in 15
trout in five hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you can't catch five fish in that time now,''
Reeves said. He hopes his work as a stream coordinator for the
Fisheries Resource Volunteer Corps will keep the Angeles National
Forest stream productive and among the elite fisheries of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' attitude is what Don Stehsel Jr. said is needed to make
his nonprofit conservation group grow. ``People want to protect
(streams) from their heart,'' Stehsel said.
</P>
<P>
   Stehsel founded the FRVC seven years ago after anglers illegally
fished out Deep Creek, situated between Lake Arrowhead and Running
Springs in the San Bernardino Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a section where they raped a mile of the stream,''
Stehsel said. ``There was nothing left larger than 4-inch fish. I
was really, really upset, and it was too late to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Stehsel already realized the Department of Fish and Game and the
U.S. Forest Service were too shorthanded to protect ``his'' stream.
He contacted other conservation groups in the San Bernardino
National Forest, but they were also too extended to expand into the
Deep Creek area.
</P>
<P>
   So he took the matter into his own hands. The FRVC has 117
members who patrol streams in the Angeles and San Bernardino
national forests, including Piru Creek, San Antonio Creek, San
Gabriel River's East and West forks, Deep Creek and Bear Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Stehsel designed the group to protect streams but quickly veered
from that focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized it's just not fishing,'' he said. ``We need to
monitor areas with people problems, off-road vehicle areas, do
trail maintenance, plant trees... because they go hand-in-hand with
our streams.''
</P>
<P>
   Endorsed by the Southwest Council of the Federation of Fly
Fishers and fueled by donations from government agencies and
private businesses, the FRVC helps DFG wardens and Forest Service
rangers check licenses and permits, remind anglers of fishing laws
and attempt to stop poachers. Volunteers also remove graffiti, pick
up trash, repair trails along stream beds and assist in conducting
fish-population surveys and constructing signs.
</P>
<P>
   Stehsel said it's hard but rewarding work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather talk people out of doing this than into it,'' he
said. ``If they join, we would like them committed to serious
protection of our resources, not for the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Interested parties can learn more about the program during an
FRVC seminar on Saturday that begins at 8:30 a.m. in the Angeles
National Forest Service headquarters, 701 N. Santa Anita Ave. in
Arcadia. Prospective members must have a first-aid certificate and
volunteer at least six times a year.
</P>
<P>
   To register for the seminar or for more information, call (714)
284-8844.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Piru Creek &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Piru Creek was a stream lost on the Fisheries Resources
Volunteers Corps until 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Chatsworth's Jeff Joel joined the group and
immediately set up patrols for the stream that runs along the
border between Los Angeles and Ventura counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to fish it and it's in our back yard,'' said Joel, 41.
``I've seen big changes going on there, so I decided that's where I
wanted to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of the FRVC _ from the San Fernando Valley to Long
Beach and Huntington Beach _ patrol the stream from just below
Pyramid Lake to about a mile past Frenchman's Flat, where the trail
becomes rugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I've fished there forever,'' said stream
coordinator Joel, who also receives help from his 14-year-old son,
Jason. ``But I've seen a lot of changes in the people who have used
it and changes in efforts of the Forest Service to take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real close to civilization and gets a lot of use.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have helped enforce the DFG's catch-and-release
regulations, clean up illegal fire pits, pick up trash, construct a
fence to prevent trash from blowing into the stream and educate
hikers and anglers about the stream's fragile nature.
</P>
<P>
   Signs in English and Spanish will be erected in August to flag
the creek's catch-and-release section. Volunteers hope eventually
to work with the Department of Water and Power to remove or alter a
gate that limits access by disabled anglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting the (condition of the) stream back where it was
20 years ago,'' Joel said. ``We're making changes.''

NEXT THREE WEEKS CRUCIAL FOR MARINER MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners begin the second half of the season at
the Kingdome Thursday familiar with erasing a large deficit and
turning a lost season into something magical.
</P>
<P>
   They keep thinking about 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it once and can do it again,'' insisted center fielder
Ken Griffey Jr. ``We know it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for '95, when the M's trailed the then-California Angels
by 13 games on Aug. 24 and suddenly embarked on a heart-stopping
stretch drive that resulted in a one-game playoff victory over the
Angels, you would think another 13-game bind would be too much to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   This time, time might be the Mariners' best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The defending American League West champions have 74
regular-season games remaining to get their collective act together
and climb from last place in the division to at least become
involved in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The journey starts Thursday when left-hander Jeff Fassero
opposes former M's right-hander Omar Olivares in the opener of a
four-game series against the division-leading Angels. Anaheim has
lost five straight after zipping through June with a 21-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: What the M's do the next three weeks will
affect not only this season, but next season and beyond. Nineteen
of their next 24 games are at the Kingdome, and that stretch will
take them past the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' franchise is at a crossroads. Who goes? Who stays?
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella, who has been remarkably calm considering
how poorly his team has pitched and played defense this season,
knows the second half will be a repeat of the first unless changes
are made.
</P>
<P>
   There already have been indications management has decided to
improve the defense, hoping it helps the pitching. During the
All-Star break, left fielder Glenallen Hill, a defensively
liability, was placed on waivers and claimed by the Chicago Cubs.
Before the break, Piniella decided the team would be better off if
error-prone third baseman Russ Davis plays another position,
specifically left field.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest question concerns left-handed starter Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Mariners be better off trading him, say, to the Los
Angeles Dodgers for second baseman Wilton Guerrero and right-handed
reliever Antonio Osuna? Or does it make more sense to stand pat and
hope that Johnson returns to his former dominant self before
bolting out the free-agent door at the end of the season?
</P>
<P>
   And what if the same M's owner who blocked a previous trade with
the Dodgers throws a roadblock into another proposed deal for
Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Johnson is a major issue,'' said Harold Reynolds, an
ESPN baseball analyst and former Mariner second baseman. ``It's
almost like they are putting a dagger in his heart and twisting it.
I don't see how they can keep him, risk losing him to free agency
and getting almost nothing (two draft picks) in return. I think
they have to trade him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, M's vice president of baseball operations, says
filling the team's most obvious needs won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a position of strength right now,'' he said. ``I
have a job to do and work within the (financial) guidelines my
president lays down. Lou wants things done yesterday, because
that's his nature. But it doesn't move that quickly. And if other
teams feel you are out of the race, they are ready to take
advantage of you, and we do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing now with next year, when the team moves into its new
stadium, is a difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to fill one hole and create another one,''
Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Mariners sit at the bottom of the division entering
the second half, Hall of Famer Joe Morgan believes the team has the
capability of getting involved in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season got off to such a horrible start because the
bullpen did not do as well as everyone anticipated, including
myself,'' he said. ``I also was on the bandwagon, and I think that
really hurt. It hurts more than people realize to blow leads late
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into the race, they obviously need better relief
pitching in the second half. Those guys are under tremendous
pressure and must regain their confidence. If that happens, they
are capable of running off a hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think they are too far out. The Mariners are
capable of getting hot and winning 19 of 22 ballgames. Let's face
it, everyone in the division can beat everyone else and it's just a
matter of (the M's) getting a hot streak. Everyone in the division
except the Mariners has been hot during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   But to get hot, or even warm, the Mariners must catch the ball
better, pitch better and improve their situational hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened so far reminds me of Boston in 1996,''
left-handed pitcher Jamie Moyer said. ``In the first half, we
couldn't hit, couldn't field and couldn't pitch. But after the
break, it was almost like a different team.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one gave up, but everyone was more relaxed, went out and
played and started winning. This team can do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer said it starts with the starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to step it up a notch, if that's possible, and start
feeding off each other. Once you start winning, everyone's
confidence improves and who knows what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened once. Can it happen again?

TIME FOR MARINERS TO BE THINKING 1999 AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To begin the baseball season's second half, the
Mariners propose at the moment to start a left fielder who has
never chased a game ball in the outfield and a 34-year-old third
baseman who has hardly played in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   With these two representing 25 percent of an everyday lineup,
the club proposes to rally from 13 games down to contend for a
championship?
</P>
<P>
   I would prefer the chances of all the camels in the Sahara being
herded through the eye of a needle. I'll even spot you a dozen
water buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   While it's unlikely that Russ Davis and Rico Rossy will long
hold their new positions, the fact that this will happen for even a
few games is just the latest bit of preposterousness that the
Mariners, with a straight face, are foisting upon the public.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how generously one analyzes the decisions that have
created this little franchise crossroads _ ``the deal looked good
at the time, and it got us to the postseason'' _ it remains
astonishing that the Mariners are down to such impotent answers for
such serious shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial word is that more deals are forthcoming. That
certainly should inspire the peasantry to storm the Bastille.
</P>
<P>
   In the last offseason, well before last place could be seen,
felt and smelled, the Mariners acquired some players. Among the new
faces were Glenallen Hill, Pat Listach, Jeff Huson, Rick Wilkins
and Tony Fossas. None were ever labeled all-stars, but were
adjudged reasonable role players who could fill obvious holes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Hill's unceremonious boot off the roster _ the
Mariners couldn't get so much as a mascot for him, so he was waived
_ all are gone. With the exception of first baseman David Segui,
the one player upon whom they paid high-market value, the Mariners
in the offseason went only to the blue-light special table and got
exactly what they paid for. Pitcher Billy Swift has been the lone
keeper from the retread pile, and at 37 with a long history of
injuries, he is more day-to-day than most of the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, these players were acquired before serious pressure
was on and the Mariners were exposed as threadbare, before the
current crop of Class AAA minor leaguers, already picked over from
seasons of rent-a-vet trades, were certified as bereft of
breakthrough talent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the lack of possibilities now.
</P>
<P>
   With even less willingness from ownership to extend the player
budget, now that it is writing checks for the new ballpark's cost
overruns, the Mariners have no choice but to deal from weakness.
Even the increased revenue anticipated from the new park already
has been earmarked for owners, not player payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Time to write off 1998 and look to 1999 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   With the bullpen showing few signs of recovery, the lost glove
of Davis and the lost interest of Randy Johnson, the sore knees of
Jay Buhner, the lame stick of Dan Wilson, the control problems of
Ken Cloude and Joey Cora, this year has been butchered beyond
redemption. With three teams to surpass in the American League
West, the miracle of 1995, which required overcoming only one team,
will not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   That means it's time to quit loving these guys and start trading
the few that have value. Given Johnson's continuing malaise _ 12
strikeouts and eight earned runs in one game? _ it's obvious that
the Big Unit has pitched his way off the team. If the Mariners are
no longer stuck on rescuing '98, the idea of acquiring two or three
top-drawer prospects becomes plausible.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a decent market for Edgar Martinez, that brutal call
must be made. A handful of other Mariners could be packaged with
one or both to acquire a substantial down payment on the future.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is the Mariners will come away with the same thing they
received in their most recent trades of All-Star talent. From the
trades of shortstop Omar Vizquel and first baseman Tino Martinez,
the Mariners are left with Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Please, please, please: Do not accept stock market advice from
this team. Even if they suggest Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk of doing nothing is greater. That's because the two
Mariner All-Stars, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, have deals
that expire after the 2000 season. That means a good team and high
revenues must be in place by the end of 1999 to be able to recruit
and pay what figures to be two of the biggest contracts in sports
history.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mariners, after the tepidness of last winter, must be
bold. They must risk the PR backlash of heroes lost, they must take
chances with elite veteran free agents (think Roberto Alomar would
work OK at second base next to Rodriguez and in front of Griffey on
a new grass field?). They must show the guts at this trading
deadline in three weeks and in the off-season to make a futile 1998
turn into a one-year reloading instead of a multi-year rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   There is no good choice. The time for good choices came when
they had a decent left fielder in Roberto Kelly, a good closer in
Mike Jackson and a respectable third baseman in Dave Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   The choices were made, and ended up being Hill, Fossas and
Rossy, who might be just as effective helping me round up the
camels.

MARINERS' TOP DRAFT PICK FACES BIG TRANSITION TO FULLTIME PITCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Matt Thornton thought he knew what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   So the little-known left-handed closer decided not to sit in
front of a television while baseball conducted its annual amateur
draft last month. Instead, Thornton packed up his clubs and a few
friends for a golf outing.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton took along his mother's cell phone _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was ready when the draft came around. I was
thinking second or third round. ... This is a dream,'' said
Thornton, a 6-foot-6 power reliever whom the Mariners took 22nd
overall in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The M's signed the bright-eyed prospect to a $925,000 contract
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton says he was still in a jolted state, when the Mariners
introduced him to Seattle media Wednesday. After all, the Mariners'
No. 1 pick attended Grand Valley State University _ a Division II
school in Grand Rapids, Mich. _ and on a basketball scholarship,
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton has pitched since he was 7 years old, but last season
was his first as a reliever. When the 21-year-old reports to the
Class A Everett AquaSox this week, he will totally commit to
baseball for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are confident that Thornton will make up for his
lack of experience with enthusiasm and undoubted power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I calmed down for a week,'' Thornton said of his
selection. ``I got into my first accident and got my first ticket
the next day (after being drafted). It's interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing is Thornton's ability, according to Roger
Jongewaard, the M's vice president of scouting and player
development. Thornton earned just three saves in 15 games last
season. However, he throws a fastball that ranges between 91 and 94
mph, and also possesses a hard slider and changeup.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is his lack of innings against professional-caliber
players. The upside is Thornton's youth and the relative low
mileage on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about fast-tracking him as a closer,'' said
Jongewaard, who points to Thornton's size and mobility as two of
his biggest assets. ``But we'll give him more innings _ like the
last three innings so he can work on his pitches. We think he could
move rapidly. ... He could be very good (early) or long-range.
Fast-tracking on some guys doesn't work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least a week before Thornton pitches for Everett.
He will go through workouts and simulated action until then.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were not discouraged by Thornton's small-school
tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not dependent on Baseball America or the media for
finding our guys,'' Jongewaard said. ``We like his athleticism.
With him being a basketball player, he's got good balance and
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton has never had professional training. Basketball always
impeded his work in baseball, which Thornton played only in the
spring and summer. Had Thornton been drafted in the later rounds,
he says he would have returned to Grand Valley State for his senior
season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Thornton finds himself thrust into the Mariner organization
and ready to tackle the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be effective in whatever I do,'' Thornton said.
``I'm not going to quit working hard.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Homophobia and demagoguery in the GOP
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget all that stuff about hating the sin but loving the
sinner. House Republicans are about to go after the sinners. A vote
is imminent on a provision supported by the leadership, and thus
likely to pass, that would cancel President Clinton's recent
executive order barring discrimination against gays and lesbians
who work for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Most federal agencies already had nondiscriminatory policies,
though with slight differences here and there. The main effect of
Clinton's order is to impose uniformity, so what's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   The big deal is that in its thralldom to the religious right and
its increasing tilt to ideological rather than to pragmatic
conservatism, the Republican Party has gone from being just a
little cracked about homosexuality to being outright peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   Commonly cited as evidence of that have been the recent
declarations by Senate and House Majority Leaders Trent Lott and
Dick Armey that homosexuality is a sin, but both men were only
answering questions they didn't seem pleased to have been asked and
sin is a religious, not a political, judgment. They are welcome to
it.
</P>
<P>
   (Though Lott also seemed to think homosexuality is a mental
disorder or an addiction. The American Psychiatric Association
concluded otherwise 25 years ago, in effect finding that most folks
are heterosexual but a few are not and there you are.)
</P>
<P>
   Far more disturbing is the worsening demagoguery of the party
and its candidates in demonizing gays and lesbians as a shortcut to
office.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the U.S. House of Representatives on the verge of all but
endorsing job discrimination against gays and lesbians by
disallowing an order forbidding that.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican Party recently denied recognition at its
convention to the Log Cabin Republicans, a sobersided club of gay
Republicans. And when the group complained, delegates unleashed a
torrent of abuse, with state leaders comparing it to the Ku Klux
Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is blocking the appointment of a gay as ambassador to
Luxembourg. (In the course of which issue Sen. James Inhofe,
R-Okla., likened the nominee to the former KKK Grand Wizard David
Duke. Klan analogies apparently are going around.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's GOP gubernatorial primary in Nebraska sank into a
contest in homophobia, with candidates competing in the vigor of
their oaths to block homosexual marriage, which the conservative
state legislature has never even considered.
</P>
<P>
   Republican primaries in South Carolina, too, have set off a
bidding war in anti-gay rhetoric, most bizarrely with a would-be
agriculture commissioner declaring homosexuality a threat to family
farms. ``You can't have farming based on having Bob and Bob being
married,'' said Jim Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   All this posturing is put about as a defense of morality but it
is no such thing. Republican candidates in many places no longer
can win without certification from fundamentalist Christian
pulpits, and as one GOP ally put it, when Republicans are quoting
the Bible and Democrats are citing the American Psychiatric
Association, Republicans win.
</P>
<P>
   Count on it: When politics is talking about saving souls, it is
thinking about counting heads.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Eight great books
 &HT;    (Corrects improvised to impoverished in 11th graf.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Letter from a student:
</P>
<P>
   ``What books do you suggest for a high school senior that reads
and writes a lot and dreams of being a teacher or writer, maybe
even a journalist?
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, what books really impacted you when you were
almost 18 and trying to find your place in the world?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure books are the place to look for what you seek. My
experience has been that books tend to raise more questions about
life than they answer.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Here's a crate of eight that I've pulled from the
bookshelf. Think of them as points on the compass:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1960) by Harper Lee, the story of a
little girl growing up in the South during the Depression. Harper
Lee's father was the inspiration for the character Atticus Finch,
and Atticus Finch is an inspiration for everyone who reads this
book.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Thanksgiving Visitor'' (1967) and ``A Christmas Memory''
(1956) by Truman Capote, a pair of novellas available in a single
volume. Beautifully written, these stories serve as companion
pieces to ``To Kill a Mockingbird.'' Truman Capote and Harper Lee
grew up together, and he is also a character in her book. Indeed,
there's literary hearsay that Capote may have helped Lee with the
writing of ``Mockingbird,'' her only published novel.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Sun Also Rises'' (1928) by Ernest Hemingway, one of his
first and arguably his best novel, the story of expatriates at play
in postwar Europe. The book is prefaced with Gertrude Stein's
quote, ``You are all a lost generation.'' Even more poignant are
the novel's concluding lines: ``Oh, Jake,'' Brett said, ``we could
have had such a damned good time together.'' ... ``Yes,'' I said.
``Isn't it pretty to think so.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Moveable Feast'' (1964) by Hemingway, published
posthumously, recounts a nonfiction version from the same era as
``The Sun Also Rises.'' Here's Hemingway's quote that introduces
this memoir: ``If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a
young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays
with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Great Gatsby'' (1925) by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the
defining novel of the Jazz Age that has a place on most everyone's
list of great American literature. ``There was music from my
neighbor's house through the summer nights,'' recounts Nick
Carraway in telling the tragic story of Jay Gatsby. ``In his blue
gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the
whisperings and the champagne and the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Grapes of Wrath'' (1939) by John Steinbeck, who
chronicles the plight of impoverished American farmers, Okies
searching vainly for a workers' paradise in California. ``They had
hoped to find a home, and they found only hatred. Okies _ the
owners hated them because the owners knew they were soft and the
Okies were strong, that they were fed and the Okies hungry.'' Songs
have been written about this novel, such is the lyrical quality of
its prose.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``All the King's Men'' (1946) by Robert Penn Warren, perhaps
THE novel of American politics, with the fictional Willie Stark in
the role of legendary Huey P. Long. ``It might have all been
different,'' Stark says as he lay dying from an assassin's bullet.
The lament of man's history on Earth has never been summed up so
simply.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Gay Place'' (1961) by Billy Lee Brammer _ the title is
from a poem by Scott Fitzgerald, ``I know a gay place nobody
knows,'' and has nothing to do with gender preference _ is
considered probably the best novel ever to come out of Texas.
Brammer does for Lyndon B. Johnson what Robert Penn Warren does for
Huey P. Long. The period is the late 1950s and the location is
Austin, though the reader is never told. Like Harper Lee, Brammer
never published again.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: ``The Last Picture Show,'' Larry McMurtry; ``The
Sound and the Fury,'' William Faulkner; ``From Here to Eternity,''
James Jones; any of the Travis McGee books by John D. MacDonald;
and all of the essays of E.B. White.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the books that mean the most to me. The fun is
in finding your own.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for writing. Thanks for reading.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: RISKS AND REWARDS IN A SUBPRIME UNIVERSE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, July 12.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among people who make their living lending money,
the subprime market has become a hot meal ticket. And these folks
aren't talking about second-tier steak houses, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subprime home equity loans are commonly marketed as
bill-consolidation loans, particularly as a means to pay off credit
card debt,'' a recent Federal Reserve Board study notes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've seen these loans being aggressively pitched on TV
to homeowners with lower incomes, with limited borrowing power or
with soiled credit ratings. By the end of 1997, the Fed study
pegged the overall size of this loan pool at $90 billion, and
growing at a sizzling 15 percent annual clip.
</P>
<P>
   For some borrowers, such loans are a good deal. Interest rates
can be as low as 10 percent, and average 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While that's more than double what one can expect to pay for a
top-of-the-line first mortgage, it's usually less than the carrying
charges on credit cards or on other forms of revolving consumer
debt. What's more, interest on mortgage debt is deductible on
itemized federal tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The bank that issues our credit card will thank us for being
such prompt payers by bumping up the family credit limit. But
industry insiders know the bank would be still happier were we to
keep a large open tab on our plastic money.
</P>
<P>
   Card issuers must look askance at the success shown by such
sports figures as Dan Marino, Dan Dierdorf and Jim Palmer in
pitching home equity loans. According to researchers, since
mid-1996 about 4.2 million U.S. households have pulled the plug on
$26 billion of credit card debt by converting it into mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The card issuers who really get hammered are the monoline
companies (that offer only one type of credit) and retail store
operations,'' said Bruce Brittain, president of Brittain
Associates, an Atlanta-based research firm. ``If a consumer pays
off their card balance with an equity loan and the issuer isn't
(also) in that business, those balances simply have to go
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brittain has tracked what he sees as a worrisome trend among
some subprime borrowers to once again max out their cards after
paying them off with an equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   So what would happen if the good times should stop to roll?
</P>
<P>
   ``If these consumers then find themselves having to decide on
which loan to make a monthly installment, we predict it will be the
equity loan because the borrower's home is the collateral,''
Brittain says.
</P>
<P>
   Such an economic climate could trigger a run of credit card
delinquencies. Lenders try to factor such losses into the cost of
doing business by passing along the charges to their good
customers. Those that can't can go broke.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the prime interest of subprime borrowers, who may
fall prey to such schemes as ``equity stripping'' (inflated loans
based on falsely padded income) or abrupt demands for payment on
``balloon loans?'' These ploys could cause them to lose their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators and congressional probers also fear that
subprime borrowers can fail to sense the risk they run from
personal or general economic reversals. On Capitol Hill, hearings
are in the works.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: RISKS AND REWARDS IN A SUBPRIME UNIVERSE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, July 12.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among people who make their living lending money,
the subprime market has become a hot meal ticket. And these folks
aren't talking about second-tier steak houses, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subprime home equity loans are commonly marketed as
bill-consolidation loans, particularly as a means to pay off credit
card debt,'' a recent Federal Reserve Board study notes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've seen these loans being aggressively pitched on TV
to homeowners with lower incomes, with limited borrowing power or
with soiled credit ratings. By the end of 1997, the Fed study
pegged the overall size of this loan pool at $90 billion, and
growing at a sizzling 15 percent annual clip.
</P>
<P>
   For some borrowers, such loans are a good deal. Interest rates
can be as low as 10 percent, and average 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While that's more than double what one can expect to pay for a
top-of-the-line first mortgage, it's usually less than the carrying
charges on credit cards or on other forms of revolving consumer
debt. What's more, interest on mortgage debt is deductible on
itemized federal tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The bank that issues our credit card will thank us for being
such prompt payers by bumping up the family credit limit. But
industry insiders know the bank would be still happier were we to
keep a large open tab on our plastic money.
</P>
<P>
   Card issuers must look askance at the success shown by such
sports figures as Dan Marino, Dan Dierdorf and Jim Palmer in
pitching home equity loans. According to researchers, since
mid-1996 about 4.2 million U.S. households have pulled the plug on
$26 billion of credit card debt by converting it into mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The card issuers who really get hammered are the monoline
companies (that offer only one type of credit) and retail store
operations,'' said Bruce Brittain, president of Brittain
Associates, an Atlanta-based research firm. ``If a consumer pays
off their card balance with an equity loan and the issuer isn't
(also) in that business, those balances simply have to go
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brittain has tracked what he sees as a worrisome trend among
some subprime borrowers to once again max out their cards after
paying them off with an equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   So what would happen if the good times should stop to roll?
</P>
<P>
   ``If these consumers then find themselves having to decide on
which loan to make a monthly installment, we predict it will be the
equity loan because the borrower's home is the collateral,''
Brittain says.
</P>
<P>
   Such an economic climate could trigger a run of credit card
delinquencies. Lenders try to factor such losses into the cost of
doing business by passing along the charges to their good
customers. Those that can't can go broke.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the prime interest of subprime borrowers, who may
fall prey to such schemes as ``equity stripping'' (inflated loans
based on falsely padded income) or abrupt demands for payment on
``balloon loans?'' These ploys could cause them to lose their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators and congressional probers also fear that
subprime borrowers can fail to sense the risk they run from
personal or general economic reversals. On Capitol Hill, hearings
are in the works.

 &HT;    Cooking makes a comeback
 &HT;    (Fixes author of 'Pies and Tarts' in 16th graf.)
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last February, while most young professionals were stalking top
restaurants for Valentine's Day reservations, Monica Hoover was
learning how to launch the real arrow to her partner's heart: with
homemade cookies and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   No fussy restaurant desserts for this 34-year-old Atlanta
comptroller. No crowds and no expense, either. Instead she joined a
group of culinary enthusiasts for a Valentine's Day primer at the
Cook's Warehouse, a cookware store that has become a popular venue
for cooking classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was kind of a neat alternative to going out to
dinner and spending $200,'' said Hoover. ``Even though there was a
Valentine's theme, it was simple, stress-free cooking that you and
your date could make together.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when slaving over a hot stove was absolutely no
one's idea of a successful evening's entertainment, much less a hot
date. After all, wasn't the idea to get out of the house, away from
the chores?
</P>
<P>
   But for a generation of people who frequently dine out as a
matter of stomach-rumbling necessity, cooking _ honest, satisfying
home cooking _ is making a comeback. For special dates. For weekend
projects. For fun.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kroger Cooking School in Alpharetta, Ga., more than 3,000
students took a class in 1997, up 7% from the previous year.
Chef-instructor Kathy Blanda says popular classes, such as one that
teaches basic kitchen skills, are ``jam-packed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fascinated by it,'' says trend guru Faith Popcorn,
chairman of BrainReserve, a marketing consultant to the Fortune
500. ``Cooking at home is a skill, not a drudgery. When you
generate a home-cooked meal you get so much recognition for it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly since so many others can't. ``Literally we have a
generation of people who don't know how to boil an egg,'' says
Popcorn. Maybe we passed on that home ec class in high school.
Maybe we paid no attention when mom put the Thanksgiving turkey in
the oven, or _ for the post-baby boom generation _ mom was too busy
at work to even think about any turkey other than Swanson's.
</P>
<P>
   But, boy, are we making up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we got interested in Martha Stewart,'' continues
Popcorn, ``and all these cooking shows. It's homemaking
voyeurism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fashionable element at work here,'' agrees Art
Siemering, whose Trend/Wire newsletter tracks food trends for
professionals. ``Cooking has experienced a real liberation and
gravitated from a chore or daily task that we have to do to an
occasional pleasure. Now we can cook whenever we want and never
when we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   For busy professionals, that usually means once the work week is
over. Hoover knows ``a lot of folks who stop by Harry's in a
Hurry'' (a popular gourmet carryout) on the way home from work
during the week. But on the weekend they break out the chef's
knives and cutting boards _ not to mention the videos, the CD-ROMs,
and a whole new generation of cookbooks that Jennifer Griffin,
senior cookbook editor at MacMillan, terms a full-fledged ``back to
basics movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Trendwatchers and editors agree the home cooking revival is
fueled mostly by young adults who grew up with more Hamburger
Helper than homemade meatloaf. And they want to make up for lost
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they're missing something,'' says Siemering. ``It
might be something real like memories of visiting their
grandmothers. Or maybe it's something imagined from watching Nick
at Nite. But they're asking themselves, `How can I get a little
better at this or that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Hunnicutt of Decatur, Ga., 35, is teaching herself how to
cook one pie at a time. Her mother, who worked full-time when she
was growing up, made ``really good Thanksgiving dinners, but that's
about it. I don't remember her ever teaching me how to cook. Maybe
it's me. Maybe I wasn't interested back then.''
</P>
<P>
   She is now. Hunnicutt has been working her way through Martha
Stewart's ``Pies and Tarts,'' which she describes as a ``pretty
like basic book for people who shy away from pies because they're
afraid of a rolling pin.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple American recipes and basic technique are the two themes
echoed through many of today's hottest cookbook titles, and the
Titanic success of the updated ``Joy of Cooking'' was only the tip
of the iceberg. Atlantan Shirley Corriher's ``CookWise,'' a food
scientist's explanation of superior results _ the fluffiest
biscuits, the most gorgeously bronzed roast chicken _ has been the
surprise sleeper of the season, even inching up the charts at
Amazon.com, whose ``literary foodie kind of crowd'' usually favors
glossy coffeetable books, according to spokesperson Beth Garson.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Willan's latest volume, ``Cook it Right,'' uses
in-your-face photos with each basic recipe to illustrate both
desirable and undesirable results. Those people who can't boil an
egg can find out exactly what they did wrong to get that green ring
around the yolk.
</P>
<P>
   More are in the pipeline. MacMillan's big hit for the fall
season, ``How to Cook Everything'' by Mark Bittman and edited by
Jennifer Griffin, will use color photography and simple,
contemporary recipes to show people how to cut and cook everything
from chicken to squid.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know how to clean a squid?'' asks Griffin. ``The
first time I tried I didn't know it had that piece of cartilege
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooking instructor James Peterson, author of the just released
``Vegetables: The Most Authoritative Guide to Buying, Preparing,
and Cooking, with More Than 300 Recipes,'' is currently writing and
photographing a yet-unnamed book that zeroes in on technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about how to fillet a fish and how to carve a roast
and how to peel this or that. My goal,'' says Peterson, ``is to get
people to think they don't need a recipe at all. If they understand
the essence of it, they'll be able to taper it to their own
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also the goal of Pam Anderson, executive editor of Cook's
Illustrated, whose just released cookbook ``The Perfect Recipe''
dishes up the kind of idealized mac and cheese, chicken pot pies
and brownies that June Cleaver would hock her pearls for.
</P>
<P>
   But for her next work she'd like to move completely beyond
traditional recipes, to do away with measurements, and to really
teach people the instincts of a good cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have lost their confidence and ability to look, smell
and taste the food they're cooking. You have to poke and probe. You
have to take some initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, just maybe, you'll make your grandma proud.

 &HT;    Magazine editor tackles perfect recipes
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Pam Anderson has cleaned and cooked 100 pounds of
greens, roasted 20 prime ribs, and baked 50-plus cobblers.
</P>
<P>
   She has roasted more than 40 turkeys, developing a brining
method that turns out a cooked bird with breast meat as moist as
its legs.
</P>
<P>
   All in in search of the perfect recipe.
</P>
<P>
   This Pam Anderson is not the Baywatch babe, but the executive
editor of Cook's Illustrated, a serious no-advertising bimonthly
cooking magazine. The author of ``The Perfect Recipe: Getting It
Right Every Time'' cookbook (Chapters, $27), Anderson was in Austin
at Central Market recently to show how to cook the perfect roast
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things she did was clarify her definition of
perfection. ``These are my perfect recipes. These are not the only
way to do a recipe ... I try not to emphasize that this is the last
word, the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she sees her perfected recipes more as publishing her
notes for other cooks to try in their culinary experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Her recipes may depart from the norm. In roast chicken, the
breast meat tends to overcook before the legs and thighs, she
explains. So her roast chicken goes backless. With a pair of
poultry shears, she demonstrates how she cuts out the back bone,
leaving a butterflied bird that cooks in 30 minutes _ in the oven
or on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   It is a roast chicken so good and so easy to carve that Kathleen
Caoyonan, a student in the class and a novice cook, promptly put
the recipe on her July Fourth menu.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect, however, does not always mean complicated, Anderson
says. It can be easy and fast. ``I'm a busy person, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Before developing her collection of ``perfect'' recipes,
Anderson says, she used to try different recipes from cookbooks and
magazines, usually with varying results. She decided to make a
study of dishes she prepared frequently and fine tune the recipes
to turn out delicious results every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a chicken pot pie that I'd actually have time to put
on the table on weeknights, and macaroni and cheese that both my
kids and I would eat. I wanted foolproof coleslaw and potato salads
that would go with all sorts of dishes, and a cobbler recipe that I
could vary with seasonal fruit and top in several different ways.
For special occasions, I wanted dishes that would deliver the
absolute best,'' she explains to the class as well as in her book's
foreword.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black slacks, a blue sweater and sandals, Anderson leans
on the counter with a cup of coffee in her hand and talks to her
students as if she were chatting over a table with a neighbor, her
warm manner contrasting with the more erudite tone of Cook's
articles. She tells how she grew up in the Florida Panhandle,
privileged to know wonderful S outhern foods like prime, aged
steaks and home-churned banana ice cream. ``These are the taste
memories I work from,'' she says as she discusses her quest for the
best recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she nails her improved recipe in four tries, like her
technique for making fabulous chicken stock. But other times it
takes dozens of tries to achieve the perfection she seeks. The best
roast turkey, for instance, was one of the most involved testings.
She recalls waking up in the mornings thinking, ``Oh, God. I've got
to make another turkey ... But you can't stop. You have to keep
going until you get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Perseverance paid off, and her brining technique has been widely
received. She even uses it on chickens when she has a couple of
extra hours because it distributes the salt more evenly throughout
the bird.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve an optimum recipe, she first looks at 30-35
variations to understand the full range of possibilities. On her
computer, she sets up a spread sheet comparing ingredients and
methods of the recipes. Using this information as a guide, she
devises a composite recipe. Then she and an assistant start
tinkering, working with one variable at time.
</P>
<P>
   Initially she cooks in small batches, testing in her New Hope,
Pa., home kitchen, using typical consumer appliances. When she hits
roadblocks, she calls on research centers, chefs, food science
experts, and cookbook authors for enlightenment. Then she tests
some more.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, her husband and teen-age daughters, who, like most 13- and
15-year-olds would be happy eating pizza every night, sometimes get
tired of eating turkey, or whatever she is testing, meal after
meal. But generally they are good sports, she says.
</P>
<P>
   And they do not consume all the test food. Some of it simply
falls victim to research. ``I feel bad sometimes about throwing
away food,'' she says. `` But it's hard to take someone a turkey
that does not taste very good and has four bites out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she has a recipe perfected, it is sent to the magazine's
test kitchen in Boston, where other testers compare it in blind
tastings to other classics, the same procedure now used for all
recipes in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for the perfect recipe is an involved, thoughtful
process _ one, she believes must be approached with the innocence
of a child, the questioning of youth, the drive of young adulthood
and the wisdom of age.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of recipes that worked 50 years ago are not as successful
today because ingredients are different. Meat, for instance, is
leaner and less forgiving in cooking, and chicken is not as
flavorful as birds of the past. Thus, in testing recipes, she says
you have to question everything, including old practices.
</P>
<P>
   Interested in food since her Southern childhood, Anderson
started out majoring in home economics in college, but hated the
child care and sewing classes that went along with the program. She
switched to history, with an English minor. After she married and
moved to Chicago, she returned to food with a vengeance, devouring
the books of Julia Child and James Beard and spending half her
family's graduate student budget on food and entertaining. She
segued into catering for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Then on to the East Coast when her husband, an Episcopal
minister, continued graduate studies in N ew Haven, Conn. There she
went to the former Cook's magazine, and asked for a job as a recipe
tester. By the time the magazine folded in 1990, she was food
editor. She went to work for Restaurant Business Magazine, a job
she credits with teaching her how to write.
</P>
<P>
   When Christopher Kimball decided to start up Cook's again, he
asked her to write a story for the first trial issue. Through the
modern technology of telecommuting, she became food editor when the
magazine premiered in 1993. And for three or four years, she did
all of the recipe testing in her kitchen in Pennsylvania, faxing,
e-mailing and modeming the results to Kimball, the editor and
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike a restaurant review, the results primarily were based
on her tastes and those of her assistant. But Anderson does not
claim to be a super-taster. ``I think I have an average palate and
reflect what most Americans think tastes good,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now most of the magazine's testing is done in the magazine's
central kitchen in Boston and, as executive editor, she primarily
works with the food writers and issue planning. But, unlike some
cookbook authors, she does her own recipe testing when she is
working on an article for the magazine or her next cookbook. (That
book's working title is ``Cooking by Heart.'' It will teach people
how to be less recipe dependent for weeknight meals.)
</P>
<P>
   Because Anderson cooks dinner for her family most nights, she
knows of what she writes. And despite her test-kitchen experience,
she economizes efforts in the kitchen like many home cooks,
re-using a pan or spatula when it does not cross-contaminate foods.
(''I hate ending up with lots of dishes at the end.'')
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, she connected with her full class of 30 students. Two
cases of her new book, ordered for the occasion, sold out. And one
student even purchased Anderson's used copy. Another went next door
to a book store and found a copy in stock, bringing it back after
class for Anderson to autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate compliments to the perfect recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Pam Anderson's versatile recipe for chicken, which can
be roasted, grilled or broiled. The Perfect Recipe: Roast
Butterflied Chicken with Tarragon-Mustard Pan Sauce 2 teaspoons
minced fresh tarragon leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 medium garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 whole chicken (3 pounds), butterflied
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup homemade chicken broth or low-sodium canned broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   Place the chicken breast side down, with the tail end facing
you. With kitchen shears, cut along one side of the tail down the
entire length of the backbone. With the chicken still breast side
down, turn the bird so its neck faces you. Cut along the other side
of the backbone and remove it from the chicken. Reserve back for
another use, such as making broth.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the chicken breast side up. Open the chicken and lay it on
a work surface. Use the palm of your hand to flatten the breast so
that the whole chicken lies flat. Use your fist or the flat side of
a mallet to pound the chicken to a more even thickness. Make a
1/2-inch slit on either side of each breast about 1 inch from the
tip. Tuck the corresponding leg into each opening.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Mix tarragon, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper
into a paste in a small bowl. Loosen breast and leg/thigh skin and
rub herb-garlic paste over exposed areas. Tuck legs into slits in
breast skin, then transfer chicken to a large roasting pan or jelly
roll pan, skin side up. Rub skin with oil and very lightly season
with salt and pepper. Let chicken stand at room temperature while
oven heats.
</P>
<P>
   Roast until chicken skin is nicely brown and juices run clear,
about 30 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter or cutting board,
cover with foil and let rest while making sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon off all fat from roasting pan. Heat one or two burners
(depending on roasting pan size) to medium-high. Pour broth into
pan, scraping up any drippings that have stuck to bottom of pan.
Pour liquid into a small saucepan and reduce by half, about 4
minutes. Whisk in mustard, then swirl in butter.
</P>
<P>
   Halve chicken down breast bone and snip skin between breast and
legs/thighs. Serve immediately with sauce passed separately. Serves
4.
</P>
<P>
   Never roast a butterflied chicken without throwing a couple of
vegetables in the pan _ red or sweet potatoes, carrots or parsnips,
onions or shallots and turnips or rutabagas _ cut into 2-inch
chunks. Since the vegetables will be cooked but not browned when
the chicken is done, remove the bird from the pan and return the
vegetables to the oven while the chicken rests. Don't use more
vegetables than will fit in a single layer in the pan. You can
deglaze the pan with stock, water or wine after removing the
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Cook over direct heat for 12 minutes breast side up, then about
15 minutes breast side down. Place an old jelly roll pan on top of
the bird with a couple of bricks in it to weight it down, making it
cook faster and more evenly. Perfect tips from a pro:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone ought to have a spoonula, a rubber spatula slightly
curved like a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   For the best burger, poke small holes in the surface with your
fingertips and use 100 percent ground chuck.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have a food processor (which she likes for cutting
shortening into flour) or a pastry blender, grate cold or frozen
butter into the flour using a box grater. This works well for
biscuits or pastry. Stock your kitchen with a pair of heavy-duty
kitchen shears or poultry shears. (She's had good luck with Henckel
and Cutco shears.)
</P>
<P>
   A combination of butter and shortening makes the best crust for
cobbler or pie _ butter for flavor and shortening for flakiness.
</P>
<P>
   In testing cobblers, Anderson was surprised at how well frozen
fruit did in recipes. Because cobblers are one of her easy, standby
desserts, she now keeps bags of frozen blueberries in her freezer
all the time for unexpected company.
</P>
<P>
   A little butter makes a difference in recipes, she says,
stirring a tablespoon into a sauce for chicken. ``It's not going to
kill you. Well, I don't think it's going to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the smoothest, lightest mashed potatoes, add the milk before
the butter.
</P>
<P>
   In making single, unfilled pastry crusts , instead of pie
weights placed on foil to keep the crust from puffing, she grabs a
handful of screws and nails from her garage.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I cannot live without is my Poldar Thermo-Timer, a
digital read thermometer with a two-foot long metal wire and a
probe at the other end. The wire is so thin that the oven door can
remain closed with the thermometer staying outside the oven, making
it possible for cooks to check a roast's temperature without
pulling the meat in and out of the oven. (William-Sonoma stocks
this item.)
</P>
<P>
   For moist, full-flavored cornbread, stir boiling water into part
of the cornmeal before adding the remaining ingredients.

 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems that all that's left of the classic age of
The New Yorker is the typeface and Lillian Ross. She went to work
at the magazine in 1945 and quickly became a legend for her
profiles, notably one on Ernest Hemingway, as well as for Picture,
her book-length story on the making of John Huston's ``The Red
Badge of Courage.'' Ross helped invent a painstaking, incrementally
observational journalism for which others have received most of the
credit.
</P>
<P>
   She has recently published ``Here But Not Here'' (Random House,
$25), a memoir of her 40-year love affair with New Yorker editor
William Shawn that has aroused much negative comment, largely
because of Ross' decision to publish while Shawn's widow is still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn has usually been characterized as a preternaturally shy,
vaguely creepy little man, if, admittedly, a genius, who moved the
magazine away from the light sophistication of founder Harold Ross
to a more serious, reportorial base.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross gives us a Shawn who adores French cooking, movies and
jazz, a passionate man with immense yearnings for a writing career,
who felt imprisoned by his responsibilities _ to the magazine, its
writers and to his separate but, apparently, equal families.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, voluble, continually interesting, Lillian Ross is not a
woman used to bad reviews, and she took the opportunity of a recent
phone conversation to expound on her career, her relationship to
Shawn and the responses her latest book has evoked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was writing ``Here But Not Here'' a way to keep Mr. Shawn
close?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know exactly why I wrote the book _ for three reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Number one, I wrote it for him. He wanted to be regarded as the
man that he was, not this creepy little fellow they insist on
making him.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason was for my son Erik. Because we don't have
much of a family, I wanted Erik to know his own true heritage. Bill
Shawn was like a father with him, and Erik absorbed all of the good
that was in Bill Shawn without any of the handicaps. He wasn't
raised to feel guilty about anything, which Bill was.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, I wrote it for myself, to tell the truth, about a love
story that I think is rather unusual, if not unique.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've always, to the best of my memory, been very
well-treated by reviewers. Has the criticism been difficult for you
to deal with?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been puzzled by it. It's an unusual experience for me.
It seems as though they're not reading the book. They're using it
as a point to take off and express something they've been harboring
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Everything I've written in a way has been controversial,
starting with the profile of Hemingway. I loved him and loved the
way he was. It was such fun to be around him, and we always had a
great time together.
</P>
<P>
   But the profile was taken as devastating. I discovered that
writing is a Rorschach test; people are ready with opinions and
prejudices, and words like ``devastating,'' because of the images
they had in their own heads about what Hemingway should have been.
A writer is supposed to sit in a leather chair with a pipe in his
mouth and contemplate God knows what. My picture of Hemingway was
exactly as he was _ a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't prepared for bad reviews . . . To hear the way these
clods talk about it in what passes for a review, but is really an
opportunity to divest themselves of bitterness or envy or
frustration in their own lives, and their own ignorance . . . They
just come out with it and pretend it's a review.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Shawn have a specific editing method, or did it vary
according to the writer and the subject?
</P>
<P>
   A: It started long before there was a manuscript handed him.
First of all, he was able to tune in to the writer, or the artist.
He often would be able to feel what the writer was trying to do
before he did it, and could give them guidance.
</P>
<P>
   There were others with whom he struggled, and whom he did a good
deal of writing for. He made it part of what they were doing. And
there were still others he felt personally sorry for, and he
struggled with them. One or two became burdens to him, and he
agonized over that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Other than vulgarity, what could be counted on to make alarm
bells go off in his head?
</P>
<P>
   A: Vulgarity is a very broad word when it comes to Bill Shawn.
Obscenities didn't bother Bill. He used them himself, the way all
people do in private.
</P>
<P>
   What always bothered him was unnecessary cruelty; that he found
unacceptable. He had many arguments with one writer in particular,
who was absolutely brilliant, but she could go out of her way to be
cruel, and that bothered him. He tried to get her to be kinder.
</P>
<P>
   He did his best to persuade, but if the writer was implacable _
and she was one of the few who was _ then he would let the word or
the cruelty stand, but he would be depressed about it for three
weeks. But there weren't many who were implacable. They would
listen. And he always tried to encourage writers to write better,
to be writers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Shawn had been able to leave The New Yorker earlier, say
1960 or 1965, would he have been able to begin his own writing
career, or do you feel that his yearnings for a writing career were
just a case of the-grass-is-greener?
</P>
<P>
   A: Perhaps, but it's hard to tell. It's just a guess, and what
does it mean? I don't like psychoanalytic writing, I don't like
giving my opinions, unlike the critics. I like to give very telling
facts, and leave it to the reader to understand, based on his own
capacity to understand. Some understand, and others don't.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of all the writers and artists you've observed and become
friendly with over the years, from Charlie Chaplin to Huston to
Hemingway, are there any specific traits you've noticed that they
have in common?
</P>
<P>
   A: These people were different. Th(ere) was the time I met
Chaplin, who had just married Oona (O'Neill, his last wife), and I
was struck by the difference between people who were geniuses,
artists. I don't know if it can be defined. There's a freedom
there, something that pushes them to express what they have.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out with Chaplin, I saw again how fortunate a genius is
to hook up with the right partner, whether it's a wife or someone
else. Oona gave him a real life, a life that he could enjoy outside
of his work. And that's very rare. That's why you find so many
writers and artists who make one mistake after another in marriages
and relationships. That's one aspect of a genius that's rare, the
ones who are able to enjoy _ I don't like to say little things,
because they're not little. Things like having babies, watching
them grow, being able to participate in that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your work, you have a way of seeming resolutely un-awed by
the legends you're writing about. Is that the way you approach
them, or just the way you feel about them by the time you come to
write about them?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the other way around. I had gotten to know John Huston
several years before he invited me out to watch him make ``The Red
Badge of Courage.'' I found him very, very appealing instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oh?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not like that. I was always very careful about any kind of
personal relationship in that way. You have to remember the
relationship with Bill Shawn started very early; I came to work for
him in '45, and it was only a matter of three or four years before
he started to indicate his feelings. Those were the years I was
starting to do the work I became well known for.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't get personal with them. I found Huston appealing as a
man, but I had my emotional feelings bound up with somebody else.
Some people can have more than one person in their life, but I'm
not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   I think one of the reasons I've always been able to form the
basis for a good working relationship when I'm doing a story is
it's always been a two-way thing. The people liked me and I liked
them. If they hadn't liked me, I wouldn't have been able to work
with them. I love to write about what I love.

 &HT;    Pair of books captures past in different ways
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cover picture is of a hundred or so rotary phones, which
nicely captures the essence of ``Going Going Gone'' (Chronicle,
$19.95) a very amusing volume about vanishing Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things cast into obsolescence are: penmanship, men's
garters, the Red Menace, hotel keys, sanitary napkin belts, the
draft, Civil Defense, slide rules, white gloves, chop suey, men's
clubs, psychoanalysis, the nuclear family, wedding night virgins
and two-newspaper towns.
</P>
<P>
   Call me contrary, but it seems to me that, in most cases, it's
no big loss.
</P>
<P>
   Other things tagged as gone with the wind strike me as debatable
_ nuns, organized labor, paper dolls and even typewriters all seem
to me likely to stick around in some form, if not with the density
they had when the century was younger.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a thought-provoking book about the evolutionary _ and
transitory _ nature of civilization's products.
</P>
<P>
   Another, rather more serious but equally entertaining book is
``Paul Robeson: Artist and Citizen'' (Rutgers University Press,
$25), a collection of essays and beautiful photographs published on
the centenary of the great singer and political activist.
</P>
<P>
   The essays, by writers ranging from Martin Duberman to David
Levering Lewis undertake specific aspects of Robeson's work, from
his singing to his acting to his infatuation with the Soviet
experiment. Charles Musser contributes a very interesting take on
Robeson's work with black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, and his
starring in O'Neill's ``The Emperor Jones'' on stage and film.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know Robeson only from his stunning performance in
the 1937 film of ``Show Boat,'' this collection is a good entry
point to learn more about one of the most gifted, tormented men of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW WRINKLE . . . Random House is extending its Modern Library
franchise into paperbacks for the first time. The first releases in
the new format include Sam Tanenhaus' ``Whittaker Chambers,''
``Nothing But You: Love Stories from The New Yorker,'' and a
paperback original from Filipino author F. Sionil Jose .
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Wilde's ``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' the first book
ever issued by the Modern Library back in 1917, will also be issued
in paperback, as will Volume 1 of the Moncrieff/Kilmartin
translation of ``Swann's Way,'' and a single book including two
volumes Teddy Roosevelt wrote before he became president: ``Hunting
Trips of a Ranchman'' and ``The Wilderness Hunter.''

 &HT;    Are decadent foods disappearing?
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a Valentine's Day without chocolate. Or a birthday party
without ice cream. Or even a wedding without champagne, smoked
salmon or cream cheese to spread on it?
</P>
<P>
   It could happen. Chances are, however, the foods will be around
_ but at a precious price.
</P>
<P>
   Decadent foods may be on the wane for a variety of reasons, but
mostly, it's simply supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Take the butterfat situation _ for only the second time in
history, the price of Grade AA butter recently hit $1.95 a pound on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A predicted shortage had consumers
scrambling for premium ice cream, cheese and butter.
</P>
<P>
   Demand is up for butterfat, said Bob Butler, an Okeechobee,
Fla., dairy farmer. ``Generally, people have decided they prefer
taste again'' after years of low-fat eating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the cows are on a nine-month production schedule. You can
expect higher prices till the cows catch up, Butler said, but we're
in no danger of running out.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the fish is more in question _ demand for seafood is
growing steadily, said David Nitchman, spokesman for the National
Fisheries Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Overfishing has been the result. Some argue that up to 30
percent of species are being overfished _ swordfish, once an
expensive fish but now common, is only one of those species.
Sturgeon, which produce caviar, are threatened, as are certain
types of salmon. But many fish have faced cyclical declines for
several reasons, including popularity.
</P>
<P>
   If left alone, they do recover, said Tom Thomas, of Florida's
Bureau of Seafood and Aquaculture. ``Florida has a management plan
for swordfish, and we do have swordfish _ we want consumers to know
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be enough fish around for everyone, he said, but
maybe not as much and not right away.
</P>
<P>
   Wine experts have already said if you don't have your Dom
Perignon for the year 2000 New Year's celebration, you aren't
getting any. Production for premium champagnes, again, is only so
great _ and we're talking about a whole world celebrating with a
toast.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for Godiva, and other chocolate, is pretty sweet,
however, even though prices may increase to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Smith, spokeswoman for the Chocolate Manufacturers of
America, said, ``Researchers are just now beginning to learn how to
better grow the beans, and increase production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not in any danger of running out of chocolate
any time, but I can't predict the prices,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Art Simmering, trend watcher and editor of Trend/Watch, a
newsletter for the food industry, said luxury foods will always be
with us, but their availability is simply ``supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, he said, chocolate, caviar and butter _ and
other luxury foods _ may again find their way back to their high
positions in the food pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a good thing,'' he said. ``Maybe some of us could
stand to cut back on our consumption of things like butter, and ice
cream, you know?''

 &HT;    Honey eating beetle is everyone's beeswax
 &HT;    By Jim Reeder
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ A tiny beetle that somehow made its way from
South Africa to attack honeybee hives in South Florida threatens
the state's $11 million honey business as well as other crops that
depend on bees to pollinate their flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The beetles eat the honey, defecate in the honeycomb and destroy
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sour, rotten honey running out of the hives,'' said
Laurence Cutts of the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services. ``It's sickening.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials can't figure out how the beetle moved from
South Africa to a Port St. Lucie area grove where it was discovered
last fall but only identified in early June.
</P>
<P>
   The beetle has spread to Indian River, Lake, Polk, Brevard and
Martin counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew exactly what they were, their potential for damage
or what to do about it,'' said Cutts. ``They totally destroy the
combs, honey, the bees _ they wipe out everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The small hive beetle is a native of South Africa and until
recently had been found nowhere in the western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Beetles live in bee hives as larva and as adults, though the
pupa live in soil, Cutts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody brings South African dirt to Florida and it would be
easier to smuggle in an elephant than to bring in a bee hive,''
Cutts said. ``We have no earthly idea how they got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony York, a Fort Pierce beekeeper, noticed the beetles last
fall but didn't think it was a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider anything a threat until something happens to
the hive,'' York said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the beetles have destroyed 32 of his hives.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Russ of Haines City discovered the beetle in hives he was
keeping near Port St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought it in and said it was killing his hives,'' Cutts
said. ``I didn't believe it and thought the beetles were just
scavenging in a sick hive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 38 of Russ' 40 hives have been destroyed and another is on
the critical list.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture and state officials are
studying the pest in hopes of finding a way to control it.
</P>
<P>
   They're studying pesticides, traps , bacteria, fungus and other
methods to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   The beetles aren't considered a problem in South Africa where
they co-habit with the tougher ``killer bees'' on that continent,
Cutts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not a serious concern except among the weakest
hives,'' Cutts said. ``The killer bees there defend their hives
vigorously and are able to keep the beetle at bay more than our
docile European bees.''

 &HT;    Author Raye Virginia Allen rediscovers art of Gordon Conway
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Most of us first heard about Gordon Conway when she
became the subject of a book.
</P>
<P>
   She was a Texas debutante with a man's name who broke into the
male-dominated New York advertising and magazine world in 1914. At
age 20, she helped inaugurate the fashion image of the Jazz Age's
New Woman with her stylized drawings for Vogue, Vanity Fair and
Harper's Bazaar magazines. Her working years took her from New York
to Paris and London. She created billboards and costumes for stage
and film, became a set designer, and managed the first costume
department at a British film studio. All the while, she created
posters and illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Her high-pressure, stressful life resulted in a heart attack at
age 39 that forced her to retire. And she faded from view. Just
like that.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It was mainly her health. But styles in art were changing.
The public came to prefer a softer edge. The less-expensive
photographic image had begun to replace drawing. Plus, she was away
from urban centers and thus easily forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Always a loner, Conway did not network in professional
associations and had no acolytes or interns to keep her name alive
once she left the scene. At least, that's the way the author of
``Gordon Conway: Fashioning a New Woman'' explains how she came to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Conway, who died in 1956, remained forgotten until another
well-connected Texan, Raye Virginia Allen, researched her story and
put it into a book. Since its publication last fall by the
University of Texas Press, ``Gordon Conway: Fashioning a New
Woman'' has prompted _ and continues to prompt _ numerous exhibits
around the country on the talented artist and her work.
</P>
<P>
   And within the past year, most of Conway's original artwork has
been collected by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at
UT.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the renewed interest in Conway is the seductive
nature of her colorful, sophisticated drawings. Another is the
passion author Allen feels for her subject, spending more than a
decade working on this book. Living part of the year in Washington,
D.C., and the rest at her comfortable hilltop home in Temple, Allen
proselytizes for Conway from both places. Scheduled events have
included one this past April at the National Museum of Women in the
Arts as well as upcoming fall events in Austin, Kerrville,
Galveston, Dallas, Corpus Christi, Fort Worth, Nacogdoches, New
York, and London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I traveled for 14 years in search of the woman's artwork and
life story,'' Allen said. ``Now _ in 1998-'99 _ I'm telling the
tale of the hard-working glamorous New Woman in the very places
that unearthed details of her era between the World Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her artwork is so gay and cheerful and happy, so full of
celebration,'' Allen said, ``even when her personal life was on a
downward spiral. At first everything came together for her and it
all seemed so effortless. She had this Texas savvy about how to get
things done.'' But then, Allen said, the stress of her meteoric
career cut short her life.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in Conway for Allen began not in Texas but in
Washington, where Allen's husband was part of the Carter
administration, and she was a cultural historian serving on the
board of the American Folklife Center. A friend from Paris, Texas,
introduced her to a cousin of Conway who owned the collection of
the late artist's work, diaries and letters. After seeing the
pictures and learning of the archives, Allen scrapped other plans
and agreed to write her American Studies dissertation at UT on
Conway. ``I knew I should do it and could do it, and I wanted to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her UT adviser, the Pulitzer-Prize winning historian William
Goetzmann, agreed. ``He told me, `Raye, if you have the use of this
private collection and archives, do not miss a day. Join up.' So I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare chance to do primary research on an important
shaper of popular taste. Born in Cleburne, reared in Dallas, and
educated in Washington and Switzerland, Conway grew up wealthy. Her
forte became the creation of images that fed the dreams of
middle-class people everywhere yearning for glamour and excitement.
``If the stern women's movements of the early 20th century aimed to
drag males into the world of equality,'' UT professor Goetzmann
wrote in the introduction to Allen's book, ``Conway's females
enticed them into it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether on paper, on stage, or in person, Gordon carefully
developed her style like a commodity for the consumer market _ a
product that a large segment of the public liked and came to
expect,'' Allen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One Conde Nast editor at the time said, ``The American woman
feels that she can be a better wife, a better worker, if she can
only believe that glamour is to be her lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As the book tells it, the backstory was that Conway fought
stress by reordering the world around her. Art and design became
the leitmotif of her life.
</P>
<P>
   What came to interest Allen as much as Conway's art was her
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started out, it was to write about the artwork
and how it reflected the culture _ also, how she helped shape it.
That eventually became Part II of the book. Once I got into the
diaries and interviews and discovered her stress level and burnout,
I realized this was a very modern story,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my editor at UT Press, Frankie Westbrook, that modern
women would identify with this story, and she agreed I should write
it.... I would like to think I have resurrected Gordon Conway.
She's a woman who deserves it _ a model for women today
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen did 75 interviews researching the book. She talked to
family, friends and associates of Conway, as well as to authorities
on that time period. Of Conway's declining days, Allen says that
she ``remained optimistic, even though she had cancer and heart
trouble. She stayed hopeful by sheer will. She never complained.
She didn't want her mother to know she had cancer.'' In the last 14
years of her life, Conway had various malignancies from breast
cancer to uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Allen writes that on the afternoon before Conway died, at the
family estate in Virginia in 1956, she went downstairs for a game
of backgammon with her mother. ``Halfway into the game, she sighed
and asked to be excused.''

 &HT;    Profile of Seattle rocker Pete Droge
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN Like most great heart-on-their-sleeve garage-rockers,
Pete Droge looks as if he should be working in a convenience store
or a sandwich shop somewhere. His T-shirts and shaggy, lazy hair
recall the looks of everyone from Soul Asylum and Matthew Sweet to
a young Tom Petty, and his melodic, guitar-heavy, three-chord rock
songs are as simple yet wonderful as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   While Soul Asylum was making cameos in ``Clerks'' and Petty was
dancing around with Kim Basinger, though, Droge was working on his
1994 debut, ``Necktie Second,'' which featured the rock radio hit
``If You Don't Love Me (I'll Kill Myself).'' Four years later, the
question is whether there's any place left for Droge or other
plainly clothed rockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be,'' the 29-year-old singer said recently,
calling from his home in Seattle. ``Guys like me, though, have to
go the more traditional routes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Droge, ``traditional'' means touring a lot, which he does.
His show at La Zona Rosa on Friday will be his third stop in Austin
this year.
</P>
<P>
   It also means he has to make great records instead of strong
singles. Which he has done. His 1996 LP ``Find a Door'' was one of
the highlights of that year, a rootsy, toe-tapping,
sing-along-worthy disc from start to finish. His new one, ``Spacey
and Shakin,'' is almost as enjoyable, featuring a touch of
psychedelia and an overload of guitar effects layered onto Droge's
catchy, melodic numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction to being on tour,'' Droge said of the
louder, fuller sound on ``Spacey and Shakin,'' augmented by his
longtime backing band, the Sinners. ``It's a natural thing. Iif you
perform a lot, you're going to want to turn it up and let the band
loose. That's just what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spacey and Shakin'' _ produced, like Droge's other albums, by
Brendan O'Brien (Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine) _ was also
the result of some down time that occurred when Droge's former
record label, American Recordings, folded. Because of the record
company's foundering business, the ``Find a Door'' album went
mostly unnoticed. You probably won't hear Droge complaining,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was frustrating at first, going on tour and not
seeing my record in any of the record stores,'' he said. ``But
looking back, it gave me some much-needed down time. I had the
chance to really think these songs and this album through and take
a breather, and that may have been more healthy for my longevity
than making a hit out of that record.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, there really is only one way to make a hit in
Droge's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sort of a romantic notion about what rock 'n' roll used
to be,'' he said. ``I still believe in the hard-work ethic and that
genuine connection you make with audiences at a concert. Everything
else is unimportant.''

 &HT;    The shrewdest one was Madeline
 &HT;    By Dale Fuchs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: A Long Island lass heralds Friday's big screen
debut of the plucky French heroine every girl knew.
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   In a new house in Boca without any vines,
</P>
<P>
   I recall my youth as I sip red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, I read bedtime stories all the time;
</P>
<P>
   my favorite one was Madeline.
</P>
<P>
   She was so different from you and me;
</P>
<P>
   she lived in a house in Gay Paree
</P>
<P>
   with 11 little girls in two straight lines,
</P>
<P>
   and wherever they went, people spoke in rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   (What that house was, I could never tell _
</P>
<P>
   An orphanage? A prep school? A convent? Oh, well.)
</P>
<P>
   Madeline was famous for raising hell,
</P>
<P>
   and oh, could she frighten that Miss Clavel.
</P>
<P>
   The action always took place somewhere pretty,
</P>
<P>
   some touristy spot in that classy French city.
</P>
<P>
   I, meanwhile, lived an ocean away,
</P>
<P>
   in a boring 'burb off the Long Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   While Madeline would dress oh-so-proper
</P>
<P>
   I looked nothing like a Chanel shopper.
</P>
<P>
   No matched hats and coats or Catholic school shoes:
</P>
<P>
   I wore pink Danskins and rubber snow boots.
</P>
<P>
   While she got to stroll past the Eiffel Tower,
</P>
<P>
   I sat home with the Flintstones for hours.
</P>
<P>
   And when Miss Clavel took the girls to the Seine,
</P>
<P>
   My mom shlepped me to Loehmann's again.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, I rode the bus to Cantiague School
</P>
<P>
   where standing in two straight lines wasn't cool.
</P>
<P>
   No reason for mom to dial DANton-ten-six,
</P>
<P>
   'cause nothing (shucks) was wrong with my appendix.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, Madeline hasn't grown.
</P>
<P>
   She has no job or home of her own.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be deceived by her innocent looks.
</P>
<P>
   She's making a mint with dolls, videos and books.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, readers cried, ``Boo Hoo!
</P>
<P>
   We want a movie tie-in, too!''
</P>
<P>
   So now like the mermaid and Mr. Magoo,
</P>
<P>
   Madeline is coming to a theater near you.
</P>
<P>
   (But I'll skip the movie _ in sunshine or rain.
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving my money for a Paris-bound plane.)

 &HT;    School program scheduled out of space flight
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A popular education program has been scratched from
the October space shuttle flight of Sen. John Glenn because the
astronauts are booked solid with a vast array of science
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   One school in Japan and five in the United States _ including
John Glenn High School in New Concord _ were each scheduled to
connect via amateur radio with the shuttle Discovery for 10-minute
conversations between students and astronauts. Although the
air-time is relatively short, NASA schedulers decided last week
that the process of setting up and then stowing the radio equipment
makes the classroom program too time-consuming for a mission that
already has more than 80 experiments aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time-liners have come to the conclusion that it doesn't
all fit,'' said Doug Ward, head of public information at Johnson
Space Center in Houston. ``That's not one we like to give up, but
it also has a lower priority than the science.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) began in 1983
aboard the ninth shuttle mission, and spent its first few years as
a secondary project that astronauts did only in their leisure time.
Although it now is a scheduled shuttle program like any other, it's
not uncommon for a SAREX project to be scratched when a shuttle
schedule gets too full.
</P>
<P>
   Now NASA's education division is looking for a replacement
project that will fit the schedule of the nine-day flight that also
has great education potential because of its high public profile
with Glenn aboard. In addition to being the oldest person in space
(he'll be 77 by launch day), Glenn is returning to space for the
first time since being the first American to orbit the earth in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Robertson, who heads the education and information
services division of the Johnson Center, said she's been given a
short window in the astronauts' schedule to fill with an education
project and she said Glenn will be at the center of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 30 minutes open for some kind of education event,''
she said. ``And right now, we don't know what that's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Word that the SAREX program had gotten the ax apparently hadn't
reached Glenn, who on Tuesday touted it as one of the
``intangible'' benefits of the space program. During debate on the
Senate floor over an amendment to kill the International Space
Station, Glenn's defense of the station included mention of the
radio talks he'd be giving to students while aboard the Discovery
in October.
</P>
<P>
   A staff member for Glenn said the senator wouldn't comment on
the loss of SAREX from his mission because he doesn't want to
overstep his role as a regular member of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Since being named to shuttle crew in January, Glenn has taken
pains to point out how ``research rich'' the flight would be, and
two weeks ago his flight commander, Air Force Lt. Col. Curt Brown,
said in Houston that the flight was so rich in experiments that
NASA schedulers were considering cutting some projects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a multitude of experiments, the crew also will
use the heavy mechanical arm in the shuttle's cargo bay to deploy
and then retrieve a sun-measuring device called the Spartan. Glenn
himself will be the subject of two experiments in which scientists
are searching for links between the human body's reaction to
extended periods of weightlessness and old age, which cause similar
debilitating effects.

 &HT;    She wanted a picture of her smiling son's face
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The woman on the other end of the phone line identified herself
as Betty Capps, not that this meant anything to me. I have a hard
enough time putting
</P>
<P>
   names with faces, much less voices on the telephone. I just
assumed that Mrs. Capps was a loyal reader with a problem.
</P>
<P>
   That much was true, though it was a problem I had never been
presented with before, or since. Nor do I expect it to happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   Her complaint began in an ordinary enough fashion. She was upset
about her son's picture in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I got an instant mental picture. I didn't know
who her son was, but I imagined it was somebody who had been shown
on the front page
</P>
<P>
   of the newspaper, legs splayed, hands up against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   I put on my stern editor's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Capps, this newspaper has a duty to print the news of the
community, as uncomfortable. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Capps heard me, if she was even listening, I will never
know. She just kept right on with her compliant.
</P>
<P>
   I just had to do something about her son's picture. She was
nice, but firm beyond any thought that she might change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Capps, what do you want me to do?'' I was getting a bit
exasperated, but I already had a good idea I was going to lose this
argument.
</P>
<P>
   She paused for a moment and then said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to get him to smile.''
</P>
<P>
   A brief picture of a criminal up against the wall smiling at the
camera flashed through my mind before I realized something was
wrong here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is your son, Mrs. Capps?''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jack Stallard, the sports editor at the Lufkin Daily News
and who now works for our sister paper, the Longview News-Journal.
Mrs. Capps had a
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin paper mailed to her mostly to read her son's column. The
column was accompanied by a thumbnail picture of a serious
Stallard. I had questioned
</P>
<P>
   the picture at the time, but Jack mumbled something about how
women loved the serious look.
</P>
<P>
   Not the one woman who counted. She had apparently been pestering
him for a while to change the picture but he had conveniently
forgotten. When that
</P>
<P>
   failed she went to the top. Lord knows where she would have gone
had I not responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack has such a pretty smile,'' she said, though ``pretty''
was never an adjective I used when describing Stallard. ``The world
needs to see my son smile.''
</P>
<P>
   I agreed and thanked Mrs. Capps for the call. I walked to my
office door and ordered Jack inside. Now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will,'' I said, ``get a new picture taken this moment. In
that picture you will give your best smile. When you go home this
weekend, you will show
</P>
<P>
   it to your mama and see if that smile is good enough. If it is
not, you will retake that picture until you get it right.
Understand?''
</P>
<P>
   He understood.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later I got another call from Mrs. Capps thanking
me for the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love that smile,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's mom died last week. I had only met her in person a few
times, but I knew her well, through three of her sons.
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes happens that good people produce bad children, but
bad people almost never rear good kids.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of her children, the ones I know, are first rate.
One was a career Marine who is the only male I've ever let keep my
children overnight
</P>
<P>
   (he actually drilled them). One is a Lufkin police officer; the
other is Jack, who is one of the best people I've ever known.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Mrs. Capps would have understood why Jack's smile was
gone last week, but I don't think it is something she would accept
for very long.
</P>
<P>
   The world needs to see your smile, Jack. Don't take it from me,
those are your mother's words.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note:
</P>
<P>
   Emily quit smoking three months ago Monday. But folks, it hasn't
always been pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks prior to April 6
</P>
<P>
   Wherever I was _ baseball game, car, kitchen talking on the
phone, computer at home _ tried to imagine myself not smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, April 5
</P>
<P>
   Filled out my quit smoking pledge card.
</P>
<P>
   Got my little nicotine patches all ready for in the morning
</P>
<P>
   Bought sugarless gum, and put it in a bowl on the kitchen
counter
</P>
<P>
   Bought vegetables and cut them up
</P>
<P>
   Smoked like a fiend all day
</P>
<P>
   Smoked last cigarette around 7 p.m. (when pack ran out.)
</P>
<P>
   Went to bed at 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't fall asleep because I was so scared about tomorrow
</P>
<P>
   Monday, April 6
</P>
<P>
   Ate chips and dip all morning
</P>
<P>
   Swam in pool every time I felt like smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Had girlfriend over with her kids and we swam and stenciled
little buckets (that we later put plants in)
</P>
<P>
   Called girlfriend on vacation to wish her Happy 40th BD. (Quit
on April 6 so I'd always remember the quit date. Her birthday.)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, April 7
</P>
<P>
   Felt like a crazy woman all day. Talked on the phone. Wanted a
cigarette so bad my insides were actually itching.
</P>
<P>
   April 17
</P>
<P>
   Went out drinking with the girls to celebrate Riz' 40th
birthday. Didn't smoke!
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, April 18
</P>
<P>
   Hung over from last night's shenanigans. Didn't wear patch
today. Didn't smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, April 19
</P>
<P>
   Still hung over. Didn't smoke. Didn't wear patch.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, April 25
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina for my niece's wedding. Marty smoked a
cigarette and I wanted one so much my mouth was actually watering.
I WISH I SMOKED!!
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, April 26
</P>
<P>
   Woke up glad that I didn't smoke yesterday

   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News,'' said Young, a
past chairman of the American Chemical Society Division of Chemical
Health and Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a former chemistry professor at Florida State University,
said that E. coli bacteria are quickly killed in a pool with proper
levels of chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Hancock, an epidemiologist at Washington State University,
said E. coli might survive for some time in properly chlorinated
water if the bacteria were encased in feces. If feces became lodged
in a pool's filter system, it could slowly dissolve and be released
unnoticed into the water, lengthening the time of hazard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and health officials stress that the White Water E. coli
outbreak is only the second known case of a pool spreading the
disease. The first also occurred in Georgia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Without state laws, Georgia counties and cities are free to set
differing standards on pool care. Fulton County, for instance,
allows public pools to dip to 0.5 parts per million on a chlorine
test before posting a failing grade.
</P>
<P>
   Hall County does not routinely inspect the water park at Lake
Lanier Islands. The seven pools at Stone Mountain are inspected
about once a month during the summer, according to DeKalb County
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among Southeastern states, Florida, South Carolina and North
Carolina have statewide pool laws. Florida is considered toughest
at cracking down on its 30,000 public pools, taking action against
4,000 of them last year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 water parks operate in the U.S. and Canada, and
inspection routines vary so much that it's difficult to compare
them to White Water's track record.
</P>
<P>
   In San Dimas, Calif., the county inspects the pools at Raging
Waters twice a month during the warmer months. That's twice as
often as the Marietta pools are checked. About once a month, one of
the 13 attractions falls below the county's chlorine minimum of 1.0
parts per million, which local officials consider a good record.
</P>
<P>
   Like Georgia, there's no state law on public pool sanitation in
Missouri, where the owners of White Water have another water park
in Branson. That city has adopted a low-chlorine standard of 0.4
parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   But at even lower levels of chlorine a pool may pass inspection
depending upon other factors, said Health Department director
Linnea Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Only one pool has failed at the Missouri water park since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But if one of the pools at the Soak City water park in Sandusky,
Ohio falls below 1.0, it fails, said Sandusky sanitarian Bob
Butler. Butler inspects the pools twice a year and said a Soak City
pool fails about once every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorine testing is not an exact science, and mistakes are easy
to make, said Wally James, president of Con-Serve Associates, an
Iowa-based water park consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections are conducted by dipping a small container into the
pool, and then mixing the water with a chemical that turns varying
shades of pink, depending on the chlorine level.
</P>
<P>
   The dyed water is then held up to a color chart and matched to a
color that indicates the chlorine level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hold the kit up to the sun, or do the test in poor
light, you could be off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James said investigators looking into the E. coli infections may
want to check beyond the pool. ``E. coli dies within six seconds in
water with 2.0 (parts per million) chlorine,'' he said. James
speculated that the outbreak might stem from a child having an
``accident'' in one of the bathrooms, on a pool deck, or some other
place where chlorine is not used.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials have discounted that possibility, said Joyce
Goldberg, spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Resources.
``We believe it was probably a bunch of kids in a corner of a pool
in close proximity to the one who had the accident,'' Goldberg
said.

 &HT;    Mr. Payroll debuts at Ohio Speedway/Starvin' Marvin
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A new money machine making its Dayton debut uses
military technology to let people cash checks anytime they like.
</P>
<P>
   The Mr. Payroll Check Cashing Machine has been installed at the
Speedway/Starvin' Marvin station at 2232 Needmore Rd., just west of
Interstate 75. Nestled between car care products and soft drinks,
the machine cashes any type of check any time of day without photo
identification.
</P>
<P>
   On first use, the machine asks for the user's address and other
information to help establish the person's identity. The machine
also uses technology called facial biometrics to electronically
measure and record an image of the user's face.
</P>
<P>
   On subsequent visits, customers enter their Social Security
numbers while the machine photographs the faces and matches them
with images on file. If number and photo match up, the check is
cashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security feature on this is outstanding,'' said R. Day
Harter, Speedway district manager. ``People can steal your PIN
number from your ATM card, but they can't steal your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first machine became operational in June 1997, 45 more
have been installed in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Payroll is the brainchild of Michael Stinson, who founded
Mr. Payroll Corp. in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we thought there was potential for an evolutionary
development along the way,'' Stinson said. By October 1996, the
company had an agreement to develop the machine. The following
summer, the first machine was unveiled for public use.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Payroll charges 1.5 percent of the amount cashed for
payroll/government checks; 2.5 percent for personal and two-party
checks; and 3.5 percent for tax, insurance and other checks.
Stinson said the cost to use Mr. Payroll compares favorably with
other outlets for getting quick cash, such as automatic teller
machines and stand-alone check-cashing outlets, whose fees can go
as high as 20 percent in some markets.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson said the company will monitor how well Mr. Payroll is
received in Dayton before deciding whether to add machines in the
Miami Valley and in Speedways across the country. Harter said the
response so far has been positive, with lines forming in the store
the first weekend in July.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson said he hopes to install Mr. Payroll in grocery stores,
major discount stores and a variety of bank branches. Already Mr.
Payroll is in 11 Wells Fargo bank branches for use by non-bank
customers, he said

JUDGE PUTS OFF HEARING ON WOMAN ACCUSED OF KILLING NEWBORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Jersey judge on Wednesday abruptly postponed Thursday's
scheduled court hearing for the 19-year-old New Jersey woman
accused of killing her newborn son at her high school senior prom
in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, Melissa Drexler of Forked River, had planned to
plead guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated manslaughter at the
hearing, said a person, speaking on the condition of anonymity, who
was familiar with her recent plea-bargaining talks with the
Monmouth County prosecutor, John Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge John A. Ricciardi of State Superior Court in Freehold
adjourned the hearing without explanation. William Mack, the
court's criminal case manager, said he did not know why the judge
took the action, adding that he was unaware of any request by Kaye
or Miss Drexler's lawyer, Steven Secare, for the adjournment. A new
date for the hearing has not been set.

JUDGE QUESTIONS KING JURORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge questioned each juror in the fraud
trial of Don King on Wednesday to gauge the impact that one
panelist had on the others by relating a news report of the
sentence King could face if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The all-day interviewing in U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence
McKenna's chambers in Manhattan, postponed the third day of
deliberations and delayed McKenna's expected ruling on a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of defrauding a Lloyd's of London insurance
syndicate in 1991, King could be sentenced to up to 45 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The jury forewoman sent McKenna two notes on Tuesday, one saying
she was convinced that a verdict could not be reached because of a
holdout juror and another that ``the one juror,'' possibly the
holdout, had related the newspaper report about the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In the second note, the forewoman also said she wanted to
discuss matters privately with McKenna, who said he would let her
``tell me what she wanted to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what she is going to say,'' McKenna said.

Americana. Another, rather more serious but equally entertaining

BOTH SIDES SPEAK AT ANTI-DESECRATION BILL HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending to correct Rick Monday team affiliation to Cubs.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wednesday was Flag Day at the US Senate as Tommy
Lasorda of the Los Angeles Dodgers and other Americans told the
Judiciary Committee of their love for the red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  During a hearing on a proposed constitutional amendment that
would allow Congress to protect the flag from desecration, others
testified that what the flag represented was more important.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version of the flag desecration amendment
last year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee approved it by a 10-7
vote June 24. A date has not been set for the full Senate to vote
on the issue, but a close vote is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda and most of the other panelists said they support the
amendment. The Dodgers' general manager told of a time he witnessed
protesters set fire to a flag at a Dodgers game against the Chicago
Cubs in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all watched dumbstruck as the man pulled out a match and
tried to light the American flag to burn it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said Cubs outfielder Rick Monday committed ``one of the
most heroic acts ever to take place on the field during a Major
League Baseball game'' when the player grabbed the burning flag
from the protester and ran toward the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``And without any prompting that I can remember, the whole crowd
stood and began to fill the stadium with an impromptu rendition of
`God Bless America,' '' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Another celebrity, actor and singer John Schneider, who played
Bo Duke in the former television show ``Dukes of Hazzard,'' also
encouraged the Senate to pass the amendment. Schneider has recorded
a song called ``I Love Old Glory,'' which was written by Senator
Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who sponsored the proposed amendment, said, ``While it
might be nice if a statute were all that was needed to permit
Congress to prohibit flag desecration, a constitutional amendment
is necesary because the Supreme Court has given us no choice in the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 and in 1990 that flag burning is
considered free speech and protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said ``it
may be the most politically unpopular position I could take,'' but
he opposes the proposed amendment. Although he is offended by acts
of flag desecration, Feingold said, people should have the right to
commit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand in opposition to this amendment because it will limit
Americans' First Amendment right to freedom of speech _ the most
fundamental of rights guaranteed our citizens by our Constitution
and the most fundamental of rights necessary to maintain our
constitutional democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin V. Stenhammar, a disabled veteran from Asheville, N.C.,
also urged the Senate to vote against the amendment. ``Flags, no
matter how honored, do not have rights. People do. Please protect
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be enacted, the proposed amendment must pass the Senate with
a two-thirds vote and then be ratified by 38 states. In 1995, a
similar amendment failed by three votes in the Senate.

LYME DISEASE TICK AN ADDED GOLF COURSE HAZARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By TOPSY SIDEROWF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you play golf, you're at risk for getting Lyme disease. In
fact, the worse you play, the greater your chances. Deer ticks,
prime agents in the spread of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases,
lurk in the damp, tall grass of the rough and leafy underbrush of
the surrounding woods.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go nonchalantly looking for balls that stray off the
fairway. That's especially true if you play in metropolitan New
York, one of the endemic areas for the disease in the country. New
York state leads the nation with more than 40,000 cases reported
between 1982 and 1997. Connecticut, where Lyme disease was first
identified in 1975, is next, followed by New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   From early reports, this is going to be a bumper year. ``On a
scale of 0 to 10, the tick index is 10 now and it's likely to
remain 10 for the next several weeks,'' said Rich Falco, an
entomologist at Fordham.
</P>
<P>
   Nymphal ticks, active through August, are the culprits. Often
undetected because they're so small _ like a sesame seed _ nymphs
account for 95 percent of Lyme disease cases. Apple-seed-sized
adult ticks, which come out in the fall, are less of a threat,
since they are more likely to be seen and felt.
</P>
<P>
   A bull's-eye rash is the classic symptom of Lyme disease. If you
have this, it means the tick that bit you is infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes the disease. See a physician
immediately. Early Lyme disease responds to antibiotics like
doxycycline and amoxicillin.
</P>
<P>
   But diagnosis is sometimes elusive because the tell-tale rash
appears in only 80 percent of cases. There's also a high
false-negative response in laboratory tests early in the disease.
If you feel as though you have a summer flu _ fever, chills,
headache, muscle and joint pains _ but no runny nose, and have
spent time outdoors in a Lyme disease-endemic area _ like the
Northeast, the upper Midwest and northern California _chances are
good it's Lyme disease. Untreated, it can lead to chronic arthritis
and heart and nervous system abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   This same deer tick is responsible for two other emerging
tick-borne diseases, ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Both are more
severe initially than Lyme, but respond well to therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few simple precautions can reduce your exposure to tick
bites by 99 percent,'' said David Weld, executive director of the
American Lyme Disease Foundation in Somers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Spray exposed skin and pant legs with a repellent containing
DEET (diethyl-meta-toluamide). Since ticks are found on the ground,
you need only spray from the knees down. Reapply if you have become
wet. Follow directions on the label.
</P>
<P>
   After your round, do a tick check. Inspect your scalp, armpits,
groin, beltline, back, nape of the neck and behind the knees. If
you find a tick, remove it with a tweezer, grasping the tick by the
head close to the skin. Apply antiseptic at the site. If you remove
the tick within 24 hours after attachment, you are much less likely
to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   Wash your golf clothes and dry them in a dryer after each
wearing. The heat will kill any roaming ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Wear lightly colored clothing so you can more easily see ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Your course superintendent can also take the following steps to
reduce tick populations:
</P>
<P>
   Spray the perimeter with an insecticide between late May and
early June. This targets and eliminates most nymphs.
</P>
<P>
   Build nests for hawks and owls. These birds feed on small
rodents, which are essential in perpetuating the life cycle of a
deer tick.
</P>
<P>
   Clean up wood and leaf piles, which attract rodents.
</P>
<P>
   Lay a 3- to 4-foot-wide path of mulch between your course and
the woods. This creates a barrier ticks won't cross.
</P>
<P>
   Also, SmithKline Beecham's Lymerix vaccine has been recommended
for approval by an advisory panel to the FDA and should be approved
and available for those ages 15 to 70 by the end of August. Three
inoculations over a period of 12 months have been shown to induce
immunity for 8 out of 10 people.

Disease Foundation at (800) 876-LYME or (914) 277-6970

FEW HAVE SPOKEN EASILY IN DISCUSSION ON RACE, CLINTON NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wrapping up his yearlong race initiative, President
Clinton conceded Wednesday that he has had trouble getting people
to talk bluntly and honestly about their racial feelings and that
America's increasing diversity has made the subject more complex
and harder to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that ``unique and still unresolved issues between
black and white Americans'' exist, but he has sought to emphasize
how the country is becoming more ``multi-racial, multi-ethnic,
multi-religious ... and therefore it will be more important both to
understand the differences and identify the common values that hold
us together.''
</P>
<P>
   In a taping of a dialogue on race that will be broadcast on PBS,
Clinton said, ``I think the more people work and learn and worship,
if they have faith, and serve together, the more likely you are to
strike the right balance between celebrating our differences
instead of being afraid of them and still identifying common
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Clinton in the hourlong discussion was a panel of eight
journalists and scholars, moderated by Jim Lehrer of ``The NewsHour
with Jim Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the other panelists darted from such topics as
affirmative action, the poor, mixed marriages, and the language of
race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodriguez, editor of the Pacific News Service and
essayist for ``The NewsHour,'' told Clinton: ``The racial
relationships now in America are so complex and so rich that it
seems to me that we don't have a language even to keep up with that
complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez spoke of a young woman who was asked about her racial
identity and called herself a ``Blaxican,'' because her father is
African-American and her mother is Mexican. ``The fact is we have
been falling in love with each other for over 200 years in this
country, from Pocahontas to Thomas Jefferson's children,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed to agree, later suggesting: ``We need a
vocabulary that embraces America's future. We need a vocabulary
that embraces America's present and past on this race issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The session was the last of three conversations on race led by
Clinton as part of the President's Initiative on Race. The
initiative began in June 1997 with the appointment of a
seven-member advisory board to help spark a national conversation
on race.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's taping, Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence
Page pointedly told Clinton that a problem with the racial dialogue
was the advisory board's ``tiptoeing around the really tough issues
of race'' and its reluctance to grapple with affirmative action.
Clinton did not directly respond.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Lehrer asked Clinton whether he had trouble
getting people to open up and talk about race. The usually verbose
Clinton simply responded: ``Yeah, we don't talk a lot about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer then asked the panel, ``How do you get people to talk
about race?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walk into a room. I think people are always talking about
race,'' said Sherman Alexie, a filmmaker and author of nine books.
``They use coded language. Well, nobody says that's a black person,
let's talk about being black. It ends up coming up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie, who is a Native American, gave an example: ``What they
will do is come up to me and tell me they're Cherokee. But that's
usually what it amounts to.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laughed because earlier in the discussion, he said he
didn't know much about the American Indians while growing up in
Arkansas. But he had mentioned that his grandmother was one-quarter
Cherokee.

CITING STUDY, MAYOR SAYS WORKFARE DOESN'T HURT STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brandishing a new study by the city comptroller's
office, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said Wednesday that despite fears
to the contrary, his workfare policy requiring welfare recipients
to work for their benefits is good for students at City University
of New York who are receiving public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It improves their grade point average,'' Giuliani said at a
news conference. ``It improves their chance of remaining in school
because they drop out less often, and it improves their chance to
graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that CUNY students on workfare assignments
during the 1996-1997 school year had slightly higher grades and
slightly lower drop-out rates than the average for other students
who were not on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The study covered only students remaining in college after
workfare provisions were enacted, not the 5,000 or so welfare
recipients who dropped out soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor also attacked Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a
Democrat, saying that he had withheld the study for ideological
reasons because it supported the mayor's position.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, Hevesi called his own news conference to deny
the charge, and to say that he agreed with the mayor that CUNY
students on welfare should work.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that 287 students who had workfare jobs for at
least half of the fall semester had a 2.59 grade point average,
while the 160,000 CUNY students not on welfare had a 2.53 average.
Those workfare students earned an average of 10 credits that
semester and 83 percent enrolled for the spring semester, while the
comparison group earned an average of 9 credits and had a 79
percent spring enrollment rate. The study did not look at how
students' grades and credit loads changed from one semester to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY officials declined to comment on the report, except to say
that the period studied was brief and the sample of students small.
</P>
<P>
   Workfare has been a running battle between CUNY and the Giuliani
administration since the policy was instituted in 1995. At that
time, about 27,000 CUNY students were on public assistance, more
than any other college or university in New York state. By
mid-1996, that number had dropped by 17 percent, and CUNY officials
said that although students dropped out for many reasons, the new
workfare requirement was a serious obstacle for many students.

UTILITY SEEKS TO CLOSE NUCLEAR PLANT IT CAN'T SELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Officials of GPU Service Inc., a utility based in
Parsippany, N.J., said Wednesday that efforts over the last year to
sell its Oyster Creek nuclear plant had been unsuccessful and that
it would now begin steps to decommission the plant and close it by
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The plant could have continued to operate until 2009, when its
operating license will expire.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear from the company and the state's
Board of Public Utilities what impact if any the closing would have
on electrical rates for the company's two million customers in 13
counties in the central and southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement came as the utility industry is undergoing
sweeping deregulation, which has so far increased the available
sources of electricity, thereby lowering its costs. At the same
time, GPU has begun to divest itself of its generating plants and
to convert itself into only a buyer and distributor of electricity.
Because of these factors, regulatory officials and executives at
the utility said, the move to close the nuclear plant has raised
tough new questions for both the company and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a serious and extensive effort to sell the plant,''
Fred D. Hafer, the president and chief executive officer of GPU,
said in a statement. ``However, in the end we were unable to
finalize a deal with the one potential buyer who expressed an
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hafer said that the company would seek state approval for the
closing of the plant by 2000, but would reconsider the plan if
regulators took a different view of the plant's economics and the
state's energy needs.
</P>
<P>
   GPU spokesman Jeff Dennard said that the company had not
abandoned its efforts to sell its other nuclear plant, Three Mile
Island in Londonderry, Pa., and that the outlook for the sale of
that plant still looked good.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 620-megawatt plant at Oyster Creek is the second-oldest
nuclear generating plant in the country. It opened in late 1969
just two weeks after the nation's oldest plant, Nine Mile Point
Unit 1, near Oswego, N.Y. Oyster Creek is on Barnegat Bay, 10 miles
south of Toms River, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, as deregulation of electricity sales has
gotten under way, plants like Oyster Creek have ceased to be
competitive. The current cost of electricity in this new market,
Dennard said, was about 2.5 cents a kilowatt hour. The Oyster Creek
plant, with its fixed capital costs of about 3.8 cents a kilowatt
hour combined with an operating cost of 3.1 cents a kilowatt hour,
is not able to compete in that market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chilton, director of the energy division of the state's
Board of Public Utilities, said that the possibility of closing the
plant early had been suggested by the company more than a year ago.
State officials knew, he said, that ``Oyster Creek would be a tough
sell'' because of its high operating costs, and so the inability to
find a buyer was not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   What is a surprise, he and others said, are the questions now
facing the state in the new era of deregulation, including whether
the company even needs the state's permission to close the plant.
Chilton said it is an ``open question'' whether the company must
come to the state to take ``competitive steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the plant has long been advocated by
environmentalists in the state, as well as by consumer advocates,
who insisted that its high operating costs saddled residents with
some of the region's highest utility rates. Local government in the
Lacey Township area receive more than $10 million in taxes annually
from the plant, which accounts for 64 percent of the local budget.
But last year state lawmakers passed legislation guaranteeing the
tax revenues should the plant close.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was 11 years old in the early 1950s, I'd get on my bike
and ride to the Cloverdale movie theater in Montgomery, Ala. For 10
cents, nearly half of my allowance of 25 cents, I could watch a
movie starring Gene Autry, or my favorite, Roy Rogers, who died
this week at the age of 86.
 &HT;    Those cowboys were good guys in white hats who were always
victorious over the bad guys, who looked evil (thanks to a four-day
growth of beard).
 &HT;    Roy Rogers was special to me because he operated on a higher
plane of morality. For example, he never shot first, and when he
did shoot back, it was to shoot the gun out of the outlaw's hands
-- never to kill him.
 &HT;    He saw women as people to be respected, not exploited. He loved
animals, especially Trigger, his golden palomino. In short, he was
a genuine hero.
 &HT;    A 1940s poll of children by Life magazine placed Roy Rogers in a
three-way tie with President Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln
as the person they would most like to resemble. Why? He was a
clean, moral person who fought for justice, but with a sunny
disposition.
 &HT;    His movies were also fun. His sidekick, Gabby Hayes, was always
funny. And even though Dale Evans, his wife, starred in many shows
with him, they never did any of that mushy kissing stuff. But they
did sing together, which seemed natural.
 &HT;    In his private life, Roy Rogers was a man of deep faith who made
appearances with Billy Graham. I saw a recent interview with him
and Dale Evans about how their marriage lasted 50 years. He said,
``We don't believe in a 50-50 split of responsibility. We both put
in 100 percent.''
 &HT;    As I look back, his movies were important to me as a child
because they taught me something about morality. My generation grew
up knowing there is a difference between right and wrong.
 &HT;    Within a few years of the demise of ``The Roy Rogers Show'' on
television in 1957, Hollywood began teaching the young generation
morally confusing messages about ``anti-heroes,'' likeable outlaws,
such as ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' More recently, a
film like ``Pulp Fiction'' literally glamorize psychopaths, people
who kill without emotion.
 &HT;    We can see the ghastly result in children who walk into their
schools with automatic weapons, killing fellow students and
teachers for no reason.
 &HT;    William Bennett, in his introduction to the best-selling ``The
Book of Virtues,'' said its purpose is ``to aid in the time-honored
task of the moral education of the young.'' Moral education is
``the training of heart and mind toward the good.''
 &HT;    Children are not born with a knowledge of such virtues as
honesty, compassion, courage and perseverence. ``If we want our
children to possess the traits of character we most admire, we need
to teach them,'' Bennett writes.
 &HT;    Since Hollywood no longer is aiding in the moral education of
our youth, parents and grandparents must seize the initiative to do
so. How? First, we can discuss our own moral choices to do the
right thing though it requires effort and discipline. Another way
of teaching virtue is by tapping a wealth of written material once
taught to students to help them develop character.
 &HT;    Bennett's book is a wonderful place to start. It is a compendium
of stories and poems for children of all ages. ``Quick! What did
Horatius do on the bridge? What is the sword of Damocles? The
answers are in this book,'' writes Bennett.
 &HT;    The earliest stories in such chapters as ``Self-Discipline,''
``Compassion,'' ``Friendship'' and ``Faith'' are for the youngest
children. The latter parts are more sophisticated, such as letters
or talks by noted people. Consider ``The Athenian Oath'' that was
taken by 17-year-old young men of Athens:
 &HT;    ``We will never bring disgrace on this our City by an act of
dishonesty or cowardice.
 &HT;    ``We will fight for the ideals and Sacred things of the City...
 &HT;    ``We will revere and obey the City's laws...
 &HT;    ``We will strive increasingly to quicken the public's sense of
civic duty.
 &HT;    ``Thus in all these ways we will transmit this City ... greater
and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.''
 &HT;    Each of us can be a Roy Rogers to young people by reading such
material.

A PROGRAM WEDS 2 WHO LED THE PHILHARMONIC 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deprived of its centerpiece, the musical arm of
Lincoln Center Festival '98 must find another. I doubt it will be
the New York Philharmonic. Tuesday's Bernstein-Mahler concert was
to have been corollary to the opening of ``The Peony Pavilion,''
the 16th-century opera that Chinese officials have declined to send
abroad. Leonard Bernstein remembered was always a subtheme of this
year's festival; but judging from this makeshift evening, it will
serve as poor substitute for a main event.
</P>
<P>
   Wedding ``The Age of Anxiety'' to the Mahler First Symphony
makes some superficial sense. Both composers were music directors
of the Philharmonic. Bernstein helped revive Mahler's reputation,
and certainly the heart-on-sleeve theatricality of his music owes
something to the older man's confessional style.
</P>
<P>
   Yet festival events are made to take us out of the everyday, and
programming the most ubiquitous of the Mahler symphonies speaks of
a management more interested in selling tickets in the face of a
Bernstein piece not a lot of listeners knew. Quite naturally, the
evening's Central European conductor, Kurt Masur, showed more
sympathy for Mahler than for Bernstein. Curiously, the Philharmonic
musicians played the Mahler a lot better than they did music by
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Age of Anxiety,'' inspired by W.H. Auden and finished in
1949, is actually Bernstein's Second Symphony. Its two parts, each
in three sections, resemble a film score for which only a scenario
and a partial script exist. The piece follows one evening's
peregrinations by a lonely foursome, beginning at a Third Avenue
bar. There are a cab ride and a final nightcap, and during it all
thwarted attempts at bonding, philosophizing and a lot of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's music, with an elaborate piano part played here by
Lukas Foss, acts as a kind of emotional underpinning. Its long
melodic lines and ambiguous harmonies have a fine theatrical touch,
knowing just when to underline a particular surge of emotive juices
or how to fall back in quiet despair. Much of the music is drab,
I'm afraid, like a good production of an uninspired play.
</P>
<P>
   As accompaniment to a visual or dramatic art form, ``The Age of
Anxiety'' could become a soundtrack only subliminally noticed and
do its work admirably (and there is, of course, the Jerome Robbins
ballet). On its own, the piece tends to sag, depending on a a
touchingly grandiose finale and some rollicking jazz piano in the
solo parts to rescue its credibility. I cannot speak for Masur's
like or dislike of the piece. I can only say that string ensemble
was uncharacteristically vague for such a superb orchestra, that
brass choirs were blowsy, that individual accidents were many, that
over large stretches the players sounded bored to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Mahler was not tidy, but it was at least engaged. One thing
that truly binds these two pieces is their use of the vernacular,
and Masur and his players made the inner movements happily bend and
swerve to the pop-tune influences of the day. We know Foss mainly
as a composer and conductor of wildly uneven accomplishment, but it
is a shame we don't hear him play the piano more. It may be what he
does best. The scale was perhaps too small for Bernstein's music,
but the difficulties were handled with elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center will always have trouble dealing with the
festival ideal of pilgrimage, retreat and concentration. Tuesday's
house, not a sellout, behaved badly at the start and then calmed
down; it seemed to love the Mahler at the end. For the Philharmonic
it was business as usual, bowing to the Bernstein theme but
generally going its own way. This is not what the ancient Greeks
had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   To find the true spirit of an urban festival, one had to go
outside Avery Fisher Hall and onto the plaza it faces, where Loren
Schoenberg's band played Fats Waller and hundreds of couples
jitterbugged happily.
</P>
<P>
   More Bernstein soon: The Philharmonic plays an American program
at Fisher Hall on July 14 and 15. There are ``The Unknown
Bernstein,'' gathered by Michael Barrett (July 20), and ``Literally
Bernstein,'' with the Eos Orchestra (July 23), both at Alice Tully
Hall. Note, too, next week's programs with the Hamburg Ballet at
the New York State Theater.

`VILLAGE': WHERE PAST AND FUTURE INTERSECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cataclysmic events in faraway places may change
fortunes in an obscure Israeli settlement, but to the Jewish
pioneers of Joshua Sobol's ``Village,'' it is the earthy exigencies
of everyday life that matter most. Like the price of manure.
</P>
<P>
   A witness account of the Holocaust reaches the community in the
person of a Russian refugee who arrives shortly after the war and
relates the story of her family's liquidation. (``Where's she
from?'' a villager inquires. ``From there,'' another replies.) The
woman's news brings the village to a standstill, but the
transfixing moment is fleeting. Her testimony is completed and
digested by the village in a few dry-eyed minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sobol, an Israeli writer who has dealt with issues of Jewish
survival in plays like ``Ghetto,'' is not so much concerned with
another contribution to the literature of the Holocaust in this
curious play, presented by the Gesher Theater of Israel as one of
the initial offerings of Lincoln Center Festival '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Village,'' as demonstrated in a scene of luxurious length in
which a Jew and and an Arab spar over the quality of the manure the
Arab provides for the Jew's orange groves, is preoccupied by the
prosaic minidramas that set the rhythms of insular, small-town
existence.
</P>
<P>
   How taken you are with Sobol's surreal reconstruction of the
village of his own youth in the Sharon Valley in the 1940s will
depend on whether a town full of talking turkeys, aria-bellowing
emigres and love-starved socialists is your idea of a
spirit-lifting flight of fancy. For long stretches of the
three-hour production at Alice Tully Hall _ performed in Hebrew,
and a smattering of Russian, with simultaneous English translation
_ it's hard to escape a feeling that you're being taken places
against your will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memory, true memory, as opposed to false, mythologized memory,
is always personal, always individual,'' the playwright wrote in
1989, in a defense of ``Ghetto,'' a play about a Jewish theater
troupe in Nazi-occupied Lithuania presented that year at Circle in
the Square. The problem with ``Village,'' however, is that despite
the generic locality implied by the title, Sobol's memories,
embedded in an array of mirage-like interludes, rarely transcend
the deeply personal.
</P>
<P>
   His characters _ the village's wayward wife, the stern pedant,
the doctrinaire Marxist _ never seem to emerge from the dream
state. They remain flimsy and cartoonish, fixed perhaps as
individuals in Sobol's mind, but remote and insubstantial to most
of the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the years leading to Israel's independence in 1948,
``Village'' has apparently been a popular and critical hit in
Israel. The Gesher, a seven-year-old theater company founded by
Russian Israelis and headed by a Russian-born director, Yevgeny
Arye, has rapidly established itself as one of Israel's most
innovative theater troupes. It just may be that a company of
recently arrived exiles, in a land of refugees deep in reflection
about its first 50 years of nationhood, struck a responsive nerve
with a play that manages to be nostalgic without being gratuitously
sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   The play is ``Our Town'' reimagined by Marc Chagall; the village
it conjures is a mystical bend in the road of Palestine's past and
Israel's future. It begins, a la Thornton Wilder, in the town
cemetery, with the villagers upright in their graves. In place of
``Our Town's'' stage manager, however, is Yossi, played by Israel
(Sasha) Demidov, the simpleton who presides over the cemetery as
gravedigger and the story as narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi is the pure-hearted soul of the young nation, so free of
the taint of the bad blood and violence that lie ahead that at the
outset, he doesn't even understand what death is. His education
progresses from the slaughter of his barnyard friend, the turkey
(played by Klim Kamenko), to the slaughter of his soldier brother
Ami (Mark Ivanir). Along the way, Yossi observes with only meager
comprehension as the villagers couple and cheat and drink and
struggle to eke out fruitful lives, and in the end, he is left
alone in a more complex world, puzzling over the question of how
much progress he and his village have made.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lisiyansky's all-purpose set suggests a pastoral world
in a biblical land: it's love among the bulrushes. A narrow
turntable moves with the scene changes, but only once is it
employed by Arye to optimal effect, in a scene in which Ami is
slowly revealed to be kissing his girlfriend, Dassi (Efrat
Ben-Zur), behind a screen onto which a Charlie Chaplin movie is
being projected.
</P>
<P>
   The gawky Demidov does what he can with the only mildly engaging
Yossi; the character is never more than a childlike tour guide. The
others in the energetic cast of 20 try to embody the idea of the
life force of a community, but vague ideas are all anyone seems to
have.

PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL HEADS FOR KEY VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Legislation sought by Republicans for 20 years
that would protect companies from costly product liability lawsuits
may have its best chance yet to become law, as it heads toward a
key vote in the Senate Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the bill carries the support of Republicans, the White
House and most of the business community, a controversial amendment
by California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein to exclude the gun
industry could drag down the entire bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes special protections for California's
biotechnology and medical device industries, and rejection of the
legislation would amount to a serious blow in their four-year
crusade for lawsuit relief. Without some form of legal protection,
the industries argue, more and more suppliers will be unwilling to
provide materials for many life-saving products.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vetoed a product liability bill two years ago,
saying it undermined consumers' rights to sue manufacturers of
defective products, but he has agreed to a compromise measure that
meets his concerns. Republicans will attempt to overcome a
Democrat-led filibuster on the measure Thursday, and the vote is
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Strongly backed by business lobbies, Republicans argue that
companies are beset by frivolous lawsuits that jack up product
prices and stifle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, backed with equal vigor by trial lawyers, contend
that limiting manufacturer liability will expose consumers to
dangerous products.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader denounced the bill as ``a
disgraceful effort to subvert our civil justice system, allowing
corporations to escape financial responsibility for the harm and
damage they cause innocent citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Although large businesses complain that the new version is too
watered down, the measure retains strong backing from the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, which called it ``a solid platform on which to
build future reforms'' and a ``historic opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would:
</P>
<P>
   -- Require plaintiffs to show ``clear and convincing evidence''
that a manufacturer acted with ``a conscious, flagrant indifference
to the rights or safety of others.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Cap punitive damages against small businesses at $250,000 or
twice compensatory damages, whichever is smaller (small businesses
are defined as $5 million or less in revenue and 25 or fewer
full-time employees).
</P>
<P>
   -- Reduce damages if consumers misused or altered products or
were intoxicated at the time of injury.
</P>
<P>
   -- Shield suppliers of ``biomaterials'' used in medical devices
if the supplier did not make or sell the allegedly defective
medical device. (The provision does not limit lawsuits against the
devicemakers themselves.)
</P>
<P>
   The biomaterials provision enjoys strong bipartisan support and
was added to gain votes for the broader liability reform package.
Championed by Reps. Anna Eshoo of Palo Alto and Zoe Lofgren of San
Jose, both Democrats, the biomaterials provision is ready for a
House vote as a stand-alone bill.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 40 percent of the medical device industry is located in
California. Devicemakers say they are running out of raw materials
for such life-saving products as brain shunts and heart pacemakers
because their suppliers _ makers of silicones, plastics and other
materials _ refuse to sell to them for fear of being dragged into
lawsuits against the devices. Medical devices are inherently
riskier, and thus far more likely to be hit by lawsuits, than other
products containing plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Most suppliers are huge businesses, like Du Pont, with ``deep
pockets'' to pay big damage claims, while devicemakers are often
much smaller companies with far fewer financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, medical devices offer such a tiny market for plastics
and similar materials _ a $10,000 pacemaker may contain only a few
pennies worth of silicone _ that many suppliers have cut off sales
to devicemakers because the profits do not begin to offset the cost
of defending a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But devicemakers worry that their provision will be dragged down
by the current fight over product liability legislation, which has
not even begun to move in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nau, director of government affairs for ALZA, a drug
delivery device manufacturer in Palo Alto, said devicemakers are
relying now on dwindling biomaterial stockpiles. A bigger problem,
Nau said, is that manufacturers have quit developing new materials
for the medical device industry because of the potential legal
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innovative plastics, new polymers, the kinds of things that
have been developed regularly and with rapidity for the past 40, 50
years, are not being developed anymore because people do not want
to sell to us,'' Nau said.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure excludes tobacco companies and silicone breast
implant manufacturers _ both subject to extraordinarily broad and
costly litigation _ from any liability protection.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein wants to exclude gun manufacturers as well. But the
bill's backers say her addition is unnecessary and could shatter
the fragile compromise with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very delicately tied together,'' said U.S. Chamber of
Commerce lobbyist Neil Trautwein. ``Amendments like Feinstein's
could start a flood'' of other amendments and ``add another decade
to the long-standing fight for product liability reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein spokesman Howard Gantman said the bill's sponsors
were ``very willing to include exclusions for the tobacco industry.
The senator's point is that guns are right up there with tobacco in
terms of killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein remains undecided on the overall bill. Lobbyists
contend that Feinstein and other Democrats they were counting on to
break the filibuster are now threatening to bolt if they are denied
their amendments.

WHEN SMOKE CLEARS, FRENCH LOVE THEIR BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE JENKINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ I'm not sure what they were singing on the
Champs-Elysees on Wednesday night, but it has replaced ``Got a
light?'' as the French national theme.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the joyous lyrics, I heard  &LR; Les Bleus.  &LR; Not the St.
Louis blues, or the lowdown blues, but the nickname for the
blue-clad French soccer team. In defiance of reason, they are
single-handedly dismantling the barriers of Gallic indifference.
</P>
<P>
   It was astounding, how it all came down. Throughout the day,
there were few signs of the World Cup around Paris. Not in my
neighborhood, the thriving Montparnasse, not even on the
Champs-Elysees, the world's most beautiful and famous boulevard.
Then it became official that France had beaten Croatia 2-1 to earn
a spot in Sunday's final against Brazil _ and an unbelievable party
broke out.
</P>
<P>
   So many important things are happening here, from the pure glory
of sport _ France never has won the World Cup _ to the character of
a nation. The monthlong tournament has brought joy to a people
mired in gloom, tolerance in the realm of sensitive racial issues.
It isn't likely that a soccer tournament can cure all of that; not
in the long run. But the French feel delightfully different about
themselves these days, particularly the nation's youth, who poured
out of subways by the thousands Wednesday night to join the
merriment.
</P>
<P>
   My evening started at a little cafe called Le Deauville on the
Champs-Elysees, and the scene was quintessentially French. A little
man played romantic tunes on the accordion. Couples kissed
unabashedly. Many people had their backs to the television set as
the game began, indulging themselves in vintage French delights:
smoking, brooding, intellectualizing.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crisp, perfect night, a bit like Carmel in autumn. I
kept looking for the crazed fanatics and painted faces; there were
many at the stadium, but none here. Nobody dressed for the occasion
or went out of his way in any respect. They just dropped into the
bars, perhaps hoping they wouldn't be noticed, at any old time.
Imagine it: The French invented the World Cup, and they've spent
nearly 70 years trying to win it. Here they're playing a semifinal
game in their home country, and cafe-goers arrive fashionably late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but that is the national pastime,'' cracked one man
between dramatic pulls on his cigarette. ``Not to be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The French cannot be the Dutch, spending a couple of hours
painting themselves, then staring glumly in the mirror after a
crushing loss. They choose not to win by sheer will; they sit back,
watch quietly, have a smoke, and let the victory come to them.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular player on the screen was Fabien Barthez, the
bald-headed French goalkeeper. This guy could pass for a bass
player in a Greenwich Village jazz club _ or a bouncer on Sunset
Boulevard. He has flair and takes risks, endearing him to the
populace. The French have doubted his ability on occasion _ hell,
they doubt everything, come to think of it _ but he had a great
night, often sprinting madly to catch corner kicks on the fly. The
first half ended scoreless, but there were many French
opportunities, lending a world of promise.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to move around the boulevard a little. It was still
business as usual out there, pedestrian and auto traffic moving
busily along. I passed by a restaurant/bar, saw the TV set
flickering and pulled on the door _ only to have a menacing-looking
figure wave me off.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was a goal for France, and bedlam. A man sneaked
in, and I tried to slide in behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' asked the proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   ``American journalist,'' I answered, immediately figuring it was
the wrong answer. A better one would have been, ``I'm a big Jerry
Lewis fan.'' Or, ``That Charlie Sheen (plastered all over town in
billboard advertisements for his latest travesty), hell of an
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the journalist angle seemed to work. ``Are you a loner?'' he
asked in his heavy French accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. Actively hated people my entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come in.''
</P>
<P>
   I never did figure out the cloak-and-dagger stuff, but I spent
the rest of the night in there, witnessing the inexorable growth of
French emotion. I was glad to see the great Davor Suker have one
last moment for Croatia (he scored his country's only goal), but
suddenly his plight paled against larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lilian Thuram, who is black, scored both of the goals for
France. Marcel Desailly, born in Ghana, is a titan of defense.
Zinedine Zidane, the master midfield creator, is the son of
Algerian immigrants, and three other French players have roots in
former French colonies in Africa. This information would be
irrelevant in America's sporting taverns, but racial hatred burns
white-hot throughout Europe these days. It is the source of many
crimes by German and British hooligans. It has stirred major crises
among the Dutch soccer team over the past two years. And it is a
problem in France, where noisy politician Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader
of the National Front, built his campaign around vilifying
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible for a racist to enjoy this wonderful French
team. Judging from Wednesday night, they all had gone into hiding.
When I left the Cafe Mysterie and all its high intrigue, I walked
onto the Champs-Elysees and one of the most memorable scenes of
modern-day France.
</P>
<P>
   You would have thought the country had been liberated from
oppressive foreign rule. The street was filled with friendly mobs
and horn-honking motorists. I can't speak for the after-hours, but
there wasn't even the hint of trouble. Descending into the Metro
station, I sat there watching new trains arrive, each loaded with
singing, shouting French people under 25.
</P>
<P>
   I finally boarded the train bound for Montparnasse, and there
was an old man sitting there in a black beret. The scene had not
moved him. ``Football,'' he scoffed, waving dismissively at the
departing throng.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him that, for once, he is in the minority. What
a wonderful time to be French.

POOR A'S MAY HAVE TO MOVE TO FIND FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.W. NEVIUS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   People think the A's don't get it. They think the team of green
and gold is moping around the Coliseum, trapped in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there is the looming presence of Mt. Davis, the
football renovation for the Raiders that made it clear just who was
the really important tenant in Oakland. Then there are the
Godzillas of baseball, the mega-teams of the game with their huge,
intimidating payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there are the cross-Bay Giants, stealing the local
baseball thunder with their run toward the playoffs for the second
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   Poor A's. They never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't underestimate them. The Athletics are not only
perfectly happy to be themselves, they are more than a little bit
smug about their chances. They know that they have a nice little
product, undervalued and with a huge upside, and if people around
here don't appreciate it, someone else _ maybe somewhere else _
will.
</P>
<P>
   In the next six months, expect to see a serious evaluation of
the option of a move to a new ballpark in the San Jose/Santa Clara
area. The Giants swear the A's can't move the team to the South
Bay, but if someone down in Silicon Valley wants to step up, the
A's are convinced they can win that battle, either in the courts or
in baseball's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   And if a move to the South doesn't pan out, the A's are willing,
and able, to wait this out. Things may improve here, or they may
get a nice offer to move to where the fans would be delighted to
watch them. The way the A's see it, they are in the catbird seat,
and they can just sit where they are until something good happens.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it isn't as if they are leaking money. Attendance may
be lousy, but with the lowest payroll in the American League _ $20
million, compared with Baltimore's baseball-high $68 million _ they
don't need to hear the turnstiles whir to break even.
</P>
<P>
   And the other side of the equation is pretty impressive. Even
with the lowest payroll, the A's own the seventh-best record in the
American League. Remember, that's with a bunch of kids out of the
farm system, a couple of well-weathered veterans, and mini-splurges
into the free-agent market from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the team, and the franchise, are doing their
part. This isn't easy. As long as the A's are militantly committed
to the sensible idea of running a franchise without losing buckets
of money, the margin for error is very thin. One expensive
free-agent screwup _ hello, Ruben Sierra _ and the whole franchise
goes into a tailspin for a spell.
</P>
<P>
   The law of averages does not favor a team like the A's, but they
have a track record of beating the odds. Smart, penny-wise, and
young, this is the template for an up and coming baseball franchise
in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the A's aren't a little peeved.
This is a team that won four in a row heading into the All-Star
break, swept two games over the Giants at 3Com Park at the end of
June and were greeted with resounding shrugs in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   You don't think that sticks in their craw? It is hard enough
battling into the prevailing wind every day, but when you finally
make some headway, you would like to get the credit from the home
folks.
</P>
<P>
   And don't get them started on the big-wallet crowd, like the St.
Louis Cardinals, who simply went out and blew the concept of the
draft right out of the water with a $7 million contract to
draft-buster J.D. Drew. The only satisfaction the A's get in that
is that the Cardinals, with a payroll of $52.5 million, have won
one less game so far than Team Frugal.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics have turned into a bit of a favorite pet with
baseball's national deep thinkers. Thoughtful essays have been
penned about how the Pittsburghs and the Oaklands of the world are
the real soul of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to like. For all the attention paid to their
payroll, the A's would rather that you look at their impressive
collection of kids, beginning with All-Star Ben Grieve.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can they play, they are an appealing group, the kind of
young guys a group of fans would like to latch onto and ride for a
while. If you are really trying to build something, it might be
better to plug the youngsters in right now and let them play,
rather than sit on the bench and watch the free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it, if this were an expansion team, starting up somewhere
like Phoenix, they'd be writing poems to this gritty bunch. They're
cuter than Beanie Babies, and they've probably got a better shelf
life.
</P>
<P>
   And if the fans in Oakland don't catch on, somebody else will.
Maybe in Santa Clara, or maybe in Portland or Las Vegas, but it is
going to happen. The A's are sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   So save your tears for the A's. You'll need them if they leave.

VENERABLE RUNNER, 68, SAYS UPCOMING MARATHON WILL BE HIS LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tony Stratta doesn't even make an attempt at
selling the notion that the motivation behind his 50 years of
marathon running is a complicated story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that I was never very good at it,'' he said.
``So I just kept on doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to expect more than such a simple explanation
for his desires, but after a few moments with Stratta, a
68-year-old retired hotel manager who talks with the energy of a
stand-up comedian, it all makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   He's never been a star runner. He's just a guy who learned long
ago that he liked running, and no matter how he placed at the end,
he always would find a reason to start.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with 163 marathons behind him, Stratta has found a reason
to stop. Sunday's San Francisco Marathon, which he's run 18 times
in its 20-year history, will be his last. This isn't something
sentimental, either. The bottom line for Stratta is that his body
hasn't failed him. It's his patience with the scheduling process
that has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   It takes so long now to enter a marathon and then actually run
in it, he said. ``They want you to know what you're doing on New
Year's Day in the year 2000. The process gets held up. I still
haven't gotten my medal from last year's (San Francisco)
marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Retracing Stratta's running routes is about as hard as
deciphering the driving force behind his long-distance love. You
jump back to his days at Daniel Webster grammar school in Potrero
Hill, when he had to find some way to arrive at school on time. An
admitted late riser, he regularly raced the 3 miles from his home
to school.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Stratta garnered no fame while running
cross-country and track at Lowell High. There isn't a varsity
letter lying among the varied collection of trophies and medals in
his living room. But when he was 18 years old, he ran in his first
marathon in Petaluma. The year was 1948 and Stratta didn't think
about stopping until this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, you couldn't get people to do marathons,'' he said.
``People made fun of it. To be good as a runner, you had to win the
quarter-mile. Then the half-mile became big. Then the mile and the
2-mile. But that happened over a few years. It was like anybody who
had to run 26 miles to get some attention wasn't special.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratta has never tired of trying tougher races. His marathon
experience includes 42 50-mile events. His best time in the San
Francisco Marathon is 3:42, which he accomplished at 43. There are
less than a handful of top 10 finishes in his lifetime, but as
Stratta says, those types of achievements never drove him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stratta is content in knowing that he can still run his
4 miles each morning and maintain his affiliation with the San
Francisco Dolphin South End Runners. He's had his fill of marathons
and doesn't expect to leave any regrets behind him at the
conclusion of Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to run this race in 7:16, get my medal, and walk
away happy,'' Stratta said.

 Sun's Cloudy Future   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Could Sun Microsystems become the next big victim of the
Microsoft-Intel blitzkrieg?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quite possibly, say some analysts who see Sun as a valiant but
overmatched computer-maker trying to push its own technology in a
world increasingly dominated by Microsoft Windows and Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, for those who don't know, makes desktop workstations for
heavy computing tasks like computer-aided engineering, and high-end
servers used to manage corporate networks. It also is the company
behind Java, the popular development software for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Sun apart from most other computer-makers is the fact
that it relies totally on its own own chips and operating system.
None of its computers use Intel chips, and they won't run Microsoft
Windows NT, which has become the operating system of choice for
corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   Other big computer-makers, such as IBM, Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard, have their own proprietary systems, but they also
offer Wintel computers to reach a larger market.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sun's individualistic approach has proven successful,
with steady growth and annual revenues approaching $10 billion. It
is the leading maker of workstations, and demand continues for its
powerful Starfire servers. Analysts also praise a strong management
team that includes Chief Executive Officer Scott McNealy, Chief
Operating Officer Ed Zander and Alan Baratz, who heads up the Java
effort.
</P>
<P>
   However, recent signs suggest Sun may be entering a period of
extreme vulnerability to the forces that have battered other
companies, such as Apple and Silicon Graphics, which have tried to
prosper without embracing either Microsoft or Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's stock, which reached an all-time high of $53.31 last
August, has languished in the $40s for most of the past four
months, a sign of uncertainty on the part of investors. It closed
yesterday at $45.50, up $2.56.
</P>
<P>
   Among recent developments:
</P>
<P>
   _Personal computers are displacing workstations in corporations,
and inexpensive desktop terminals using Microsoft Windows NT appear
to be gaining acceptance in the corporate market faster than
``network computers'' such as Sun's JavaStation.
</P>
<P>
   _Powerful PCs boasting Intel's new Xeon chips could rival the
power of Sun's high-end servers while costing less.
</P>
<P>
   _Last week, Sun announced its first layoffs since 1994 _ 200 out
of 13,000 Bay Area jobs _ as part of a reorganization in which it
will eliminate individual operating units in favor of two
divisions, one for products and technology and one for services.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group makes no bones
about his fear for Sun, saying, ``In our view, it's the next Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has just been lucky that they're in areas where
Microsoft and Intel haven't competed until recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun's best long-term strategy, said Enderle, would be to abandon
its go-it-alone strategy and start building computers that use
Intel chips and can run Windows NT. SGI made that decision last
fall, after other attempts to turn around the company failed. It's
too soon to tell whether that strategy will help SGI, which hasn't
yet started selling Wintel workstations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sun is unlikely to adopt the Wintel platform, partly
because of McNealy's hatred of Microsoft. ``Sun has used Microsoft
as a foil for so long that it would require the departure of
McNealy for them to move back into the mainstream,'' said Enderle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of embracing Wintel, Zander said,
``It'll be a real cold day in whatever.'' Sun is doing just fine on
its own, he said, and besides, the Wintel market is already so
crowded that only one company _ Dell _ seems able to turn a decent
profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the money in the Wintel space is being made by Microsoft
and Intel,'' Zander said. ``Why would I want to do Wintel if nobody
is proving able to make money on it?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Sun joined the Wintel bandwagon, it's unclear how it
could differentiate itself from the rest of the crowd. SGI might
gain an edge by wedding its superior video technology to Windows
NT. Sun has no such advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Sun had hoped to slow the Microsoft-Intel assault on the
corporate desktop with the JavaStation. But the small, blue units
shipped a year behind schedule, and have been a marketing
disappointment. FedEx and 1-800-Flowers, two big companies Sun had
counted on to embrace the JavaStation, have opted instead for
Windows terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun may have shot itself in the foot by building up
expectations for the JavaStation and not delivering on them,'' said
analyst Gregg Blatnik of Zona Research. ``They took much longer
than anyone including themselves anticipated in getting it to
market, and there's not a lot that indicates a large demand for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zander conceded ``We did not execute as well as we could have on
getting the software and some of the hardware specifics right.''
But he vowed that by next year, some major companies will be
choosing JavaStations for limited applications such as airline
reservations or customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to Sun may even be greater at the high end, because
that's where the largest profit margins are. Networks servers from
Sun, IBM, HP and others start at a half-million dollars and are
used, for example, to run complex databases, execute financial
transactions and keep track of inventories.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft and Intel succeed in commandeering the network
server business, it could cut into Sun's core workstation business
if companies wanted the same technology throughout their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life will get tougher for Sun as desktop and server systems
with Intel architecture and Microsoft NT move further and further
into territory that Sun may have had exclusively a few years ago,''
said Blatnik.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Sun count on Java _ one of many software tools to bring
animation to Web pages and make them interactive _ as a major
source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun hopes that Java _ which lets different kinds of
computers work together _ would help its business by making Sun
computers compatible with Wintel systems.
</P>
<P>
   Further muddying the situation is Sun's legal dispute with
Microsoft, which has put its own version of Java into its Web
browser. The outcome of that case could determine the extent that
companies can modify Java in their own products _ possibly diluting
Sun's control even further.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's main advantage at this point is the size of its customer
base. For example, Internet service providers use Sun servers to
manage more than half of all Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun has done very well getting in there, and once you're in
it's very hard to get you out,'' said Blatnik.
</P>
<P>
   But an early lead in the rapidly changing technology business is
no guarantee of succes. After all, Netscape once had a commanding
lead in Web browsers, and Novell owned the network operating system
market, and look what happened to them.

 Apple's Grand Design   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 New York  
 
Apple Computer, which popularized the phrase, ``The computer for
the rest of us,'' says its future growth and survival hinge on the
consumer market it all but shunned the past few years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs _ looking fresh despite a red-eye
flight from the West Coast _ told a gathering of 2,500 yesterday at
the Macworld Expo trade show that Apple's new iMac home computer
will fuel sales during the next six months, contributing to a
recent resurgence at the Cupertino company. He also announced that
Apple will record a third-straight quarter in the black next
Wednesday, but he declined to say how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple (recently) had failed in the consumer market, but the
iMac will change that,'' said Jobs, who was greeted with a
thunderous, 30-second standing ovation from the partisan crowd.
``It is a kick-ass consumer product.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 million installed Macs in the world, 10 million are
home computers, but Jobs said Apple hadn't made compelling products
for that market _ until the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs announced that some 177 consumer applications _ from
companies including America Online, Adobe Systems, Quicken,
Symantec Corp. and Mattel _ have been designed for the iMac in the
two months since it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   He then trotted out Richard Wolpert, president of Disney Online,
who said the Magic Kingdom has developed a Macintosh version of
Blast, its online service for kids. (Rumors of an Apple-Disney
partnership were rife this week, but many erroneously thought
Disney would announce that it was installing thousands of iMacs in
its hotels around the world.)
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, which was announced in May and doesn't ship until
August 15, already has created a buzz among Mac fanatics. Industry
observers estimate that 400,000 units will ship by the end of
September, making it one of the most popular Macintosh models ever.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said the iMac will closely weave in Web browsing and will
come with a 56K modem, faster than the 33.6K modem initially
expected.
</P>
<P>
   A laptop counterpart to the iMac is due in the first half of
1999, according to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs and other Apple executives said the company's consumer bent
is the final piece of a five-step plan that Jobs jokingly compared
to Abraham Maslow's theory on the hierarchy of needs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Apple's ``hierarchy of skepticism,'' the company first
needed to convince computer shoppers, investors, analysts and the
press that it would shake out of its ``death spiral,'' Jobs said.
It did so, he said, by putting in place a new management team and
board of directors and striking a development deal with Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Apple had to stabilize business by whittling down its
unwieldy product lines, from 15 to two (consumer and professional).
The company also focused on strongholds in the education and
desktop-publishing markets. ``We needed to protect the business
before we could grow,'' Clent &UR;  &LR; Richardson, Apple's senior director
of worldwide developer relations, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Apple forged business relations with hardware-and
software-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, developers were hopping mad at Apple,'' Jobs said.
``Our deal with Microsoft drew boos (from Mac fans last year), but
it brought other developers aboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple also may have created goodwill among developers by footing
part of the bill on some companies' trade show booths. One
developer said he wouldn't have attended if not for Apple defraying
the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple first had to show the discipline to get its internal
house in order. Its consumer strategy is dead-on for future
growth,'' said Louis Mazzucchelli Jr., vice president of Gerard
Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. in New York. ``If they had tried this a year
ago, it wouldn't have worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for Apple's comeback isn't complete, however,
unless the company succeeds in increasing year-over-year sales and
improving its market share, its critics argue. In its most recent
quarter, Apple registered $1.4 billion in sales, compared with $1.6
billion the previous year. Meanwhile, its market share hasn't
budged from 4.1 percent a year ago, according to Dataquest Inc., a
San Jose-based market researcher.
</P>
<P>
   That's where iMac, and its potential for a boost in sales, comes
in, Apple executives say.
</P>
<P>
   So far, potential customers like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a great consumer product that combines software,
modem, memory and a big screen,'' said Pamela Steffen, who traveled
from Boston to get her first glimpse of the roundish, aqua
marine-colored computer. ``The younger crowd will especially love
it since it looks like a beach ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Cingone, standing nearby in front of an iMac display at
the Apple booth, said she is buying the $1,299 machine for her
college-bound daughter. ``It's a winner. I've been waiting for a PC
like this Apple for a long time.''

 Ex-Media Vision Execs Charged In Fraud Case   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In the largest securities fraud and insider trading case in Silicon
Valley history, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed
charges yesterday against four former senior executives of Media
Vision Technology Inc.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suit, filed in San Francisco federal court, alleges that
former Chief Executive Officer Paul Jain and former Chief Financial
Officer Steven Allan ``directed subordinates to falsify documents
in order to artificially inflate revenue and understate expenses in
an extensive scheme to defraud investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Controller Robert Williams and former manufacturing
director Wayne Nakamura were also charged in the suit with
participating in the scheme that in 1993 overstated profits of the
Fremont-based multimedia products company by $119 million.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC charges that by trading on inside information, Jain
reaped profits of $1.5 million, Allan $825,000 and Nakamura
$21,250. In its civil action, the SEC seeks a return of this money
and penalties of as much as $7 million. The federal regulatory
agency also seeks an order barring Jain and Allan from serving as
officers or directors of any public company.
</P>
<P>
   Jain, who was fired from Media Vision four years ago, could not
be reached for comment. But his lawyer, Paul Dawes of Latham &AMP;
Watkins, said, ``He certainly plans to deny the claims.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the SEC charges, an assistant U.S. attorney said
yesterday that a grand jury investigation of Jain continues.
</P>
<P>
   So far three former Media Vision executives have pleaded guilty
to criminal charges filed by the U.S. attorney's office in Oakland.
They are:
</P>
<P>
   _Former Controller Robert Williams, who has pleaded guilty to
one count of providing false information to the FBI but has yet to
be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   _Former Chief Operating Officer Russell Faust who has pleaded
guilty to a federal mail fraud charge and agreed to pay $556,000 in
fines to cover insider-trading profits.
</P>
<P>
   _Former sales director Michael Humphress, who has pleaded guilty
to similar fraud charges and was fined $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   After financial irregularities at Media Vision were first
reported by The Chronicle, the company's stock skidded from a high
of $46.50 in January 1994 to below $5 a share four months later.
The company's market value fell from a high of $630 million to zero
by the time it filed for bankruptcy protection, according to David
Bayless, the SEC administrator in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The company was reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy in 1994.
It changed its name to Aureal Semiconductor Inc. in 1996 and under
new management began selling a new line of personal computer audio
chips in the first quarter of this year.

   CREATIVE REUSE: A California manufacturer has a bridge to sell
you _ part of one, at least. And it's none other than the famed
Golden Gate span in San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, when the bridge was being repaired, a man
named Vince Bindi bought tons of sections of the handrail that ran
along the bridge's pedestrian walkway. His company cuts
14-foot-long, 800-pound segments into smaller pieces, refinishes
them and creates paperweights, plaques, key and candle holders, and
clocks, ranging in price from $20 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   There also are a pair of tables, including a 2-foot-square,
glass-topped, 100-pound table that costs $1,200. The company will
consider custom-making furniture to your specifications.

   FAMILY FINANCIAL PLANNING: In the mail we find the ``Credit Card
Condom.'' Like the latex sheaths from which they get their name,
the CCCs (actually, non-tear envelopes) are meant to be slipped on
in advance to keep yourself from getting into trouble later.
</P>
<P>
   Financial trouble, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope lists advice about ``safer spending'' and
prevention of debt. The extra time it takes to remove the card may
make you think twice about the advisability of charging yet again.
The envelopes can be used in tandem with stickers, meant for the
front of cards, that bear dire warning such as, ``Overuse can be
hazardous to your wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Both come from the National Center for Financial Education in
San Diego. The envelopes cost $5 for 10; stickers, $1 for 10. To

   GET CIVIL: July is national Get Along With Your Ex month. The
very necessity of such a thing will give radio zealot Dr. Laura

<P>
   The campaign, begun on the Internet, has a Web site full of
tips, referrals and discussion groups for post-split people on how
to try to maintain cordial relations with those with whom you
produced offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The premise: Parents who don't fight with or disparage each
other raise healthier children. Central to getting along is a
pledge: ``Although I am no longer in a committed relationship with
my child(ren)'s other parent, I will make every effort to maintain
a working relationship for the sake of our child(ren). I promise
always to take the high road, regardless of how my ex behaves.''

 Jitters Drive Net Stocks Off Highs   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
After a month of spectacular gains, Internet stocks took a beating
yesterday but are expected to rebound today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jittery investors drove down the share prices of Amazon.com,
Yahoo, and other Internet companies, fearing that the high-flyers
might have peaked.
</P>
<P>
   However, after the markets closed yesterday, the No. 1 Internet
search engine Yahoo announced better-than-expected earnings, giving
investors hope for a quick turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we'll see a strong upswing tomorrow,'' said Andrea
Williams, analyst at Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's dip tops a dramatic run-up among Internet stocks in
the past month. Since June 3, shares of Internet bookseller
Amazon.com have climbed from $42.25 to as high as $143.75, while
Yahoo shares have skyrocketed from $102 to a record price of
$207.50.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two days, however, investors got skittish _ a
typical reaction to all-time high prices, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe it as a bit of a mania,'' said Richard Welty,
president of Welty Capital Management in Lafayette. ``There has
been such a run-up that you have to have a correction.''
</P>
<P>
   During yesterday's ``correction,'' Amazon.com shares plunged $15
_ from $122.13 to $107.13 _ and Yahoo shares fell $4.81 _ from $191
to $186.19. Trading also dragged down the share prices of other
Internet firms, such as Lycos, Inktomi, DoubleClick and Excite.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet slide did not affect the rest of the market, which
comfortably cruised to its second-highest closing price ever: up
89.93 points to 9,174.97 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The
Dow was up strongly because investors switched out of Internet
stocks and into the big blue chips that make up the average.
</P>
<P>
   And the day's turmoil continued even after the market closed,
when Yahoo announced that its second quarter earnings significantly
beat Wall Street's expectations. Excluding an acquisition charge,
Yahoo earned 15 cents per share, while analysts had expected 9
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo also announced a two-for-one stock split and that investor
Softbank Holdings boosted its stake in the company by $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The combined good news caused Yahoo shares to soar 8 percent in
after-hours trading to $202. Amazon, Netscape and Lycos shares all
also rose in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the gains are justified _ because Internet stocks are
simply recovering to their normal prices.
</P>
<P>
   But others say it is crazy for companies with little or no
revenues to be trading for prices higher than corporate mainstays.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times like this, it doesn't pay to be rational,'' he said
David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jim Balderston said investors are wrongly placing their
bets on the sexy well-known companies _ such as Yahoo and Excite _
rather than the boring little-known ones such as Cisco Systems that
are already generating significant profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long haul, the people that are going to make a lot of
money on the Internet are the guys that build the infrastructure,''
said Balderston, an analyst at Zona Research in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of the gold-rush fever where people are
heading off the Internet investment trail,'' he said. ``The problem
is that most of them are going to come back broke and humiliated.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ Ever since my high school days I've enjoyed
running (long before it became a fashionable pastime), and at least
three times a week I slip on my Reeboks and trot down to the
jogging trail that circles Oakland's Lake Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   Most runners greet me with a friendly nod or a wheezing ``Hi,''
but there are a few I meet who turn the miles into misery. There
are ways during exercise to exorcise these haunts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chatterbox: This guy is more interested in exercising his
jaws than his legs. In less than a mile you learn about his
business deals, political preference, religious affiliation, trips
to Hong Kong and the terrific deal he got on his BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing your pace won't lose this bore; he'll risk heart
failure to keep up and tell you about the killing he made on the
stock market. Try answering him in gibberish that he'll mistake for
insider information. When he ducks into a phone booth to call his
broker, run like hell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ms. Cutie-pie: She paid $500 for her pink-and-blue jogging
outfit. She doesn't want to ruin it with sweat. She wants you to
run with her to shoo off lechers lurking in bushes. Her
conversation is limited to, ``Can't you slow down a bit?'' and
``Haven't we run far enough?'' She asks these questions every 50
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Swallow air and expel it in a lusty belch. She'll sprint away
and shout over her shoulder, ``How gross!''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Authority: This is a variation of the chatterbox. He's
read everything from Jim Fixx to Jane Fonda, which he believes
makes him an expert on fitness. Chances are he began running two
months ago. He peppers his conversation with terms such as
``runners high'' and ``hitting the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   He wears T-shirts ``awarded'' after weekend runs, but doesn't
mention the 20 bucks or more that he paid for each one. He doesn't
hesitate to tell you that your shoes, shorts, breathing, etc., are
all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Unfriendliness won't get rid of this prancing pedant. You'll
have to resort to blatant dishonesty. When he criticizes your
stride, say something like: ``Gee, it felt so comfortable when I
finished fourth in the '92 Olympic marathon; I would have won the
bronze medal if that damned Hungarian hadn't cut in on me in the
last mile.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't see him again.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Masochist: You have to feel sorry for this guy. He hates
running. He'd rather be sitting at home sipping a brew and watching
``Baywatch,'' but his doctor has told him that he's got to exercise
to melt off the extra 50 pounds. You don't have to worry about him
talking; the poor fellow can barely breathe between groans and
gasps.
</P>
<P>
   Do this sorrowful soul a favor. Advise him to take up golf.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pro: This is the worst of all. As you're struggling
through your second mile, her (yeah, guys, it's usually a woman)
lean body will suddenly and effortlessly glide past. If she glances
back at all _ and she usually doesn't _ it is only to give you a
disdainful look for momentarily blocking her path. You know without
her saying a word that she is a true runner, and for an instant you
have been in the presence of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   This time it's your turn to slink.

 No Backing Down for Nat Semi Chief   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Not too many chip companies like to take on the mighty Intel Corp.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Microsoft's vocal rivals expressed glee at its federal
antitrust woes, its Wintel counterpart operated in a much quieter
climate when it faced its own antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   But big, bear-like Brian Halla, entering his third year at the
helm of National Semiconductor in Santa Clara, doesn't back away
from a fight. Ask him about the Federal Trade Commission lawsuit
against Intel, and he'll tell you it doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see the FTC get rid of this `Intel Inside' thing,
where they spend millions of dollars a year brainwashing
(people),'' Halla said. He also wants Intel to make it easier for
rivals to clone its chips, in keeping with Halla's call for ``a
level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel won't take the bait. ``Brian is welcome to his own
opinions, but we don't have any comment on those opinions,'' said
Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
   Halla, 51, a former Intel man himself, is trying to give the No.
1 chipmaker a run for the money, and at the same time right his own
company's foundering fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   He's gained notoriety in the industry for his pioneering notion
of putting an entire computer system on a single chip, a concept
that could drive the price of a personal computer below $500 next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous visionary,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst
with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in San Francisco. ``The challenge
is trying to take a company and move it into an entirely different
direction. He needs to pull off the system-on-a-chip strategy, but
if anybody can do it, he's probably the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while others fret over what those cheap chips will do to
shrinking profit margins, everyone seems poised to follow Halla's
lead. The industry buzzword is integration _ as in integrating more
functions onto the main microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   National and Advanced Micro Devices have aggressively pursued
the sub-$1,000 PC market _ and Intel has followed.
</P>
<P>
   Other chipmakers have run from Intel when it's moved into their
markets. When VLSI Technologies saw Intel getting into the
motherboard business, for instance, VLSI stopped making chip sets
for motherboards. But Halla doesn't scare so easily.
</P>
<P>
   When Halla took over National, he said, the company thought of
itself as a ``fast follower.'' It also had a sizeable analog
components business, a safe haven from Intel's digital dominance.
</P>
<P>
   But Halla sought to change all that. He likened himself to the
conquistador Cortes, who _ when he reached Veracruz on the Gulf of
Mexico _ burned all his ships to keep his men from retreating.
Under Halla, National last year sold Fairchild Semiconductor for
$550 million, and bought Cyrix, a Texas chipmaker, for $540
million, and Mediamatics, a Fremont-based maker of PC video chips,
for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the employees, `We've burned our ships. We can only
go forward,''' Halla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're driving, we're innovating, we're leading, we're a
player. Your darkest days as a player are better than the brightest
days in the bleachers.''
</P>
<P>
   National is seeing some dark days. It lost $69.3 million (42
cents per share) in its most recent fiscal quarter, on sales of
$510 million, and it has warned of another rough quarter ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would lay off 1,400 people, including 560
when two obsolete fabrication plants at its Santa Clara
headquarters are shuttered this year. National has been battered by
the same forces causing layoffs and missed earnings across the chip
industry, including lower sales in Asia and backed-up PC
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The financial results haven't been healthy'' for National,
Advanced Micro Devices or even Intel, said David Wu of ABN AMRO, a
Dutch investment bank. With Intel's profits flat, Wu observed,
``When the lion of the jungle isn't eating well, the hyenas and the
leopards don't get to eat either.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu questioned Halla's strategy of selling chips for sub-$1,000
PCs. ``He needs high margins,'' Wu said. ``If all you're doing is
the low end, you're not going to make much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Halla, naturally, doesn't like the low margins, either, but he
said Americans aren't ever going to buy $1,500 computers again. So
he's selling to the growing market, and he's looking forward to
when the PC-on-a-chip goes into cars, clocks and kitchen
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going forward, technology will be driven by products you can
put under the Christmas tree,'' Halla said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also encouraged that Intel's entry into the low-end market,
the Celeron chip, has been widely viewed as a failure. ``The dogs
aren't eating that dog food either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With his deep voice, easy laugh, and gift for analogy, Halla
plays the role of CEO as salesman. But his degree, from the
University of Nebraska, is in electrical engineering, and he's
quite at home talking technology.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 14 years at Intel as a ``marketeer,'' he said, rolling
out products like the 386 microprocessor. In 1988, he left for a
job with LSI Logic, where he started to pursue his system-on-a-chip
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that LSI's CEO, industry veteran Wilf Corrigan, wasn't
going anywhere, Halla began to look around. He fantasized about
running National, and when Gil Amelio left to run Apple Computer,
Halla got the call.
</P>
<P>
   Halla now enjoys the luxurious office and lush campus that
Amelio helped refine at National, but otherwise he completely
reshaped the business. (Halla declines to discuss his predecessor,
saying, ``We don't do Amelio here.'')
</P>
<P>
   He's had successes and failures, and he discusses them in
equally hyperbolic terms.
</P>
<P>
   When it's pointed out that analysts criticize National's lost
networking business, Halla said, ``Networking was an example of
horrible execution. It was ours to lose and we lost it. ... It was
the worst failure in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   But the acquisition of Cyrix, Halla believes, will lead the way
to some bright victories. The company opened a new plant to
fabricate chips in South Portland, Maine, and not only did the
plant open in a &UR;  &LR; speedy 18 months, but two-thirds of the chips it
makes are perfect: a strong percentage for a brand new facility,
due to the extremely complicated nature of making silicon chips.
``It's the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me in my
career,'' Halla said.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of success, Halla said he knows he's made the
right move by joining National.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought about retiring,'' he said. ``I was playing golf
with my dad. I was on the 18th green and had shot 105, which is
just awful. I said, `This is why I could never retire.' If my golf
game stayed this (terrible) the rest of my life, it would be like
premature purgatory.''

 LatinoLink Founder's Vision for Web Site Pays Off   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
When Lavonne Luquis founded her Web company in 1995 to provide
online news, chat and entertainment for Latinos, she knew nothing
about technology.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She didn't know how to finance a startup. She'd never sold an
advertisement, let alone a Web ad. And she'd never heard of an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know diddly-squat,'' said Luquis. ``But I didn't know
I didn't know diddly-squat.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week, San Francisco-based LatinoLink made headlines
when it was one of 21 Internet companies Zapata Inc. invested in or
bought outright.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata, a Houston fish processor, is trying to turn itself into
a major Internet gateway competing with the likes of Yahoo, Excite
and America Online. It will split off its Internet businesses into
a separate company called Zap Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. But Luquis, who
personally financed much of her three-person company's growth,
hopes that Zapata will provide capital to advertise and upgrade
computers. LatinoLink will also get increased visibility on Zap's
home page.
</P>
<P>
   From humble beginnings _ when she was grateful if the site
attracted three hits a day _ LatinoLink has become the leading Web
site for Hispanics, pulling in some 10,000 hits on an average
weekday. The company broke even for the first time in the most
recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Luquis, 38, spent six years as a newspaper reporter and editor,
first at the San Juan Star in Puerto Rico and later as city editor
at The Olympian in Olympia, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   When she first began Web surfing in 1994, she looked for sites
for Latinos or about Puerto Rico, where she'd grown up _ and was
sorely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of that was born the thought that there had to be a market
for something like LatinoLink,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And so began the 12-hour days. In early 1995, Luquis hooked up
with Max Ramirez, a photographer she'd met at a journalists'
convention, and LatinoLink was born. For the first month, she put
in a full day at the paper and then came home to work on the
startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started the company, people said, `You're so
brave.' I didn't feel brave at all,'' Luquis said.
</P>
<P>
   During the next year, as she tried to keeping the business
afloat, keep the technology current, make deals with content
providers and attract people to the site, Luquis learned just how
brave she'd been.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In the early days, most of the company's capital came from
Luquis' savings, a business loan and some $50,000 in credit card
debt.
</P>
<P>
   While Ramirez was keeping the computers running, Luquis went out
and tried to sell ads. The site's first advertiser was brokerage
house Charles Schwab. Current advertisers include AT&AMP;T, IBM and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Luquis quit her newspaper job in March 1995 and Latino Link
debuted the following month. It has news and features, job
listings, e-mail, chats and lots of feedback from users. Current
postings include: a news story about how immigrants pay more in
taxes than they receive in benefits, a column about novelist Isabel
Allende and an essay by a user on finding a recipe for flour
tortillas on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Web Magazine described LatinoLink as ``the premiere
place for Latinos online.'' A little over a week ago, Hispanic
magazine named Luquis a recipient of one of its 1998 Hispanic
Achievement Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had the vision to see there was an opportunity and a
market,'' said E. David Ellington, chief executive of NetNoir, an
online service aimed at African Americans. ``She does her homework,
and it's really quite amazing. She's very thorough and very
effective.''

   Upon learning that  &UR; Tina Brown &LR;  had announced her departure as
editor of the New Yorker, Personals called a Bay Area contributor
to the magazine, a former staff writer, to ask who he thought would
replace her. ``A very brave person,'' he said, noting that despite
Brown's much-publicized efforts, the magazine has continued to lose
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Newhouse could comfortably do it,'' he said of Conde Nast
owner  &UR; Si &LR;   &UR; Newhouse &LR; , ``he would probably fold the magazine. But
nobody wants to be the person who killed the New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer said the magazine had been profitable until late in

AL Tops Off All-Star High  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ It would have been such perfect symmetry.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after Bobby Bonds of the Giants homers in the
44th All-Star Game and wins the Most Valuable Player award, son
Barry Bonds of the Giants hits a mammoth three-run homer to bring
the National League back from behind and is named MVP of the 69th
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds the younger did his part Tuesday night, smashing a
451-foot home run in the fifth inning off Cleveland pitcher Bartolo
Colon to turn a 5-3 NL deficit into a 6-5 lead. But Bonds and his
mates were done in by Montreal Expos closer Ugueth Urbina and his
fielders, who immediately coughed up three runs in a very ugly
inning to erase the good Bonds had done.
</P>
<P>
   The American League added seven more runs, including three off
Giants closer Robb Nen in the ninth, and won 13-8 in the
highest-scoring All-Star Game ever, their second straight victory
and ninth in the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down 5-3, and that made it 6-5, and you think you have
momentum, then they jump right back at you,'' NL right fielder Tony
Gwynn said. ``That's the way it is in this ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the homerfest that a sellout crowd of 51,267 and NBC
might have wanted. Remarkably, 26 of the 31 hits in the game were
singles. But it was the offensive show that everyone expected from
Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar, who snatched the MVP trophy, and Alex Rodriguez
also homered, Cal Ripken doubled, and Devon White tripled for the
only extra-base hits in the longest nine-inning All-Star Game ever
(3 hours, 38 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch the scoring in Denver, you're always seeing big
numbers: 13 to whatever, 13 to 6,'' Alomar said. ``This was a
different kind of All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar, White and Ivan Rodriguez each had three hits for the
American League. Mark McGwire went hitless with a walk in four
trips to the plate for the National League, although he nearly left
the yard with a sixth-inning drive to the warning track in center.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds had one only hit, but it was easily the most electrifying
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   His smash off Colon in the fifth inning traveled 451 feet and
nearly reached the upper deck in straightaway right field. Hanging
from the deck was a string of banners bearing the logos of all 30
major-league teams. Incredibly, Bonds' ball hit the Giants' banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was cool he hit the San Francisco sign,'' said
McGwire, who with White scored ahead of Bonds. ``It was very
impressive because he battled. He just missed a hit down the line
in left (that was foul), and he fouled off some pitches. He's
facing one of the young studs in the American League, he got a good
pitch to hit and he drove it a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds said he was just trying not to make a fool of himself
after whiffing at two fastballs in the 96-mph range to start the
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock. He threw so hard,'' Bonds said. ``I was just
trying to stay calm and not strike out. I was just nervous hitting
behind Mark. They walked him and put all the pressure on me.
Hitting behind Mark McGwire is not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Bonds' first in 20 All-Star at-bats. In 1973,
Bobby Bonds homered and doubled in a 7-1 NL victory at Kansas City.
The Bondses became the second father-son combo to hit All-Star
homers. The Griffeys did it first.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-run lead Bonds presented the NL was gone in moments
after Urbina took the mound to start the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar led off with a single off Craig Biggio's glove into
center, followed by an infield hit by Ken Griffey Jr. The runners
pulled off a double steal to get into scoring position before
Urbina struck out Juan Gonzalez. But with Jim Thome at the plate,
catcher Javy Lopez of Atlanta committed a passed ball. Alomar
scored to tie the game and Griffey moved to third.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey then scored on a wild pitch to put the AL ahead for good
7-6, and Ivan Rodriguez capped the rally with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar added a homer in the seventh, brother Sandy hit an RBI
single in the eighth, and the AL finished the rout with three runs
off Nen in the ninth. Only one was earned.
</P>
<P>
   So ended a bad night for some great pitchers. The AL scored four
runs in the fourth off Tom Glavine, two on Ripken's double, after
the NL had taken a 2-0 lead off Roger Clemens on a Tony Gwynn
single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The NL scored twice in an eighth-inning rally to close the
deficit to 10-8, but the rally died when Paul O'Neill of the
Yankees threw out Fernando Vina at home trying to score on a
single. Andres Galarraga then hit an inning-ending double play. &QL;

REPUBLICANS TRYING TO KILL CLINTON'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BARRING
GAY  DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Several Republican lawmakers, including House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, are trying to block an executive order
issued by President Clinton three months ago barring discrimination
against gays in the federal government.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The move represents the latest in a series of recent political
attacks emanating from GOP circles on gays and gay rights,
including continuing opposition to the nomination of San Francisco
philanthropist James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel
is openly gay and a leading supporter of gay causes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's executive order, which was hailed by gay advocacy
groups, added sexual orientation to the federal government's policy
barring discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, disability or age. Some federal agencies had
already adopted such a policy, but it was applied inconsistently
across the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative organizations, led by the Family Research Council,
are incensed at the order and are urging Republicans to move
against it. They argue that Clinton has overreached his executive
authority and is trying to create ``institutional quotas'' on
behalf of gays.
</P>
<P>
   In response to their lobbying efforts, Rep. Joel Hefley,
R-Colo., will attach an amendment to a funding bill when the House
reconvenes next week that would forbid the federal government from
spending any money on enforcing Clinton's order. So far, there are
no estimates on the cost of implementing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton has added a new category to the nation's civil
rights laws,'' Hefley said. ``Apparently, he has decided to rule by
executive order. The last time I checked, amending federal law was
Congress' job, not that of the executive branch.''
</P>
<P>
   He and three colleagues, including DeLay, R-Texas, sent a letter
to other lawmakers arguing that ``while we do not support
discrimination, we also do not believe in giving special protected
status because of sexual orientation, or for most other reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Socarides, a spokesman for Clinton, said the president
is ``disturbed'' by what he described as an effort to ``pass a law
that permits discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   He linked the attempt to block the anti-discrimination measure
with the refusal of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to allow the
full Senate to vote on Hormel. The heir to the Hormel Meat Packing
Co. fortune was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
in November. But Hormel's nomination has languished since then,
despite pressures on Lott from scores of Democrats and key
Republicans, including Sens. Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Orrin
Hatch of Utah, to let the philanthropist's name go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hormel's chances seemed to diminish considerably
when Lott, R-Miss., compared homosexuality with afflictions such as
kleptomania and alcoholism. House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R.-Texas, promptly endorsed Lott's comments, saying, ``The Bible is
very clear on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay advocacy groups reacted strongly to the Republicans' move.
``It is not coincidental that Hefley's amendment is happening with
the fall elections upon us,'' said Tracey Conaty, a spokeswoman for
the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C. ``It is
an effort to score &UR;  &LR; cheap political points against a minority
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Conaty accused opponents of the anti-discrimination measure of
``lies and deceptions'' by inaccurately saying it calls for quotas
on behalf of gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to counter rhetoric up there on Capitol Hill when
much of it is not based on fact,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schwalm of the Family Research Council, the organization
that drummed up support against Clinton's executive order, conceded
that the measure does not specifically call for quotas. But he said
it calls on heads of all federal agencies to institute
``affirmative programs'' promoting ``equal employment'' of gays.
``We all know that affirmative action programs result in quotas,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gay advocates said they believe that they can defeat the move to
overturn the executive order. Winney Stachelberg, legislative
director for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay
advocacy organization, said surveys taken by her organization show
that there is considerable support for policies prohibiting
employment discrimination against gays. In fact, she said, the
majority of lawmakers on Capitol Hill have instituted policies in
their own offices prohibiting such discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hormel, Lott's office staunchly refuses to say whether
the Senate will be allowed to vote on his nomination. ``It hasn't
been scheduled yet, and right now the schedule is very tight,'' a
spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has been leading the
lobbying effort on behalf of Hormel, said she refuses to believe
that the nomination is dead. ``The majority leader has never said
to me it is dead,'' she said, referring to Lott. ``And I take him
at his word.''

BASEBALL HITS A HOME RUN (AND MORE) IN COOPERSTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ It's just a bat, but I can't stop looking at
it. I can't stop racing from one name _ and one stream of
consciousness _ to the next. I can't stop wishing I could reach
into the glass case, pull out the bat and hold it in my hands.
Please? For just a few moments?
</P>
<P>
   The bat is a Lou Gehrig-model Louisville Slugger, and it is on
display at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. On the
barrel is the signature of Babe Ruth. Henry Aaron. Willie Mays. Ted
Williams. Frank Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The enrollment of major-league baseball's 500 Home Run Club is
15. Each and every member of the club has signed his name on this
bat.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth died in 1948, the year after Jackie Robinson become the
first African American to play in the major leagues. Robinson
opened doors _ if not minds _ for 20-year-old Henry Louis Aaron to
break into the majors with the Milwaukee Braves in 1954. Five days
short of his 20th anniversary in the majors, Aaron hit his 715th
career home run to end Ruth's reign as the home run king. Hate mail
and death threats turned it into a joyless coup for Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer took Ruth at age 53 _ before the two most recent
additions to the 500 club, Eddie Murray and Mike Schmidt, were
born. Nine other members (Aaron, Mays, Robinson, Harmon Killebrew,
Reggie Jackson, Mickey Mantle, Willie McCovey, Eddie Mathews and
Ernie Banks) started their major-league careers after Ruth's death.
While Ruth was alive, Mel Ott, Jimmie Foxx and Williams were the
only other players to hit any of their 500-plus homers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there is this bat, on the second floor of the Hall of
Fame, that connects them all. Living and dead. Black and white.
Stocky and sleek. Sluggers who swing from the heels, sluggers who
transform hitting into science. Seven right-handers, five lefties,
two switch-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Do people from this part of the country truly realize what a
treasure is in their midst?
</P>
<P>
   I grew up 2,000 miles away, trusting that one day the chance
would come to visit baseball's shrine. Now that the Hall of Fame is
barely a 90-minute drive from home, I occasionally have to remind
myself of the wonders that never cease in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   The first catcher's mask, worn at Harvard in 1876. The
fingerless fielder's gloves of the 1880s. The 1899 contract that
Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson signed for $90 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Mathewson accumulated the first 20 of his 373
career victories. Mathewson, one of the five original inductees in
the Hall of Fame, served in a chemical warfare unit in France
during World War I. Accidentally exposed to poison gas that
weakened his lungs, he contracted tuberculosis. Mathewson enlisted
the healing powers of Saranac Lake in the Adirondack Mountains, but
he died on the first day of the 1925 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody mention the 1925 World Series? Check out the bat
the Pittsburgh Pirates' Kiki Cuyler used to hit a Series-winning
double off Walter Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Johnson, one of the artifacts in the Hall of Fame is
a ball signed for him by Teddy Roosevelt. One floor above is a row
of presidential box seats from Griffith Stadium. Nine different
presidents sat there before the wrecking ball came down on the
stadium after the 1961 season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Stadium, of course, is where Mantle hit his 565-foot
homer in 1953. The ball and bat from that homer are on display.
</P>
<P>
   So is the bat Roger Maris used to hit his 61st homer in 1961.
And the bat _ now bronzed _ that Bill Mazeroski used to finish off
the Yankees in the 1960 World Series. And a bat Williams used when
he hit .406 in 1941. And the bat that Roberto Clemente used to get
his 3,000th _ and final hit _ months before he died in a plane
crash while attempting to carry food and medical supplies to
earthquake-striken Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The connections from past to present are as endless as your
passion for the game. Shoeless Joe Jackson's shoes from the 1919
season. Ty Cobb's spikes and sliding pants. Ozzie Smith's glove.
The cowboy hat Dizzy Dean wore in the broadcast booth, where he did
his best to break every grammar rule known to English teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On one floor is a copy of a hate letter that Jackie Robinson
received when he was breaking into the majors: ``Robinson we are
going to kill you if you attempt to enter a ballgame at Crosley
Field.''
</P>
<P>
   To wipe out that ugly image, walk over to the St. Louis Browns
jersey worn by Satchel Paige in 1952. That was the year Paige went
12-10. He was 46 at the time, having spent his best years toiling
in the Negro Leagues. Paige, who didn't make his major-league debut
until he was 42, once came up with the following list of tips of
how to keep young:
</P>
<P>
   1. Avoid fried meats, which angry up the blood.
</P>
<P>
   2. If your stomach disputes you, lie down and pacify it with
cool thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   3. Keep juices flowing by jangling around gently as you move.
</P>
<P>
   4. Go very light on the vices, such as carrying on in society.
The social ramble ain't restful.
</P>
<P>
   5. Avoid running at all times.
</P>
<P>
   6. Don't look back. Something might be gaining on you.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire is gaining fast on the members of the 500 Home Run
Club. Upon hitting his 400th homer earlier this season, McGwire
donated the batting gloves he wore to the Hall of Fame. More than a
decade earlier, the Hall of Fame collected the bat that McGwire
used to hit his 49th homer as a rookie. McGwire passed on the
chance to hit No. 50 on the final day of the 1987 season because he
wanted to be at the hospital for the birth of his son.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a bat, and it rests in a glass case on the second
floor of the Hall of Fame. I can't wait until the day that Mark
McGwire's name is on it.

ORANGEMEN SEE BETRAYAL IN BRITISH ARMY ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Stephen McKinney peered across the
quarter-mile expanse that separates his camp from that of the
British army and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgraceful,'' said McKinney, 33, one of the hundreds of
Protestant Orangemen who are maintaining a vigil in the pasture
next to Drumcree Church as a standoff between the Orange Order and
the security forces drags on. ``Here we are, loyal Ulstermen, and
they've our own army preventing us from asserting our civil rights.
They're up there with the same lot that killed them and us all
these years. Absolutely disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   The British army's prominent role in the standoff triggers
conflicting emotions on both sides of the barriers. For Protestants
like McKinney, it deepens their sense of frustration, insecurity,
and isolation. While they profess their British identity, the
Orangemen are defying British law by demanding to march in a
neighborhood where they are not wanted and where a
government-appointed commission has said they cannot go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you, all these men who fought in the Second World
War, and they're being prevented from walking the Queen's highway
by the army they served in. It's a real slap in the face,'' said
McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   For hard-line Catholic republicans who have supported the Irish
Republican Army, there is the awkward acknowledgement that the
British army has been transformed suddenly from being their enemy
to their protector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair play to Tony Blair and fair play to the Brits,'' said
Anthony Murray - words that he, as a committed Irish republican,
never thought he would.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, a 200-year-old Protestant brotherhood, holds
some 2,000 marches every summer to commemorate the defeat of an
invading Catholic king in 1690. Most of the parades pass without
controversy, but those which go through Catholic neighborhoods,
especially the one here, are a major source of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, police held the line for five days before they
allowed the Orangemen to march down the Garvaghy Road through a
Catholic neighborhood. This time, the British government appears
determined not to give in to threats or force by using its army to
take a more prominent role in the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Army engineers have erected barbed wire, metal barriers that
prevent face-to-face confrontation at roads, and a long, deep moat
that has stranded the Orangemen about a half mile from their goal,
the top of the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Murray stood at the bar in Tir na nOg, the local Gaelic Athletic
Association club, where extreme nationalists who once justified the
killings of British soldiers and police officers acknowledged, with
some discomfort, that they are now depending on the security forces
to uphold their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Like many republicans, Murray finds himself in the odd position
of wanting the soldiers to go home, but not just yet. Murray
worries, however, that his neighborhood could become a sealed-off
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Most Catholic nationalists here don't believe the police are
capable of keeping the peace without the army. They cite the
collapse two years ago, and they say that the natural sympathy of
the 93 percent Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary lies with the
Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
   The situation carries a strong sense of deja vu. British
soldiers were dispatched here in 1969 to quell the disorder that
grew from the Catholic civil rights marches and the violent
attempts by loyalists and Protestant authorities to suppress it.
When the soldiers arrived, Catholics brought them tea and biscuits,
considering them to be their protectors.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRA, which had been dormant, exploited the unrest and
the heavy-handed treatment of Catholics to rejuvenate itself. It
then began to target soldiers as members of an occupation force.
The army hit back hard, alienating most nationalists, and fed a
vicious cycle leading to almost 30 years of violence that killed
more than 3,400 and injured 10 times as many.
</P>
<P>
   Today, none of the 3,000-odd Catholics who live in the housing
projects around the Garvaghy Road are bringing the soldiers tea and
biscuits. But there is a grudging realization that if the Orangemen
are to be forced to obey the rule of law, British soldiers will
have to hold the line. For nationalists, the determination of the
army and the police to maintain order is a critical test of the new
political arrangements here.
</P>
<P>
   Extremists on both fringes are monitoring the situation to find
weaknesses in the enemy camp and to make sure, at least on the
Catholic side, that no one gets too friendly with the British.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA cannot be pleased by the sight of young Catholic boys
talking to the troops, most of whom come from Scottish regiments -
an irony because most Orangemen trace their roots to Scotland.
Youngsters here largely ignore the police, but they are fascinated
by the soldiers, with their uniforms and their machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Someone presumably sympathetic to the IRA put up a notice
admonishing children not to fraternize with the security forces.
``Children and adults are advised not to have any dealings with
them,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen's camp is anything but tense. A few dozen tents
are pitched in the pasture, and Orangemen, some of them with their
families, sit in lawn chairs, chatting and barbecuing. They seem
more like early arrivals for an outdoor concert than hard-liners
vowing to stay in the field until they are allowed to march the
same route they have been marching since 1807.
</P>
<P>
   One Orangeman underscored his resolve by putting up a Christmas
tree. Fast-food trailers came in to feed those without their own
barbecues, and an enterprising loyalist put up a souvenir stand,
selling loyalist paramilitary flags, cassette tapes that pay
tribute to dead gunmen, and baby bibs that proclaim, ``Born to
March the Garvaghy Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Orangemen complained that most of the international news media,
and all of the more than 100 international observers, stayed on the
nationalist side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media and the international observers are biased toward
the nationalists,'' said Bryan McDowell, 32, who wore his Orange
sash and buttons demanding his right to march.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why none of the international observers had gone to the
loyalist side to hear their grievances, Warren Allmand, the leader
of a Canadian delegation, said he feared observers might be beaten
up if they went over. Besides, he said, they had been invited by
the Garvaghy Road residents' group.
</P>
<P>
   Allmand said, nonetheless, that the observers can maintain their
objectivity: ``We call them as we see them.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Stephen McKinney sees it, all of the forces of society _
the nationalists, the government, the news media, international
opinion, and now even the British army _ are aligned against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't exactly instill confidence in you,'' McKinney said,
watching as his 7-year-old son played nearby, ``but we'll stay here
as long as it takes.''

RECOVERY LEADS SLAYING SUSPECT TO THE COURTOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By most accounts, Gena Spero left the sane world 15 years ago.
Arrested after her best friend was found strangled in a bathtub in
1983, she has lived in state institutions ever since, her behavior
under close medical watch, her eyes hollowed from an array of
anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Spero was never convicted of the murder. She never even faced
trial, appearing too psychotic in annual competency reviews for
doctors to recommend her case move forward, refusing to take
medication that would aid her coherence.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at age 35, Spero is scheduled for trial. Last month,
after more than a decade of treatment, a psychiatrist suddenly
declared her competent to face a first-degree murder charge in the
killing of Gina Sindoni, a 21-year-old Hampshire College student.
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of mental patients, specialists say, Spero
could be edging back toward the world of sanity with the help of
comprehensive treatment. Though her doctor says there is ``no magic
pill,'' she is clearly a beneficiary of medical research, which has
brought a better understanding of psychiatric disease.
</P>
<P>
   But with that understanding may come a price: If convicted,
Spero faces life in prison. Her psychiatric treatment could
diminish. And her mental fitness _ which her attorney says is
fleeting, anyway _ could disappear as quickly as it came.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the movie `Awakenings'?'' said Dr. Paul Appelbaum,
referring to the 1990 blockbuster about a doctor who raises
encephalitis patients out of their comas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite that dramatic,'' continued Appelbaum, the chair
of the department of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center. ``But you've now got people who've been psychotic
for decades, who get these new medications and suddenly aren't
psychotic anymore, and are asking, `What happened to the last 20
years of my life?'''
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many mental patients who avoided
criminal trials due to their lack of fitness are now facing
long-dormant charges, specialists say, but the number of patients
being brought into competency is clearly rising.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the number of suspects incompetent to stand
trial is recorded together with the number of convicts found guilty
by reason of insanity _ for a total of about 700 a year, according
to a spokesman for the Department of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   But with the development over the last 10 years of new
medication known as ``atypical anti-psychotic'' drugs _ which work
in neurotransmitter systems that were ignored until the 1980s _
psychotic suspects are expected to regain competency more quickly
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of different factors that influence how and
why a person might take a long time to be restored to competency,''
said Steven Schwartz, a mental-health lawyer at the Center for
Public Representation in Northampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs have become much better. More people are getting
restored quicker,'' he said. ``And after a serious crime, it can
take years for the pain of that experience to get addressed in some
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Spero's drug regimen is confidential. Even her precise diagnosis
is a mystery. Dr. David Greenleaf, the Medfield State Hospital
psychiatrist who assessed Spero for the court, described her
condition as ``puzzling.'' But he confirmed that it is most likely
a form of schizophrenia, and that her recent recovery is best
explained as a combination of the passage of time and
``comprehensive treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Spero was arrested eight days after the death of Sindoni, a
Beverly native whom she met in a women-only boarding house in
Boston. Each woman had a long history of psychiatric treatment, and
their shared troubles had brought them together _ occasionally in a
romantic relationship, according to reports at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 10, 1983, Sindoni was found dead in the soapy water of a
bathtub inside the Haverhill apartment of Michael Costas, a
boyfriend of Spero's. Joe Spero, a Haverhill police officer,
immediately brought his daughter to see attorney Steven Colella,
who described his young client as ``obviously psychotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 15 years she repeatedly was found incompetent to
stand trial. Although she was treated successfully with
psychotropic drugs in the months after her arrest, Colella advised
Spero not to take her medicine when it came time for assessment, so
that she would appear before a judge and jury as psychotic as she
was at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   And so the case dragged. After three years at MCI-Framingham,
Spero was transferred to a maximum-security unit at Medfield State
Hospital, where she remains. Once a year she was evaluated for
mental fitness; in 1992, she was even declared competent to stand
trial, briefly. But the psychiatrist changed his opinion at a court
appearance, and minutes later Spero collapsed with a seizure,
according to Essex County Assistant District Attorney Kevin
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, however, Spero has shown an ``attitudinal
shift,'' said Greenleaf, who has evaluated her for the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Colella said she is still being medicated, and whether to take
the medicine before her next hearing on July 22 is now ``her
decision.'' Greenleaf said her lucidity is the product of
comprehensive treatment and therapy, not drugs alone. Either way,
Spero has adjusted her perspective on facing the charges against
her, Greenleaf said.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas once she was unable to speak or sit up during a court
hearing _ and was ``destabilized by the thought of a trial'' _
Spero can now discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was profoundly different is that she can now sit with
this painful stuff,'' Greenleaf said. ``She seems to want to move
forward. She has slowly gotten better. Time has passed.''

   &UR; Boost from estrogen may be brain teaser
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does taking extra estrogen protect older women against
Alzheimer's disease or even normal age-related mental decline?
Research in recent years has suggested that it can, but results
from a new study of 532 older women suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the University of California at San Francisco
tested the theory by measuring estrogen levels in the blood of
women over age 65, and administering mental tests at the outset and
then five years later. (Most of the previous studies had asked
women about their use of postmenopausal estrogen supplements,
rather than measuring the hormone directly.)
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the scientists report in the July issue of the
Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, the women generally did
more poorly on the second mental test. But there was no relation
between a woman's estrogen levels and her performance over time. In
fact, women in the highest quartile of estrogen measurements did
slightly worse on one test than those women in the lowest quartile.
</P>
<P>
   These results, pending those of larger studies, should caution
women who may want to take estrogen to benefit the brain, writes
Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, of the University of California at
San Diego, in an accompanying editorial. ``Enthusiasm for the
neuroprotective effect of estrogen appears to have outrun the
actual data,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Up or down during early labor? Up to you
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some women say they feel better walking around during the first
stage of labor, but many caregivers tell mothers-to-be it's better
if they lie down. Now, a study in which women were randomly
assigned to either walk or stay in bed concludes that it really
doesn't make any difference, at least in uncomplicated pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in the current issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine, researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas say they assigned 1,067 women in
spontaneous labor to be confined to a labor bed or to move around
as they pleased. The women had to be having regular uterine
contractions and the fetus had to be in the normal head-down
position.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, headed by Dr. Steven L. Bloom, found no
differences in the two groups with respect to the length of labor;
the need for forceps, episiotomy, or caesarean section, or any
other pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, ``it seems reasonable to let
women elect either alternative,'' the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Promise seen in drug to treat hepatitis B
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An antiviral drug, lamivudine, can be given safely to patients
with chronic hepatitis B and can reverse the inflammatory damage
caused by the widespread disease, says a report. The drug could be
more effective and less toxic than the current treatment,
interferon alpha.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 million people worldwide are chronically infected
with hepatitis B, which can cause cirrhosis, liver cancer, and
death. The report in the current issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine said that researchers at several Chinese Hospitals and
at the drug company Glaxo Wellcome studied results for 358 Chinese
patients. The patients had been treated for nearly a year with
lamivudine, which blocks DNA replication of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Liver biopsies revealed that 67 percent of the patients saw
improvement of liver damage, and there were few adverse effects.
Interferon alpha treatment has shown less success, the researchers
said, and can cause severe side effects. Further long-term tests
should be undertaken, they said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Marijuana byproduct to fore in stroke study
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cannabidiol, a natural component of the marijuana plant, shows
promise as a potential treatment for stroke, say researchers who
tested it in rat brains. The tests showed that the substance, which
has no mind-altering properties, was highly effective in blocking
the brain-damaging effects of glutamate, a chemical messenger
released in huge quantitites during a stroke. And cannabidiol
appears to have few side effects in humans, even at high doses, the
researchers from the National Institutes of Health said in a report
in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

 &HT;    CLINTON HOPES TO BUOY YELTSIN AND IMPROVE U.S-RUSSIA RELATIONS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-US-BOX-$ADV11.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, July 11 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ World leaders prefer to hold summits without surprises,
well-scripted meetings before the television cameras which portray
men of action, but where usually nothing much happens.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dangerous prospects of a Russian economic collapse
and a widening war in the Balkans forced U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to wait no longer for a
chance at talks on an serene stage.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S.-Russia summit in 18 months, announced this week,
is scheduled to take place in Moscow in September amid growing
uncertainty about Russia's future and increasingly strained
relations between Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton understands that Yeltsin is in a very difficult
position domestically and the longer he waits to visit the riskier
the situation could become,'' said Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy
director of the USA and Canada Institute, a Moscow-based think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S.-Russian relations have been frozen over the past year,
nothing is happening, and that is a very dangerous thing,''
Kremenyuk added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accepted the invitation to visit Russia despite the
failure of the opposition-led Russian legislature to fulfill a
request to ratify the START II arms control treaty signed with the
United States in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's mounting economic problems and the spreading
violence in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the White House
concluded it could no longer wait for a summit celebrating a START
II ratification that is no where in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin needs help, and Clinton has decided to come to his side.
Aides insist the two men enjoy a close, personal rapport,
exchanging telephone calls about once a month and meeting at
international forums, like the May summit of world leaders in
England.
</P>
<P>
   But while the two countries have grown closer since the days of
the Soviet Union and their Cold War rivalry, they are not staunch
allies, a fact clearly demonstrated by an array of foreign policy
differences.
</P>
<P>
   During his recently concluded trip to China, some critics
questioned whether Clinton was neglecting a more important
strategic relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last Clinton-Yeltsin summit in March 1997 in Helsinki,
U.S.-Russia relations have soured on issues including NATO
expansion in eastern Europe, international sanctions against Iraq,
and Russian arms and technology sales to Iran and other developing
nations
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit to Moscow is chiefly being characterized by
analysts here as an urgent mission of mercy intended to bolster
Yeltsin's image as a world leader, back his efforts at economic
reform and restore confidence in Russia's sagging financial markets
among foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   An all-out economic meltdown would send consumer prices
skyrocketing, further diminishing Yeltsin's clout and ruining
chances for more democratic and market reforms in the foreseeable
future, analysts predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West doesn't need Yeltsin, but it predicts chaos were he
to be forced from office before his term ended. They don't see a
figure reliable enough to substitute for the current leader,'' said
political scientist Alexei Bogaturov.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to travel to Moscow later
this month for meetings with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to
formulate and agenda for the Clinton-Yeltsin summit.
</P>
<P>
   But just how Clinton's visit will play in Russia is difficult to
predict, given the volatile economy, simmering nationwide labor
strikes and Yeltsin's low ratings in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's early honeymoon years as a champion of Western-style
reform following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 have given way
to disillusionment as most Russians have seen their standard of
living diminished during the long, ongoing transition to democracy
and free markets.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma, controlled by
Communists and nationalists hostile to Yeltsin, is scheduled in
September to consider an unpopular, belt-tightening budget and the
long-delayed ratification of the START II agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Ryzhkov, a political moderate and the Duma's first
deputy speaker, warned that a contentious autumn is looming just as
Clinton arrives in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can safely say that unfortunately it will be a hot autumn,''
he told a news conference this week. It is already clear that
growing arrears on pensions, wages and the defense order will
exacerbate social tensions and popular discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is currently negotiating an aid package with the
International Monetary Fund to help it meet its short-term debt
obligations and strengthen the ruble. But some foreign investors
predict Russia may need $20 billion or more to restore confidence
in the economy and prevent a devaluation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma is scheduled to meet next Wednesday and Thurday to
consider a austerity measures prompted by the Yeltsin government
and considered necessary before the IMF approves an assistance
package.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economic slide -- its markets have lost almost
two-thirds of their value in the past year -- may have prompted the
Clinton White House to abandon hopes of a START II ratification,
which the Duma has announced it will not consider before it
convenes for its fall session.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate ratified the arms control treaty in 1996. But
despite pleas from Yeltsin, the opposition-dominated Duma has
continually put off a vote on the treaty, which would cut Russian
and American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Another pressing issue is Kosovo and the Serbian crackdown on
separatist ethnic Albanian forces. The Clinton administration has
pushed for tougher economic and military sanctions to temper
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and prevent a wider conflict
in the Balkans. Russia has opposed harsh steps against the Serbs,
whom they view as traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the United States and Russia have confronted one
another at the United Nations over policy toward Iraq, another
traditional Soviet-era ally where Russia has potentially lucrative
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's promise to continue pushing for enlargement of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization also has alarmed Russians, many
of whom regard NATO expansion as an implicit declaration that the
U.S. continues to consider Russia a potential enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the U.S. Senate ratified a NATO agreement to admit three
former Warsaw Pact countries: Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic. Yeltsin is expected to reiterate Russia's opposition to
the expansion, and particularly proposed NATO membership for the
Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once part of the
Soviet Union.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Here are the issues facing U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who are scheduled to meet in
Moscow in September:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA'S ECONOMY: The prospect of a crash is spurring Clinton to
visit Moscow. Russia needs an international bailout. Yeltsin and
his democratic reforms could be in danger should the ruble crash
and poor Russians face skyrocketing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   THE BALKANS: The U.S. warns that a broader Balkans war is
possible unless international pressure is placed on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the Serbian crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Russia has resisted, regarding the
Serbs as traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
   NATO EXPANSION: The security organization designed to counter
Soviet aggression during the Cold War is looking to expand to
countries once behind the Iron Curtain, a move many Russians regard
as a threat. Invitations have gone to Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS REDUCTION: In their last summit, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed
to pursue new strategic arms cuts as soon as the Duma ratified
START II, a treaty signed in January 1993. The Duma, Russia's lower
house of Parliament controlled by Communists and other Yeltsin
opponents, have withheld the political plum.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ: Russia has been a leading voice in the United Nations to
relax economic sanctions and weapons inspections imposed on Iraq
since the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The U.S. wants to keep the
pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pending proof that he
has abandoned his weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN: The U.S. wants Russia to curb its exports of nuclear and
missile technology to Iran. Yeltsin has offered assurances that
Russia will halt shipments that could help Iran become a nuclear
power, but U.S. intelligence reports indicate that the transfers
continue.

   ``The fliers never really bothered me because I knew that if you
tell lies often enough, someone is going to believe them,'' says
Minton. ``I know some people are going to believe some of what has
been said about me. But what can I do? I'm not a member of the
truth police. Sure, I could pass out my own fliers. But I won't.
I'd be a basket case if I worried about what the Scientologists say
about me and what people believe. And yes, I'm relatively confident
about who I am. Perhaps you might say arrogant. I think I drive
them crazy. I think they find my attitude extraordinary.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burden on his family
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the effect on his family has been an issue, especially for
older daughter, Katherine. Drawing attention to oneself at age 12,
Minton says, is something every preteen tries to avoid. Having
picketers in front of your house can bring nothing but
embarrassment to a young girl, says Minton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told my girls that, yes, their dad is different,'' says
Minton of Katherine and Sarah, 10. ``I've explained that I'm just
not prepared to let these guys act like predators on people who are
trying to exercise their most fundamental rights in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Christmas, he says, he and his wife gave a party for close
friends and neighbors. During the evening, he noticed several boys
dropping balloons filled with water off the back deck. Katherine
later explained that the boys had come armed with the balloons in
case the Scientologists were picketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was a nice sign of support for her,'' says
Minton, who chooses his words carefully when discussing his
children and wife. ``The kids in her class knew what was going on
because they'd talked about a newspaper article about me in their
current events class.
</P>
<P>
   ``So yes, Katherine initially exhibited age-appropriate
embarrassment but time has made everything less of an issue,'' says
Minton, who adds that his girls understand that his involvement is
not going to end any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Minton says what most sparked his anger were the fliers in St.
Barts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so unexpected. I think that's why it got to me. But it
certainly was not surprising because that's the sort of violation
of personal boundaries that the Scientologists enjoy,'' says
Minton, who is reluctant to talk about his reactions because he
does not want to fuel the Scientologists' tactics. ``It was a
tactic to make my wife squirm. To make me squirm. They gloated
about this incident on the Internet _ about their unstoppable
reach, that nobody is outside the reach of the Church of
Scientology.''
</P>
<P>
   Jentzsch says he does not know anything about the fliers in St.
Barts but does confirm that ``individual Scientologists have
distributed fliers in Boston to draw attention to what they felt
was Minton's religious bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton's wife, Therese, says she supports her husband. His
dedication does not surprise her, she says, because her husband has
always had strong beliefs. But does she hope his involvement will
end?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God, I hope so,'' she says during a short telephone
interview. ``But I know he has made a commitment and I feel my job
is to protect my family and not let all this have a negative effect
on our lives. I've tried to make it a positive experience for our
girls. That their dad has strong beliefs and it's important to have
such beliefs and to stand up for what he believes is right.''
</P>
<P>
   She says they don't thrash it out at the dinner table but talk
about other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess I do exercise more caution than the girls know
about,'' says Therese, whose family in England was contacted by
Scientologists looking into her background. ``I look at who's
walking down our street when I go out the front door and take other
little precautions. But I want everyone to know that we are truly
there for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jentzsch confirms that church attorneys retained ``qualified
investigators'' to try to ``discover the man's true agenda.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His mother talked
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Minton has found most disturbing is that his mother, son,
and brother talked to detectives after he'd warned them to keep
silent. He has little contact with them and is openly upset by what
he sees as their betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives ``went to where my family works or to their homes and
told them that I was being accused of hate crimes against the
Scientologists,'' says Minton. ``They said I was giving millions to
people who are out to destroy the Scientologists. They told my
mother that if I wasn't putting all these millions into a war
against the Scientologists, maybe she could have a nicer home. They
used the same tactic with my son and he began to question how I was
spending my money.''
</P>
<P>
   He says his mother probably sat down with the detectives
because, like any mother, she likes to talk about her sons. His
younger brother, he says, was probably shaken after being told his
big brother was under investigation for an extortion attempt
against the church. He probably thought, says Minton, that somehow
he might get in trouble if he kept silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I didn't do a good enough job preparing my family for
the tactics of these people,'' says Minton, who grew up in
Nashville. ``My family is Southern and they're not used to dealing
with strangers in a forceful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton's mother, Catherine Minton, says she is surprised by her
son's involvement with the Scientologists because she didn't think
``he was interested in these sorts of things.''She agreed to talk
with two Scientology members who arrived on her doorstep, but now
regrets that she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really upset when they left,'' says Catherine, during a
phone conversation from her room in a Florida nursing home. ``They
wanted to know everything about Bob and it really was none of their
business. I wish I'd never let them into my house. I wish I hadn't
talked to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bob is doing is really his business,'' says Catherine.
``I can't do anything about it. But I sure wish he'd quit fooling
around with these people because of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   His son by his first marriage, Rob Minton, 30, is more vehement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had a rocky relationship,'' says Rob, during a
recent phone conversation from his home in Kentucky. ``There have
always been many problems. He's got a lot of money and he's bored.
He doesn't have any hobbies so this has become his hobby _ a very
expensive hobby at that. But I think it's a waste of time. Why not
help underprivileged kids or battered women? Why this? Why didn't
he spend this kind of time and energy on our relationship? He never
visited me in college and did not come to my graduation. We've
never had a father/son relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton, in response to the fliers about his family, says that
over the years, he has been very generous with family members. He
says he took a mortgage on his mother's home to protect her from
herself because she has a history of borrowing against the equity
and getting herself in financial trouble. He says he did not
appreciate his son's questioning how he spends his money,
especially the money he paid for the home for the former
Scientology couple who wanted to open a cat sanctuary near Seattle.
And he says, he will, as promised, give his son a down payment for
a home when he marries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A personal motive
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As to the psychiatric problems alluded to in the fliers, Minton
says they stem from several days spent in a mental hospital when he
was 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was very abusive towards my mother, so when I was 16
she up and left,'' says Minton, whose father owned clothing stores
in Nashville. ``A week later my father and I got into an
altercation and I left the house and took the car.''
</P>
<P>
   His father called police and they chased the young Minton
through the streets of suburban Nashville until he overturned the
car. He was taken to the police station and at 1 in the morning
transported to a private mental institution, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt terribly abandoned there,'' says Minton. ``I had no
idea how long I'd have to stay or why I was put there. I was locked
up in a padded cell like an animal. I wasn't allowed to contact
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third day he managed to call his girlfriend's mother, who
called his grandfather. The next morning his father and grandfather
picked him up and he went to live with his grandparents _
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   It was this experience that triggered his interest in Lisa
McPherson who, according to Minton and published reports, died
after being locked up for 17 days in the Scientology-owned hotel.
So far Minton has committed $350,000 to the civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is extremely serious about what he's doing,'' says Dandar,
the McPherson's attorney. ``He sees Scientology as a big bully and
violater of human rights. He's astounded at what happened to Lisa.
And he puts his money where his mouth is. I know he'll see this
case through to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton says he's never before supported a cause with such
passion. He protested the Vietnam War but not with the energy he
has devoted to Scientology. It has enveloped him to the point that
he's backed away from many of his former activities, such as
helping to coach his daughters' Little League team and spending
time raising money for his daughters' private school.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting is that Scientologists have recently
requested sit-down meetings with Minton. And he has agreed. Minton
met for five hours in Los Angeles and two hours in Boston in a
hotel room at the Marriott Long Wharf with two high-ranking
Scientologists, Marty Rathbun and Mike Rinder. Minton says he
believes the meetings came about because they thought that
schmoozing with him might help persuade him to ask the producers of
``Dateline'' not to air a show on him on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Jentzsch confirms that they met with Minton but denies that the
purpose was to convince him to cancel the ``Dateline.'' ``I don't
think he could do this, in any event.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton plans to meet further with the Scientologists. He says he
hopes that might lead to changes within the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``My involvement does surprise me at times. It certainly wasn't
there at the beginning,'' says Minton, who notes that the fliers
and picketing stopped, with the exception of St. Barts, after he
took pictures of the picketers and posted them on the Internet late
this winter. ``I'm spending all my time on this and I have no
thoughts of retreating.''

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's hardliners are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   A fact brought home recently when conservative clerics -- those
men with the long brown robes, turban-like headwear and cellular
telephones -- hustled around the parliament that they control to
efficiently orchestrate the ouster of moderate President Mohammed
Khatami's top cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   To ordinary Iranians, it was ominous but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   A year into the term of the popular but not-so-powerful
president, the political climate in this country of 60 million
people swings daily between Khatami's quest for reform and
conservative backlashes against him.
</P>
<P>
   While Khatami stocks his government with moderates, the
religious conservatives run the parliament, courts and the
military.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers are now free to take their case to the streets,
their demonstrations are sometimes broken up by semi-official mobs.
</P>
<P>
   The political and cultural clash is laid out in the pages and
offices of the lively Iranian press.
</P>
<P>
   At Shalamche magazine's storefront office, the walls are covered
in burlap, one corner is ringed with sandbags and artillery shells
are used as trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   The young, idealistic, editors do not talk to foreign
journalists, but their magazine defends Islamic values under
attack. Originally dedicated to the memory of the 1980s Iran-Iraq
war, its latest target is across town: The Jameah daily.
</P>
<P>
   Jameah is a snappy broad-sheet that started in the bloom of more
than 300 publications founded since Khatami's election. It pokes
fun at political leaders and prints long interviews with
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Its office is also staffed with young idealists, but it is in a
California-styled villa. A tongue-in-cheek staff petition posted on
the wall asks editors why the swimming pool is empty.
</P>
<P>
   But Jameah has bigger problems than an empty pool. The Iranian
courts have ordered it to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from traditionalism to modernism,'' urges the
paper's editor, Mashallah Shamsolvazeen. ``Don't let this newborn
baby, the (Khatami) election, die now.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami supporters sometimes call themselves ``The May 23
Front,'' referring to the election last year when Khatami stunned
the world by winning 70 percent of the Iranian vote.
</P>
<P>
   Youth and women _ two groups especially hard-pressed under
Iran's strict Islamic rule _ were strong supporters. In his
cautious talk about a ``civil society,'' Khatami offered hope of
more personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The poor were attracted to his pledges to improve the Iranian
economy, largely controlled by quasi-government conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   His win inspires open, but still dangerous, questioning of
whether religious rulers should have the final say in government.
</P>
<P>
   The press is flourishing. Women are asking for more rights to
divorce and for child custody. Unmarried couples feel freer to hold
hands in public.
</P>
<P>
   But, Khatami's mandate recently suffered losses on three fronts:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last month, the parliament, run by Khatami's conservative
election opponent, impeached Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri was a key Khatami confidante whose office gave him a say
in how future elections will be organized and the power to appoint
the mayor's of Iran's cities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The judiciary, run by religious authorities, has placed Tehran
Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi on trial for corruption. Seen as a
reformer and an effective administrator of the city of 10 million
people, he helped run Khatami's election.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The judiciary, also, ordered the closing of the Jameah
newspaper after complaints were filed against it by a large,
quasi-government business group and the prisons department. The
paper is still running, as it appeals the order.
</P>
<P>
   The attack against Nouri illustrated the hardliners' approach.
</P>
<P>
   They accused him of allowing too many public demonstrations and
replacing too many old administrators. They said crime and disorder
were rising and that he was encouraging supporters of Karbaschi to
challenge the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has preferred one man (Karbaschi) over a nation,'' said
parliament member Taher Taheri(cq). ``He has given permission to
too many to speak out and comment, causing great stress in the
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami supporters say the hardliners know the president is too
popular to attack directly. So they attack his advisers, hoping to
tarnish the president and the idea of reform in this
still-conservative society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever anyone talks about freedom, soon (the hardliners)
connect the word 'freedom' to immorality,'' said student activist
Serajeddin Mirdamad (cq).
</P>
<P>
   Even in south Tehran, a working-class area where people adhere
to strict Muslim customs, they worry about their beloved president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are putting pressure on him . . . If he weren't limited,
he could do so many good things,'' said Abbas Zavaraian, 35, who
works in his father's ice cream store.
</P>
<P>
   He explains Khatami's popularity simply: ``A good man will be
loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives are trying to preserve their power in a
society where the sources of power have always been hard to define
and are now getting even cloudier.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameni, is the ultimate
director of the police, military, courts and many business groups.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Khatami, who had served in the government in the
past, to run for president at a time most thought he had no chance
of winning.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Khameni was visibly weak at a public appearance and
Tehran is flush with whispers that he has a terminal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's own influence is limited both by the narrow powers of
his office and Iran's history of harshness with reformers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, clerics in the parliament impeached President Abolhasan
Bani Sadr after he tried to centralize power and reform the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami enters while Iran's fortunes are mixed. It has largely
recovered from it's eight-year war against Iraq. It is modern and
productive despite a U.S. trade embargo against this country it
says sponsors terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But, slumping oil prices are gouging deficits into the
government's budget and increasing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all Iranians were born after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution that ousted the dictatorial Shah of Iran, and they are
restless for material and social freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami is wary of giving his opposition any ammunition in their
claims that reform leads to chaos. He consistently urges followers
to stick to only legal, non-violent avenues for activism.
</P>
<P>
   Many have urged him to respond more forcefully, which he finally
did when the parliament fired his interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day as the impeachment, Khatami appointed Nouri to a
newly created position with broader authority -- a move reportedly
viewed as a direct challenge to the conservative offensive.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ These are dicey times for Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   On my trip last month, I could sense the difference from my last
visit in December.
</P>
<P>
   Then, reformers were gleeful about the prospects for changing
their fundamentalist nation under newly-elected President Mohammed
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Iranians are channel-surfing between World Cup soccer games
and the trial of the popular Tehran mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Gholamhossein Karbaschi is accused of corruption, but most
Iranians think he was targeted by the religious hardliners who run
the courts because he managed Khatami's surprisingly successful
election.
</P>
<P>
   As in December, Iranians are still seeing increased freedom.
But, the Karbaschi trial is just one example that reform still has
its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues causing friction is how Iran should show
itself to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The day after watching a televised World Cup match with a group
of young Iranians, one called and asked that I not tell anyone I
was with there.
</P>
<P>
   These days, an evening with a foreign journalist can be
controversial, especially if the evening in question includes
cassettes of Western dance music.
</P>
<P>
   When hardliners in the Iranian parliament last month impeached
Khatami's top cabinet minister, Abdullah Nouri, they cited his
comments in the foreign press. There were too many outsiders, they
said, carrying news about Iran's private business.
</P>
<P>
   I got the same response when my translator tried to set up an
appointment with the head of the unofficial ``club wielders,'' the
hardline mobs that break up reformist demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they want to know about our internal affairs,'' he
asked, saying it seemed like a form of ``espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's identity is built around martyrdom and persecution. Some
are afraid that if Iran opens up, people will see that Iranians are
not all stern religious zealots.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a hard secret to keep. Iranians are, in fact, fun and
sophisticated, friendly and educated. Go to this capital city's
working-class south side and interview the grocery store owner, and
he'll want to treat you to lunch. The ice cream salesman insists
that you fill up while you ask him your questions.
</P>
<P>
   The many parks and shopping districts in Tehran are some of the
most fertile ground for interviews in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   One western observer noted that hardliners are afraid Iran will
be perceived as ``the kind of country America doesn't have to worry
about.'' That would almost be contrary to Iran's national
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   But, the reformers are glad to have foreign journalists around.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate government officials, led by Khatami, are making it
easier for foreigners to get visas and are encouraging American
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The average Iranian on the street wanted me to know that Iran is
changing, even as they are nervous about how far they will be
allowed to go.
</P>
<P>
   They told me not to pay attention to the people who shout
``Death to America'' at Friday prayers, saying it was passe
sloganism.
</P>
<P>
   One should not take this too far. Overall, Iranians still
believe in the basic principles of the Islamic revolution. The late
Ayatollah Khomeini is still beloved.
</P>
<P>
   But one intellectual also reminded me that, ever since the
Muslims conquered the country in the 7th Century, Iranians have
adopted stern public behaviors to satisfy their religious rulers,
while leading much more relaxed, accommodating, private lives.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, in the carousing described by the Persian poets
Omar Khayam or Hafiz, that Iran has always had many faces.
</P>
<P>
   You could have looked at the streets of Tehran after the
national team beat the United States in World Cup soccer. The team
is a patriotic phenomenon and has become a vehicle for Iranians to
test out new freedoms without fear of reprisal from the Islamic
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that hard-line Iranian officials made it difficult
for American networks to beam out much video of the jubilant soccer
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The world would have seen happy Iranians having what any
American would consider clean fun. One clip that was censored
showed youths saying they were ready for good relations with
America.
</P>
<P>
   There was even one girl in the street stretching modesty laws by
wearing make up in public. She had the Iranian flag's red, white
and green painted on her face.
</P>
<P>
   What are the conservatives supposed to do about that?

KEEPING MILDEW OFF THE ROOF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The original roof on my 1950 gambrel-roof house was black. I
had a new, light gray roof installed and now it shows a lot of
mildew. How can I get rid of the mildew, and how can I prevent its
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   JOYCE ELIOT, Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You probably had mildew on the black roof as well, but it
simply did not show, as it does on the lighter roof. To get rid of
it, use the tried and true formula of one part liquid chlorine
bleach and three parts water. Just paint it on and let it dry.
</P>
<P>
   And, there is a new way you might try to keep the mildew from
coming back: long strips of zinc tucked under the shingles in the
second from the top row, with about 3 inches of zinc exposed. In
the case of a gambrel roof, the strip can be tucked under the
shingles on both the steep roof and the higher, shallow roof of the
gambrel.
</P>
<P>
   When it rains, the water runs over the zinc, distributing it
down the roof. Zinc is a powerful mildew preventer. Before these
strips were invented, there was no sure-fire way you could keep the
mildew from returning.
</P>
<P>
   The strips, sold by different companies, have different names,
but they all do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   One brand is Shingle Shield, sold in hardware stores, home
centers, and lumber dealers, distributed by PDQ Building Products
Sales of Hingham, 978-878-8733. Another brand is simply called
Rolled Zinc Strips.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am finishing off my basement that has 7 1/2 feet of
headroom from floor to the ceiling joists. Can I use metal studs
instead of wood? They are less expensive, for one thing. As for a
ceiling, dropped versus dry wall? And for the floor of the entry, 7
by 13 feet, ceramic tile versus vinyl tiles on rough concrete?
</P>
<P>
   TOM HUME, Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Metal studs are OK, except they transfer heat and cold
readily. But that is OK below grade, because the temperature does
not get below 55 degrees most of the time, so a minumum of
insulation is required. As for the ceiling, a dropped ceiling is
more expensive than dry wall, but will allow access to wires,
plumbing, and other things between the joists. Because of the
limited height of the ceiling, it is best to install a ceiling that
does not go much below the joists; such systems are called no
clearance ceilings and are sold in building supply stores. For the
floor, ceramic tile is best in the handyman's opinion; vinyl tiles
are OK but will follow the roughness of the concrete floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have to replace my front door that is 32 years old, with
two large panels and two windows with bull's eye or bullet glass. I
can't find any standard doors of this style, and I'd like to keep
those nice windows for the new door. Where can I find such a door?
</P>
<P>
   JEANNE MARIE FURNARY, Westford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know if any door company will incorporate the fancy
windows, but it's worth a try. Such windows seem quite rare these
days. So, try Elegant Entries, 45 Water St., Worcester, MA 01604,
508-755-5237.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of the air in my wheelbarrow's tire has gone out, making
it mighty hard to push. There is no stem or valve for refilling
with air. How can I pump it up again?
</P>
<P>
   ANONYMOUS CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I have never heard of a tire holding air that does not have
some means of refilling it. Dismount the wheel and tire, and take
it to a hardware store. The store might find a way. If not, you may
have to replace the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband replaced a small section of a no-wax floor with a
new, matching piece. He used a wax stripper to remove the wax or
floor polish, but the contrast between the old and the new is still
great. Is there a way to even out the colors? We plan to replace
the floor in autumn.
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN BARRETT, North Attleborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For that short a wait until putting in a new floor, live with
it. You could try coating the entire floor with Future to see if
that might even out the color.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm having a threshold put into a doorway without a door
where the floor in one room is linoleum, and flagstone in the
other. Can I nail through the flagstone to hold the threshold in
place?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY STARK, Newtown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In a word, no, but you can nail through the mortar joints
between the stones. Predrill through the mortar before driving the
nails. Or just nail into the linoleum side, which presumably has
wood under it.
</P>
<P>
   And, you might not need nails at all, because the threshold may
fit tightly without nails. The vertical trim around the opening is
made of a jamb board (one of the boards that forms the opening),
and two casing boards (one on each side of the opening _ that is,
one in one room, another in the other). These casing boards are
offset a little from the jamb board. The space, about a quarter
inch, is called a reveal. Because of this configuration, the ends
of the threshold must be cut to match that trim. The end is cut
out, leaving short ``horns'' on each side of the threshold end.
After cutting each end, the threshold is dropped in place, without
nails. Those horns lock in the threshold and keep it from moving
laterally. All this sounds a lot harder than it really is.
</P>

   The average Iranian on the street wanted me to know that Iran is
changing, even as they are nervous about how far they will be
allowed to go.
</P>
<P>
   They told me not to pay attention to the people who shout
``Death to America'' at Friday prayers, saying it was passe
sloganism.
</P>
<P>
   One should not take this too far. Overall, Iranians still
believe in the basic principles of the Islamic revolution. The late
Ayatollah Khomeini is still beloved.
</P>
<P>
   But one intellectual also reminded me that, ever since the
Muslims conquered the country in the 7th Century, Iranians have
adopted stern public behaviors to satisfy their religious rulers,
while leading much more relaxed, accommodating, private lives.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, in the carousing described by the Persian poets
Omar Khayam or Hafiz, that Iran has always had many faces.
</P>
<P>
   You could have looked at the streets of Tehran after the
national team beat the United States in World Cup soccer. The team
is a patriotic phenomenon and has become a vehicle for Iranians to
test out new freedoms without fear of reprisal from the Islamic
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that hard-line Iranian officials made it difficult
for American networks to beam out much video of the jubilant soccer
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The world would have seen happy Iranians having what any
American would consider clean fun. One clip that was censored
showed youths saying they were ready for good relations with
America.
</P>
<P>
   There was even one girl in the street stretching modesty laws by
wearing make up in public. She had the Iranian flag's red, white
and green painted on her face.
</P>
<P>
   What are the conservatives supposed to do about that?

JEFF GORDON IS NASCAR'S GOLDEN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OMAR KELLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He adorns milk ads with the likes of actress Claudia Schiffer
and tennis ace Pete Sampras. He's graced cereal boxes and
toothpaste ads along with appearing on the ``Tonight'' show and the
``Late Show with David Letterman.'' He was selected as one of the
world's 50 most beautiful people by People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, the millionaire with his own jet and a wife who was
a former Miss Winston, has struck gold in only six full seasons on
the NASCAR circuit. And he's really on getting started.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's great. Racing has given me the opportunity to do
some really fun and exciting things,'' said the 26-year-old Gordon,
whose chiseled features and piercing eyes give him the look of a
Hollywood star. ``Being in a Super Bowl commercial was exciting.
The milk mustache (ad) was cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being one of People magazine's most beautiful people was fun
too, but I really wanna know who voted on that one. My sport is
great because it's so commercial. If you couldn't tell just look at
our cars. Racing provides me a lot of exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Gordon sits in front of his bowl of Kellogg's
mini-wheat cereal, one of his many endorsements, and wonders if his
life could get any better. Winning a third Winston Cup in four
years might help.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon sits atop the standings, leading Jeremy Mayfield by 40
points, but even if he were to slip and not win the title, he'll
remain the circuit's best and brightest star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Gordon is certainly a star in our sport and appears to
have a bright future for many years to come,'' said NASCAR
president Bill France. ``Just as Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt
opened the doors for the new generation, Jeff Gordon is doing the
same as NASCAR heads into the 21st century. He has become a great
ambassador for NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into this weekend's Jiffy Lube 300 at the New Hampshire
International Speedway in Loudon, Gordon won four times this
season, collecting $1,678,665.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his success rate at NHIS, on the NASCAR circuit for
the last four years, it's a strong possibly Gordon's Chevrolet
Monte Carlo will be rolling into the winner's circle this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only been going there for three or four years, and I've
won twice so far. It's safe to say my track record is pretty good
there,'' said Gordon. ``It's always kind of been a hit-or-miss
situation at New Hampshire. Either our team wins or runs really
good on the track, or we do the total opposite, like crash or run
really bad. There has been no in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like his career. He's become the biggest star in United
States motorsports in what seems like the blink of an eye. Gordon
was 24 when he won his first NASCAR Winston Cup title, the youngest
ever. Bill Rexford had won the title at 23 in 1950, before
Winston's sponsorship. And Gordon can only improve with experience.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon credits his crew chief, Ray Evernham, with much of his
success, Evernham's swift decisions and cunning strategies have
steered Gordon to the winner's circle 10 times in one season on two
occasions since their hookup in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes us a great combination is our communication back
and forth,'' said Gordon, who will announce later this year that he
and his wife, along with Evernham, will form their own Busch Grand
National series team. ``The difference between us and the field is
that the more precise my observations are about the car, the more
precise Ray's adjustments can get. Small changes makes a big
difference in the speed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday's race, Gordon is again being lined up for success by
his Hendrick Motorsports team. They'll put him behind the wheel of
a fairly new vehicle, one that has been particularly stong on the
long straight aways, which Gordon said he'll need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (NHIS) track has long straightaways with very tight, flat
corners,'' he said. ``It takes a very different driving style to
really go fast. We've got some momentum right now. Things have been
handling well.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's likely that they'll continue, along with NASCAR's
steadily increasing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a hand in NASCAR's success. I simply try to put
on as good of a race as I possible can, but I do it for the fans,''
Gordon said. ``If it weren't for my fans supporting me, spending
money, going to my races, Jeff Gordon wouldn't be anybody. Those
people are special. They keep me hungry and working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon merely wants to return what the fans demand _ a winning
tradition.

CASE OF MISSING SOCIALITE SULLIES NEW YORK CITY'S NEW IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly 40 years, Irene Silverman has lived a
block from Central Park in a limestone mansion she converted into a
boarding house for the very rich. She's been attended to by cooks,
housekeepers, a personal assistant, a driver and several other
helpers, none of whom saw her vanish Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, who is 82 and barely 5 feet tall, still has not
turned up, and police now fear she has fallen victim to one of the
bizarre, deadly deeds that once screamed regularly from Gotham
tabloids before crime began to plummet a few years ago under Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The missing woman is a retired Radio City Music Hall ballet
dancer. She is the kind of moneyed, East Side socialite who once
took a limo to art class at Columbia University. She has been known
to tote champagne in her purse and favored used-up bottles of
expensive gin to water the roof garden atop her five-story home.
</P>
<P>
   She is still classified as missing, but police are questioning a
pair of grifters who, fortuitously, were already in custody here: a
mother and son who have committed felonies from coast to coast, and
who were picked up Sunday on federal charges that they passed a bad
$14,000 check to purchase a green Lincoln Continental in Utah
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two people in custody and we are following a number of
leads, but we do not know where Mrs. Silverman is at the moment,''
police commissioner Howard Safir said Wednesday at a briefing where
he also announced that crime in New York had fallen another 8
percent. ``We don't know whether any harm has befallen her.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have combed sections of the park, hundreds of dumpsters
and any dark place around the gilded Fifth Avenue salons, for her
body. The search for Silverman also has spread to other states,
said Safir. He said a dismembered arm and leg discovered in a Bronx
recycling bin belonged to an unidentified Hispanic woman.
</P>
<P>
   Safir declined to say whether 63-year-old Sante Kimes, known to
prosecutors as ``The Dragon Lady,'' and her well-dressed
23-year-old son Kenneth Kimes were cooperating with investigators.
New York newspapers reported Wednesday that the two had Silverman's
passport and checkbook when they were arrested Sunday evening, and
that they are also wanted for questioning in connection with the
murder of a man who was found in a garbage bin four months ago in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their records, the Kimes have dedicated much of their
their lives to felonious crime. Authorities said Sante Kimes has
been arrested about a dozen times on charges ranging from grand
theft to credit-card forgery to involuntary servitude. She was
caught stealing a $6,500 mink coat from a Washington hotel in 1985.
In 1986, she was charged with forcing illegal immigrants from
Mexico to work in virtual slavery at her home in Southern
California. Kenneth Kimes was charged last year in Miami with armed
robbery and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Silverman came in contact with Kenneth Kimes
three weeks ago, when he rented a $6,000-a-month apartment in her
five-story building under the name Manny Gueren. Janice Herbert, a
close friend of Silverman's who had been scheduled to get together
with her Wednesday, said: ``The staff was always like little birds
watching over her all the time. This man who weaseled his way into
that house, he must have been casing her and her patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses were arrested Sunday night by federal agents and New
York police on the unrelated charges, around the same time that one
of Silverman's housekeepers reported her missing. The next day,
police discovered blood stains in front of Silverman's E. 65th
Street house and issued a sketch of Kimes as a suspect. A detective
involved in Kimes's arrest made the connection between Kimes and
the Manny Gueren alias.
</P>
<P>
   Now, friends of Silverman are hoping that she is still alive. In
interviews Wednesday, they described her as a quintessential New
York socialite who grew up poor in New Orleans, spent 10 years as a
ballet dancer in New York, then married a rich, quiet real estate
developer who showed her the world and left her with millions when
he died about 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a grande dame, she was very elegant, and she loved the
dance,'' said John Gruen, a long-time dance writer. Silverman, who
danced under her maiden name Irene Zambelli, was related to the
great 19th century dancer Carlotta Zambelli, and she studied under
famous Russian ballet instructor Michel Fokine. Pretty and petite,
she danced from 1933 to 1943 with the now-defunct Corps de Ballet
at Radio City Music Hall, which at the time was the only ballet
company in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody can live to tell this tale it's Irene,'' said
Herbert, who also danced with the Corps de Ballet in the '50s.
``Ten years at the Music Hall prepare you for life. The stage is
cement, and you're dancing on point, seven days a week, four shows
a day, and that can do a job on your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman gave up her career when she married Samuel Silverman
and began to live as a Manhattan gadfly. She sponsored artists,
attended classes, and eventually started the Colby Foundation,
which is dedicated to advancing the cause of ``all forms of needle
arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruen, the dance writer, said he met Silverman through his wife,
Jane Wilson, who was conducting a drawing class in the 1950s at
Columbia. ``Jane came home to say that here were all these
18-year-old and 19-year-old kids and there was this woman who was a
certain age _ she must have been pushing 50 _ taking courses in
drawing. And she was really quite talented. She was very bright and
asked intelligent questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more, she was a very wealthy woman,'' said Gruen.
``Jane soon realized that Mrs. Silverman arrived in a limo to
Columbia. The courses lasted three hours, and she kept her limo
waiting there three hours on several occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruen said Silverman loved champagne so much she once took out a
bottle that she was carrying in her purse. ``Not to say she was a
drunk, because she definitely was not. But the champagne just
flowed. She said she needed it because she was in pain'' for her
back.
</P>
<P>
   When Silverman's husband died, she decided to convert their home
into a boarding house, renting out apartments to artists and
professionals. The house, said Herbert, was like ``an incredibly
magnificent museum,'' with expensive paintings filling the walls.
</P>
<P>
   From the street, it is impossible to tell what Silverman has
done to the place. Wednesday, it stood out on the upscale street,
but only because of the camera crews who hovered around the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very careful about that,'' said Herbert. ``You never
knew from the outside what was going on inside.''

ASPIRE TO PERSPIRE? I DON'T THINK SO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   I am old enough to remember when ladies didn't sweat. They may
have perspired, they may even have glowed. But they didn't sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are no more ladies, and women are sweating all over
the place. Yes, we've earned the right to sweat. It's one of the
less-acknowledged triumphs of the feminist movement. For some of us
who came of age pre-Title Nine, this new sweat equity takes some
getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   I am trying to learn to love it. To love my own sweat, that is.
Do I have to learn how to love everybody else's too? That would be
asking a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Before we go on, perhaps I should pause to say that if this
subject offends you, please move to the next column which, whatever
it's about, won't be about sweat. Don't say you weren't warned.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the hottest evenings in recent memory, a friend and I
were talking in my kitchen, which, like the rest of the house, is
cleverly designed to be drafty in winter and airless in summer. I
was attempting to cook dinner, I suppose you might even say
``slaving over a hot stove'' (I certainly would), and complaining
that I hate sweat, that it was driving me crazy, that I'd taken two
showers that day and was working up to a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn to accept your sweat,'' Chris said. ``Don't
fight it. Give in to it. Relax. Learn to love it.''
</P>
<P>
   I know sweat is healthy, that you're supposed to break a sweat
when you exercise, that if you don't sweat you'll boil over and
die. So sweat is swell. But do I have to love it?
</P>
<P>
   Chris grew up in Florida. Chris is male. Both these facts have
formed his view of sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Men love to sweat. Ask any man. ``I love to sweat!'' he'll say.
It's one of those guy things.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's a girl thing, too. Women love to sweat. Because
it's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We taxed our muscles, and ended up very sweaty. Which is why
we loved it,'' say the editors of Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness
magazine, reviewing a 30-minute workout in the summer number.
</P>
<P>
   And because sweating is so healthy, it's fashionable. Which is
great, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The division between fashion and fitness is officially blurred
into oblivion,'' the July issue of Vogue declares in a sportswear
layout featuring athletic-looking young models, some of them
actually sweating, unless they've been sprayed with Evian, a
possibility; it is Vogue after all.
</P>
<P>
   A workout-induced sweat is what a tan used to be: a status
symbol. Once, not so long ago, a tan was a mark of the leisured
class, of the sort of people who could afford to summer and winter
at resorts and watering places. Workers were pale. Now workers are
pale and sweaty. Because work is the new status symbol. So is
working out. And getting a tan is unthinkable. It can kill you.
Worse, it can age you before your time.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat, on the other hand, is good for you, assuming you
re-hydrate yourself by drinking gallons of bottled water and
electrolyte-replacing fluids specifically designed for those who
sweat. Sweat sells. It sells makeup. Waterproof mascara to help you
avoid the dread ``racoon-eyes'' look. Tinted moisturizers instead
of foundation, which tends to run when it meets sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat sells clothing. ``Your skin sweats, gets clammy, dries up
and dies,'' reads an ad for a new line of Nike training wear
described as, ``a highly-evolved way to facilitate the evaporation
of sweat by hauling it away from the skin.'' This ad features a
photograph of track star Marion Jones, caught in the middle of a
long-jump, her amazing form aglow. Sweat looks great, on her. But
on me? I don't think so.

CALIFORNIA BEACHES ARE BARELY SURVIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOLANA BEACH, Calif. _ From his perch at Fletcher Cove, Carl
Stahmer has almost everything expected of a California lifeguard:
blond ponytail, even tan, an endless vista of blue ocean. All
that's missing is sand.
</P>
<P>
   Even at low tide, the beach is more gravel than grain.
Sunbathers and surfers between waves scramble for a patch of sand
that won't poke. Riprap, as the boulders brought down for
protection are known, lines the base of the fragile bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been screaming about the sand for years,'' said Stahmer,
a 10-year veteran who, between stints on the beach, is working
toward his doctorate degree in romantic literature. ``This last
winter was like a spike in the coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as beachgoer MaryEtta Eaton put it, ``It's a disaster. This
isn't a beach, it's a strip.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher Cove, like many of southern California's
tourist-attracting beaches, is a lot less attractive than usual
this summer. Waves powered by last winter's El Nino storms pummeled
the coastline month after month, stripping away sand and slashing
the size of some beaches, lowering them by 10 feet or more in
spots. In nearby Cardiff, for instance, beachfront restaurants are
now oceanfront restaurants, with the water almost lapping at their
outdoor patios.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem of natural, episodic erosion is the
damming of large inland rivers, now unable to carry sand back to
the sea. Flood prevention also stops sand from returning to the
beaches, and oceanologists estimate that the dams have cut the
amount of sand traveling from river to sea in southern California
by half.
</P>
<P>
   With some beaches so bare they give new meaning to the term nude
beach, coastal cities are struggling to find ways to restore their
shorelines. Many of their economies depend on it. Southern
California beaches bring in billions of tourism dollars each year.
Solana Beach, a half-hour north of San Diego, has 14,000 residents;
its 1.25-mile stretch of beach attracts 1.2 million people a year,
60 percent of them out-of-towners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beaches are the hallmark of San Diego County,'' said Steve
Sachs, a coastal-erosion specialist with the San Diego Association
of Governments, a voluntary association of 18 cities. ``The quality
of life here is really dependent on the beaches. ... So we want to
get our beaches back.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the missing sand will return naturally; in fact, some
beaches are already coming back. Some, like popular Venice Beach,
are as wide and sandy as ever. But others, which never recovered
from the even more violent El Nino of 1981-82, need help. Sachs
estimated that San Diego County needs 30 million cubic yards of
extra sand for its 60 miles of beach, or enough to fill San Diego's
Qualcomm football stadium 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego had hoped the solution was in its own bay. To make
room for a nuclear aircraft carrier, the Navy late last year began
dredging the harbor, bringing up more than enough sand to replenish
the county's beaches. But the first sand pumped onto an Oceanside
beach was found to contain military munitions _ including some live
rounds. The rest of the sand was dumped out at sea instead.
</P>
<P>
   Now San Diego County must look to other sources, such as
sandbars. So far, Sachs said, it has raised about $14.5 million in
state and federal funds for the project. That's just to put the
sand down. Maintaining the beaches would cost $5 million a year,
not much when compared with another staple of California life. It's
about a third the cost of a freeway interchange, Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature will go a long way toward bringing the beaches
back, but we need some intervention on our own part if we're going
to keep them,'' said Blayne Hartman, vice president of a Solana
Beach soil-testing firm called TEG. ``Otherwise, the next El Nino
could wipe us out, maybe for good.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Solana Beach is involved in a pilot project to
truck sand in from Yuma, Ariz.. Two waste transport firms, whose
trucks were returning empty from Arizona, have kicked in $50,000;
the city put up $32,750, and another $5,000 came from an anonymous
donor.
</P>
<P>
   That will haul enough sand to raise Fletcher Cove, the tourist
beach, by 6 feet. But Tide Park, the smaller beach used by locals,
was going to be left to erode. Then Hartman pledged $10,000 and
helped raise another $30,000. Now Tide Park will get its own sand,
a project that City Councilman Joe Kellejian said should get under
way before month's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our entire beach during El Nino, and this ... adds
material from an outside source,'' Kellejian said. ``The analysis
that's been done on the sand so far was `as good as you can get.'
The grain size is excellent, the color's good. It'll be just like
it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. A higher beach is not necessarily a wider beach.
During low tide at Fletcher Cove, the water reaches almost to the
lifeguard station. At high tide, during a full moon, Tide Park
disappears altogether. But both beaches are in better shape than
Cardiff State Beach, which has been reduced to rubble in the last
10 years and was depending on the bay dredging for new sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will ask us, `Why did you bring the cobbles in?''' said
Denny Stoufer, chief lifeguard for the San Diego Coast District,
referring to the stones that litter some area beaches. ``At South
Carlsbad, there was dry sand anywhere from 20 to 40 yards wide when
I was a rookie lifeguard. Now there's no dry sand, and in winter
there's no sand. ... Unless we do something, I can see a time when
there are no beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the beaches' continuation, some specialists say,
artificial intervention is essential. Some are eroding too fast,
and the sand is moving too far off shore for natural replenishment.
Others, built by developers, were never natural and demand constant
care. Still, some environmentalists prefer to leave the coastline
to erode as it will _ an argument that upsets homeowners who live
atop the bluffs that must now be protected by seawalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that if you're going to have a highly developed
coastline, which we do, it's a little late to say we're not going
to intervene,'' said Reinhard Flick, a research associate at the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography and staff oceanographer for the
California Department of Boats and Waterways. ``Most of the
intervention in the last 60 or 80 years has increased the beaches
more than it's cost us coastline. This thing about man's
interference is a kind of bogeyman.''
</P>
<P>
   Intervention, of course, costs money. In May, US Representative
Ron Packard, a Republican whose district includes parts of San
Diego County, pushed through legislation that will make as much as
$7 million available for beach-rebuilding efforts. The bill will
also free the Navy to use whatever funds aren't spent on the harbor

   Eyes that feel sandblasted. A persistent dull throb in the mouse
hand. Laundry collects in a corner that is on its way to being
declared a domestic Superfund site, and come to think of it, you're
getting pretty ripe, too.
</P>
<P>
   These are the unmistakable signs of a serious addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But what games are good enough to trigger that I-gotta-play
response, the kind of yearning that makes some game fanatics blow
off dates and forget other important things, like eating and work?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I've been getting grainy eyed over real-time strategy
games. I was strung out on Total Annihilation for a while,
determined to rack up victories against the evil Core. It didn't
help that Cavedog Entertainment just released an expansion pack
with more missions, maps, and new machinery. Dark Reign fed my
temporary need for interplanetary domination with its excellent
sound and graphics; it, too, has an expansion available, and
Activision promises even more versions of this award-winning game.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is often an addiction unto itself, with its surplus of
minutiae and useless facts that blur the line between jockdom and
geekhood. Baseball games torque the geek quotient up several
notches, as in the case of Microsoft's 1998 edition of Baseball 3D
and the forward-looking All-Star Baseball 99 for the Nintendo 64
system.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a stat-freak's dream, player and team performance
broken down into several hundred categories. This is definitely a
game to warrant buying several extra memory modules to hold all
that data. Baseball 3D is among the best-looking sports games on
the market, with accurate renderings of all major-league stadiums
and detailed high-polygon player models that do everything except
adjust their cups at the plate. According to the box, all this
realism requires a system with a Pentium 133 chip or better, 16
megs of RAM, and a 2 meg 3D card. We ran it on a P-166 with 16 megs
and found the action sequences annoyingly choppy. A P-200 with 32
megs handled the game nicely.

<P>
   Between bouts of galactic conquest and attempted triple plays,
it has been hard to escape the Play-Station game N2O: Nitrous
Oxide. This is a pure fast-twitch fiber workout; the only strategy
is to stay alive while spiraling through the iridescent gut canal
of some huge beast. (OK, maybe they're just tunnels, but indulge my
little ``Fantastic Voyage'' fantasy.) While your skimming
hovercraft is blasting nasty intestinal flora and fauna,
high-energy dance beats from the Crystal Method pump out of the
speakers. This game sounds amazing routed through a home theater
sound system.
</P>
<P>
   After having gone through a Final Fantasy VII binge when the
game was released for PlayStation, I expected the new PC version to
collect dust in the ever-expanding in-basket. Cloud, Barret, Tifa,
and the rest of the crew still offer some of the most engaging
gameplay ever designed for any format, and the PC version's
graphics approach console quality. The heart of the game is the
rich storyline, which remains unchanged, so this game might trigger
more people to find out what the fuss is about.

   Our uncharacteristic largesse was prompted by the high-wow
factor of Microsoft's site terraserver.microsoft.com, which, in
typically low-key Microsoft fashion, claims to be the world's
largest online database. With 1.01 terabytes of info harnessed on
linked hard drives (about 100,000 copies of ``Moby-Dick,'' if you
really need to know), it contains satellite photographs of much of
the United States, and most large cities in Europe, Africa, and
Asia. Click on a region or enter a city to get surprisingly clear
images. The pictures are of Cuban Missile Crisis resolution,
meaning I was able to make out the car parked in my driveway but
couldn't read the license plate. For that, one would need access to
the newer sky spy imaging technology that enables the government to
count nose hairs on a chosen target.

LABOR'S DECEIT ON PROP 226 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Beginning next week, JACOBY-COLUMN will move on Mondays and
Thursdays.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The defeat last month of Proposition 226, California's
``paycheck protection'' intiative, was a blow to conservatives and
Republicans, especially those Republicans who pay dues to labor
unions and resent seeing their mandatory fees used to promote
Democratic candidates. Proposition 226 would have required unions
to get a member's permission in writing before spending any part of
his dues on political activities. That, said the advocates of
paycheck protection, would finally stop unions from riding
roughshod over many members' wishes and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor fought hard to defeat Proposition 226,
pouring at least $20 million into a campaign of astonishing deceit.
The unions claimed, for example, that the measure would stifle the
voice of California workers. They warned that it would threaten
``Medicare, Social Security, public education, health and safety
regulations, and environmental protections.'' They even howled,
ludicrously, that paycheck protection ``could mean the difference
between life and death'' for sheriffs and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   It is always painful to lose to mendacious opponents, but the
supporters of Proposition 226 can take comfort in this: Even if
they had won, nothing would have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, I wrote that Proposition 226 would ultimately prove
futile. If California unions were barred from spending workers'
money on political activities without permission, I predicted, they
would simply call those activities nonpolitical and continue
spending as they pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's proof.
</P>
<P>
   I have from Mike Antonucci, the relentless teachers union
watchdog who runs the Education Intelligence Agency, the 1998-99
budget of the California Teachers Association. Or rather, the two
budgets _ the union prepared one spending plan marked ``226 wins,''
and a second marked ``226 loses.'' (Antonucci's communiques, must
reading for anyone interested in the skinny on teachers unions
nationwide, are dispatched from EducIntel(at)aol.com).
</P>
<P>
   Few unions blasted Proposition 226 as harshly as the powerful
CTA, which described paycheck protection as ``the biggest threat to
teachers and public education by far.'' Lois Tinson, the union's
president, prophesied that Proposition 226 would stifle the voice
of teachers in the public arena. Making unions get members'
permission before spending their dues on politics would prove a
bureaucratic nightmare, she said, and would ``open the door to
government intrusion into teachers' lives.'' It was a dagger
``aimed right at the heart of the work CTA does for children and
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the union believed not a word of its own rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The amount the CTA budgeted for the new fiscal year if Prop 226
failed _ that is, if its political operations would continue as
usual _ was $97,394,400. The amount it planned to spend if Prop 226
passed was ... $97,394,400. A difference of nothing. Zero dollars
and zero cents. One of the most partisan unions in California
intended to spend exactly the same amount of its members'
compulsory dues whether the paycheck protection measure won or
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The two budgets differed in only one respect. The ``226 fails''
version allotted $7.1 million to its so-called Initiative Fund and
its political action committee. The ``226 passes'' budget shifted
that $7.1 million into a mysterious new line item, the Public
Policy Center. The center's purpose would be to ``engage in the
development of public policies'' _ read: politics _ and to
undertake ``organizational outreach to other interested groups with
common goals and objectives to obtain visibility and coordinated
advocacy.'' Translation: Instead of giving money directly to
Democratic candidates and left-wing campaigns, the CTA planned to
funnel its members' money to other liberal groups and let
(itals)them(unitals) make the political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a paycheck protection law ``would have resulted in no
net reduction in CTA income,'' says Antonucci, ``no increased say
for CTA members, and probably no effect on CTA political
influence.'' Had Prop 226 passed, evading it would have been as
simple as announcing that the money the union had formerly spent on
politics it was now spending on mere ``outreach.'' And for mere
outreach, it wouldn't have had to ask anyone's permission.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the new law wouldn't have changed a thing. Union
leaders in California, as in other states where paycheck protection
has been enacted, would not have shut down their political
operations and gone quietly into that good night. With a little
tapdancing here, a bit of ragtime there, they would have continued
pumping money into the coffers of their left-wing allies _ with or
without the approval of the workers from whom the money was
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Real(unitals) paycheck protection is not about politics
and permission slips. It's about ending compulsory unionism in the
first place. Employees who wish to join unions should always be
free to do so, but no one should have to tithe to a union _ or any
other organization _ as a condition of keeping his job. Extortion
is a crime when an individual does it. It should be just as illegal
at the hands of a union.

MEMORIES OF `CHARLIE' ON THE MTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL A. GRECH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Jacqueline Steiner heard of the death last week of
Walter A. O'Brien Jr., a long-forgotten Boston mayoral contender in
1949, her thoughts moved, once again, to a song about a man riding
the subway without enough money to get off.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's campaign, which finished last in a field of five, had
one enduring feature. It was O'Brien's objection to a change in T
fares that required an extra nickel to leave the subway, which
inspired Boston's legendary ditty, ``Charlie on the MTA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am continually amazed that people _ it doesn't matter where
they're from _ still know the song, which we wrote all those long
years ago,'' said Steiner, now 79, who co-wrote the song with Bess
Lomax Hawes for O'Brien's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, a union supporter and well-known liberal politician,
ran a campaign that championed the working man hurt when commuters
were forced to pay five cents more if they used surface
transportation after getting off the Metropolitan Transit
Authority, now the MBTA.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford radio or television advertising, O'Brien asked
the group to compose campaign songs, which were played by sound
trucks that were driven through Boston neighborhoods. ``Charlie on
the MTA'' was adapted from the melody of ``the Wreck of Old '97,''
about a train crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrote seven songs for Wally in that election, and `Charlie
on the MTA' was one of them,'' said Sam Berman, 75, who was part of
a group that sang the song during the campaign. ``In those days,
political campaigns culminated at a delicatessen in Dorchester, and
different campaigns used to try and drown each other out with their
sound trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie, of course, was the luckless subway rider who paid his
only dime to board the MTA but, because he lacked another nickel,
could never get off again. Steiner says the best-known lyrics were
written by Hawes:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square Station
</P>
<P>
   Every day at quarter past two
</P>
<P>
   And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
</P>
<P>
   As the train comes rumblin' through.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People all the time ask me why Charlie's wife gives him a
sandwich and not the five cents he needs to get off the train,''
Steiner said, laughing. ``There is a paradox there, naturally. That
is part of the marvelous humor of the verse _ you are left with an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   During the election, Steiner met with a group of politically
involved folk singers at Hawes' house in Cambridge to sing
traditional American folk music and, for fun, to adapt folk songs
to topical events of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, who was one of the folk singers, says the idea for the
song started as a joke between him and his younger brother, Arnold,
now 73. The song was popularized nationally by the Kingston Trio in
the 1950s, but O'Brien's first name was changed to George to avoid
its being associated with the Progressive Party, of which O'Brien
was a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Progressive Party at the time was very liberal and Walter
was regarded as a red,'' explained Steiner. ``The '50s were a very,
very bad time for any view that was not orthodox, and Walter began
getting hate mail until the decision was made to change his name at
the end of the song.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien was the only liberal candidate in one of Boston's most
famous mayoral elections, which James Michael Curley lost to John
Hynes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1949 election was one of the three biggest in Boston and
all of the media attention was trained on Curley and Hynes,'' said
historian Charles Bahne. ``O'Brien was a union man and no one
really paid attention to him. In the 1950s he was denounced as a
communist by Massachusetts' version of House UnAmerican Committee.
They hauled him in and he refused to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   A World War II veteran, O'Brien lost the 1948 race for the 10th
Congressional District and then the 1949 mayoral race. In 1957,
O'Brien returned to Maine, his native state, became a high school
librarian and ran a used book store with his wife, Laura Manchester
O'Brien, whom he married in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he died at age 83 at his home in Cundy's Harbor,
Maine, O'Brien was a footnote in Boston's colorful political
history. Charlie, however, took up a whole chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrote the song because we believed in Walter O'Brien,''
said Steiner. ``He was a warm-hearted, generous man, a man of
principles and courage, who fought for his beliefs all of his
life.''

MARTHA PAUL'S HERBAL THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; POMFRET, Conn. _ On four acres in this rural Connecticut town,
Martha Paul, 43, has carved out a recipe for a magical kingdom. Her
ingredients are a 1780 house with a renovated kitchen, a shop set
up in a former rickety shed, and a backyard filled with herb and
flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   She never has to fight traffic. She's home for her daughter,
Saga, at the end of the school day. She's surrounded by the things
she loves. And she's doing what she most likes to do _ sharing her
knowledge of herbs in cooking, home decorating, and aromatherapy.
It's a recipe for happiness, one that feeds Paul's vision of a
nurturing lifestyle and a successful career.
</P>
<P>
   `I've created a pleasant place here for people to take classes
and look at our gardens,'' says Paul, who calls her business
Martha's Herbary. ``It's a comforting place where people can learn
a little about enhancing their lives. A lot of people come here
feeling empty because they've not set aside time for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here as an inspiration, I hope,'' says Paul, a tall,
energetic, and handsome woman with dark red hair. ``I make
everything seem easy, whether it's showing people how to cook with
phyllo dough, make a wreath, or serve a Tuscan dinner or afternoon
tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul and her husband, Richard, bought their 18th-century home
four years ago. In search of a large home on a main road, they
chose the big white house on the corner of Route 169 because this
rural road was named one of the top 10 scenic US highways by Scenic
America in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also across the street from the Vanilla Bean Cafe, a
very popular restaurant,'' says Paul. ``And there's three private
schools in town and some really great B&AMP;B's. These all draw a lot
of visitors to the area, and we are positioned to attract drive-by
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pauls moved up from Hampton, a sleepy little town ``with
great hidden houses, stone walls, and lots of small cottage
industries. But our house there was off the beaten track and my
business had outgrown the space.''
</P>
<P>
   So her husband quit his job at Charrette in New Haven, and the
couple set about opening a new Martha's Herbary here. They had
their work cut out for them. Trees obscured the house, and the yard
had long been allowed to go wild. But within six weeks the new
kitchen with its large center island was completed, a new shop was
set up out back in the former carriage shed, and 15 raised herb
beds were in place _ all by Richard's hand. He also added a
fanciful bird house fence by the driveway and cleaned up a sunken
garden that became a medicinal herb garden bordered by two existing
fish ponds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little scary when Richard joined the business because
the herbary became our sole source of income,'' says Paul,
strolling through her backyard and pointing out the hops, pink
honeysuckle, and morning glories covering tall trellises. ``But
everything's gone very well. He just took a job at CVS several
weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Stooping to pick up a potted herb, Paul sang the praises of its
texture, color, leaves, and scent. ``My interest in herbs has
always been there _ since I was a little girl,'' continues Paul,
lovingly ruffling the leaves of a lovage plant and sharing the
celery scent with a visitor. She recalled following her
grandparents around their restaurant on Long Island, where she
cultivated her passion for herbs and cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to sound strange, but I think I have an
interest from past lives. It's inside of me. I just get so excited
when I talk about herbs, plant them, and smell them. My stomach
flutters. Herbs are great because you can cook with them, they look
beautiful, and they smell wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul didn't set out to be the herb lady of Pomfret. She worked
as a food and beverage manager at hotels after graduating from the
University of Maine, where she majored in environmental science.
When she and her husband moved to the New Haven area in 1984, she
befriended a woman who ran a landscaping business and retail shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I up and left the hotel business and went to work with her,''
says Paul. ``I had no retail experience but I knew I was a good
people person, knew about gardening, and could offer her my
knowledge of herbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to the garden shop was a small antique store run by two
women; it was these three people who taught Paul that she could do
anything if she had the passion.
</P>
<P>
   And, after her daughter was born in 1988, she had a visceral
passion to stay home. She had been trying to have a child for years
and did not want to leave her baby in the care of anyone but
herself. So she began teaching a class in herbal breadmaking out of
her kitchen. These classes became so popular that she added others
_ the difference between cooking with fresh and dried herbs, how to
preserve fresh herbs for the winter, and wreath making. She also
opened a small shop in her dining room, where she sold teas and
potpourri.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just grew and grew,'' says Paul, who is a member of the
Herb Society of America. ``I started the business with about $200
and filled my first classes with friends who didn't pay just so I
could make the classes full. But I didn't have to do that for very
long. Today my mailing list has grown to 4,000 people and that's
without buying anyone else's list.''
</P>
<P>
   She now teaches about 120 classes per year but would like to cut
back and devote more time to writing her second book _ this time on
lavender. Her first book, self-published, is called ``Seasonal
Herbal Favorites.'' She'd also like to do a cable television show.
</P>
<P>
   Paul enjoys her Saturday evening Tuscan feasts, when couples
join in preparing an authenitc Tuscan meal that might include
seafood bruschetta, polenta with rosemary blood orange and fennel
salad, and roast chicken with fennel seed. Noncooks kick back and
enjoy a glass of wine, and then follow the food into the dining
room for a formal dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Paul has also instituted for-women-only weekend packages that
include two nights at a local B&AMP;B and classes in medicinal facial
steams and foot rubs. Among her course offerings are soapmaking,
lavender, kitchen herb and spice swags, and herbal cordials.
</P>
<P>
   This spring she began an eight-month herb garden apprenticeship
program. One Sunday a month from April through November,
participants are brought through the entire herb growing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start by planning and designing a garden and then get into
such things as cosmetics, edible flowers, and brewing garden tea.
It's a good life here,'' says Paul. ``I love my house, my business,
and being at home for my daughter.''

SEC ACCUSES FORMER SILICON VALLEY EXECUTIVES OF FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what may be the biggest corporate fraud case
in Silicon Valley, federal regulators are accusing the former top
executives of Media Vision Technology Inc. of fraudulent financial
reporting and insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-based Media Vision, a former multimedia maker of CD-ROMS
and sound boards, was one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street a
few years ago. But reports of fraud led to government
investigations, the resignation of several executives and
bankruptcy for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil complaint filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
San Francisco, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued former
Media Vision President and Chief Executive Paul C. Jain of
Berkeley, former vice president Steven J. Allan of Los Gatos,
former controller Robert S. Williams of Los Altos and former
director of manufacturing Wayne Nakamura of Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly the largest and most elaborate financial fraud
case in the history of Silicon Valley,'' said David Bayless, the
SEC's district administrator in San Francisco. ``We know of no
other cases where top corporate officers were involved in planning
out the fraud, carrying out the fraud and covering up the fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on whether related criminal charges
would be filed by the U.S. attorney's office, which also is
investigating the former executives.
</P>
<P>
   Allan's attorney, Darryl Rains of Morrison &AMP; Foerster in San
Francisco, said: ``Obviously, I'm sorry this is happening. The
action against Steve is unnecessary, and he is not responsible for
the problems at Media Vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the other former Media Vision executives either
declined to comment on the charges or could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC complaint, Jain and Allan ordered their
subordinates to falsify documents and inflate sales figures ``in a
scheme to defraud investors'' in the third and fourth fiscal
quarters of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The executives falsely reported that 1993 fiscal year revenue
had tripled to $241 million and profits increased six-fold to $19.9
million, according to the complaint. In reality, the company lost
$99 million in 1993 and $75 million in the first quarter of 1994,
the SEC alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The executives allegedly recorded millions of dollars in product
orders that were never shipped to customers, according to the SEC
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal securities laws designed to protect investors,
companies whose shares are publicly traded must turn in accurate
financial statements and other corporate documents to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC charged that Jain, Allan and Nakamura had sold Media
Vision stock while they were privy to ``inside information'' on the
company's financial fate, also a violation of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC complaint alleges that Jain pocketed $1.49 million from
insider trading, Allan made $825,000, and Nakamura obtained
$21,250.
</P>
<P>
   All four executives also are accused of hiding the fraud from
Media Vision's auditors, Ernst &AMP; Young, by lying and ``cooking the
books'' _ creating a second set of accounting entries.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is seeking the return of all illegal profits, civil
penalties and an order barring Jain and Allan from serving as
corporate officers or directors of any publicly traded company.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Media Vision's lightning-fast rise and fall made headlines four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's high-flying stock traded at 46 1/2 in January
1994, and the company boasted a market capitalization of $630
million.
</P>
<P>
   After the alleged fraud was discovered in the ensuing months,
the company's stock plummeted to 4~, and Media Vision went
bankrupt. The SEC estimates that investors lost more than $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1994, Media
Vision reorganized under new management and emerged two years later
under a new name, Aureal Semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, other former Media Vision executives have
settled their civil and criminal cases with the SEC and the U.S.
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   In June of 1997, Senior Vice President Michael Humphress paid a
$200,000 fine to settle fraud charges that he inflated company
revenues by shipping unordered products. And in January, Chief
Operating Officer Russell Faust paid $359,000 in penalties and
agreed to return $197,000 in profits from insider trading on Media
Vision stock, according to the SEC.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Minton is a multimillionaire who retired in 1992 at age
46. He has a wife, his third, and two bright young daughters. He
lives in an elegant town house on Beacon Hill in Boston filled with
antiques and Oriental rugs. He also owns a weekend home on several
hundred acres in Sandown, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   So why has this self-made man chosen to do battle with the
Church of Scientology instead of sitting back and enjoying his
financial success and a peaceful, family existence? And why,
especially, when he has never even been a church member?
</P>
<P>
   Because, he says, he believes in the First Amendment; has the
money to fight the church and what he calls its harassment of
critics and former church members; and because he cannot forget
being locked up at age 16 in a mental institution against his will.
</P>
<P>
   His crusade, costing $1.5 million to date, has not been without
its repercussions and has had a direct effect on his and his
family's life.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall Minton has been greeted with anti-Minton fliers
written by Scientologists and dropped on his and his neighbors'
doorsteps or pinned to trees lining the quaint streets of his
upscale urban neighborhood. He's looked out his windows to see
groups from the church picketing his house. And he's had detectives
hired by the Scientologists checking every phase of his background
both here and abroad _ and this has caused a rift between Minton
and his mother and son. But what he found most disturbing were the
anti-Minton fliers distributed while he was vacationing with his
family on the Caribbean island of St. Barts in March. After a day
at the beach, Minton returned to his car to find the church's
calling cards on his and more than a dozen other windshields.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me why I'm involved in all this when it isn't my
fight,'' says Minton during an interview. ``I was never a member of
this group but I'm involved because I believe everyone has the
right to believe what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``People (itals)don't(unitals) have the right,'' continues
Minton, his words becoming more impassioned with each sentence,
``to have their minds controlled and manipulated in the way the
Scientologists manipulate people. I'm just so incredibly shocked at
the pain Scientology can cause people. It's so obvious that
Scientology, like other groups and cults, causes a lot of
devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Scientology was founded in 1954 by L. Ron Hubbard,
a prolific science-fiction writer who died in 1986. In his
teachings, Hubbard described humans as clusters of spirits that had
been trapped in ice and banished to Earth 75 million years ago by
an intergalactic ruler. Through self-help techniques and counseling
sessions known as auditing, Scientologists believe they can live
more productive lives. But the often substantial costs of these
sessions has drawn criticism over the years and in 1967 the IRS
revoked the tax-exempt status that the church had been given in
1957. The IRS reversed that decision in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, he says, he has become the church's ``numero
uno'' target and he in turn has slowly made Scientology the focus
of his time, energy, and money. He has a growing suspicion that
church members are responsible for personal belongings that have
disappeared and other odd incidents.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders, for example, if the Scientologists are responsible
for a dead cat he found on his doorstep in New Hampshire. And he
wonders if they stole his laptop computer and address book from the
trunk of his rental car in California, where he'd gone to picket
the church's April celebration of Hubbard's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Heber C. Jentzsch, president of the Church of Scientology
International, acknowledges that the church hired detectives to
look into Minton's past, had an attorney contact him, and that
Scientologists did distribute fliers in Boston. But he denies any
church involvement in the cat and computer incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these incidents and the pressures on his family, Minton,
who made his fortune trading in the debts of Third World countries,
says he will continue his anti-Scientology efforts indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harassment began last fall after I bought a home (for
$260,000) for a couple, former Scientologists, who were being
hounded by the church in Seattle,'' says Minton, who became
interested in the church while surfing the Internet in the spring
of 1995. ``At that time, I got a phone call from a lawyer named
Elliot Abelson, a heavy-hitting attorney who works for the
Scientologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I were surprised to hear from him. I said no
because I knew he was representing the church. He then asked why
someone like me with a stable life and family and financial means
would want to get involved with the Scientologists. He clearly was
giving me a veiled warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton said he was more curious than fearful about the call and
expected to hear further from Abelson. But he did not.
</P>
<P>
   Jentzsch confirms that Abelson did call Minton because he wanted
to know why Minton ``started bankrolling individuals litigating
against the Church concerning matters in which he had no apparent
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the fliers and picketing began. The investigation into his
background started after he paid an attorney for the family of Lisa
McPherson in a wrongful death suit against the Scientologists.
McPherson died after a 17-day stay in a church-owned hotel in
Clearwater, Fla. According to published reports, church officials
say that McPherson was under 24-hour watch at the hotel during
which time she spit out food, banged violently on the walls of her
room, and hallucinated. The county medical examiner said McPherson
was deprived of water for at least her last 5 days and died of a
blood clot brought on by severe dehydration. Church officials deny
responsibility for her death.
</P>
<P>
   Kennan Dandar, the attorney for the McPhersons, says he is
preparing to sue in civil court early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the fliers that have been the most public and
vitriolic. Some of the accusations:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Minton, of ... West Cedar Street, has given $1.25
million to complete strangers to destroy a religion while his own
mother lives on Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many hate mongers, he has a history of psychiatric
problems. But a troubled past is no excuse for leading KKK-style
rallies and spreading poison on the Internet about a peaceful
religion known for its helpful literacy and drug rehabilitation
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Minton refuses to help his own son with a loan to purchase
a house, yet forked over $1.5 million to fund the members of a
known hate group in a campaign to create intolerance &AMP; hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Minton acts like a bully to anyone he can manipulate with
his money. His second wife left him rather than put up with his
brutal beatings.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first of these fliers was unsigned, succeedings ones, with
the exception of the St. Barts missive, carried the following
identifier: This is written as a public service of STAND
(Scientologists Taking Action for Non-Discrimination).

WOOD DECK VS. BRICK PATIO: IT'S UP TO YOU 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Decks vs. patios. Decisions, decisions!
</P>
<P>
   If you have neither, and have grand plans for making the back
yard an extra room for the summer, what do you choose?
</P>
<P>
   Both have their assets and debits, so you could compromise and
spend twice as much money and put in both.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, but there is still the question of which is best _
for you.
</P>
<P>
   So let's find out what is best for you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Check out a wood deck
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advantages of a wood deck:
</P>
<P>
   It is made of wood, and therefore can be raised high enough to
make it an easy walk from back door to deck. It also makes it
easier to bring dinner and other goodies to the awaiting hungry
mob.
</P>
<P>
   Railings can be added, giving the deck the feeling of an actual
room. In fact, if the deck is just a few feet off the ground,
railings are required.
</P>
<P>
   The deck can be converted to a screened porch.
</P>
<P>
   While a wood deck must be maintained (cleaned, sealed, or
stained on a regular basis) the maintenance is relatively easy.
Mildew and algae (the familiar black and green spots, respectively)
can be washed off with some ease with bleach and water.
</P>
<P>
   You have a choice of woods. If you don't like the idea of
pressure-treated wood, use cedar, fir, mahogany, or some of the new
composite wood such as Trex, or an all-vinyl floor. These
suggestions are for the floor, not the superstructure, which can be
fir or pressure-treated lumber.
</P>
<P>
   A deck floor is made of spaced boards, so there is never a
question of drainage or lack of it; there are no standing puddles
in bad weather, or waiting for a puddle to dry out after it rains.
In other words, there is little waiting needed after the rain
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantages: A wood deck is expensive, especially if you have
it done by a pro. In fact, it is relatively expensive even if you
do the work yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Although maintenance was listed as an advantage, the need for
maintenance is a disadvantage to the owner who doesn't want any
maintenance at all.
</P>
<P>
   Wood may be slippery when wet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Check out a brick patio
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, how about a brick patio? We mention brick because it is the
traditonal thing to use on a patio, which is historically set on
the ground. Other materials such as concrete pavers are useful, but
we will stick, this time, to bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages of a patio:
</P>
<P>
   Good looks. There is nothing quite like a brick patio, sidewalk,
or any other space for tradition and convenience, not to mention
good looks again.
</P>
<P>
   You can locate a patio anywhere: near the house, under a tree,
even on two levels to compensate for uneven land.
</P>
<P>
   No maintenance. Once the bricks are installed on sand or stone
dust, there is no need to keep them clean because Nature will do
that for you. As with a wood deck, mildew and/or algae can be
cleaned off a patio with bleach and water. But as with a patio, it
doesn't hurt to keep the mildew and/or algae, unless it becomes
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   A patio can be done by an amateur: you. Laying the brick is
simple, but the work itself is heavy duty.
</P>
<P>
   A patio is relatively inexpensive; brick costs about $2.50 a
square foot, with extra cost for sand or stone dust.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantages of a patio: On the ground, it is lower than the
house floor, so getting to it is not always convenient, especially
when you're loaded down with steaks or other goodies for the
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot of work to build a patio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
First, a border
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A brick patio or sidwalk must have a border to keep the bricks
from spreading all over the place. This border can be more bricks,
patio blocks, or landscape timbers, pressure-treated preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Bricks get dirty and dull outdoors, and cleaning them is
difficult. While we said there is no maintenance with a patio, some
owners would find any dirt, mildew, and/or algae intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you opt for a brick patio, brick set in a bed of sand or
stone dust, and you will do it yourself. Here are a few ideas that
can carry you through to completion.

 UNDATED: ... to completion.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your patio is in the sun, or it is sunny most of the day, it
would be a good idea to put agricultural cloth or perforated black
plastic on the bed of sand to help prevent weeds from coing up
between the bricks, but allow water to drain. If the weeds do come,
treat them with vinegar; you will be weed-free for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Such underlayments are less necessary if the patio is shaded
most or all of the day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Buy a hard brick
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buy a hard brick. City Hall Pavers, sold at quarries and brick
yards, are the standard for patios and sidwalks, and will last
indefinitely. They are 8 inches long, 3 5/8 inches wide, and 2 1/4
inches thick, and are a little uneven, which adds to their charm as
a patio or sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   You need five bricks per square foot. To figure how many bricks
you need, determine the size of the patio; say it is 100 square
feet. Multiply this figure by five and you get 500 bricks.
</P>
<P>
   To make the patio flush with the ground, excavate the desired
area to a depth of 4 1/2 to 5 inches. You need only about 2 inches
of sand or stone dust as a bed for the brick, so that plus the 2
1/4-inch thickness of the brick will bring the brick up to the
desired level.
</P>
<P>
   If tree roots and other obstacles make it difficult to excavate,
then don't; you can instead raise the patio above ground, by
spreading stone dust or sand directly on the ground: two or three
inches is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the patio is flush with the ground or raised above it,
you need a border to keep the loose bricks from walking or
spreading. Bricks in sand or stone dust are always laid dry,
without mortar.
</P>
<P>
   A good border unit is a soldier brick, the same City Hall Paver
laid on its long end. Another good unit is a concrete patio block,
16 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 2 inches thick. These can be
laid on their long or short side.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape timbers are also good as a border. Specify
pressure-treated timbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tamp that stone dust thoroughly
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set borders first, then put in the stone dust or sand, smooth it
out, and tamp it down thoroughly. Stone dust is a better material
to use because it tamps down very compactly, and brick will sit on
it for many years without sinking. If the bricks sink after a few
years, pick them up and put in a little more stone dust.
</P>
<P>
   While stone dust is good as a base, sand is better to sprinkle
between the tightly-packed bricks because it has fewer pebbles than
stone dust.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fun starts: Laying the bricks. There are several
patterns you can create from bricks, but the easiest, and the best
in the long run, is a running or common bond, in which the bricks
in the first row overlap the bricks in the second by half their
length.
</P>
<P>
   Set the bricks tightly against each other. When the job is done,
sweep sand between them. It will take quite a bit of sand to get
into the joints, but once it is in place, the bricks are held
tightly in position.
</P>
<P>
   As you set each brick, tap it with the handle of a heavy mallet,
or use a plastic- or rubber-headed mallet to position the brick at
the right level. If the brick goes too deeply, add some stone dust
under it. If the brick doesn't want to snuggle in, take a bit of
the stone dust out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Use a straight edge
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, here is the most important part: To make sure the bricks
are even with one another, put a long straight edge such as a
straight 2 x 4 on a row of bricks. If the 2 x 4 rocks a little, the
bricks in the middle are high, and should be lowered. If the 2 x 4
shows a gap under it in the middle of its span, the bricks in the
middle are low, and must be raised.
</P>
<P>
   Use the 2 x 4 as a level checker along the length of the bricks
as well as across their width.
</P>
<P>
   You can slope the patio a bit, especially where it is next to
the house foundation, to allow drainage and prevent pileup of water
along the foundation. Where the patio is not near the house, you
can make it level, because water will drain right through the
joints and stone dust and into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is simple; that is, uncomplicated, but the work is
hard. At the end of the day, you will be well aware of your
muscles, because all will be a bit sore.
</P>
<P>
   But after a good night's rest, you'll be rarin' to go to finish
the job. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   One more asset for a brick patio. You don't have to mow the
darned thing.

UNRAVELING LOVE'S TANGLED SKEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I learned how to handle conflict from my dad. It was easy. You
wrote the offender out of your life. For years at a time my
brother, my sister, and I weren't speaking to one another, but my
dad held the family record for Most Consecutive Years of Silence.
He didn't speak to his brother for 30 years. They made up in the
last few years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   My dad taught me his technique for handling conflict. I was 15
and heartbroken when my first boyfriend, who lived out of town,
wrote to criticize me for not choosing a nicer girl to fix up with
his friend. This guy wasn't ditching me. He was just complaining,
but I was hurt and my dad wanted to share with me what made him
feel better in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   He sat me down with a pen and paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write, `You are absolutely right,''' he said. ``Now go mail
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I stood at the mailbox, knowing I was saying goodbye to one of
the cutest boys I'd ever met, but the message I was sending was
crystal clear: You want to criticize me? OK, I'll admit I was
wrong. I never want to have anything to do with you again. I felt
as if I was dying as I dropped the letter in the slot. It was hard
to imagine how much more pain I'd be feeling if my dad hadn't
showed me how to protect myself so well.
</P>
<P>
   These were his rules of self-defense, whether your adversary was
an enemy or someone you loved. You hauled out your biggest guns and
fired away. You ridiculed your assailant and if she ever raised her
voice, you walked out the door. Being in the wrong was intolerable.
Loving the person who put you there was impossible. If, after all
your defensive maneuvering, you were forced to acknowledge even the
smallest act of thoughtlessness, or stupidity, or wrongdoing, you
severed the connection.
</P>
<P>
   I can't count how many friendships I abandoned as a young woman,
or how many doors I slammed behind me in the early years of my
marriage. Like my dad, I felt I had to be perfect in order to be
lovable, and if I wasn't perfect, anyone who loved me was supposed
to pretend I was or suffer the consequences. I felt such shame when
my faults were pointed out that I imagined my critics felt toward
me as I did myself, unforgiving and full of contempt. I didn't want
to reproduce my parents' marriage _ they lived apart for 18 years _
but I was on that path.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and painfully, this column, along with years of therapy,
taught me the art of conflict resolution. I'd adopted the policy of
sharing my rough drafts with whomever I wrote about and in doing
so, I could no longer simply blame the other guy. In discussing
disagreements, I got to hear the other side of the story _ what
she'd really meant, how I'd misunderstood his intent, that this was
a specific criticism not a total condemnation, how what he really
wanted was for me to see how my behavior was affecting him.
</P>
<P>
   At times I felt as if I was taking shrapnel from all sides, but
as I forced myself to remain in contact, I noticed something
utterly amazing. When I allowed family and friends to criticize me
without retribution, issues got resolved without any lingering bad
feelings. It worked so well that I too learned to say what was
bothering me before my annoyance grew out of all proportion.
</P>
<P>
   My latest collection of columns owes a lot to the folks I
practiced on, especially my brother Ken and my sister Susan. That's
why I dedicated the book to them, to thank them for their
``willingness again and again to unravel with me the tangled skein
of our love.'' They never asked to be part of my new
forthrightness, especially in print.
</P>
<P>
   My brother confesses that he dreaded the phone calls from me
that began, ``Ken, I have to tell you about something that's
bothering me,'' after what seemed to him like every family
get-together. The only thing that kept him from following my dad's
seductive example was his realization that he could no longer
follow it and sustain a relationship. He'd learned the hard way
that the resulting loneliness and lack of intimacy were far more
troubling than any possible blows to his ego.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I took another big step. After saying something
thoughtless to Susan, I summoned up my courage, called her back and
apologized before she had a chance to brood about what I'd said.
This might not be unusual in another family, but Susan marveled at
it, reminding me again how much we've been shaped by the same
forces.
</P>
<P>
   This is why it's worth the struggle to work things out with your
siblings. Sometimes they're the only ones who recognize love in
action.

</P>
<P>
   FRENCH-ART-REVIEW (Washington) _ Art exhibitions that resemble
art history seminars often do so at their peril. Full of wordy text
panels, such shows can swamp the viewer with extraneous information
or make interesting points that one would rather encounter in book
form, sitting down. But every pitfall has escapees carefully
skirting its brink. Curators are becoming increasingly skilled at
mixing and matching artworks and ancillary material to conjure up
the times, places and personalities that produced those artworks.
There are growing numbers of shows in which words and pictures
share the wall to mutually illuminating effect, so that looking and
reading become one, or close to it. A rewarding example is ``Manet,
Monet and the Gare St.-Lazare,'' a small beautiful show that moved
to the National Gallery of Art here after appearing at the Musee
d'Orsay in Paris. By Roberta Smith.

   BERSTEIN-MUSICIAN (New York) _ Whenever Leonard Bernstein had to
list his profession on some official form, like his income tax
returns, he did not write composer, conductor, pianist or any other
limiting term. He called himself a musician. He liked the word's
embracing quality and venerable history. In earlier eras, all
professional musicians were composers as well as performers, not to
mention teachers, proselytizers, organizers and whatever else it
took to keep the tradition going. Yet in evaluating Bernstein,
people still look at his accomplishments separately. By Anthony
Tommasini.

COMPETITION: TOO MUCH, TOO SOON _ TOO BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old song about some things that naturally go together _ love
and marriage, horse and carriage _ may be a little outdated, but
apply the principle to children and the competitive spirit and
you've got a basic concept of child development: You can't have one
without the other.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes, however, is one afternoon of hearing siblings
bicker with each other _ (itals)``I am too faster than
you!''(unitals) _ or driving car pool with 7-year-olds badmouthing
the soccer referee for parents to wish they could turn down the
competitive instinct.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad idea. Researchers say too much competition at too
young an age can get in the way of healthy development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much too soon can work against the child who is very good
as well as the one who isn't because it inhibits possibilities for
each, cutting off potential growth,'' says child psychologist
Richard Weinberg, director of the Institute of Child Development at
the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 7 or 8, the child who sees himself as a winner may
stubbornly refuse to try new skills or activities in which he
doesn't excel. The child who thinks she's a loser may say to
herself, ``Why bother,'' and stop trying, says Weinberg. She may
even see herself as a bad person who doesn't deserve to ``win.''
</P>
<P>
   This starts younger than we realize, although not in a toxic
way. What fuels a 14-month-old to applaud herself or a toddler to
beam when he gets to the end of the driveway on his Big Wheel
faster than his playmate is a need to control herself and her
environment. ``It's not pleasure at winning, it's pleasure at one's
competence,'' says Vonnie Colvin, an associate professor at the
University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is a preschooler's comparative stage _ ``I'm
taller/faster/smarter'' _ about winning or losing, says University
of Wisconsin developmental psychologist Leona Schauble. ``It's
about noticing differences,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   This changes at about first grade when a child internalizes our
culture's win-lose mentality and sees that a child who is best at
something is rewarded by a teacher's smile or a parent's attention.
Now ``I'm taller'' translates to ``I'm better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's at this stage that problems can begin. Five- to 7-year-olds
are still moving back and forth between parallel play, where they
play side by side without paying attention to each other, and
interactive play, where they play together. ``If your child is
mostly still engaged in parallel play and he's put in a competitive
situation that emphasizes winning, it feels uncomfortable to him,''
says Colvin, a kinesiologist.
</P>
<P>
   That means he's not having fun, which means he's not paying as
much attention as another child or putting forth as much effort.
What's more, if he's in a competitive situation like a team sport,
he won't be valued as much.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, says Colvin, ``You can be setting a kid up to
fail at 6 or 7.'' He's turned off because he doesn't have the
skills and he isn't going to develop the skills because he's on the
bench or he's labeled a slow learner. Confidence and self-esteem
can plummet and so can a child's learning curve: Research shows
that the prime age for building skills of all kinds is 3 to 9. If
the window is missed, it can be harder (but not impossible) to
recoup.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who argue that this is a harsh lesson but one
children need to learn. Life is not fair. We live in a competitive
world. Weinberg's answer is that for young children, there's time
enough for that a few years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inappropriate competition results in premature closure,'' he
says. ``It doesn't allow a child to try things on and see how they
fit. If the music teacher tells you in third grade that your voice
isn't good enough for the chorus, you might never sing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for parents, pitfalls abound, often including a
child himself. ``Some kids by temperament are highly competitive.
You can see it as early as 5,'' says Schauble.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier you intervene, the better. The trick is not to
discourage achievement but at the same time to also:
</P>
<P>
   _Value, model, and reward teamwork and cooperation;
</P>
<P>
   _Help him make realistic self-evaluations so he doesn't set
himself up to be disappointed;
</P>
<P>
   _Emphasize process, not product, effort not ability. The idea is
to have fun, to like the learning itself rather than being focused
on the A or the score.
</P>
<P>
   Schauble says parents who stress ability over effort
inadvertently defeat a child. ``If you talk about how Tom is so
smart and Jane is so athletic, the message is that you're smart or
you're not, you're a winner or you're not, and there's not much you
can do about it,'' she says. Stressing effort over ability enables
a child to handle variability in others and in himself, to be
flexible to try new things and to handle losing.
</P>
<P>
   With preschoolers, losing shouldn't be a concept they deal with
at all, says Schauble. For instance, when you play Candy Land with
a 4-year-old, let him win; with a 6-year-old, you can let the game
play its course. The younger child enjoys the interaction with you
and the fun of the action of the game, says Weinberg, but doesn't
yet understand strategies or rules or even what a game is all
about. By 6, he does. If you're faking losing, he'll know it and be
insulted, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of too much competition is usually most obvious, of
course, in organized sports.
</P>
<P>
   Schauble urges parents who enroll a child in any athletic
program to make sure not only that the level of competition is
appropriate (for children under 7, look for programs that stress
skills and drills, not winning), but also that it meshes with your
values. Both she and Weinberg advocate pulling a child under 10
from a team where a coach shows a pattern of putting inappropriate
emphasis on winning, belittling children, modeling poor
sportsmanship, or not playing children equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't act on your values, children assume you agree
with the coach,'' Schauble says. ``You don't want kids to be so
fragile they can't handle disappointment, but you don't want them
throwing down the bat and cursing the ump, either.''
</P>
<P>
   There is perhaps no better example of how all this gets put into
action than the Massachusetts Youth Soccer Association. Hoping to
counter inappropriate attention on winning, MYSA changed its
tournament policy last year for children under 10.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy didn't eliminate scorekeeping as was widely
reported inaccurately in the media, including in this newspaper,
but it did eliminate the elimination process. Head coach Dean
Conway says under the new regulations, losing teams play as many
games as winning teams. At the end of a weekend's play, there is no
single, overall tournament winner.
</P>
<P>
   The change became necessary, he says, because too much emphasis
on winning hurts kids. ``You'd have a coach always playing a child
in the same position instead of giving him a chance to try
something new, and you'd have kids practicing one or two skills
rather than many. Some kids would get played all the time, others
hardly at all.'' Perhaps most detrimental, he says, is when kids
``play for the coach instead of for themselves. They don't exercise
their own creativity, just do what he tells them. That isn't fun
for kids under 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway says the question coaches ask him most frequently is how
to get 6- and 7-year-olds not to bunch up around the ball. ``I tell
them, here's the way little kids think: `Wherever the ball is,
that's where I want to be.' They can't help it. You have to accept
this about them and work with it.''
</P>

   Conway understands that kids and competition go together all
right, but his answer has nothing to do with sports strategy and
everything to do with child development.

 &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _With children under 7, point out that winning is often a matter
of luck. If they think winning always depends on skill, they may
connect their loss to incompetence. Avoid talking about The Winner
or The Loser. Say instead, ``You're the one who won this time and I
lost. Next time it may be different.''
</P>
<P>
   _One way a young child works out handling losing is to play
games with an imaginary friend who loses and whom he consoles.
</P>
<P>
   _When children are in the stage where everything is about
winning, sprinkle your conversation with comments like: ``What's
important to me isn't that you get the highest grade but that you
understand the material/that you do better than before.''
</P>
<P>
   _Help a child who doesn't see herself as a winner note her
progress: ``You couldn't do that six months ago. Now you can!''
</P>
<P>
   _Don't push your child under 10 ahead of her age level in
organized sports even if ability warrants it. The level of
competition will be more than she can cope with developmentally.
</P>
<P>
   _Activities oriented to performance rather than winning _
gymnastics, dance, karate _ are better for children under 7.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Almost every two hours, a teen in the United
States kills him or herself, according to the Brown University
Child and Adolescent Behavior Letter. There are 90,000 documented
suicide attempts among teens each year.

DUQUETTE'S DEALS STOCK SOX WITH PLAYOFF-CALIBER TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As the man who has taken withering criticism for Red Sox
failures in the previous two seasons, it would be understandable if
general manager Dan Duquette pointed to the unexpected success of
his '98 team as personal vindication.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps because the season is only at its midpoint and this
is a team for whom late-summer collapses are legendary, Duquette
isn't playing that card.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway, even though the native of Dalton has fashioned
a ballclub that has received remarkable contributions from players
developed within the Red Sox system, like shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra and second baseman Lou Merloni, players that other
clubs had little interest in keeping, like outfielders Troy O'Leary
and Darren Lewis, and players, like pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who
have defied the medical odds and made triumphant comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've delivered exactly what we said we were going to
deliver,'' Duquette said in a recent interview from his private
booth above Fenway Park, the one in which he has hung pictures of
two of his personal favorites, Ted Williams and Bruce Springsteen,
and where he was watching the Red Sox play with his two young sons,
Daniel and Dana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always some bumps in the road,'' he said, ``but our
program was always in place. This is an organizational
accomplishment. We know that it takes a complete ballclub, a
complete team effort. And we also know you need top quality
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also an organizational effort. It's the
accomplishment of a lot of people. A lot of blood, sweat, toil, and
tears went into building this ballclub, and we're hopeful of
keeping it together in the next couple of years. We have a
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, 40, is in his fifth season as Red Sox general manager,
hired by CEO John Harrington on Jan. 27, 1994. Only three players
remain from his first Red Sox team _ first baseman Mo Vaughn, third
baseman John Valentin and Tim Naehring, who has been unable to play
since a year ago last June because of reconstructive surgery on his
right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won the American League East Division title in
Duquette's second year, 1995, when they were eliminated in three
straight games by the Cleveland Indians, who went on to win the
American League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   After a third-place finish in 1996 under manager Kevin Kennedy,
who was fired after the season and a fourth-place finish under Jimy
Williams, the Red Sox enter the second half of the season with an
excellent chance of returning to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Their record of 52-33 at the All-Star break is second in the
American League only to the East Division-leading New York Yankees,
who with a record of 61-20 are on a pace to win more games than any
team in baseball history. If the playoffs were to begin tomorrow,
the Red Sox would qualify as a wild-card entry.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years after winning their last World Series, Duquette was
optimistic when asked about the team's chances of winning another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' he said. ``We've got a good group of core
players, we have some outstanding pitchers and we believe we can
play with the other top teams in the league. We've shown we can
play with the top teams in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an excellent record against the top teams in both
leagues, so time will tell. But we've got ourselves in position to
contend for a title. We believe we can compete with the Yankees in
a short series. Saberhagen beat them, (Pedro) Martinez beat them,
(Tim) Wakefield beat them, and (Tom) Gordon pitched effectively
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, Duquette was criticized for his failure
to keep future Hall of Famer Roger Clemens, who signed as a free
agent with the Toronto Blue Jays, compounded by his inability to
find a suitable replacement for Clemens as ace of the pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   He also was ridiculed for maintaining a revolving door of fringe
talent, players like Rudy Pemberton and Shane Mack, Rick Trlicek
and Toby Borland, while seemingly overselling, and overpaying for,
major question marks like Robinson Checo, a pitcher from the
Dominican Republic whose only previous success had come in Japan,
and Steve Avery, whose years of brilliance with the Atlanta Braves
had long since faded, even though he was only 26 when Duquette
signed him.
</P>
<P>
   Last offseason, however, Duquette engineered a trade for
Martinez, voted the best pitcher in the National League last
season, with the Montreal Expos, who were courted by many other
teams but preferred Duquette's offer of pitching prospect Carl
Pavano, a product of the Red Sox minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a good farm system to be able to make trades
like that,'' said Duquette, who was acquiring Martinez for the
second time, having traded for the Dominican-born pitcher when
Duquette was GM of the Expos and Martinez was pitching for the
Dodgers. ``In Montreal, we developed Delino DeShields and traded
him for Martinez. In Boston, we developed Carl Pavano.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't develop a Carl Pavano, you're not in position to
trade for Pedro Martinez. And Martinez is a true ace. He's shown
great leadership and results.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm system also has produced Garciaparra, on whom 11 other
teams passed in the 1994 draft before Boston took him with the 12th
pick of the first round. Garciaparra was the American League's
Rookie of the Year last season, signed a long-term deal that could
keep him with the Red Sox for seven years, and despite missing 16
games with a separated right shoulder, his production is even
better than a year ago.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... a year ago.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Last year he went by all our great players _ Williams, Yaz,
Jim Rice _ in his rookie year,'' Duquette said. ``He had the best
(rookie) year of any ballplayer this team has ever had, and he's
improved on it this year. He's a real special player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're starting to see some hope in the farm system. This
dynamic kid Garciaparra. Scott Hatteberg, Lou Merloni came through
the farm system. Soon, you'll see a group of players. It takes
about five to seven years. We're coming along pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette doesn't dispute that some of the fringe players he
acquired last season did not help the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are going to work out, some aren't,'' he said. ``If they
don't work out, move on to the next piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of center fielders Lewis, who cost a pittance
($500,000) by today's free agent standards, and Damon Buford, who
came with Jim Leyritz in a trade from Texas for pitcher Aaron Sele,
has had a profound impact on the team's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran utilityman Mike Benjamin, re-signed last winter to his
second season with the Red Sox after beginning last year with
Pawtucket, has been an invaluable contributor, filling in at
shortstop when Garciaparra was injured, playing second when
newcomer Mark Lemke sustained a career-threatening cvoncussion,
even replacing Mo Vaughn when the first baseman strained his right
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duquette acknowledges that it's a struggle to put all the
pieces together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to get the proper balance between
pitching, defense, hitting, and team chemistry,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   An industrywide shortage of pitching has caused Duquette to sign
pitchers considered to be major medical risks, including Butch
Henry, who missed nearly two years after elbow reconstruction
surgery and is out this year after tearing the anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee, and Saberhagen, who missed almost two
full seasons after radical surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, offered only $250,000 to re-sign with his former
team, the Colorado Rockies, accepted a make-good deal a year ago
with the Red Sox that paid him just over $1 million, and came back
this season for roughly the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 wins, Saberhagen has a chance to be the league's
comeback player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be resourceful, because good pitching is so
difficult to come by,'' said Duquette, who last March also signed a
22-year-old Korean pitcher, Jin Ho Cho, who made an impressive
debut with the Red Sox last Saturday and will make his second start
Sunday in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the advancement in medicine and technology has been so
significant the last couple of years, we've seen a number of
veteran pitchers come back and pitch effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Duquette received a three-year contract extension
that takes him through the 2000 season. Also receiving an extension
through the '99 season was manager Williams, who hadn't managed
since being fired by Toronto during the 1989 season and upon his
hiring by the Red Sox was widely viewed as an inferior candidate to
some of the big names Duquette had interviewed, like Jim Leyland,
manager of the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy Williams has used his entire roster this year,'' Duquette
said. ``He's gotten them involved. He's created a sense of team by
employing players in situations in which they can succeed. He has
an excellent work ethic, and he's very effectively managed the
pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real determined, professional atmosphere around the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's success will not shield Duquette from further
criticism. He remains unusually secretive for a baseball general
manager, and openly admits his suspicion of the media, whose needs,
he says, are opposed to the goals of the team. Some of his fellow
general managers have also expressed frustration at his limited
access; unlike most of them, Duquette rarely travels with the major
league team.
</P>
<P>
   And still looming is the possible departure of star slugger
Vaughn, with whom Duquette has had a frequently contentious
relationship. Vaughn, whose agents rejected the club's latest
contract offer in Denver Tuesday, could leave as a free agent after
the season, in a painful duplication of Clemens's exit in December
1996. Clemens blames Duquette for his leaving and has predicted
that he will drive Vaughn away, too.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Duquette does not convey the sense that he considers
it a matter of highest priority that Vaughn be re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made efforts in the past to sign him,'' Duquette said.
``During the season we're going to put our focus on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a solid season. He's done a nice job. He's played
very well defensively and he can hit, and hit with power.''
</P>
<P>
   Complimentary words, to be sure, but ones that fall short of
describing Vaughn the way many inside and out of the organization
do, as the team's franchise player and one the Red Sox can ill
afford to lose. Even Martinez has publicly stated that Vaughn is
the most important member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Duquette retained the confidence of Harrington after Clemens
left, and he probably will weather whatever fallout should come if
Vaughn leaves, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody once asked me when I got in baseball, `Are you
evaluated on your job?''' Duquette said. ``I said, `Yeah, every
day. You just pick up the newspaper and look at the box score.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an evaluation every day. But do enough things right

AMERICAN VOLUNTEERS TRY TO ENSURE PEACE IN RESTIVE NORTHERN
IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Albany Times Union

<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Dorothy Bukantz is spending much
of her time in the Dump. No barbed wire surrounds the Dump, a
simple grassy field that separates Catholic and Protestant
neighborhoods in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   No troops patrol the Dump's perimeters, like they do at other
blockades and checkpoints around the city. So it's up to Bukantz,
equipped only with her yellow ``Official Observer'' vest, to guard
against violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a real outbreak here, this vest is it,'' Bukantz
said Wednesday as she stood a half-mile from where protesters
hurled threats and snide remarks at one another across barricades
set up at the Drumcree church.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my real job here is to witness, not to prevent. But I am a
little worried,'' said the 46-year-old woman who splits her time
between her home in the New York borough of Queens and her
volunteer job at the Peace Pagoda in Grafton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   With a name like Bukantz, she joked, one can easily assume she
is not Irish. But she also is neither Protestant nor Catholic. She
simply believes in basic human rights, she said. And that is why
she is spending her yearly vacation here.
</P>
<P>
   Bukantz is one of 80 people in Northern Ireland this week as
part of the International Observer Delegation, a group of
volunteers from around the globe acting as a sort of social
watchdog over the Northern Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of the delegation is from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Flynn, who worked at the New York City Legislative
Office in Albany until four months ago, is here. She and the other
observers all came to make sure that all sides _ Protestants and
Catholics, those loyal to the British crown and those favoring
union with the Republic of Ireland _ are treated equitably by
political leaders and police forces as the standoff at Drumcree
church in Portadown and riots in Belfast and other Northern Ireland
cities continued.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent peace efforts brokered by the British and Irish
governments in Northern Ireland, the tensions persist. The promise
created by a recent vote in favor of peace faded in recent days
because of Protestant-led marches.
</P>
<P>
   The observer delegation is keeping a strict eye on the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force. More than 90
percent of the force is Protestant, and delegation officials
believe the police in the past turned a blind eye to attacks on
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said co-organizer Scott Dougherty, no one has yet
been arrested in 10 recent arsons at Catholic churches in Northern
Ireland. But an attack on an Orange hall _ a meeting place for the
Protestant and loyalist Orange Order _ yielded an arrest within two
hours, Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   While the observer group aims to ensure equal treatment for all
citizens, it admittedly sympathizes with the nationalist cause,
Dougherty said. For example, while observers patrol Catholic
neighborhoods and buffer zones, they do not cross the RUC
barricades very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't feel safe over there. I'd feel threatened,'' said
Dougherty, who runs Peace Watch Ireland out of his Boston office.
``Some of our observers were told by loyalists that they'd have
their throats cut and bodies thrown in the River Bann.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyalists say the observers create more tension than they quell.
``It has been clear that they're on the nationalist side,'' said
Gareth Watson, the chief marshal of the Drumcree parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously don't take into consideration the needs of a
widow with two or three children whose husband has been murdered in
cold blood by the IRA (Irish Republican Army). They don't consider
the needs of the business owner who has had his shop blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the delegation is aware of horror stories caused by the
loyalist faction as well. And though the group has no power to
enforce policy, they have no problem standing up to the RUC.
</P>
<P>
   The police force is supposed to make sure that Catholic homes
surrounding the Dump are protected from gasoline-bomb throwers and
hecklers outside their gate. But walkways in front of those homes
go largely unnoticed by the officials responsible for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entryway is wide open,'' said Flynn, pointing to a home
behind agate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone could get in here. Why isn't it being guarded? That's
the question,'' she said.

   FILM-PASSION (Undated) The thing you need to know right up front
about the film version of Balzac's novella, ``A Passion in the
Desert,'' is the ``passion'' of the title is not between man and
woman, or man and man, or woman and woman. It's between a man and a
leopard.

   FILM-SOLDIERS (Undated) There's nothing in ``Small Soldiers''
that Joe Dante hasn't done before, most notably in ``Gremlins,''
but Dante's so good at what he does that this is unexpectedly the
summer's most delightfully inventive mainstream movie.
</P>
<P>
   By Jeff Shannon. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-MADELINE (Undated) ``Madeline'' falls short of its
admirable ambition. It's a perfectly harmless, occasionally
delightful diversion for young children, at least partially
maintaining the simple appeal of Ludwig Bemelman's books to offer a
note of courage and adventure for kids who are just discovering the
world around them. At the same time, slavish devotion to Bemelman's
``Madeline'' books _ four out of six have been combined into a
marginal plot _ is what turns the film into a rather tame and
inconsequential slice of family entertainment.

<P>
   FILM-FOOL (Undated) Gone is the smug, dissatisfied Hal Hartley.
Sure, that rat-a-tat, Mamet-esque elliptical dialogue is still
there, but ``Henry Fool'' marks a turning point in the director's
career and technical prowess.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   FILM-LET$HAL (Undated) Riggs and Murtaugh may be back, but that
doesn't necessarily mean they're still bad. In fact, Martin Riggs
(Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are beginning to
feel a little, well, soft and silly, in the fourth go-round of the
popular ``Lethal Weapon'' series.

   GLACIER-PARK (Glacier National Park) If you do the math, Glacier
National Park played host to 1.7 visitors per acre last year. And
few of those visitors to the million-acre park in northwestern
Montana likely came away disappointed. Created in 1910, Glacier is
an American treasure. The $10-per-vehicle entry charge, good for
seven days, has to be one of the best entertainment tickets in the

`A PASSION IN THE DESERT' IS A CONSTANT TREAT FOR THE EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thing you need to know right up front about the film version
of Balzac's novella, ``A Passion in the Desert,'' is the
``passion'' of the title is not between man and woman, or man and
man, or woman and woman. It's between a man and a leopard.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, this relationship is ultimately not all that
passionate, and the movie is not much more than a vignette. But
it's completely absorbing, its wild animal footage is thrilling and
its exotic desert locations are a constant treat for the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in 1789 Egypt. The man is Augustin Robert (Ben
Daniels), a young officer of Napoleon's invading army whose company
has wandered further than intended into the Libyan Desert in
pursuit of the opposing Mamalukes, and is frantically trying to
return to the Nile.
</P>
<P>
   After a Mamaluke ambush, he and an elderly artist (Michel
Piccoli) _ who has tagged along to document the wonders of Egyptian
antiquity for the Emperor _ get further cut off from the main body
of the company, and are soon wandering helplessly in circles.
</P>
<P>
   When the artist goes bonkers, the near-dead Augustin leaves him
and wanders into the ruins of an ancient city enclosed within a
desolate rock formation (filmed in Jordan's famed Roman ruin,
Petra) that, he soon discovers, is ruled by a stunning she-leopard.
</P>
<P>
   This leopard can be quite lethal (Augustin sees her grab one of
his Mamaluke pursuers and gobble him right up), but she seems to
take a benign interest in him, slowly approaches, shows him a
hidden source of water and even shares her kill with him.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin calls her ``Simoom,'' the Bedouin name for the wind,
and pretty soon man and cat are frolicking playfully in the sand,
and grooming each other like the closest of cat-family members.
Augustin becomes so fond of her, in fact, that a male leopard
appears, he gets insanely jealous.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of the movie is that it has nowhere to go with this
star-crossed love affair, and when Augustin starts painting himself
yellow and putting charcoal spots on his body to make himself more
attractive, the romance loses its appeal for us.
</P>
<P>
   But the leopard star is such a breathtaking sight that the film
works as a visual ode to the magnificence of nature; and the
lengthy sequence of man and cat bonding together is the most poetic
thing the movies have produced in this department since Kevin
Costner was dancing with wolves.
</P>
<P>
   First-time director/writer Lavinia Currier also makes the most
of her desert locations, which include Jordan's Wadi Rum _ the
setting of ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' This movie is no ``Lawrence,''
and not even an ``English Patient,'' but it is another haunting and
enjoyable outdoor epic in which the desert is a most prominent
character.
</P>
<P>
   Passion in the Desert. Directed, produced and written by Lavinia
Currier. Cast: Ben Daniels, Michel Piccoli, Paul Meston. Fine Line.
93 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence.
</P>

   Grade: B

`SMALL SOLDIERS' IS CLEVER AND WITTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFF SHANNON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing in ``Small Soldiers'' that Joe Dante hasn't done
before, most notably in ``Gremlins,'' but Dante's so good at what
he does that this is unexpectedly the summer's most delightfully
inventive mainstream movie.
</P>
<P>
   Dante's up to his old tricks with the latest technology, and his
creative sensibility _ he's a mischievous renegade with a
movie-buff's enthusiasm _ thrives in a project tailor-made for his
talents.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be a Dante movie without a small Rockwellian town
where suburban peace gives way to fantastical mayhem. In this case
it's idyllic Winslow Corners, Ohio, where young Alan (Gregory
Smith) runs his dad's ``Inner Child'' toy story to restore parental
trust after a spate of troublesome behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan's got two problems: He's attracted to his cute neighbor
Christy (Kirsten Dunst) who has a stuck-up jock boyfriend, and he's
just accepted a shipment of 12-inch action figures that are about
to turn his life _ and the toy store _ into a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, the Gorgonite and Commando Elite action figures
arent't just any toys. The latest cutting-edge product from the
Globotech Corp., they've been designed with X-1000 microprocessors
procured from top-secret U.S. Defense munitions technology, and
these toys don't just play _ they learn as they doggedly apply
their programming.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Chip Hazard (voice of Tommy Lee Jones), the Commando
Elite are determined to annihilate the ``Gorgonite scum,'' a band
of misfit, pacifist aliens led by Archer (Frank Langella), who
studies Earth by speeding through Alan's multimedia encyclopedia
(after which he dubs Alan ``the keeper of Encarta'').
</P>
<P>
   That's just a taste of the movie's clever wit, and for every
throwaway pun or satirical movie reference (as when Hazard surveys
a fiery battle and proclaims ``I love the smell of polyurethane in
the morning''), there's a half-dozen rib-tickling groaners to
accompany the escalating warfare. Before long, the Commandos have
built an arsenal from household hardware, forcing Alan and
Christy's parents (among them the late Phil Hartman) and the toy
designers (Jay Mohr, David Cross) to defend themselves in a
neighborhood siege. (Hartman's fans are advised to stay through the
end credits.)
</P>
<P>
   With voices supplied by the original cast of ``The Dirty
Dozen,'' the jingoistic Commandos look like steroid mutants and
grunt military jargon with enough gusto to make G.I. Joe retire in
shame, while the Gorgonites (voiced by the members of ``Spinal
Tap'') could easily populate one of Tim Burton's nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy of Stan Winston's animatronics and computer-generated
antics from ILM, they're all given distinct personalities and time
in the spotlight, including the single-eyed ``Ocula'' and a critter
that resembles a cross between Robin Williams and the Tazmanian
Devil. Not since ``Toy Story'' (to which this movie owes great
debt) has there been this much giddy inspiration in one movie, and
although the plot gradually resorts to ``implausible'' extremes
(hey, even fantasy has rules), there's never a dull moment as chaos
erupts.
</P>
<P>
   Dante (who always finds a role for his favorite character actor,
Dick Miller) handles it all with consummate flair, and the script
includes such inspired military strategy as the use of Spice Girls
music as a Waco-like method of psychological warfare. Composer
Jerry Goldsmith even gets to riff on his own ``Patton'' theme, and
as always Dante adds some creepy underpinnings to the notion of
reckless greed and cynical marketing ... not to mention a platoon
of freaky Barbie-like dolls turned into the buxom brides of
Frankenstein.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem: Since the Gorgonites and Commandos are
ready-made for real-life toy stores, how will parents explain their
low-tech inability to perform like the real thing?
</P>
<P>
   Small Soldiers. Directed by Joe Dante. Screenplay by Gavin
Scott, Adam Rifkin, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio. Cast: Gregory Smith,
Kirsten Dunst, Jay Mohr, Phil Hartman, Kevin Dunn, David Cross,
Denis Leary. Universal/DreamWorks. 109 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
some bizarre violence involving toys.

`MADELINE' IS PRETTY TAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFF SHANNON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening credits of ``Madeline'' are accompanied by vivid
recreations of illustrations from the world-famous children's books
created by Ludwig Bemelmans, upon which the movie is based.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful Parisian scenes include moving figures of Madeline
and her schoolmates, bobbing along like paper cutouts created in an
animation workshop for children. Along with music by veteran French
composer Michel Legrand, these charming backgrounds set a promising
tone, suggesting the filmmakers have found a perfect way to
translate Bemelmans' books to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the French title ``Fin'' announces the conclusion of
this youthful Parisian adventure, it's pretty obvious that
``Madeline'' falls short of its admirable ambition. It's a
perfectly harmless, occasionally delightful diversion for young
children, at least partially maintaining the simple appeal of
Bemelmans' books to offer a note of courage and adventure for kids
who are just discovering the world around them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, slavish devotion to Bemelmans' ``Madeline''
books _ four out of six have been combined into a marginal plot _
is what turns the film into a rather tame and inconsequential slice
of family entertainment. Its charms are more subtle and infused
with an offbeat European sensibility, but because Bemelmans' books
were deliberately constructed as instructional vignettes, the film
can't entirely break free of its own episodic structure. Highlights
remain isolated in a familiar and lightweight storyline.
</P>
<P>
   When it works, it works quite well. Her role is rather starchy
and dull, but Frances McDormand is wonderfully understated as Miss
Clavel, the nun who runs the Parisian girl's school where Madeline
(precocious newcomer Hatty Jones) lives with 11 other girls. As in
Bemelmans' books, Miss Clavel has keen instincts for knowing when
``something is not right,'' as when she bolts upright in bed and
races to find Madeline suffering a bout of acute appendicitis. (Not
long after, all the girls want appendectomy scars like Madeline's.)
</P>
<P>
   The school is going to be sold as a diplomat's estate following
the death of school patron Lady Convington (Stephan Audran in a
too-brief cameo), whose bereaved husband (Nigel Hawthorne) is too
grief-stricken to consider any other option. While incorporating
incidents from the books ``Madeline and the Bad Hat'' and
``Madeline's Rescue'' (the latter involving a valiant dog), the
minimal plot follows Madeline as she foils the school's potential
buyers with the help of Pepito (Kristian De La Osa), the
mischievous son of a neighboring Spanish ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   The movie then rushes toward a forced climax involving Pepito's
kidnapping in a Gypsy caravan, but none of these individual
episodes is woven together with satisfying continuity. Instead,
``Madeline'' consists of several smaller stories that will give
children plenty to identify with.
</P>
<P>
   Director Daisy von Scherler Mayer (who scored an indie hit with
``Party Girl'') may not have found a dynamic vehicle for Bemelmans'
creation, but she's certainly got a knack for capturing
nine-year-old girls in all their charmingly clever glory.
</P>
<P>
   With her cherubic cheeks and pixie nose, Hatty Jones leads them
all with infectious enthusiasm, and careful casting allows plenty
of amusing activity on the fringes of many scenes. Still, with so
many cute kids involved, you get the distinct impression that some
of the best performances occurred when nobody was looking.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline. Directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer. Screenplay by
Mark Levin, Jennifer Flackett. Cast: Frances McDormand, Nigel
Hawthorne, Hatty Jones, Ben Daniels, Kristian De La Osa, Stiphane
Audran. TriStar. 86 minutes. Rated PG for some very mild cartoonish
violence.

`LETHAL WEAPON 4' GTETS BY ON FAMILIAR

<P>
   Riggs and Murtaugh may be back, but that doesn't necessarily
mean they're still bad.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny
Glover) are beginning to feel a little, well, soft and silly, in
the fourth go-round of the popular ``Lethal Weapon'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 4'' ekes by on their familiar, rusty banter and
creaky camaraderie and its only real source of friction comes from
its younger co-stars, Chris Rock and Chinese action sensation Jet
Li, who makes his American film debut.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ``Lethal Weapon'' debuted in 1987, the films have
enjoyed a huge following. The unconventional cops played by Gibson
and Glover struck a chord and audiences flocked to each consecutive
sequel. The filmmakers added Joe Pesci (as the annoying sidekick,
Leo Getz) in ``Lethal Weapon 2'' and Rene Russo came onboard as
detective Lorna Cole, Riggs' love interest, in the part three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 4'' strings a slender bit of narrative between
car chases, reverberating explosions and violent,
``Bladerunner''-like fight scenes. This time around, Lorna is
pregnant, as is Murtaugh's daughter, who refuses to disclose the
identity of the dad.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs has to come to terms with his guilt over his wife's murder
and decide whether or not to marry Lorna. Leo Getz tags along in
the guise of a private investigator and comedian Rock joins the
team as junior detective Lee Butters, who has a suspiciously
intense interest in Roger and his family.
</P>
<P>
   But is jam-packing the screen with more faces necessarily
better? In this case, not always. To be fair, the movie is loud,
furiously paced and one roller coaster ride after another and the
stunts (many performed by Gibson) are certainly impressive.
</P>
<P>
   But the easy repartee that was affecting and charming in the
first installment, and the intimacy that ensued and grounded the
loose-wired Riggs and actually gave us access to these two cops'
lives, has been replaced with mean-spirited, mindless violence.
Even the pregnant Lorna gets kicked around and actress Rene Russo
virtually screams her way through a thankless role in order to be
heard over the perpetual noise.
</P>
<P>
   Director Richard Donner and writer Channing Gibson have crafted
a serviceable story about immigrant smuggling and counterfeiting
that ultimately steers the heroes to a confrontation with Wah Sing
Ku (Jet Li), a member of a discipline called the Asian Triad with
an agenda a mile long and a martial arts ability to match. But
while Jet Li is a blast to watch in motion, his villain is so
one-dimensional and singularly evil we can't relate to his dilemma
for an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Too, the story wanders all over the place and the running time
is tiresomely long, with characters introduced and killed off
relentlessly. If another chapter is in the works, hopefully the
filmmakers will recall the main thing that garnered a following in
the first place was the chemistry between Riggs and Murtaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Lethal Weapon'' interestingly gave us a focused look
at family and relationships that was exceptional for the genre. We
were given some psychological insight into Riggs and Murtaugh's
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the trend in action films demands more special
effects and less story. Here it's just one wiseguy crack after
another, so it's not all that surprising that, in ``Lethal Weapon
4,'' the most sympathetic and complicated character turns out to be
Pesci's grating Leo Getz.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4. Directed by Richard Donner. Written by Channing
Gibson. Cast: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo,
Chris Rock, Jet Li. Warner Bros. 128 minutes. Rated R for language,
violence.

FOR NATURAL SPLENDOR, MONTANA'S GLACIER IS CLEARLY THE TICKET

   If you do the math, Glacier National Park played host to 1.7
visitors per acre last year. And few of those visitors to the
million-acre park in northwestern Montana likely came away
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1910, Glacier is an American treasure. The
$10-per-vehicle entry charge, good for seven days, has to be one of
the best entertainment tickets in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The natural splendor is extraordinary. From Lake McDonald in
West Glacier across the 52-mile-long Going-to-the-Sun Highway to
St. Mary Lake at East Glacier, the park offers some of the most
interesting geology and geography in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, an International Peace Park was created when Glacier
was linked to Canada's Waterton Lakes National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy hikers and campers might try some of the backroads that
slice through less-traveled areas. North Fork Road, for example,
leads to several remote lakes and campgrounds on the west side. Be
warned, however, that the roads can be quite difficult, even worse
than some Cascade range logging roads.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers and campers throughout the park are warned not to feed
bears and other wildlife. A fed bear, goes the saying, is a dead
bear. Bear warnings are posted at all the almost 1,000 campsites,
and rangers will fine violators unless they follow posted
guidelines for food storage.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle size restrictions limit the number of motor homes,
fifth-wheel and conventional trailers in the park. This helps
reduce the congestion, making Glacier more camper-friendly than
some other parks. It's a smart policy, especially considering the
number of visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
   Late June, July and August are the busiest times at the park.
You can miss most of the crowds early to mid-June and post-Labor
Day, but be warned: A foot of snow fell in August 1992 in the
northeast portion of the park.
</P>
<P>
   From Seattle, take Interstate 90 across Washington and Idaho to
just west of Missoula, Mont., then north on Highway 93 to
Kalispell. Or you can jump on Highway 2 from I-90 at Spokane and
follow it right to the park gate.

WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE WHAT GOES ON IN `HENRY FOOL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gone is the smug, dissatisfied Hal Hartley. Sure, that
rat-a-tat, Mamet-esque elliptical dialogue is still there, but
``Henry Fool'' marks a turning point in the director's career and
technical prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Though this Faustian parable contains some surprisingly immature
gags _ they reek of Monty Python mentality and could make a
sensitive stomach queasy _ it maintains a remarkable,
multi-dimensioned depth of vision, even if it does ramble on a bit
too long.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fool (stage actor Thomas Jay Ryan) is a stranger who
barges into the life of Simon Grim (James Urbaniak), a dour, quiet
garbage man who lives in Brooklyn and supports his depressed mother
and histrionic, nymphomaniac sister, Fay (Parker Posey). Henry
takes over the basement apartment in the Grim house, armed only
with his ``lifelong achievement'' _ his memoirs and a six-pack of
Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   In due course, he will urge Simon to write down his thoughts and
to bare his soul on paper _ an act that will alter the course of
both men's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Henry will also seduce both Mom and Fay and prove to be the
catalyst that unifies the seedy, diverse neighborhood. Most of all,
he will help transform Simon from his somnambulistic trance into
the Allan Ginsberg of his day; Simon's poetic reminiscence will
become reviled and embraced as pornography and brilliance after
Henry posts it on the Internet. His epic will make a mute girl sing
and a right-wing politician scream with indignity.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the plot of ``Henry Fool'' is difficult. There is so
much happening in Hartley's abrasive, beautiful, even transcendent
movie that words can't begin to touch everything going on. Hartley
won the best screenplay prize at the recent Cannes Film Festival
and his demanding, taxing script is frustratingly exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, ``Henry Fool'' is an emperor's new clothes movie in
that it's about everything and nothing. It's about art, community,
loyalty, family, pornography, loneliness, abuse, celebrity and
responsibility _ and the story is so tenuous and fragile that it
could evaporate in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``An honest man is always in trouble,'' says Henry, and we never
know if he is a prophet, a demon or, as his name depicts, simply a
fool. We only know that his saga is a complex tale that is indeed
troubled, but also poetically honest and full of the ecstasies and
disappointments of modern urban existence.
</P>
<P>
   Every frame of the film is lovingly shot, textured and full of
significant _ if initially incidental _ symbolism. Several scenes
evoke the austere color of an Edward Hopper or George Bellows
painting, and that is an important note. Hartley frames his
desperate subjects with a raw, gritty vulnerability, sets them in
their squalid environments and creates a film full of haunting
tableaux. It's a case of life imitating _ literally _ art.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fool. Directed and written by Hal Hartley. Cast: Thomas
Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak, Parker Posey, Kevin Corrigan. Sony
Pictures Classics. 137 minutes. Rated R for sexual content,
violence, language.

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In the movie ``Armageddon,'' pieces of a
Texas-size asteroid obliterate entire cities, leaving blackened,
charred remains.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas these days, it feels a lot like the movie. A scorching
heat wave is breaking records set more than a century ago, sending
people scurrying for shade or air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with the movie, there appears to be nowhere to hide. And
the hottest part of the summer is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 70 daily temperature records were topped in 17 Texas
cities, the National Weather Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Six of those records were broken in San Antonio. Other cities
breaking heat records in June included Abilene, Amarillo, Austin,
Brownsville, College Station, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Houston and
Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past couple of months we have been running consistently
above normal,'' weather service meteorologist Jeff Orrock said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio on Monday, the temperature soared to 102,
breaking a 1996 record of 101. Although weather forecasters don't
expect temperatures here to break record highs in the next few
days, they do promise readings considerably higher than 30-year
averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say there's a big change in the forecast, but
there's not,'' forecaster Daryl Williams said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters say the ``record minimum highs'' _ a technical term
used to measure each day's lowest temperature _ also are hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``So not only do we suffer in the daytime; the nighttimes aren't
cool enough either,'' Williams said. ``The bad news is the air
conditioner is going to run all night, too.''

LETHAL-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ When Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were
cast as the suicidal cop Riggs and his family man partner Murtaugh,
they were a couple of actors with star potential. What they've done
with the ``Lethal Weapon'' series, now in its fourth and final
installment, is build a chemistry that has been the basis for their
successful run that began in 1987. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
KILLING-FILM (Los Angeles) _ The premise of Mark Weidman's first

that's exactly what happens in ``Killer Flick.'' Four wild-eyed
guys with dreams of Hollywood set off across the desert on a
killing/filming spree. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
WEAPON-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Lethal Weapon 4'' has everything
you'd want _ great action set pieces, vile villains, fresh comic
improvisation from Chris Rock, plus the palpable chemistry between
Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, still vibrant after four outings. 3
Stars. By Glenn Whipp.

SMALL-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Gremlins'' director Joe Dante is

STOMP-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Unless you've spent the last four

suggest the creative things Brits are capable of when they find a
good pair of boots. By Reed Johnson.

POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ Bay Area-based Asian pop vocal group Kai
has hit one out of the park in the first inning. Kai's self-titled

`LETHAL' COMBINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eleven years ago, Ronald Reagan was still
president, Tammy Faye Bakker smeared her mascara over husband Jim's
indiscretions, and Los Angeles motorists took out their traffic
frustrations by taking handguns out of their glove compartments.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing: Mel Gibson had poofy hair.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson wasn't a movie superstar at the time. In fact, he was
coming off a string of commercial disappointments that included
``The Bounty,'' ``The River'' and ``Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.''
His next movie, ``Lethal Weapon,'' looked iffy, too. It was a
low-budget cop movie co-starring a classically trained actor, Danny
Glover, known mostly for his stage work. Warner Bros. didn't think
it would be anything special and dumped the movie in theaters in
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just this little movie written by a 23-year-old (Shane
Black),'' says producer Joel Silver. ``Really, it was a B movie
with a couple of guys who were potential movie stars. It's funny
how it ended up changing everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Along with ``Die Hard,'' another Silver-produced movie
that came out the following year, ``Lethal Weapon'' set the
template for all the big-budget, high-octane action films that have
careened into theaters during the past decade of summers. These
movies were explosive, loud and, if done properly (which was rarely
the case), brimming with jokey banter. Story lines came as an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defy you to tell me the plot of any of the first three
`Lethal Weapon' movies,'' Silver says. ``We just put Mel and Danny
into situations and let you enjoy what happens to them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that potent chemistry between Gibson and Glover that has
kept the franchise popular with audiences. Neither actor can
explain why they work so well together. Gibson says it's probably
something best left unexamined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that I get him, and he gets me,'' Gibson says.
``We enjoy each other's company, and I think it shows on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Richard Donner, who has directed all four films: ``I don't
want to compare them to Tracy and Hepburn, because it's not the
same thing, but I don't know what duo in a lot of years has been
able to generate this kind of screen magic. They are simpatico,
giving actors, who understand and appreciate each other both on and
off the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of chemistry carrying an action movie sounds a
little quaint, a look back at the films themselves only underscores
the notion. There are no computer-generated effects, no use of
miniatures. The mayhem, the stunts, the collapsing buildings are
all real, an ethos carried over to the fourth movie as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any time for that stuff,'' Donner says of
``Lethal Weapon 4,'' which began production in January and wrapped
only 37 days ago. ``We had to keep it real. But we've always done
that. It's just that this time the time we had for post-production
was more obscene that unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   In a summer populated with falling asteroids and a tame lizard
movie, ``real'' might have some appeal. At least, that's what
Silver would like to believe.
</P>

   ``The `Lethal Weapon' movies have always been about Mel and
Danny,'' Silver says. ``We try to add new elements, but it always
come back to those characters, where they've been and how much they
mean to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, we'd like to take a look back at those characters,
as well as the demolition, the destruction and the devastation _
not to mention the shots of Mel's bare backside _ of a series that
put ``The Odd Couple'' in a squad car and actually made us care. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``LEATHAL WEAPON''
</P>
<P>
   Released: March 6, 1987
</P>
<P>
   Box office: $65 million
</P>
<P>
   Characters introduced: Suicidal detective Martin Riggs (Mel
Gibson) and his family-man partner Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover).
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys: Ex-CIA rogues turned heroin dealers led by Gen.
Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) and his sadistic head thug, Mr.
Joshua (Gary Busey), who proves his manhood by holding his hand
under a lighter flame.
</P>
<P>
   Number of stunt men: 29
</P>
<P>
   Number of people killed: 19
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the times: Lots of talk about how being an '80s man
means being sensitive and saying you're sorry _ especially after
you've plowed the wife's car through the front door of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Catch phrase: From Murtaugh: ``I'm too old for this (stuff).''
</P>
<P>
   Most incongruous moment: After Riggs endures a harrowing bout of
electric shock torture, he gets loose and proceeds to snap several
necks (including one with his ankles) and engage Mr. Joshua in a
furious (and embarrassingly ridiculous) kung-fu battle on
Murtaugh's front lawn while half the LAPD stands around and
watches.
</P>
<P>
   Quintessential L.A. moment: It's supposed to be Christmas, but
people are walking around in shorts under oppressive Southland
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Shots of Mel Gibson's butt: One. Mel rolls out of bed and looks
for a beer in the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Rating (on a scale of one to three _ Stooges): Two. Car chases,
cartoon carnage and buddy chemistry make ``Lethal Weapon'' a
surprise hit and set the stage for three sequels and countless
rip-offs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``LETHAL WEAPON 2''
</P>
<P>
   Released: July 7, 1989
</P>
<P>
   Box office: $147 million
</P>
<P>
   Characters introduced: Embezzling underworld accountant Leo Getz
(Joe Pesci), dazzling (and doomed) consulate babe Rika Van Den Haas
(Patsy Kensit)
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys: South African consulate members dealing drugs for
Krugerrands. Deliciously vile, these Aryan apartheid agents are the
best baddies (until ``4's'' Jet Li) in the series. They're also
neat: The head boss asks an underling to stand on plastic wrap in
his office before he has him shot.
</P>
<P>
   Number of stunt men: 35
</P>
<P>
   Number of people killed: 32
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the times: Murtaugh is rebuked by his kids for eating a
tuna sandwich because of the drag-fishing techniques that kill
dolphins. Bo Jackson is seen in a Nike commercial, saying,
``Another day. Another hobby. Just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Catch phrase: South African consulate ringleader constantly gets
off the hook for his criminal activity by invoking ``diplomatic
immunity.'' The last time he says this, Murtaugh shoots him in the
forehead and adds, ``Has just been revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Most incongruous moment: During a car chase in downtown Los
Angeles, Riggs hops out and nearly catches the bad guys on foot.
</P>
<P>
   Quintessential L.A. moment: During (yet another) car chase, a
criminal is decapitated by a surf board. Later, when Riggs hitches
his truck up to the South Africans' hillside home and pulls it
down, someone panics and yells, ``Earthquake!'' (Actually, an
earthquake would have been a more plausible explanation.)
</P>
<P>
   Shots of Mel Gibson's butt: One. Mel has a steamy love scene
with Kensit.
</P>
<P>
   Rating (on a scale of one to three _ Stooges): Three.
Hyperkinetic movie takes the mindless cop-film genre to its apex.
It's a downhill slide into Steven Seagal territory from here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``LETHAL WEAPON 3''
</P>
<P>
   Released: May 15, 1992
</P>
<P>
   Box office: $144 million
</P>
<P>
   Characters introduced: Riggs gets a girlfriend, detective Lorna
Cole (Rene Russo), who shares his passion for violent behavior and
the Three Stooges.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys: Nondescript renegade ex-cops who steal firearms
from a police warehouse and sell them to no-goodniks.
</P>
<P>
   Number of stunt men: 34
</P>
<P>
   Number of people killed: 17
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the times: Riggs siphons gas out of a pickup truck and
gags, ``Phooey!!! Exxon!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Catch phrase: Murtaugh and Riggs recycle the ``I'm too old for
this (stuff)'' line. Yup, they were running on creative fumes here.
</P>
<P>
   Most incongruous moment: Could it be Riggs driving a motorcycle
off an unfinished freeway overpass and surviving? Or Riggs and
Murtaugh blowing up a seven-story building and living to tell about
it? Or perhaps Lorna kick-boxing a never-ending procession of
goons? The movie plays like a nonstop Road Runner cartoon, so it's
hard to pick one scene that actually calls upon reality as a
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Quintessential L.A. moment: During a foot chase at an L.A. Kings
hockey game, the blase crowd at the Forum saves its biggest ovation
for the freak who runs onto the ice. Later, just as Riggs and
Murtaugh start to chase the bad guys down a subway tunnel, a young
cop pauses to note, ``I didn't know L.A. had subways.'' You and 8
million other people, kid.
</P>
<P>
   Shots of Mel Gibson's butt: None. But he does strip down to his
briefs to compare battle scars with Russo in a scene lifted
straight out of ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating (on a scale of one to three _ Stooges): Two. But one of
them is Shemp.

GIBSON, GLOVER PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ When we pick up the story of police detectives Riggs
and Murtaugh in ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' they're in a familiar place,
crouched behind their car dodging a hail of bullets and battling a
lunatic dressed like Robocop who is toasting downtown Long Beach
with a flamethrower.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of the flying bullets and shattering glass and
exploding police cars, Murtaugh (Danny Glover) clues Riggs (Mel
Gibson) in on a secret. He's going to be a father. Riggs, too, has
a piece of news for his partner. Murtaugh is going to be a
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the armored psychopath is using Long Beach as his
own personal bonfire, but for the moment, that doesn't really
matter. You know Riggs and Murtaugh will dispatch him soon enough
in some creative bit of savagery. But you don't want to hurry it
along because what you have on the screen, the soft-shoe interplay
between Gibson and Glover, has always been the most enjoyable
element of this venerable series. Anything else _ bad guys,
firestorms, actual plot points _ almost gets in the way.
</P>
<P>
   That the makers of ``Lethal Weapon 4'' have been able to take a
six-year break, shrug off the most inferior entry in the series and
return with such crowd-pleasing verve is a pleasant surprise in a
summer packed with films where expectations have typically exceeded
the finished product.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most sequels, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' seems less an
obligation and more a celebration of the brainless fun and playful
camaraderie that have been the hallmarks of this franchise. It has
everything you'd want _ great action set pieces, vile villains,
fresh comic improvisation from Chris Rock, plus the palpable
chemistry between Gibson and Glover, still vibrant after four
outings.
</P>
<P>
   Director Richard Donner, never one to take things too seriously,
uses an even lighter touch than usual, underplaying even the most
brutal elements. When a cop discovers a man on a rooftop who has
been choked to death, he tells Riggs, ``Get this. A pigeon ate his
eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggs' response? ``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot, such as it is, focuses on a group of Chinese thugs
involved in immigrant smuggling and counterfeiting. Donner doesn't
spend much time dwelling on backstory; the bad guys exist primarily
to give Riggs and Murtaugh something to do in between their comic
scenes. Chinese action star Jet Li does make a strong impression,
though, as the ringleader, and his martial-arts talents invigorate
the movie in much the same way that Michelle Yeoh breathed life
into the last James Bond installment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, like the Bond movies, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' deftly
incorporates small scenes with old characters and themes in a way
that's oddly satisfying. Murtaugh's house suffers more abuse. Riggs
banters with the police psychologist. Riggs and Murtaugh have their
moment in the captain's office. Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) shows up for a
couple of scenes. Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) returns as Riggs'
karate-kicking love interest, this time, carrying his baby.
Murtaugh's family is on hand, still looking like the ``Cosby'' show
upon which they were modeled.
</P>
<P>
   And, naturally, Gibson and Glover trade puns, jokes and catch
phrases like ``I'm too old for this (stuff),'' which, 11 years
after they created these characters, rings pretty true. But they
certainly haven't lost their charm, their playful sense of fun or,
as this expertly crafted movie demonstrates, their ability to
entertain. ``Lethal Weapon 4'' closes the book (literally _ stay
for the closing credits) on Riggs and Murtaugh, and they can exit
with their heads held high, having delivered the goods.

`SMALL SOLDIERS' KEEP FALLING ON ITS SWORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 0 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Small Soldiers'' plays more like a commercial
than a movie, only it fails miserably in the one area an
advertisement must succeed _ selling the product. After watching
this abysmally bad kids movie, you will want to avoid anything
remotely connected to this dull, loud, morose film.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the movie, one character shakes his head and
proclaims: ``Toys is hell.'' He couldn't have said it better.
(Well, OK, maybe he could have. English teachers, save your mail.)
``Gremlins'' director Joe Dante is responsible for this lifeless
dud, a boring recycling of that film's story about a group of angry
critters who wreak havoc until a resourceful kid saves the day.
``Small Soldiers'' has none of the satirical wit of ``Gremlins,''
however, and, even worse, none of that movie's slam-bang fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Soldiers'' begins inauspiciously with a drawn-out
segment involving a heartless head of a global conglomerate (Denis
Leary) demanding new action toys that actually can walk, talk,
think and, yes, kill. The bumbling toymakers create the soldiers,
called the Commando Elite, by using microchips designed by the
military. They create a separate series, the peace-loving
Gorgonites, to act as the Commando Elite's mortal enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The real torture (an appropriate word in every sense) begins
when a young boy, Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith), gets his hands on
an early shipment of the soldiers and decides to sell them in his
dad's toy shop while he's out of town. Bad idea. While he's home
for the night, the toys activate themselves, and the Commando Elite
moves to fulfill its primary mission _ destroying Gorgonites. In
the process, they lay waste to the quaint old shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Commando Elite look like GI Joes on steroids, with all the
aggressive behavior that those drugs would produce. They appear
lifelike all right, via some impressive animatronics and computer
work. But they're never any fun, not even with actors such as Tommy
Lee Jones and Ernest Borgnine supplying the voices.
</P>
<P>
   As one-dimensional as they are, the soldiers still come off
better than the humans in the film. Broad characterizations are the
rule here. Adults are either stupid or drunks. The kids are smart
and resourceful. It's a concept that an 8-year-old boy (the movie's
target audience) would find unbelievable. But it's not as
ridiculous as when the film's young heroine, Christy (Kirsten
Dunst), proclaims that Led Zeppelin is her favorite band. Right.
You see that every day.
</P>
<P>
   But then having your dream girl swoon over ``Stairway to
Heaven'' would certainly be a young boy's fantasy. As would seeing
your moronic parents captured by a marauding band of toy commandos.
If the movie had a trace of wit or a sense of playful fun, those
concepts could have made for some good mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you're left with sadistic scenes of the Commando Elite
binding, gagging and torturing small children, scenes where a boy
is set on fire and adults are stabbed with steak knives, scenes
where the soldiers fire nail guns for fun and shoot fireballs
through the front door.
</P>
<P>
   If all those things were not grim enough, you have the
uncomfortable prospect of watching the late Phil Hartman, who plays
one of the adults, endure wave upon wave of cruelty. It's a sad
spectacle, one of many in this deplorable movie.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Unless you've spent the last four years standing
in line to buy World Cup tickets, you know that ``STOMP!'' isn't a

   The wham-bam-bang fest (with a U.S. cast) returns to Los Angeles
Tuesday for a three-week engagement at Royce Hall on the UCLA
campus. Performances are 8 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 2 and 8

   WAITING FOR SAM: The characters in Samuel Beckett's plays often
behave like prisoners in a penal colony of their own making.
Metaphorically speaking, they're trapped in the exitless prison of
existence. Which may be why the San Quentin Drama Workshop was able
to form a long, productive relationship with the late Nobel
Prize-winning playwright, and why its productions of Beckett's
works _ some of which Beckett staged himself _ have toured
internationally, stopping at places such as London's Young Vic and
Dublin's Abbey Theatre.

<P>
   The workshop will present Beckett's ``Krapp's Last Tape'' at
8:30 tonight and Sunday at the St. Ambrose Arts Center, 1261 N.
Fairfax Ave. in West Hollywood. The production, with Beckett's own
staging, continues through Aug. 28 in repertory with ``Beckett's
Women,'' which consists of three short plays, ``Come and Go,'' ``Eh
Joe'' and ``Footfalls.'' For information and tickets, call (323)

FROM RUSCHA WITH LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When the Getty Center asked artist Ed Ruscha to
help decorate its new $1 billion home, nobody mentioned anything
about a particular theme or subject.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ruscha was at liberty to pursue many of the ideas and
motifs that have haunted his work during the past 25 years:
miracles, beams of light, windows, and the perception that what's
left unsaid or ambiguous may be far more powerful and illuminating
than what's spelled out in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   As its title semi-ironically suggests, nothing much is spelled
out in Ruscha's ``Picture Without Words,'' a monumental acrylic
painting that recently went on permanent display at the center in
Brentwood. But its spare elegance hardly means the new work is
devoid of symbolism or emotional content.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring 23 feet high, ``Picture Without Words'' shows a
rectangular beam of light serenely gushing from an overhead window
and pouring onto the floor below. Though it depicts no holy
messengers or religious iconography, the massive painting _ as tall
and majestic as a church altarpiece _ exudes an atmosphere of
spirituality and euphoria that Getty Museum director John Walsh
describes as ``pictorial rather than philosophical.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting was hoisted by forklift last November onto a wall
in the lobby of the Harold M. Williams Auditorium, a 450-seat
lecture hall where the Getty also hosts regular theater and dance
performances. It's the inspiration behind ``Ed Ruscha's Light,'' a
complementary exhibition of two dozen paintings and works on paper
exploring the theme of light in Ruscha's work. The exhibition will
be on view in the museum's West Pavilion through Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by a 750-pound aluminum frame, ``Picture Without
Words'' is a quietly ecstatic meditation on light's miraculous
ability to invest everything it touches with clarity and calm.
While obviously alluding to the way light has been represented in
Renaissance painting, medieval architecture and so on, Ruscha's
work is purged of any theological signposts. Dancing with the
natural light that streams through architect Richard Meier's
sprawling stone-and-travertine-marble campus, the painting's
tranquil incandescence speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing jeans and a blue denim jacket, Ruscha himself projects a
similar easygoing eloquence while discussing the high-profile
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might think when they see this painting that there was
a subject in mind, or rules, or limits,'' said Ruscha, who was born
in Omaha, Neb., in 1937 but has lived in Los Angeles for more than
40 years. ``They just showed me the space. They didn't say, `Make
it holy, make it loud, make it colorful.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate those sorts of commissions,'' he added wryly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, throughout its 25-year history, the Getty's reputation
has rested on Old Master paintings and Greek and Roman antiquities,
which made up the bulk of its collections at the Getty's previous
home, a faux-Roman Malibu villa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture Without Words'' is one of three major commissions for
public spaces at the Getty Center, which opened to the public last
December. The others are Robert Irwin's three-acre walk-in
``Central Garden'' and Alex Smith's ``Taste,'' a pun-happy
mixed-media installation in the Getty's indoor restaurant, which
looks out on the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, these contemporary works help establish a dialogue
with the Getty's pre-20th-century European treasures, underscoring
the tension between classical and modern, permanence and
impermanence, in Meier's designs.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Ruscha had those tensions somewhere in mind when he set
about planning ``Picture Without Words'' after receiving the
commission in December 1996. Among the works in ``Ed Ruscha's
Light'' are a series of five pastel drawings he made as studies,
with variations on the motif of light projected through a
window-like opening. Also included in the exhibition are the
results of a test Ruscha made using a spray gun to lay down thin
acrylic strips of paint in various pastel hues, which coalesce into
the single beam of ``Picture Without Words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that I have to make these steps in order to make
the progression from one thing to another,'' Ruscha explained. ``I
knew that I wanted something that was ambiguous, but timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ruscha uses ``Picture Without Words'' to expand on certain
preoccupations, the painting also marks a departure from his
previous work, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Raised a Roman Catholic in Oklahoma City, Ruscha first came to
Los Angeles to study at the Chouinard Art Institute from 1956 to
1960. After quickly developing a reputation for his prints,
paintings and collages, he became associated with the Ferus Gallery
group, whose fellow travelers included the abovementioned Irwin,
Edward Moses, Ken Price and Edward Kienholz _ formidable artists
and iconoclasts all.
</P>
<P>
   The works in ``Ed Ruscha's Light'' date back to the early 1970s,
when the bold flippancy of pop art was an obvious influence on him.
In ``Gospel'' (1972), Ruscha puts a spin on Warhol's ironic way of
using commercial brand names as if they were holy texts. In this
instance, the single word ``gospel'' (the word of God) plummets
across the canvas, while arrows fly upward along a trajectory that
may represent human spirituality and belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miracle'' (1974) is Ruscha's title design drawing for a
28-minute film he made in 1975 starring singer-actress Michelle
Phillips and artist Jim Ganzer. The movie, a sly urban fable about
an auto mechanic's unlikely redemption, expresses a secularized yet
dramatic view of the possibilities of spiritual conversion. It
hardly can be coincidental that, in the 1980s, Ruscha began turning
toward images of light cast on a dark wall or floor, as if from a
hidden camera projector.
</P>
<P>
   He takes this motif to its logical conclusion in ``The Long
Wait,'' a 1995 acrylic in which a slanting beam of light projects
the words ``The End'' in Gothic lettering. It's as if we're the
audience at some other-worldly cineplex, watching our lives flash
before our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, these images have a heightened, theatrical quality,
like a stage. Yet no angelic intermediaries appear. No divine
intervention takes place. Instead, light itself is celebrated as
the eternal agent of enlightenment and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Walsh noted, there's been a gradual winnowing
down of text in Ruscha's art, building to ``Picture Without
Words.'' After all, words don't always mean what they say, or say
what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever meaning they do possess in these jittery
pre-millennial days may be bent and twisted mercilessly in the
centuries ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain misgiving about putting words on a canvas,''
Walsh said. ``Words may mean nothing in 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ruscha doesn't consider most of the exhibition's works
``religious,'' he'll concede the strong influence of his Catholic
upbringing. Recently he was one of three artists represented in the
exhibition ``Three Catholics'' at a Manhattan gallery, along with
Andy Warhol and Robert Mapplethorpe. Ruscha executed a series of
collages depicting the stations of the cross.
</P>
<P>
   Was he ever an altar boy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an altar boy wannabe,'' Ruscha replied, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   A wannabe who's apparently decided that light, in all its
glorious emanations, is sufficient miracle for anyone.

JAMES BROWN/``Dead on the Heavy Funk (1975-83)''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest chapter in the excellent James Brown anthology series
focuses on a tough period when the Godfather of Soul was facing
assault from disco and New Wave while his empire crumbled and his
band went through changes. The surprising thing about these lost
jams is their quality. Drawing from more than a dozen albums and
rare material from the vault, nearly all the tracks on the
double-disc ``Dead on the Heavy Funk (1975-83)'' (Polydor) appear
on CD for the first time, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with
Brown's earlier triumphs. The best moments are many _ full-length
versions of the hits ``Get up Offa That Thing,'' ``Hot,''
``Bodyheat'' and ``It's Too Funky in Here''; a 12-minute remake of
``Sex Machine,'' featuring JB's leader Fred Wesley; previously
unreleased versions of ``Kiss in '77,'' ``The Spank'' and ``I
Never, Never Will Forget''; and an unedited 12-minute reading of
Brown's '80s classic ``Rapp Payback.'' This might've been the
Godfather's last hurrah, but the proof is in these grooves. 3{
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MILES DAVIS/``The Complete Birth of the Cool''
</P>
<P>
   Miles' influential ``Birth of the Cool''-era nonet aimed for
gentle tones and lush arrangements, helping usher in the West Coast
sound of the '50s. Utilizing forward-looking arrangements by Gil
Evans, Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis and others, ``The Complete Birth
of the Cool'' (Capitol) still seems strikingly fresh, probably due
to the ensemble's primary goal of retaining the immediacy of
improvised music while combining a light tonality and elements of
bebop. Along with the dozen familiar studio tracks _ ``Boplicity,''
``Darn That Dream,'' ``Israel'' and ``Deception'' among them _ this
fine package includes the short-lived band's live sessions taped in
1948 at New York's Royal Roost club, complete with the famed
Symphony Sid announcing the band. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE BEASTIE BOYS/``Hello Nasty''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing the kids.'' The Beastie Boys' manager wasn't
taking no for an answer. Dump that sample-silly conceptual
approach, he might've said, or the Beasties will end up on the same
slag heap as Dinosaur Jr. The band's answer: Run-DMC's greatest
hits. Fifteen years after the Beasties' debut 12-inch comes ``Hello
Nasty'' (Grand Royal/Capitol), the bratty trio's fond 22-track look
back at the early days of New York hip-hop. It's a generally
good-natured, densely packed affair boasting noisy, satisfying
tunes that could appeal to more than just the already converted.
Standouts here include album opener ``Super Disco Breakin','' the
radio-friendly ``Intergalactic'' and ``Three MC's and One DJ.'' 3
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARC RIBOT/``Marc Ribot y Los Cubanos Postizos''
</P>
<P>
   Ribot, one of the most inventive guitarists around, offers songs
associated with '40s and '50s Cuban big-band composer/leader
Arsenio Rodriquez, famed for his skillful playing of the six-string
guitar. On ``Marc Ribot y Los Cubanos Postizos'' (Atlantic), Ribot
and his ``fake Cubans'' retool Rodriquez's orchestra arrangements
for a raw, stripped-down combo. Often hard-swinging, the album
finds Ribot shucking off the dissonant approach he's known for in
favor of a more melodic instrumental sound. Fans of ``Buena Vista
Social Club'' should check this effort out. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JEFFERSON AIRPLANE/``Live at the Fillmore East''
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been several live albums from Jefferson
Airplane in years past, this newly released 30-year-old set just
might be the best. ``Live at the Fillmore East'' (RCA) finds the
quintessential San Francisco acid-rock band drawing material from
their first four albums: ``Jefferson Airplane Takes Off,''
``Surrealistic Pillow,'' ``After Bathing at Baxter's'' and ``Crown
of Creation.'' Everything was working well on this night, from the
distinctive folk-rock vocal harmonies to the soaring rhythm
section. Standouts: ``It's No Secret,'' ``White Rabbit,'' ``The
Other Side of This Life'' and ``Somebody to Love.'' Now, where did
we put that headband? 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEN NEILL/``Goldbug''
</P>
<P>
   As curator of an avant-garde music program at the Kitchen in New
York, programmer and keyboardist Neill helped develop a
collaborative electronic music scene there. On his second album,
the fascinating ``Goldbug'' (Antilles), Neill blurs the lines
between pop, dub and experimental music, bringing in Helmet
guitarist Page Hamilton, cellist Jane Scarpantoni and samples guru
DJ Spooky. While most of the 10 tracks are rhythm-oriented, some
pieces move from dub-reggae to ambient soundscapes to uptempo drum
'n' bass. ``Goldbug'' just may offer a glimpse of how records will
be made in the future. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WINK/``Herehear''
</P>
<P>
   Philly DJ-producer Josh Wink artfully incorporates a wide range
of '90s dance music _ house, techno, drum 'n' bass and electronic _
on his sophomore effort, ``Herehear'' (Ovum/Columbia), Wink's first
release for his own Ovum imprint. The album is mixed as a seamless
whole divided into two parts _ an impressionistic, free-floating
side that recalls ambient jazz-r&AMP;b efforts by Brian Eno and Jon
Hassell, and a beat-centric DJ-friendly side that features
high-energy tracks like ``Are You There'' and ``Ah, Git Up.'' It's
a lush, smooth production job with cameos from This Mortal Coil
diva Caroline Crawley, Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and Philly
poet Ursula Rucker. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
COWBOY JUNKIES/``Miles From Our Home''
</P>
<P>
   The Junkies continue to slowly evolve, taking their sad songs
and often making them a little better _ and certainly different. On
this, their sixth studio album, they layer vocal harmonies,
textured guitar washes and opiated sonic landscapes that reflect
producer John Leckie's Radiohead sensibilities. The fuller
arrangements on ``Miles From Our Home'' (Geffen) often work
beautifully (the title track and ``New Dawn Coming''), but
sometimes obscure the band's primary strength _ singer Margo
Timmins' haunting voice. Still, hard-core Junkies will not be
disappointed and the album's stronger pop sensibilities may win a
few new fans. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHIRLEY HORN/``I Remember Miles''
</P>
<P>
   Miles Davis loved Shirley Horn's ballad singing, and the two
worked and performed together several times before the trumpet
legend died in 1992. With ``I Remember Miles'' (Verve), she pays
tribute to Davis, singing and playing piano on nine songs long
associated with the jazz giant. Horn has done these types of albums
before, but her work here is particularly outstanding, probably
because she has been thinking about making this music for so many
years. From a haunting ``My Funny Valentine'' to a poetic rendition
of ``Blue in Green'' and the classic ``Kind of Blue,'' Horn shines
here, turning in an elegant, touching album of beautiful ballads.
3{ Stars.

PRODUCER MAKES A `KILLER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark Weidman bears no resemblance to the carload
of guys runnin' and gunnin' in his independent production ``Killer
Flick,'' but he feels their pain.
</P>
<P>
   The story _ about four outlaws with Hollywood dreams _ fulfills
the prophetic words of many a would-be filmmaker: I'd kill to make
a movie. And they do with highway-to-hell abandon and their 16mm
hand-held camera rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Weidman was in his early 30s when he discovered his passion for
filmmaking, too late to go the traditional route through film
school. So he started knocking on doors with his original material
but no credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had written a few scripts and gotten some interest in them
and was waiting around for people who had promised the money to
make them,'' Weidman says. ``Then, I realized the only way they
were going to get made was if I did it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He and brother-in-law Chip Smith have done everything they could
_ short of taking any lives _ to get this first feature film made.
They formed a production company, Smile House Productions. Weidman
quit his job teaching, wrote a script, and they cobbled together
$250,000 for a 13-day guerrilla shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up with the idea of telling the story of four
filmmakers, classic antiheroes, who will literally kill to make a
movie,'' said Weidman, who co-produced the full-length feature.
``Rome, Max, One Eye and Buzz _ four characters cynical of
Hollywood and the film industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully aware their flick has to have the necessary ingredients to
play here and overseas, the foursome loads up on the T&AMP;A, violence,
car chases, explosions and romance. They're making up the script as
they go, all the while listening to radio reports of their misdeeds
and discussing the artistic merit of ``their'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Laemmle Theatres in West Los Angeles has been showing ``Killer
Flick'' midnight Fridays and Saturdays, with crowds big enough to
extend the run a couple more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing `Killer Flick' at midnight showings, I'm hoping it
takes on a cult status,'' Weidman says. ``You get more and more out
of it each time you see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I wanted to write a film that took the traditional
disadvantages of low-budget filmmaking, and make them advantages in
my film. By making a film-within-a-film, I knew I could blame them
for the screw-ups in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``Killer Flick'' is paltry on the TNT, squealing tires
and destruction. Weidman has Smith to thank for the flames and
ammo. Unlike Weidman (who quit his day job as a teacher), Smith is
a working firefighter for the city of Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip is a born producer,'' Weidman says. ``It was his dream,
too, to make this film and start our little company (Smile House
Productions).'' Chip ran interference and kept the production
running, giving Weidman the leeway to see the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip's buddies came out and helped build a gas station near
Barstow that we built on the property of another firefighter who
heard about us and asked what he could do. Next day, the film crew
came out and blew it up,'' Weidman says with a snicker.
</P>
<P>
   SAVED BY CINEMASCOPE: It was 1948, and America was enjoying the
spoils of war: a strong economy, more leisure time and money in
people's pockets. But, for whatever reason, Americans just stopped
going to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Studios saw attendance drop by 30 million between '48 and '50,
setting off alarm bells. If not for French scientist Henri
Chretien, the free fall might have lasted who knows how long.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, Chretien had developed a lens that widened a
projected picture to two-and-a-half times its height. The
technology, which he he called Anamorphoscope, was a huge sensation
when it debuted in a travelogue titled ``This is Cinerama'' around
1950. Darryl Zanuck, the boss at 20th Century Fox, saw the reaction
and announced that all of his studio's films would be shot in the
new format, which he renamed CinemaScope. Other studios followed,
though none with Zanuck's hubris.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art remembers the ``golden
age'' of CinemaScope with an exhibition of wide-screen productions
starting tonight with a 1954 double feature of ``River of No
Return,'' with Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum, and ``Garden of
Evil,'' starring Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward and Richard Widmark.
The show starts at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Robe'' (Zanuck's first CinemaScope film and a huge hit)
and ``Beneath the 12 Mile Reef,'' both from 1953, will be screened
at 7 p.m. Saturday. Double features will be shown Fridays, Saturday
and Tuesday afternoons through Aug. 11. Saturday matinees are
reserved for family movies, starting this Saturday with ``Lady and
the Tramp'' at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets cost $6 general admission, $4 for museum members,
students with ID and AFI members. For tickets, call (213) 857-6010
or Ticketmaster (213) 480-3232.
</P>
<P>
   Psychological battle: Director David Lean's 1957 Oscar-winning
``The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' shot in CinemaScope for the wide
screen, will get special treatment July 18 at Glendale's Alex
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   A winner of seven Academy Awards including Best Picture,
``Bridge'' is the story of British POWs forced by their Japanese
captors to build a railway through the Southeast Asian jungle. The
prisoners are driven by a single-minded colonel (Alec Guinness),
who is locked in a battle of wills with his captors.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a touch of realism to the screening, patrons will enter a
mock POW compound with Japanese ``soldiers'' in authentic uniforms
as they enter the theater. World War II memorabilia will be
displayed in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Screenings are at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets cost $7 for matinee,
$8.50 for evening show, and $6 for Alex Film Society members. The
theater is at 216 N. Brand Blvd. Call (818) 754-8250 for
information.
</P>
<P>
   IN PRAISE OF WINTERS: Shelley Winters will be presented with a
Lifetime Achievement Award next month at the second annual
Hollywood Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Winters began her career on Broadway before moving to the big
screen in the 1940s. She is a two-time Oscar winner for Best
Supporting Actress, winning for ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' and ``A
Patch of Blue,'' and a four-time Academy Award nominee. She
currently appears in the independent feature ``Gideon's Web,'' and
is also a writer and acting teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The award will be presented Aug. 10 at the Beverly Hills Hilton
Hotel. Authors Carlos de Abreu and Janice Pennington founded the
Hollywood Film Festival to introduce global talent to Hollywood's
movers and shakers. Last year's event drew industry professionals,
major distributors, celebrities and 400 film submissions,
organizers say.

NEWCOMERS KAI RIDING HIGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bay Area-based Asian pop vocal group Kai has hit
one out of the park in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kai's self-titled debut disc recently reached No. 12 on
Billboard's Heatseekers chart for new and developing artists.
Meanwhile, ``Something Inside Me,'' the group's first single, is
chalking up extensive airplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't have any expectations, but we felt good about
what we had done,'' said Kai singer AC Lorenzo. ``We worked on the
record for 18 months, and we're proud of everything on it. It was
scary when it was first released.''
</P>
<P>
   The r&AMP;b-tinged Filipino-American quintet grew up on a cappella
harmony singing, performing at festivals, community fairs and
corporate events. The group's name is an abbreviated form of the
Tagalog word kaibigan, which denotes the common bond among all
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on stage with nothing but your voice, you can't
hide,'' said Kai's Errol Viray. ``A cappella is our foundation.
It's the reason we take such full advantage of harmony, which makes
us truly come together as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Until intensive recording sessions began for ``Kai'' (Geffen),
members of the group continued to hone their chops with three shows
per weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo, 22, says Kai's taste in music is as diverse as its
hometown's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is a melting pot of culture,'' he said. ``At our
high school, there was somebody from every single country. So, we
all like different types of music. Luckily, the line between genres
is blurring. I've heard Shania Twain on an r&AMP;b-pop station. It's a
good thing for people to be exposed to various kinds of music.''
</P>
<P>
   DEE DEE'S DEMONS: In the acclaimed 1996 book, ``Please Kill Me:
The Uncensored Oral History of Punk,'' Ramones bassist and
co-founder Dee Dee Ramone is portrayed as both a poignant figure
and a prime mover in New York's underground music scene.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dee Dee tells his side of the story in ``Poison Heart:
Surviving the Ramones'' (FireFly; $16.95) co-written with Veronica
Kofman. The British paperback, available at a reduced price from
amazon.com, begins as Dee Dee sits in the Chelsea Hotel, sweating
it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken a lot of drugs in this hotel, and now I'm going to
get off drugs in this hotel,'' he writes. ``I am two weeks into
withdrawal, and all the demons from my past are tormenting me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ramones fans, the now-sober Dee Dee's perspective on 15
years touring with the band is a must-read. He pulls no punches as
he admits to intense conflicts within the group and his own mental
and substance-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   ONE JUMP AT A TIME: If the jump-blues number used in the new TV
commercial for the Gap reminds you of ex-Stray Cat Brian Setzer,
you're right. Santa Monica resident Setzer's ``Jump Jive an' Wail''
is the song, and it can be found on his new album, ``The Dirty
Boogie'' (Interscope).

SNUFF OUT THE JFK SNUFF FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) A company in Orland, Ill., plans to sell copies of
Abraham Zapruder's home movie of the assassination of President
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The expected price is $19.98 for a VHS
tape and $24.98 for a digital video disc.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy one, you are a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that has anything to do with Kennedy has become a
``collectible.'' At an auction in 1996, a cigar box Milton Berle
gave to the president brought $574,500.
</P>
<P>
   Even a mass-produced copy of the Zapruder film will increase in
value. So, it's understandable that hobbyists would have an
interest it.
</P>
<P>
   If, as a memorabilia buff, you buy one, you are a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, of course, the value of the film can't be
underestimated. Taken Nov. 22, 1963, as Kennedy's motorcade cruised
into Dealey Plaza in Dallas, it's the most significant 26 seconds
of documentary film in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spend their lives studying the events of the past
might understandably consider a copy of the Zapruder film an
invaluable educational resource.
</P>
<P>
   If, as a history buff, you buy one, you are a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years ago, this single snippet of 8mm footage was added
to the National Film Registry. Congress created the registry in
1988 to celebrate American cinema and preserve our film heritage.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the Zapruder film has taken a place next to
``Casablanca,'' ``American Graffiti,'' ``The Adventures of Robin
Hood'' (Errol Flynn version), ``Cabaret,'' ``Stagecoach'' and ``The
Day the Earth Stood Still''.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurs of the cinema may justifiably consider Zapruder a
necessary addition to their video libraries.
</P>
<P>
   If, as a film buff, you buy one, you are a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Those who investigated the death of President Kennedy believed
the home movie to be the most important piece of evidence in the
case. It's been analyzed and re-analyzed for all the years since
the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Amateurs and experts have used it to prove or disprove ``the
single-bullet theory,'' ``the multiple-gunmen theory,'' and notions
of secret governmental plots and official cover-ups. To those still
hoping to shed light on the case, a copy of the film could be seen
as a necessary piece of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   If, as a conspiracy buff, you buy one, you are a pig.
</P>
<P>
   There is no exception to this rule.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1 the Zapruder film becomes public property, designated
as such by the Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board. Justice
Department lawyers are negotiating with the late dressmaker's
family over how much they'll receive for it. The parties are
millions of dollars apart, according to the family's high-powered
Washington attorney, Robert Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapruders have been very reasonable, very generous in
their dealings with the government,'' Bennett said. ``They have no
desire to exploit the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, no matter how you try to disguise it, the Zapruder
film is nothing more than a few hundred pictures of a man getting
his head blown off.
</P>
<P>
   He was a real person.
</P>
<P>
   He had real children.
</P>
<P>
   Those children are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else matters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it isn't as if you haven't seen the film. Most likely
you've seen it again and again, frame by gruesome frame. It's been
on television hundreds of times.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the person getting killed was someone you knew,
imagine if it was your dad.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a done deal. There's one thing we can do to put the
sick JFK profiteers out of business. That is:
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, inaction is action. Don't buy. Continue not
buying. Tell your friends and famly not to buy. Plot and whisper
and scheme until all of us, acting as one, fire a fatal economic
shot to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   For you conspiracy buffs, I call this the ``single-bullet
theory.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If, as a history buff, you buy one, you are a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years ago, this single snippet of 8mm footage was added
to the National Film Registry. Congress created the registry in
1988 to celebrate American cinema and preserve our film heritage.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the Zapruder film has taken a place next to
``Casablanca,'' ``American Graffiti,'' ``The Adventures of Robin
Hood'' (Errol Flynn version), ``Cabaret,'' ``Stagecoach'' and ``The
Day the Earth Stood Still''.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurs of the cinema may justifiably consider Zapruder a
necessary addition to their video libraries.
</P>
<P>
   If, as a film buff, you buy one, you are a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Those who investigated the death of President Kennedy believed
the home movie to be the most important piece of evidence in the
case. It's been analyzed and re-analyzed for all the years since
the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Amateurs and experts have used it to prove or disprove ``the
single-bullet theory,'' ``the multiple-gunmen theory,'' and notions
of secret governmental plots and official cover-ups. To those still
hoping to shed light on the case, a copy of the film could be seen
as a necessary piece of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   If, as a conspiracy buff, you buy one, you are a pig.
</P>
<P>
   There is no exception to this rule.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1 the Zapruder film becomes public property, designated
as such by the Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board. Justice
Department lawyers are negotiating with the late dressmaker's
family over how much they'll receive for it. The parties are
millions of dollars apart, according to the family's high-powered
Washington attorney, Robert Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapruders have been very reasonable, very generous in
their dealings with the government,'' Bennett said. ``They have no
desire to exploit the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, no matter how you try to disguise it, the Zapruder
film is nothing more than a few hundred pictures of a man getting
his head blown off.
</P>
<P>
   He was a real person.
</P>
<P>
   He had real children.
</P>
<P>
   Those children are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else matters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it isn't as if you haven't seen the film. Most likely
you've seen it again and again, frame by gruesome frame. It's been
on television hundreds of times.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the person getting killed was someone you knew,
imagine if it was your dad.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a done deal. There's one thing we can do to put the
sick JFK profiteers out of business. That is:
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, inaction is action. Don't buy. Continue not
buying. Tell your friends and famly not to buy. Plot and whisper
and scheme until all of us, acting as one, fire a fatal economic
shot to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   For you conspiracy buffs, I call this the ``single-bullet
theory.'' &QL;

HEALTH BENEFITS SPROUT FROM MIGHTY BEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (WITH TOFU LIST)  
 BY STEFANIE L. PEARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Ponce de Leon needed a better map.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Fountain of Youth. He should have been looking for
the (begin ital) field (endital) _ that is a field filled with
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to praise a bean, but this is one mighty bean.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that not only can it lower fat and cholesterol in
diets by pinch-hitting for numerous items heavy in animal fats, but
soy can play a preventive role in the fight against several
cancers, including breast, colon and prostate. Soy also has been
found to help soften the unpleasant symptoms of menopause.
</P>
<P>
   The key, says Patricia Greenberg, author of ``The Whole Soy
Cookbook,'' is a tiny compound in soy called genistein.
</P>
<P>
   Genistein is an isoflavone, a compound that is genetically
similar to the human hormone estrogen. It's known as a
phytoestrogen, which means that it is a plant compound similar to
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, a nutritionist who is a graduate of the Scottsdale
Culinary Institute, says soy is the closest thing to a ``perfect
food'' that nature offers.
</P>
<P>
   Soy foods differ somewhat in their concentration of isoflavones,
but all of the traditional soy foods _ tofu, soy milk, tempeh and
miso _ are rich sources of isoflavones, providing about 30 to 40
milligrams per serving.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 300 plants that are sources of
phytoestrogens, including such mundane veggies as carrots, corn,
apples, barley and oats. Soy has received the most attention
because it has a much more intense concentration of the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers long have noted that many Asian countries, which
tend to consume diets high in soy foods, have lower rates of
breast, prostate and colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Those countries' diets also tend to be lower in fat and
cholesterol and higher in fiber than Western diets. Low-fat,
high-fiber diets are linked to lower rates of cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tofu goddess Greenberg just smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Adding just 25 grams of soy protein to your daily diet taps into
genistein's protective powers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   People who consume that soy protein will be more likely to lower
their intake of other proteins that tend to be higher in fat and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's book includes dozens of recipes using soy foods and
offers sample daily menus that provide at least 25 grams of soy
protein.
</P>
<P>
   Many people know soy is great for them, but don't know how to
introduce it into their diets.
</P>
<P>
   Are they stuck eating blob after blob of tasteless tofu?
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of ways to get that soy protein into your diet,
from raw soybean pods lightly steamed to highly processed soy
protein turned into hot dogs and hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Soy meat substitutes tend to absorb the flavor of whatever
they're cooked in. By contrast, meat itself puts out distinctive
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Most palates can't necessarily tell the difference between
flavors of spices and flavors of meat. Greenberg once made a
vegetarian gumbo for a group of people who don't eat shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted they tasted the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tasting the saffron in the stock,'' she explained.
``They were tasting the flavor they were used to in the stock,
which they associated with fish.''
</P>
<P>
   This means chefs can simply marinate, season, sauce or spice
their way to a flavorful dish.
</P>
<P>
   The key is remembering that your soy product will play second
fiddle to your sauce.
</P>
<P>
   More processed products _ tofu hot dogs, for instance, or
pre-spiced soy cheese _ have less of a need to be spiced. &QL;

OAKLAND IGNORES COURT ORDER, APPROVES RULES FOR MARIJUANA USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The Oakland City Council has established
California's most permissive guidelines for the use of marijuana as
a treatment for ailments, but the city ordinance is almost certain
to be blocked by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ordinance approved Wednesday without dissent, medical
marijuana users in Oakland may hold a stash of 1 1/2 pounds _
equivalent to 30 outdoor flowering plants or 48 indoor plants _
without fear of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But what appears to be the definitive test case for California's
medical marijuana law, which voters enacted in 1996, is brewing in
the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Among the defendants is
the Cannabis Buyers Cooperative of Oakland, which helped develop
the guidelines approved by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Charles Breyer issued a preliminary injunction in
May, ordering six San Francisco Bay-area marijuana clubs to shut
down. Breyer said federal law supersedes the state law on marijuana
use.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the Oakland City Council approved its new
guidelines, the U.S. Attorney's office filed a motion asking that
U.S. marshals be authorized to close down the Oakland club as well
as others in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The government also filed motions ordering the clubs to show
cause why they should not be held in contempt of the Breyer
injunction. A hearing on the motions is scheduled on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's guidelines, developed by a committee of representing
the police, patients, physicians and Oakland's legal staff as well
as the cooperative, far exceed the limit set by state Attorney
General Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Lungren is concerned, the limit is two plants or an
ounce of marijuana which, by his calculations, is equivalent to a
30-day supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guidelines have been in effect since December 1966, and
no one _ sheriffs, police departments, DAs _ has had any problem
with them,'' Lungren spokesman Matt Ross said. As for the Oakland
guidelines, ``we hope that law enforcement will do the right thing
when stopping an individual with a pound and a half of marijuana,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jones, executive director of the 1,700-member Cannabis
Buyers Cooperative, said the council's passage of the guidelines
kept the city ``on the leading edge of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones noted that Oakland modeled its guidelines after those of
an ongoing federal experiment, the Compassionate Investigative New
Drug Program. That program rations medical marijuana users to half
a pound a month or about 10 cigarettes per day. Eight patients are
currently participating in the federal program, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are ``already being implemented by the police
department, which is working with us to make sure these medical
patients aren't being harassed,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The police ``don't want to arrest patients who are legitimately
using marijuana'' and are able to provide documentary proof that
they are, Jones said. But under the guidelines, ``somebody
possessing marijuana for sale or for personal use that's not
medical will be cited and arrested.''

JUST SAY SOY: PRODUCT LINE IS VAST, VARIED

 LIST-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (WITH TOFU)  
 By STEPHANIE L. PEARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - These food items are good sources of soy protein and
genistein, a compound that is genetically similar to the human
hormone estrogen: &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edamame
</P>
<P>
   Plain ol' soybeans. Most commonly found in Japanese restaurants,
lightly blanched or steamed and sprinkled with salt. Make them at
home in the microwave or steamed _ an excellent snack or precursor
to a main meal. These are high in protein and fiber and contain no
cholesterol. Find these fresh or frozen at Asian grocery stores and
specialty stores, such as Whole Foods.  &UR; Note: Don't eat the whole
pod. Crack it open and eat the beans. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fake meat
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ``tofuphobic'' among us can stomach a veggie
burger or two. Soy-base ``hamburgers,'' ``hot dogs,'' ``ground
beef,'' ``sausage'' and the like are probably the easiest way to
start incorporating soy into our diets. Don't assume that all
vegetarian ``meat'' is soy-based. Read the ingredients. Most are
made from soy protein, tofu and other ingredients and can be
frozen, canned or dried. There are dozens available, and their
nutritional values vary considerably, so read the labels carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Look for soy sausage, soy bacon, hamburgers and hot dogs and soy
ground beef. Beware that these products have less fat than their
animal counterparts and so may need to be cooked with non-stick
sprays and for a shorter time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Miso
</P>
<P>
   Miso soup is a rich, salty broth of fermented soybeans. Although
available powdered, miso is best sold as a paste. Add water for
soup or use as a seasoning (in a salad dressing, for instance).
Different kinds of miso have different flavors, so keep trying
until you find your favorite. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Non-dairy soy frozen dessert
</P>
<P>
   A lifesaver for the lactose-intoler ant. Made from soy milk or
soy yogurt, soy-base frozen desserts have just about all the yum of
ice cream with the benefits of soy, no cholesterol and usually less
fat. Find brands, such as Tofutti, in natural food and specialty
stores such as A.J.'s. These taste more like ice milk than ice
cream. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy cheese
</P>
<P>
   Made from soy milk, soy cheese approximates both hard and soft
cheeses. Be sure to use full-fat versions for cooking or baking,
because low-fat versions don't melt well. In baking, use a lower
oven temperature than you would with normal cheese. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy flour
</P>
<P>
   Made from roasted soybeans ground into a fine powder, soy flour
comes in three incarnations: natural or full-fat; defatted, which
has the oils removed during processing; and lecithinated, which has
had lecithin added. The defatted flour gives even more of soy's
protein kick to recipes because the protein is concentrated.
Because soy flour is gluten-free, yeast-raised breads made with soy
flour are more dense in texture. Replace a fourth to a third of the
flour with soy flour in recipes for muffins, cakes, cookies,
pancakes and quick breads. Don't try to use it alone. Also, note
that it must be refrigerated. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy grits
</P>
<P>
   Soy grits are similar to soy flour except that the soybeans have
been toasted and cracked into coarse pieces, rather than fine
powder. Soy grits can be used as a substitute for flour in some
recipes. High in protein, soy grits can be added to rice and other
grains and cooked together. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy protein concentrate
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein concentrate comes from defatted soy flakes. It
contains about 70 percent protein, while retaining most of the
bean's dietary fiber. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Isolated soy protein
</P>
<P>
   When protein is removed from defatted flakes, the result is soy
protein isolates, the most highly refined soy protein. Containing
92 percent protein, soy protein isolates possess the greatest
amount of protein of all soy products. They are a highly digestible
source of amino acids (building blocks of protein necessary for
human growth and maintenance). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Textured soy protein
</P>
<P>
   Textured soy protein, or TSP, usually refers to products made
from textured soy flour, although the term also can be applied to
textured soy protein concentrates and spun soy fiber.
</P>
<P>
   When hydrated, it has a chewy texture. It is widely used as a
meat extender. One of the more popular brands is made by Archer
Daniels Midland Co., which owns the right to the product named
Textured Vegetable Protein, or TVP.
</P>
<P>
   Textured soy flour contains about 70 percent protein and retains
most of the bean's dietary fiber. Often referred to simply as
textured soy protein, textured soy flour is sold dried in granular
and chunk style. It can be found in natural food stores and through
mail-order catalogs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Soy sauce is a dark brown liquid made from soybeans that have
undergone a fermenting process. Soy sauces have a salty taste but
are lower in sodium than traditional table salt. Specific types of
soy sauce are shoyu, tamari and teriyaki. Shoyu is a blend of
soybeans and wheat. Tamari is made only from soybeans and is a
byproduct of making miso. Teriyaki sauce can be thicker than other
types of soy sauce and includes such ingredients as sugar, vinegar
and spices. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Soy yogurt is made from soy milk. Its creamy texture makes it an
easy substitute for sour cream or cream cheese. Soy yogurt can be
found in a variety of flavors in natural foods stores. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Whole soy beans
</P>
<P>
   As soybeans mature in the pod, they ripen into a hard, dry bean.
They're a bit more firm than most other beans but can substitute
for most beans in recipes. They're an excellent source of protein
and fiber. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy beverages
</P>
<P>
   This is the liquid extracted from soybeans, which is usually
fortified with calcium and makes a great, nutty-flavor substitute
for cow's milk. It's also good for camping or keeping on hand,
because it's generally sold in aseptic containers that can keep in
your pantry for months. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy nut butter
</P>
<P>
   Made from roasted, whole soy nuts, which are then crushed and
blended with soy oil and other ingredients, soy nut butter has a
slightly nutty taste, significantly less fat than peanut butter and
provides many other nutritional benefits as well. Soy nut butter
can be found in a few supermarkets or through mail-order
companies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy nuts
</P>
<P>
   Roasted soy nuts are whole soybeans that have been soaked in
water and then baked until browned. Soy nuts can be found in a
variety of flavors, including chocolate-covered. High in protein
and isoflavones, soy nuts are similar in texture and flavor to
peanuts. You can find roasted soy nuts in natural food stores and
through mail-order catalogs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soy sprouts
</P>
<P>
   Although not as popular as mung bean or alfalfa sprouts, soy
sprouts (also called soybean sprouts), are an excellent source of
nutrition, packed with protein and vitamin C. They can be sprouted
in the same manner as other beans and seeds. Soy sprouts must be
cooked quickly at low heat so they don't get mushy. They can be
used raw in salads or soups, or in stir-fried, sauteed or baked
dishes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tempeh
</P>
<P>
   This traditional Indonesian food is a chunky, tender soybean
cake. Wholesoybeans, sometimes mixed with another grain such as
rice or millet, are fermented into a rich cake of soybeans with a
smoky or nutty flavor. Tempeh can be marinated and grilled and
added to soups, casseroles or chili. Found in Asian food stores. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tofu products
</P>
<P>
   Tofu, also known as soybean curd, is a soft cheeselike food made
by curdling fresh hot soy milk with a coagulant. Tofu is a bland
product that easily absorbs the flavors of other ingredients with
which it is cooked. Tofu is rich in high-quality protein and B
vitamins and low in sodium. Firm tofu is dense and solid and can be
cubed and served in soups, stir-fried or grilled. Firm tofu is
higher in protein, fat and calcium than other forms of tofu. Soft
tofu is good for recipes that call for blended tofu. Silken tofu is
a creamy product and can be used as a replacement for sour cream in
many dip recipes. Several types of tofu can be found in
supermarkets and natural health food stores. Tofu is also available
as a powder. &QL;

HEALTH BENEFITS SPROUT FROM MIGHTY BEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (WITH TOFU LIST)  
 BY STEFANIE L. PEARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Ponce de Leon needed a better map.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Fountain of Youth. He should have been looking for
the (begin ital) field (endital) _ that is a field filled with
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to praise a bean, but this is one mighty bean.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that not only can it lower fat and cholesterol in
diets by pinch-hitting for numerous items heavy in animal fats, but
soy can play a preventive role in the fight against several
cancers, including breast, colon and prostate. Soy also has been
found to help soften the unpleasant symptoms of menopause.
</P>
<P>
   The key, says Patricia Greenberg, author of ``The Whole Soy
Cookbook,'' is a tiny compound in soy called genistein.
</P>
<P>
   Genistein is an isoflavone, a compound that is genetically
similar to the human hormone estrogen. It's known as a
phytoestrogen, which means that it is a plant compound similar to
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, a nutritionist who is a graduate of the Scottsdale
Culinary Institute, says soy is the closest thing to a ``perfect
food'' that nature offers.
</P>
<P>
   Soy foods differ somewhat in their concentration of isoflavones,
but all of the traditional soy foods _ tofu, soy milk, tempeh and
miso _ are rich sources of isoflavones, providing about 30 to 40
milligrams per serving.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 300 plants that are sources of
phytoestrogens, including such mundane veggies as carrots, corn,
apples, barley and oats. Soy has received the most attention
because it has a much more intense concentration of the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers long have noted that many Asian countries, which
tend to consume diets high in soy foods, have lower rates of
breast, prostate and colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Those countries' diets also tend to be lower in fat and
cholesterol and higher in fiber than Western diets. Low-fat,
high-fiber diets are linked to lower rates of cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tofu goddess Greenberg just smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Adding just 25 grams of soy protein to your daily diet taps into
genistein's protective powers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   People who consume that soy protein will be more likely to lower
their intake of other proteins that tend to be higher in fat and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's book includes dozens of recipes using soy foods and
offers sample daily menus that provide at least 25 grams of soy
protein.
</P>
<P>
   Many people know soy is great for them, but don't know how to
introduce it into their diets.
</P>
<P>
   Are they stuck eating blob after blob of tasteless tofu?
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of ways to get that soy protein into your diet,
from raw soybean pods lightly steamed to highly processed soy
protein turned into hot dogs and hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Soy meat substitutes tend to absorb the flavor of whatever
they're cooked in. By contrast, meat itself puts out distinctive
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Most palates can't necessarily tell the difference between
flavors of spices and flavors of meat. Greenberg once made a
vegetarian gumbo for a group of people who don't eat shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted they tasted the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tasting the saffron in the stock,'' she explained.
``They were tasting the flavor they were used to in the stock,
which they associated with fish.''
</P>
<P>
   This means chefs can simply marinate, season, sauce or spice
their way to a flavorful dish.
</P>
<P>
   The key is remembering that your soy product will play second
fiddle to your sauce.
</P>
<P>
   More processed products _ tofu hot dogs, for instance, or
pre-spiced soy cheese _ have less of a need to be spiced. &QL;

 (WITH RETRO)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - There's more to living retro than just buying
clothes, Daddy-O. Like, for instance, what you're going to pop on
the hi-fi as you prance around your rumpus room in pedal pushers or
a poodle skirt and crinoline.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: Living retro means listening retro. So, goodbye
Pearl Jam. Hello, Pearl Bailey. Here's some backward-looking discs
that any vintage vixen would enjoy. And while these titles probably
would be best-enjoyed on vinyl, we'll cheat a little bit since it's
the digital age:  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Swing set &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Capitol Recordings'': Louis Prima, Keely Smith and Sam
Butera: It's a whopping eight-disc set, but it's also everything
that Vegas' hottest combo recorded for the Capitol label during
their heyday in the '50s. Downside: ``That Old Black Magic'' is
gonna burn a hole in your budget since this thing's price tag runs
well into triple-digit figures.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Glenn Miller: The Popular Recordings'': Sixty songs,
including ``Moonlight Serenade,`` ``Pennsylvania 6-5000'' and
``Perfidia.'' At his best, Miller was hotter than a Julie London
album cover. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Exotica_ &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The ``ExotiLLLLLLLLLof Martin Denny'': It's two discs of
Hawaiian-flavored tunes from the tiki master himself, Mr. Denny. If
the Jungle Ride is your favorite Disneyland attraction, this will
keep you amused for hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Space-Age Bachelor Pad Music,'' Esquivel: The ``Thriller''
of exotica albums, the release of this disc in 1994 marked a
small-scale revival for the wildly dissonant ramblings of the
Mexican composer and arranger. I bet Connie Francis never imagined
``Who's Sorry Now'' sounding like this.
</P>
<P>
   Easy listening &QL; 
 &QL; 
_ ``Once Upon a Time/Blue Smoke,'' Johnny Desmond: Everybody knows
about Sinatra, Bennett and Damone. But Desmond, who died in 1985,
is perhaps the one that got away. The one-time Glenn Miller singer
had a silky, masculine style, and this brilliant reissue combines
two of his classic albums onto one unforgettable disc. ``Once Upon
a Time'' features tunes he originally recorded with Miller; ``Blue
Smoke'' is a somber after-hours collection. One listen and you'll
find out why fans dubbed him the ``Creamer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It's Magic,'' ``Secret Love,'' ``Que Sera Sera,'' ``Move
Over Darling,'' Doris Day: It may sound like overkill, but the guys
at Bear Family Records have reissued (begin ital) everything
(endital) the divine Miss Day put on wax between 1947 and 1968 in
these four box sets. There's obviously some filler here, but there
are also plenty of examples of why so many people consider Day one
of the finest singers of the 20th century. On the other hand, fluff
like ``Que Sera Sera'' also will remind you why so many other
people completely dismiss her talents as a singer. &QL;

 (ART ADV. Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients)  
 By JAYE BEELER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - From her sleek, chin-length bob to the hem of her
gabardine 1940s pantsuit, Brandi Kvetko is a vision of vintage.
</P>
<P>
   She is a collector and fan of all things vintage _ items at
least 25 years old. Luckily for Kvetko, her husband, Chris
Swanberg, is a devoted player in this ``Ozzie and Harriet''
re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the couple turned their passion into a career when
they opened Go-Kat-Go, a vintage department store now in Glendale,
Ariz. The resale store has an amazing assortment of furniture,
appliances, clothes and even beauty products from the 1940s through
the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with this stuff,'' Kvetko says. ``Even when I was
little, we had vintage stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, Bo and Barb Kvetko, own Bo's Funky Stuff down the
road. They carry zany furniture and collectibles from 1890 to 1970,
such as an amoeba-shaped, pop-up bar coffee table, mechanical
oversized camel and 1960s dryer that chimes out &UR; ``How Dry I Am'' at
the end of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The subculture of vintage aficionados is distinct as an Eames
lounge chair. You (beginital) do (endital) know what that is _
right?
</P>
<P>
   These people spend most of their waking hours living in
yester-decade. They crave clothing, furniture, restaurants, lounges
and even neon signs manufactured at least two decades ago. And the
hunt for nostalgia fulfills that longing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing interesting in the '90s,'' says Amy Bowling,
26, who caught the vintage fever five years ago when she began
wearing vintage clothes exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage clothing always has been popular with teenagers, who
could scarcely afford anything else. But when swing music cruised
into nightclubs, the dance scene rocked into vintage shops.
</P>
<P>
   The lounge core movement arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of happened,'' says Bowling, who works part time at an
antiques mall and runs a booth and display case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started wearing the vintage clothes. Then I bought a piece
of furniture. I started taking dance lessons and seeing rockabilly
bands.
</P>
<P>
   oon I was hanging out with people who had hot rods.''
</P>
<P>
   She's decorating her apartment with 1960s Danish Modern
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Kvetko and Swanberg, who took the plunge into vintage years ago,
furnished their 1947 bungalow with stuff from the '40s, '50s and
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical-print wallpaper is the backdrop for a 1940s rattan
couch and rattan bar.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is a sea of turquoise, from the '60s Whirlpool
washer and dryer to the '60s General Electric stove to the salvaged
and restored kitchen counter tops. The color scheme extends to the
appliances, such as the blender, ice crusher and hand mixer, as
well as the canister set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy, but it's us,'' Kvetko laughs.
</P>
<P>
   For hard-core vintage fanatics, the Phoenix area's street scene
is limited. They lean toward restaurants and lounges that never
lost their style, such as the New Yorker coffee shop and the Copper
Queen Cocktail Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   For Bowling, the Copper Queen in Phoenix is classic vintage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's untouched,'' Bowling says. ``It's not trying to be a
lounge. It (begin ital) is (endital) a lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been overtaken by people. This older couple does a
lounge act that is so hysterical. They are hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   More Phoenix area nightclubs are catering to the retro
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The pompadours and Billy Betties (women who love retro and
rockabilly) rule on Tuesdays at the Rhythm Room and Thursdays at
the Melody Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, the Rhythm Room ushered in its Roots Tuesday,
which spotlights rockabilly, swing, surf and lounge bands.
Rockabilly mixes old rock and roll with the twang of country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a specialized music, but it has a serious following,''
says Bob Corritore, who runs the Phoenix blues nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Pingleton and Brian Marsland rarely bother with the
Phoenix retro scene. They want authenticity. They often dine at the
s Kon Tiki, a Polynesian seafood restaurant, in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few remaining Polynesian restaurants in the
country,'' says Marsland, a 28-year-old Tempe, Ariz., artist.
``We're always going on road trips to specific places we've heard
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Pingleton and Marsland are taken with all things tiki, those
small sculptured Polynesian figures.
</P>
<P>
   At Pingleton's apartment, beads hang from the door of her tiki
room. Hundreds of tikis stare from bookshelves, windowsills, the
rattan bar, black-velvet pictures and desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the tiki room, you feel good,'' says Pingleton, a
30-year-old dietitian. ``You're smiling. You're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pingleton and Marsland are dating the vintage way. At the
end of the evening, they go to their separate apartments. There was
no shacking up in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The couple shares fond memories of vintage goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandparents' house was a fun place to be,'' Marsland says.
``It was a clean, minimalist decor. I have a lot of positive
associations with this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Their apartments are in the same apartment complex and are
painted in shocking pink and turquoise, a color scheme reminiscent
of a 1930s Miami Beach hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Their vintage furniture is perfect in this get-up. Pingleton's
long, curvy sofa shares space with a pair of hoop chairs and
amoeba-shaped coffee table. Marsland's chrome dining room set is
glossy and sleek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking,'' Marsland says. ``We're always
upgrading.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't explain their longing for old things, but they know
it exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that you saw as a little kid,'' Marsland says.
``Maybe you caught a flash at your grandparents' house. But it was
up on a shelf, and you couldn't touch it. Now you can finally
touch.''  &QL;

WILKINS ENJOYS WORKING VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Francis G. Power Gym boasts old-fashioned
bleachers, a wooden scorer's table, no air conditioning _ and the
best basketball in New England right now. It may be thus for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Celtics and other NBA players and wannabes converge
on Boston College during the week to get their picks and rolls in
during what appears to be a long, hot, management-free summer. The
NBA has locked out its players, meaning Walter McCarty, Dominique
Wilkins, Dana Barros, and others must get their hoop kicks in the
Beantown Basketball League, now in its third year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the league was a pleasant diversion and supplement
for the NBA players. Under normal circumstances, the Celtics would
be getting ready for rookie camp this week and a summer league
appearance with a few veterans and a lot of hopefuls. The players
would be visiting Brandeis daily to get in their work.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it is quite different. Brandeis might as well be in
Paraguay. And the Beantown Basketball League is the only game in
town. There are refs, coaches, a public address announcer and, most
of all, a game. A lot of games. The league started June 18 and runs
through the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   For the 38-year-old Wilkins, the league is just what he wants
and needs as he prepares for yet another season and, hopefully, a
spot on an NBA team. He said his weight is down to 220 after a
season in Italy and he is chilling out in Dover, an adopted New
Englander. Wednesday night, he was manning the middle against
McCarty, both pros depending on the collegians and ex-collegians to
make the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This keeps me in shape,'' said Wilkins, who looks terrific. He
has been using a personal trainer for the last three years and says
it has made a big difference. ``It's hot in here, it helps keeps
the pounds off, and it gives me a chance to play with the younger
guys,'' he said. ``I can work on a few things. It's perfect for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been playing in Chicago this week and off to Monte
Carlo, Rome, and Athens after that. USA Basketball had called his
agent and inquired if Wilkins would want to try out for the United
States team for the World Championships. Wilkins was flattered but
could not see himself doing so while his former, and possibly
future, teammates were being locked out and the original 12-man NBA
team decided not to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with a lot of those guys over the years, and I
couldn't do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins was considered because he had no NBA affiliation last
season. He played in Italy after spending the year before with the
Tim Duncan-less, David Robinson-less San Antonio Spurs. He still
wears his Spurs warmup shirt. His Italian team in Bologna did well,
but lost in the playoffs in the fifth and final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won the series easily,'' he said, ``but I
chipped a bone in my (right) elbow during the playoffs. Other than
that, I feel as good now as I ever did. I'll tell you this: I know
some teams could have used some scoring in the playoffs. You think
Utah couldn't have got something more out of the small forward
position? But I knew Chicago would win. They know what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian experience was markedly different from his previous
European foray, with Panathinaikos. That disastrous season ended up
with lots of litigation amid charges of breach of contract on both
sides. Wilkins also had some tough personal misfortune that season
as well and had to make some unscheduled trips back to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   There was none of that in Bologna. He and David Rivers were an
excellent 1-2 scoring punch and there was also Carlton Myers.
``They call him the Michael Jordan of Europe,'' Wilkins said,
rolling his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't the same pressure in Italy that there was in
Greece,'' he went on. ``People were nicer. You could relax and just
play. I still don't think the Europeans really understand the game
yet. They look at the scoring as if that's all there is. They don't
look at rebounds, assists, things like that. When they do that,
they'll understand the game more. And the competition is getting
better each year.''
</P>
<P>
   It has come to that. One of the greatest scorers of our time _
someone whose identity and legacy are forever entwined in point
production _ is worried that the fans in Europe aren't versed to
the finer things. It was hot in the gym Wednesday night, but not
that hot.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand that the Federal Reserve sets interest rates,
which in turn affects unemployment. By what authority does ``the
Fed'' exist? Who makes its policies?
</P>
<P>
   A. More than unemployment is involved. The Federal Reserve
encourages the nation's economic growth and controls inflation by
influencing interest rates, as you say, and thus the availability
of money and loans. It also performs many financial services for
the federal government and provides numerous services in its role
as central bank of the United States, to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is an independent government agency. Its policies are
directed by two main committees, the Board of Governors and the
Federal Open Market Committee. The board has seven members,
appointed to 14-year terms by the President, subject to the consent
of the U.S. Senate. The committee, which makes the main decisions
on Fed monetary policies, consists of the Fed governors; the
president of the New York City Federal Reserve Bank; and the
presidents of four other Federal Reserve Banks (there are 12
nationwide).
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is formic acid? I recently read that an interstate
highway ramp was closed for five hours recently when that type acid
spilled from a truck. I've never heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   A. Here's the dictionary definition: ``a colorless, irritating,
fuming, water-soluble liquid . . . CH 2 O 2 (or HCOOH) . . . used
in dyeing and tanning and in medicine.'' Our definition:
``something that stings and irritates like you wouldn't believe.''
</P>
<P>
   If you know where the word ``formic'' comes from, you'll
understand why firefighters donned masks, gloves and heavy garb,
and closed the ramp for five hours, when the stuff spilled from
that truck at Old National Highway and I-75 in Clayton County.
Think of how a teeny, tiny ant can sting you if it chooses. Ants
belong to the family Formicidae. If the formic acid produced by an
ant can, in almost microscopic amounts, create a painful experience
in humans, what could the synthetic version in concentrated amounts
do?
</P>
<P>
   Q. The governor of Georgia and Sony Music are involved in a
program to give parents of newborn babies in Georgia a CD or tape
of various classical music selections. It is believed that an
infant hearing such music will have a positive intellectual
response. How can people who aren't parents of newborns in Georgia
obtain the CDs or tapes?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Build Your Baby's Brain Through the Power of Music!'' can
be ordered by calling Sony Music Special Products, 1-800-356-1052.
The cost is $9.98 for a CD, $5.98 for a cassette tape, plus sales
tax and $3.95 for shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Old and new gospel hymns speak of Beulah land. The word
Beulah is not in the Bible and I can't find a reference anywhere to
Beulah land. Can you explain what it means?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before we answer, let's start the song going in everyone's
mind by repeating the refrain from C. Austin Miles' ``Dwelling in
Beulah Land'' (and don't forget to clap your hands):
</P>
<P>
   I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,/
</P>
<P>
   I'm drinking at the fountain that shall never run dry;/
</P>
<P>
   O yes! I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,/
</P>
<P>
   For I'm dwelling in Beulah Land.
</P>
<P>
   Beulah's origin is in the Bible (the book of the Prophet Isaiah
62:4), where it refers to ``your land Beulah,'' meaning the new
Jerusalem _ a place, neither heaven nor Earth, that enjoys God's
loving benevolence.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate source for contemporary usage may be ``The
Pilgrim's Progress,'' by John Bunyan, the religious allegory first
published in 1678. In it, Christian, the hero, arrives at last in
the land or country of Beulah on the border of the Celestial City
(heaven). Bunyan describes this land as a garden of perfect harmony
between nature and man, who, finally understanding God's plan,
rests from the arduous journey before confronting the final
challenge: crossing the river of death to eternal salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please explain the concept of the dew point. What is it? How
is it related to relative humidity, temperature and dew?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dew point is the temperature at which moisture in the air
begins to condense. The dew point is either lower than the air
temperature, or the same as the air temperature when the relative
humidity is 100 percent. The difference between air and dew point
temperatures, popularly called the ``spread,'' is especially useful
to people in aviation, because it helps anticipate fog. However, it
has little bearing on precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Dew forms when a thin film of air, in contact with the surface,
is cooled to below the dew point _ the point at which it cannot
hold all its water vapor. If the air temperature and dew point are
below freezing, frost may form on the surface, or ice crystals may
form in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``crackers'' in referring to
poor white Southerners?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are various explanations of how ``cracker'' acquired
the meaning of ``a low-down Southern white man,'' in the words of
H.L. Mencken, who added that such people ``were especially numerous
in Georgia.'' According to the Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins, the one that seems soundest traces to the verb ``crack,''
as in the expression ``he's not what he's cracked up to be,''
meaning that the person doesn't live up to his own boastful opinion
of himself. The Dictionary of American Regional English defines the
word, in this sense, as ``a backwoodsman, rustic, countrified
person,'' and also traces it to cracker or corn-cracker, the
probable original form of the word, meaning a ``braggart.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible origin is from the cracking of a whip, since
North Florida and South Georgia at one time were the site of large
ranches, but this wouldn't have any negative connotation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Back in the spring, I read that film director James Cameron
would release a longer version of ``Titanic.'' When will this come
out?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't start popping corn quite yet. While Cameron has said he
``eventually'' will put together a special edition of the movie,
which could include as much as 20 minutes of scenes edited from the
first version, he has yet to start working on it. In an interview
in June, he said it would be released ``anywhere from one to five
years from now,'' although he added that he would like to start
putting it together ``while it is still fresh in our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you compare the relative burn of calories by walking and
running?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are lots of variables involved, such as the person's
weight, the length of stride, grade of terrain, degree of vigor
expended while walking or running, even heat and humidity, so these
numbers, provided by the American Council on Exercise and the book
``The New Fit or Fat,'' are only guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   An ``average'' person (for statistical reckoning, let's assume
it's a 160-pound man) waliing will burn 8.7 calories a minute, or
261 calories for half an hour. That same man jogging will burn
about 12.4 calories a minute, or 372 calories during 30 minutes. If
that same man picks up the pace and runs, his caloric burn will be
15.1 calories a minute, or 453 calories for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers would be skewed a bit if a person measures the
caloric burn by distance _ a mile, for example _ instead of the
amount of time. ACE says our average man will walk a mile in about
15 minutes; burning 8.7 calories a minute, his total burn will be
130.5 calories. That same person will run a mile in about 7 1/2
minutes, ACE says; at 15.1 calories a minute burned while running,
that totals 113.25.
</P>
<P>
   Jogging, by the way, is just ``slow running,'' said ACE's Rachel
Narsh. She said the average jogger would burn 372 calories in 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article said air carriers have been given permission to
resume charter flights between the United States and Cuba. Does
that mean the embargo for tourists has been lifted?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Nothing has changed in connection with the sanctions
against general tourist travel to Cuba, said Hamilton Dix of the
Treasury Department. Long-standing U.S. regulations applying to the
spending of U.S. currency on travel to Cuba are intended to limit
the flow of hard currency into that country. Only those U.S.
citizens who meet certain restrictions _ such as U.S. government
travelers on official business, including representatives of
international organizations of which the United States is a member;
journalists; and family visitors traveling once a year due to
extreme humanitarian need _ are permitted to fly on the direct
charters. And the eligibility of those people will be verified by
the Treasury Department at least 48 to 72 hours in advance of
travel.
</P>
<P>
   The restricted direct flights to Cuba, which were begun in 1977,
were suspended in 1996 by President Clinton as part of a series of
measures to punish the Cuban government for shooting down two
planes over international waters. Three U.S. citizens were killed.
</P>
<P>
   American tourists determined to visit Cuba, by the way, can fly
there via another country, such as Mexico, the Bahamas or Canada.
But Beth Weaver of the Treasury Department says if Americans go to
Cuba without a specific license, and spend money there, ``which
they certainly would do,'' they would be breaking the law. They
could be investigated when they come back into the United States,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thomas Harris wrote ``Silence of the Lambs'' 10 years ago.
The subsequent movie garnered several Oscars. Fans have eagerly
awaited his sequel, but a decade has passed and we're still
waiting. What has happened to Harris?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harris is said to have been working on the sequel for more
than five years, but no one _ not Anne Sibbald, his literary agent;
not his publisher; not even his family _ has yet to see a word.
``It will arrive when it arrives,'' Sibbald told a British
newspaper last December.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, creator of psychiatrist and psychopath Dr. Hannibal
Lecter, is not exactly prolific. His first book, ``Black Sunday,''
a non-Lecter thriller, was published in 1973. ``Red Dragon,'' the
tense thriller that introduced Lecter, became an instant bestseller
when published in 1981. Fans had to wait another seven years before
Lecter reappeared in ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' which was made
into the hugely popular 1991 film of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   At last report, the divorced Harris, who has a daughter, was
living in seclusion with Pace Barnes, a former publishing house
editor, and they were dividing their time between Miami and Long
Island's Sag Harbor.

<P>
   (UNDATED: Silence of the Lambs . . .)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the status of HR 3008, the Notch Fairness Act, that
was introduced in Congress the latter part of last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Notch babies'' is a term some retirees use to refer to
themselves because, they believe, they are receiving lower benefits
than other Social Security recipients with comparable earnings born
earlier. According to an analysis by the American Association of
Retired Persons, the problem is that these ``notch babies'' are
comparing themselves to those born from 1912 through 1916 who are
receiving higher benefits than intended. According to AARP, the
benefits that ``notch babies'' receive are actuarially correct.
</P>
<P>
   The ``notch baby'' situation is a long-simmering issue. Since
1981, members of Congress have introduced 118 pieces of notch
reform legislation. None of these initiatives, however, has been
passed into law. The latest bill, HR 3008, sponsored by Rep. Mark
Neumann (R-Wis.), would give the ``notch babies'' the option of
receiving lump-sum payments totaling $5,000, or increased monthly
benefits, through the year 2002. It was referred to the House
Committee on Ways and Means and to the Committee on the Budget Nov.
7, 1997, but has yet to be acted on. Staff of the Ways and Means
subcommittee on Social Security is reviewing the bill's provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the expression ``caught red-handed'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: In ancient times, ``to be taken with red hand'' was to be
caught in the act, like a murderer, with his (or her) hands red
with the victim's blood. The use of ``red hand'' in this sense goes
back to 15th-century Scotland and Scottish law. Sir Walter Scott's
``Ivanhoe'' has an early use of ``taken red-handed'' for someone
apprehended in the act of committing a crime. Not long afterward,
the expression became more common as ``caught red-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a big fan of Rosie O'Donnell. How can I get tickets to
her show in New York?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to be lucky, and persistent. And you must plan
well in advance. Even then, there are no guarantees. You can send a
postcard (or letter with stamped, self-addressed return envelope)
to be entered into a lottery for tickets for the 1998-99 season.
You'll be notified by postcard if your name has been chosen. The
address: NBC Studios, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, 30 Rockefeller
Plaza, Suite 800E, New York, NY 10112.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can take a chance at getting standby space for tapings
Monday throughThursday each week. Standby tickets are available on
that same day only at 8 a.m. outside the 49th Street entrance to 30
Rockefeller Plaza. Standby holders must return no earlier than one
hour prior to a taping on the 50th Street side of the NBC lobby.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication: Even if you get a regular or standby
ticket, you're still not guaranteed admittance. And taping
schedules are subject to change, sometimes without notice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the houseboat in Miami where Andrew
Cunanan committed suicide? Was any connection ever determined
between Cunanan and a German businessman, I think it was, who owned
the houseboat?
</P>
<P>
   A: The houseboat, named the New Year, was condemned by Miami
Beach officials in January after it had settled on the shallow
bottom of Indian Creek and its German owner, identified as Torsten
Reineck, missed a deadline to refloat and repair it. It then was
demolished. Cunanan, the suspected serial killer of fashion
designer Gianni Versace and four other men, committed suicide on
the houseboat in July 1997 before police could capture him.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were unable to prove any previous link between
Cunanan and Reineck. That was among several questions the
investigation was not able to answer, such as how Cunanan ended up
on the houseboat, and what he did between Versace's slaying and his
own suicide. As Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto said when
the probe was closed officially on Dec. 31, 1997, the answers to
many questions ``went down with the ship, so to speak, when Andrew
Cunanan committed suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find the Powerball winning numbers on the
Internet? I travel frequently, and it would be handy when I buy a
ticket in a Powerball state. The only site I could find has not
been updated in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try a website for a lottery in one of the participating
states, such as Wisconsin. Here's the address: www.wilottery.com/
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the Mississippi River get its name, since it starts
in Minnesota and ends in Louisiana and borders many states?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Why Do They Call It Topeka'' explains that the
Mississippi, the longest river in North America, derives its name
from the Algonquin words mescha (meaning ``great'') and cebe
(water). The state was named after the river.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 paperback, subtitled ``How Places Got Their Names,'' is
a wealth of information about how places (towns, states, rivers,
mountains) got their name. It's by John W. Pursell. If it isn't in
stock, bookstores should be able to order it. It's a Citadel Press
book, published by Carol Publishing Group ($9.95; ISBN
0-8065-1588-0).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The release of the new ``X-Files'' movie, and the popularity
of Gillian Anderson in the role of Agent Scully, has me wondering:
When did the FBI start permitting women to serve as agents? And
what thoughts did J. Edgar Hoover have on this subject?
</P>
<P>
   A: The FBI's first female agents were Joanne E. Pierce of
Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Susan Lynn Roley of Long Beach, Calif.,
who joined on July 17, 1972. FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead
said the agency can't respond about Hoover's beliefs on female
agents because ``that would be speculation as to what someone else
thought, and we're not going to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the CIA gift shop have a mail order catalog?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Furthermore, the gift shop doesn't sell to the public. A
spokesman said the gift shop, operated by the CIA's Employees
Activity Association, is private and not government-run. It sells
such items as golf balls, baseball hats and beer mugs with the CIA
logo, but only to CIA employees.
</P>

   There is, however, a retail outlet not affiliated with the CIA
that does sell many such items to the public. Ship's Hatch Inc.,
has outlets in Arlington and Fairfax, Va. ``Tourists love the CIA
stuff,'' said Mary Beth Cox of the Arlington location. Numerous
items with the CIA logo are available, including coffee mugs,
T-shirts, hats, patches, cigarette lighters and shot glasses, she
said. Specialty items such as Navy hats (from any Navy ship, past
or present, Cox said) also are available.
</P>
<P>
   Items can be obtained in person (or by mail order) from Ship's
Hatch, 1677 Crystal Square Arcade, Arlington, VA 22202
(703-413-6289); or by telephone order from the Fairfax location
(703-691-1670). Information also is available on the stores'

   Q: Is the name Atlanta derived from Atlas, the god in Greek
mythology? Or is it from the Atlantic Ocean?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you want to take an indirect route, it's from Atlas. But
the more direct source is Atlantic, from a railroad that took part
of its name from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The place that was to become Atlanta was incorporated under the
name Marthasville on Dec. 23, 1842. The post office also recognized
it by that name. In 1845, J. Edgar Thompson, chief engineer of the
Georgia Railroad, was asked by his boss to suggest a new name for
the depot, the southern terminus of the Western &AMP; Atlantic
Railroad. The book ``Georgia Place Names'' said Thompson came up
with Atlanta as a feminine version of Atlantic. Although the town
still was called Marthasville, freight coming in was marked
``Atlanta,'' and it wasn't long before the new name stuck. Atlanta
was incorporated as a city Dec. 29, 1845.
</P>
<P>
   The names Atlantic and Atlas are directly related. The ancient
Romans named the Atlantic Ocean after the Atlas Mountains of North
Africa, which marked the western limit of what was then the known
world. The Atlas Mountains were named for Atlas, son of the Titan
Iapetus and the sea nymph Clymene, in Greek mythology.

CLINTON EXHIBITS PRUDENCE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ President Clinton and his officials are speaking softly
and keeping America's big stick in the closet in Kosovo, the latest
flash point of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who earned
his spurs as a tough-talking mediator in Bosnia three years ago, is
all on persuasive diplomacy in attempting to bring together Serb
ruler Slobodan Milosevic and the independence-minded Albanian
population of the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said this week there is no sense in threatening to
rain bombs on the Serbs because ``further violence by anyone won't
solve anything.'' What he meant was that such a threat would be a
bluff and Milosevic would know it. The 15-nation European Union has
called for bombing and, at one time, seemed to have Washington's
support. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's policymakers have realized that military action over
Kosovo would open up many dangerous possibilities, including a
renewal of war elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia, and would not be
worthwhile, least of all for the ethnic Albanians there. Without
the United States in their corner, the EU countries will do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the six-nation contact group (the United States,
Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Russia) that handles relations
with the countries of the former Yugoslavia urged immediate
negotiations between the Serbian regime and the Kosovo Albanians,
although Milosevic is unlikely to comply quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The situation differs greatly from the uproar over Iraq's
refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors early this year.
Then Clinton was doing the blustering, and most of America's allies
told him to cool it, as he eventually did. The Iraqi episode
appears to have taught the U.S. administration that waving Theodore
Roosevelt's famous ``big stick'' isn't invariably the solution to
complex foreign policy issues even when unsavory bullies like
Saddam Hussein and Milosevic are the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   General approval existed for intervening in Bosnia because it
was a sovereign state and its survival was threatened not only by
rebels but outsiders from Serbia and Croatia. Furthermore, after
four years of war, all sides were exhausted by the fighting and
looking for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is different. It is a province of Serbia, and military
intervention, even to protect the Albanians, would from any
perspective be an undeniable violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Albanians indisputably nurse serious political and
cultural grievances. However, Americans might ponder how they would
react if a group of militant Mexican Americans demanded
independence for the American Southwest or sought its reabsorption
by their ethnic brethren south of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government, with massive popular support, would
certainly resist such a step and reject outside efforts favoring
it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some might argue that the legal case for the Southwest's
autonomy or outright secession is stronger than that of the Kosovo
Albanians. Most of the U.S. Southwest was acquired in the Mexican
War only 150 years ago. Kosovo has been part of Serbia for seven
centuries.

   FRENCH-ART-REVIEW (Washington) _ Art exhibitions that resemble
art history seminars often do so at their peril. Full of wordy text
panels, such shows can swamp the viewer with extraneous information
or make interesting points that one would rather encounter in book
form, sitting down. But every pitfall has escapees carefully
skirting its brink. Curators are becoming increasingly skilled at
mixing and matching artworks and ancillary material to conjure up
the times, places and personalities that produced those artworks.
There are growing numbers of shows in which words and pictures
share the wall to mutually illuminating effect, so that looking and
reading become one, or close to it. A rewarding example is ``Manet,
Monet and the Gare St.-Lazare,'' a small beautiful show that moved
to the National Gallery of Art here after appearing at the Musee

embracing quality and venerable history. In earlier eras, all
professional musicians were composers as well as performers, not to

took to keep the tradition going. Yet in evaluating Bernstein,
people still look at his accomplishments separately. By Anthony

NEWCOMERS KAI RIDING HIGH
</HEADLINE>

(NOTE: This is a corrected version of Pop Beat. The last item has

By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bay Area-based Asian pop vocal group Kai has hit
one out of the park in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kai's self-titled debut disc recently reached No. 12 on
Billboard's Heatseekers chart for new and developing artists.
Meanwhile, ``Something Inside Me,'' the group's first single, is
chalking up extensive airplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't have any expectations, but we felt good about
what we had done,'' said Kai singer AC Lorenzo. ``We worked on the
record for 18 months, and we're proud of everything on it. It was
scary when it was first released.''
</P>
<P>
   The r&AMP;b-tinged Filipino-American quintet grew up on a cappella
harmony singing, performing at festivals, community fairs and
corporate events. The group's name is an abbreviated form of the
Tagalog word kaibigan, which denotes the common bond among all
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on stage with nothing but your voice, you can't
hide,'' said Kai's Errol Viray. ``A cappella is our foundation.
It's the reason we take such full advantage of harmony, which makes
us truly come together as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Until intensive recording sessions began for ``Kai'' (Geffen),
members of the group continued to hone their chops with three shows
per weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo, 22, says Kai's taste in music is as diverse as its
hometown's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is a melting pot of culture,'' he said. ``At our
high school, there was somebody from every single country. So, we
all like different types of music. Luckily, the line between genres
is blurring. I've heard Shania Twain on an r&AMP;b-pop station. It's a
good thing for people to be exposed to various kinds of music.''
</P>
<P>
   DEE DEE'S DEMONS: In the acclaimed 1996 book, ``Please Kill Me:
The Uncensored Oral History of Punk,'' Ramones bassist and
co-founder Dee Dee Ramone is portrayed as both a poignant figure
and a prime mover in New York's underground music scene.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dee Dee tells his side of the story in ``Poison Heart:
Surviving the Ramones'' (FireFly; $16.95) co-written with Veronica
Kofman. The British paperback, available at a reduced price from
amazon.com, begins as Dee Dee sits in the Chelsea Hotel, sweating
it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken a lot of drugs in this hotel, and now I'm going to
get off drugs in this hotel,'' he writes. ``I am two weeks into
withdrawal, and all the demons from my past are tormenting me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ramones fans, the now-sober Dee Dee's perspective on 15
years touring with the band is a must-read. He pulls no punches as
he admits to intense conflicts within the group and his own mental
and substance-abuse problems.

LAWYER HAS TOUGH JOB IN FINDING JURY FOR SENSATIONAL MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROGER CROTEAU  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS _ The lawyer for a former Air Force Academy cadet
accused of murdering a teen-age girl to appease his ex-fiancee says
he faces no easy task in finding an unbiased jury.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Dan Cogdell said ``every newspaper has convicted my
client on Page One,'' a reference to the intense publicity the case
has had in Texas and around the nation since the 1995 slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, state District Judge Don Leonard questioned
potential jurors at the Comal County Courthouse about what they
have seen and heard regarding the murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection continued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, now 20, is accused of killing a 16-year-old Mansfield,
Texas, girl in 1995 at the request of his then-fiancee. The
ex-fiancee, Diane Zamora, also 20, was convicted of murder in
February and is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in his black suit, Graham took notes Wednesday as
Leonard questioned the potential jurors, listening to the answers
and talking in low tones with lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The love story involving clean-cut high school sweethearts that
prosecutors claim led to a rival's murder reads like a play and has
attracted a crush of national media coverage. Finding jurors who
haven't already made up their minds is difficult, even though the
trial was moved to New Braunfels from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the jury pool have at least a little knowledge
about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he would not automatically rule out anyone who
thought his client was guilty; the question is whether potential
jurors can keep an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   Determining that can be difficult. ``I'm afraid of the ones who
say `I saw the TV movie and read the book ... but I don't have an
opinion,''' he said. ``Those are the ones who scare me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he looks for strength of character in jurors and the
ability to stand up and make an unpopular decision.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Mike Parrish said he wanted jurors who are
intelligent and fair.
</P>
<P>
   While finding a truly unbiased jury is difficult in high-profile
cases, it can be done, said University of Texas law Professor Lucas
Powe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Texas is capable of finding 12 people in the
county who have not heard of him,'' he said. ``They found 12 people
in Miami who had never heard of Daniel Noriega. They found 12
people in Washington, D.C., who had never heard of Oliver North and
I believe they even found 12 people in Los Angeles who had never
heard of O.J. Simpson.''
</P>
<P>
   But is a juror who pays so little attention to the world around
him a good juror?
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is no, but in fact we've gone toward a theory in
this country that we want ignorant jurors and the best way to do
that is to find ignorant people,'' Powe said.

 &HT;      COLLINS MAKES CASE FOR TIGHTER BERRY INSPECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Kyra Leasure  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 9 -- Following the outbreaks of food poisoning
in 1996 and 1997 from Guatemalan raspberries, including five
reported cases in Maine, Sen. Susan M. Collins Thursday called for
the federal government to adopt stricter inspection controls of
imported food.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, R-Maine, led the second out of four hearings that are
scheduled to address the safety of food imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The escalation in the number of foodborne illnesses at a time
when food imports are soaring prompted the Subcommittee to focus
its investigation on the safety of imported fruit and vegetables,''
said Collins, who chairs the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, at least 1,465 people nationally suffered
Cyclosporiasis, a form of food poisoning that causes nausea,
diarrhea, fatigue and weight loss. Another outbreak occurred in
1997, when another 1,000 people suffered from the poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration and the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention then worked with the Guatemalan Berry
Commission to improve the practices for growing and handling
raspberries in Guatemala. The Commission voluntarily improved water
quality, what is believed to be the source of contamination, and
sanitary conditions and established a system in which only the
safest farms are permitted to export their berries to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Collins and other lawmakers complained that the U.S.
government does not do enough of its own inspections of imported
foods -- which a recent General Accounting Office report noted that
Americans are increasing their consumption of, especially produce.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, 24 percent of fruit consumed by Americans was imported;
in 1995 that number had increased to 33 percent. Of all this fruit,
however, less than 2 percent was inspected by the FDA before it
made its way to supermarkets, according to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're headed in the wrong direction,'' said Levin.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, as part of his food safety initiative, has
proposed providing the FDA with authority to force other nations to
impose U.S. health standards on their farmers before food can be
exported to the United States. He has also proposed increasing
funding to enhance inspections by FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new steps for Guatemalan berry production, there was
another outbreak of Cyclospora in Canada just three weeks ago,
which some inspectors believe was caused by raspberries imported
from Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that another outbreak occurred despite the
implementation of various control measures suggests either that the
control measures may not have been fully implemented or that the
measures may not have addressed the true source of contamination,''
Dr. Stephen Ostroff, associate director for Epidemiologic Science
at CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases, told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country's food safety net must be improved so that
consumers are protected from the risk of unsafe foods, particularly
when contamination is not detectable by the average consumer,''
said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Once her committee concludes the food safety hearings, Collins
plans to introduce legislation with stricter inspection
regulations, stronger controls over food imports and increased
funding for the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming hearings are scheduled to cover specific fraud and
deceptive techniques used to get food products illegally into the
United States and may present possible remedies for the weaknesses
previously identified.

FRENCH RESERVE CHALLENGED BY FRENCH TEAM AS IT PREPARES FOR
BRAZIL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAIREFONTAINE, France _ Approximately 300,000 people converged
on the Champs-Elysees in the early hours on Thursday to celebrate
the fact that France was at last in the final of the World Cup.
There were hundreds of thousands more ``supporteurs'' in the
squares of Nantes, Montpellier, Bordeaux and even traditionally
restrained Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   But the team, whose victory over Croatia in the semifinals had
generated all this exuberance, quietly boarded its bus and drove
south for 45 minutes to its country home away from home _ the
national technical center for soccer _ to begin preparing to face
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The French team has trained here in the woods of Clairefontaine
for years and been based here since June 8: two days before the
World Cup began. It is a bucolic, attractive spot, but to hear the
players tell it late Thursday morning, they have just about had
their fill of tranquility, both inside and outside the confines of
their rural retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit disappointing to be here,'' said defender
Marcel Desailly. ``We'd like to be out in the cafes and on the
Champs-Elysees ourselves. It's there where you can really get a
sense of the impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Desailly and his teammates made it clear that their run to the
final is the highlight of their careers. They also made it clear
that they are not getting enough support during their games, and
they were not referring to the record television audience of
approximately 20.5 million in a nation of 58 million that watched
them beat the Croatians. They were referring to the atmosphere
inside the striking, new 80,000-seat Stade de France. Les Bleus
have yet to lose there since it was inaugurated in January, but
they also have yet to sense the passion they see on their
television screens and on the street corners they pass in their bus
en route to and from games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real fans are outside the stadium,'' said Didier
Deschamps, the French captain. ``It's easy for someone to do the
wave when we score, but we need that support all the time. We need
the same enthusiasm and joy that we can see outside the stadium.
Inside the stadium, there are too many uptight people in suits and
ties. This is not the theater ... If these people are invited by
the sponsors, I have no problem with that. That's part of soccer
these days, but I hope they wake up for the final. I don't want to
hear the samba for 90 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender Frank Leboeuf, who will start against Brazil because of
the red card Laurent Blanc received against Croatia, suggested
putting up a sign outside the Stade de France. ``It should read,
`No suits allowed','' Leboeuf said. ``It's an offense to soccer,
which is a sport of the masses. Put on a T-shirt. Paint your face
and start shouting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reserve goalkeeper Lionel Charbonnier became frustrated enough
in the final minutes of the match to get off the bench and run
behind one of the goals, where he exhorted the crowd to cheer more
loudly. ``It bothered me to see this public so calm,'' he said.
``After Blanc's suspension we were playing with 10 men against 11,
and I could hear the flies fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Charbonnier was not the only French reserve lobbying for less
reserve. Before the semifinal, midfielder Robert Pires had asked
French president Jacques Chirac to shed his business suit in favor
of a French team jersey with the number 23 (there are 22 players on
the French team). But Chirac, even under pressure, declined to defy
decorum and instead kept the uniform in question by his side during
the match, although he brought it with him when he visited the team
in their exuberant locker room afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, fans were already in the streets of Paris
celebrating France's victory and the two goals scored by right
fullback Lilian Thuram. Unlike the English, Dutch or even the
Croatians, French fans don't have traditional soccer hymns with
which to bond. On Wednesday night, they settled for chanting ''On
est en finale!'' (We are in the final) and, perhaps of greater
interest to Chirac, ``Thuram President.''
</P>
<P>
   That was heady stuff for a player who never had scored with the
national team in 37 previous appearances and has scored only once
in his two seasons with Parma in the Italian first division.
``Desailly came up to me after my second goal and said, `What's the
matter with you?''' Thuram said. ``He told me all I usually do is
kick the ball into the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Although French coach Aime Jacquet said his team would protest
Blanc's expulsion, which came with 16 minutes remaining, a
spokesman for soccer's international governing body FIFA said the
decision by Spanish referee Jose Garcia Aranda would not be
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Blanc, one of the few links between the team that failed to
qualify for the 1994 World Cup finals and the team that has
qualified for THE final, will now have to watch his nation's most
important match from the bench. In his customary spot next to
Desailly will be Leboeuf, a lesser presence and lesser player with
a greater sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare himself with Ronaldo, the Brazilian striker he
should see plenty of on Sunday night, Leboeuf responded, ``I played
striker once, too, and that's why I became a central defender.''

   PARIS _ A task force of engineers and team leaders who were
trying hard to complete a highly competitive electronics contract
were startled to see French job inspectors abruptly appear in their
midst shortly after 7 o'clock one evening early this year.
</P>
<P>
   What are your names and why are you working late? the inspectors
wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring protests about their intrusion, several inspectors
insisted on putting the same questions to corporate executives who
were meeting with a potential customer in nearby offices, according
to an anonymous pamphlet that circulated after the raid on the
headquarters in suburban Paris of Alcatel-TITN Answare, a
subsidiary of Alcatel, France's giant telecommunications
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several prominent French companies that have been
raided by job inspectors bent on stopping executives and
top-salaried specialists from working longer hours than the
official 39-hour workweek _ in effect, doing unpaid overtime as
executives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to snap inspections, investigators have staked out
plants' parking lots to photograph license plates and document that
the cars' owners are spending too much time in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered business as usual, the practice among
managerial-rank employees of working long hours if needed to get
the job done has become a violation of French labor law.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the hottest front in the long-running wars of the
35-hour workweek decreed by France's Socialist-led government.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the idea is bitterly opposed by business, the
government has expanded the plan for shorter hours beyond factory
and white-collar wage-earners to include salaried employees known
in French as cadres.
</P>
<P>
   This category, often loosely assimilated with ``manager,''
actually embraces almost a quarter of France's nearly 15
million-person work force, including not just top executives but
also nearly all skilled professionals employed in big companies.
</P>
<P>
   What cadres have in common is not their managerial rank but a
quasi-executive social status _ and a tradition of working long,
often irregular hours without claiming overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Jobs and Solidarity Minister Martine Aubry, the
government has decided to end this practice as part of its campaign
to force companies to shorten hours and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing the change on cadres has turned out to be a
controversial idea in France, partly with cadres themselves and
above all with businesses. They complain that accommodating the
need for shorter hours for cadres will disrupt their performance
and make French companies less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and elsewhere, rival companies have more
flexibility because of less-rigid labor regulations and more
individual contracts with skilled personnel, which are not dictated
by French-style industry-wide negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishing in France has on occasion attained tragicomic
proportions, with French chief executives dropping public hints
that they have rented hotel rooms for their executives to work
clandestinely.
</P>
<P>
   As a riposte, job inspectors have sought to monitor executives'
personal computers to detect whether they have been used for
company business at home to circumvent the ban.
</P>
<P>
   In the current climate, a workaholic executive risks a reprimand
because his boss fears that a trade union official _ or even a
disgruntled fellow executive _ will inform on the company, inviting
unwelcome attention from job inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, executives interviewed for this article
declined to discuss their own companies by name.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, inspectors are known to have successfully charged
Alcatel, Thomson-CSF, the big defense electronics firm that is
being privatized, Carrefour, the country's largest supermarket
chain, and Credit Local de France, a bank with branches throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies have complied with the new government
demands, which were aimed mainly at high-tech industries heavy in
nonmanagerial cadres.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the list, Francette Aubert, spokesman at the Ministry
of Jobs and Solidarity, said that the inspectors had issued
thousands of notices of violations targeted at ``a few big
enterprises to clarify the legal status of cadres,'' which
currently is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A corporate head had a blunter interpretation: ``The big test
cases were intimidation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political bargaining is just getting under way about a bill on
cadres, which is due next year as the final act of legislation that
started in May on the 35-hour week. But French big business has
already started negotiating with employees about a workweek for
cadres.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the raids have been suspended for several weeks and
may not resume. Few employers have any remaining appetite for
tangling with the job inspectors, a nationwide corps of 420 persons
who come under the Ministry of Jobs and Solidarity but enjoy
considerable autonomy in tracking down abuses of labor laws, often
in close collaboration with unionized employees.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors' militancy can be unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   A test of wills at Thomson Radars and Countermeasures, a
subsidiary of Thomson-CSF, involved charges this spring of 1,500
violations, according to sources in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Top management, facing personal fines in excess of $100,000 and
the threat of jail, finally agreed to shut the main corporate
facility every day at 7 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the conflict is the perception of many French
cadres that the government wants to take away their status.
</P>
<P>
   Technically a payroll category, the title of cadre carries some
fringe benefits, but for many it is also a social badge, separating
quasi-professional people from other workers in a business and
giving them status as part of a middle class whose work is somehow
associated with incentives rather than with union-negotiated
sectorial pay raises. &QL;

 By DAVID USBORNE  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA, GA. _ Jonathan Huff and Randy Brazee knew they had a
problem when someone hurled a brick through the window of their car
outside the house they own together in the Atlanta neighborhood of
Kirkwood.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around it was a note with a curt message. It read:
``Move out of Kirkwood now, snowflakes!'' Snowflake, they later
discovered, is a derogatory term some black Americans use for white
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   That was in March. Not long afterwards, Jonathan, a computer
systems manager, was listening to a radio show while at work at
Georgia Tech in downtown Atlanta. What he heard stunned him.
</P>
<P>
   Someone called Amos Moore, a black minister of the Baptist
Church, was accusing whites, and especially white homosexuals, of
invading Kirkwood and trying to take it away from its mostly black
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan, 28, understood at once. Months before, he and his
longtime partner Randy, 30, had successfully sued a black neighbor
for selling cocaine and other drugs out of her house, and this was
payback time.
</P>
<P>
   But something else was going on. This minister, whom he had
never heard of, was clearly trying to stir a black campaign to oust
all whites, gay and straight, from Kirkwood.
</P>
<P>
   The suburb remains at least 80 percent black. Of the whites who
have moved there, about half are homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moore was airing a noxious mix of grievances. Among
them was his claim that the few gay households in Kirkwood _ there
are about 20 _ were setting about recruiting black youths to the
gay lifestyle by flying rainbow flags outside their homes, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   They were importing AIDS into the area, he went on, and by doing
up their houses they were driving up property prices and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This last point may have had some legitimacy. Just to the east
of the center, Kirkwood is an unassuming neighborhood of modest
turn-of-the-century homes that for decades has been almost entirely
populated by low-income blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A slow influx by prosperous young whites over recent years has
begun a gradual process of gentrification. An active neighborhood
association of blacks and whites has made strides in driving out
litter and crime. Rapidly rising house values have been an
inevitable consequence.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion of an anti-white, anti-gay hate campaign was much
harder to stomach. Atlanta is a proud symbol of racial integration,
a city where almost all the political power lies with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Jonathan and Randy and many friends were themselves
the victims of prejudice and discrimination by blacks _ a classic
case, it seemed, of the oppressed turning into the oppressor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moore has not gone away. In recent weeks, he has twice
distributed leaflets to black homes, asking them to rallies. ``Save
Our Neighborhood,'' the first once screamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are concerned about the `white takeover' of Kirkwood,
come meet with us...to discuss how we can put an end to the
homosexual and lesbian takeover of our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   A second leaflet called for an end to ``apartheid'' in Kirkwood
and declared: ``Don't let AIDS take over our community.''

<P>
   Randy, who works for a mobile-phone company, says it is the
racism that upsets him most, even more than the gay-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just in awe that this is happening in 1998. What he is
saying is just perpetuating racism and it's just plain scary.''
Jonathan adds: ``If his stance were a religious one, I wouldn't
care. But for him to viciously and publicly say these things is
frightening, and it's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Atlanta is appalled too. ``This city is what it is
because of all the people who are here, including straights and
gays,'' declared the city council president, Robb Pitts. ``We are
grateful and thankful to the gay community for their
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's defunct community relations board is to be
resurrected specifically to seek ways to defuse the tension in
Kirkwood.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, meanwhile, a special town meeting on the issue
was held at City Hall. At the meeting, Moore was unrepentant,
saying: ``The Bible says homosexuality has no place in the kingdom
of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gathering, he was heckled by Jimmie Scott, a gay man
who is black. ``How can you call yourself a man of God and preach
hate?'' he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate you, because God hates you,'' the Reverend replied. ``I
don't have to condemn you, because God condemns you.'' &QL;

   The Rev. Moore's outbursts have helped to feed another debate
now getting widespread attention in the U.S. It is about the
alleged unwillingness of the black community generally, and
especially black churches, to come to terms with homosexuality and
to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   While inclusion of homosexuals has been vigorously discussed by
predominantly white denominations, it is not on the agenda of any
of the mainstream black churches.
</P>
<P>
   The head-in-the-sand attitude to gay sex and AIDS in most black
churches comes at a time when new statistics show that 57 percent
of new HIV infections in America are among black people, whether
caused by homosexual or heterosexual contact or through drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Black Americans account for only 13 percent of the whole
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that homosexuality is not a reality in our
church,'' said the Rev. Tim McDonald of Atlanta's Concerned Black
Clergy. ``That's a problem that white folks have.'' If there are
black ministers in denial about homosexuality, the Rev. Moore is
surely among them. &QL;

<P>
   Moore and his poisonous rhetoric will surely fade in time. If
there are many supporting him, they are not showing themselves: at
the City Hall meeting, there was barely a handful at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could I find anyone in Kirkwood willing to speak up for him.
``It doesn't bother me at all,'' said Agnes Langston, 51, when
asked about the new gay households.
</P>
<P>
   A black resident in Kirkwood for 30 years and a close neighbor
of Jonathan and Randy, she celebrates their court action that
forced the closing of the crack house on Kirkwood Road. She has no
desire to meet the Rev. Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Langston also agrees that since the whites started coming in,
the area has become more pleasant. ``It's calmer, there's no more
litter and no more drugs.'' But she also acknowledges the potential
downside of gentrification. ``Those taxes,'' she says. ``Someone's
got to fix that.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA, GA. _ Jonathan Huff and Randy Brazee knew they had a
problem when someone hurled a brick through the window of their car
outside the house they own together in the Atlanta neighborhood of
Kirkwood.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around it was a note with a curt message. It read:
``Move out of Kirkwood now, snowflakes!'' Snowflake, they later
discovered, is a derogatory term some black Americans use for white
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   That was in March. Not long afterwards, Jonathan, a computer
systems manager, was listening to a radio show while at work at
Georgia Tech in downtown Atlanta. What he heard stunned him.
</P>
<P>
   Someone called Amos Moore, a black minister of the Baptist
Church, was accusing whites, and especially white homosexuals, of
invading Kirkwood and trying to take it away from its mostly black
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan, 28, understood at once. Months before, he and his
longtime partner Randy, 30, had successfully sued a black neighbor
for selling cocaine and other drugs out of her house, and this was
payback time.
</P>
<P>
   But something else was going on. This minister, whom he had
never heard of, was clearly trying to stir a black campaign to oust
all whites, gay and straight, from Kirkwood.
</P>
<P>
   The suburb remains at least 80 percent black. Of the whites who
have moved there, about half are homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moore was airing a noxious mix of grievances. Among
them was his claim that the few gay households in Kirkwood _ there
are about 20 _ were setting about recruiting black youths to the
gay lifestyle by flying rainbow flags outside their homes, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   They were importing AIDS into the area, he went on, and by doing
up their houses they were driving up property prices and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This last point may have had some legitimacy. Just to the east
of the center, Kirkwood is an unassuming neighborhood of modest
turn-of-the-century homes that for decades has been almost entirely
populated by low-income blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A slow influx by prosperous young whites over recent years has
begun a gradual process of gentrification. An active neighborhood
association of blacks and whites has made strides in driving out
litter and crime. Rapidly rising house values have been an
inevitable consequence.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion of an anti-white, anti-gay hate campaign was much
harder to stomach. Atlanta is a proud symbol of racial integration,
a city where almost all the political power lies with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Jonathan and Randy and many friends were themselves
the victims of prejudice and discrimination by blacks _ a classic
case, it seemed, of the oppressed turning into the oppressor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moore has not gone away. In recent weeks, he has twice
distributed leaflets to black homes, asking them to rallies. ``Save
Our Neighborhood,'' the first once screamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are concerned about the `white takeover' of Kirkwood,
come meet with us...to discuss how we can put an end to the
homosexual and lesbian takeover of our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   A second leaflet called for an end to ``apartheid'' in Kirkwood
and declared: ``Don't let AIDS take over our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy, who works for a mobile-phone company, says it is the
racism that upsets him most, even more than the gay-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just in awe that this is happening in 1998. What he is
saying is just perpetuating racism and it's just plain scary.''
Jonathan adds: ``If his stance were a religious one, I wouldn't
care. But for him to viciously and publicly say these things is
frightening, and it's just wrong.''
</P>

<P>
   TOKYO _ The Sumida-gawa, which divides Tokyo's east and west, is
among the ugliest of the world's rivers, but also one of the most
immaculate.
</P>
<P>
   A jumble of colorless buildings are reflected in the grey-brown
waters; cars hum constantly along the concrete expressway suspended
above them. But the wide pathways, with their thoughtfully provided
picnic tables, are free of litter.
</P>
<P>
   The flotsam _ human and inanimate _ which usually accumulates
along urban river banks is nowhere to be seen. In fact you could
walk straight past without ever suspecting that this is the saddest
place in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   You might be puzzled by the neat cubes, the size and shape of
shipping containers, which line the walkway. They are made of
cardboard and carefully wrapped with string in waterproof blue
tarpaulins, like giant Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside one _ after removing your shoes _ and you would
discover that each contains a tiny home, with mattress and quilt,
and a makeshift shelf containing comics and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   One occupant even has even rigged up a portable electric
generator. Pots and pans, salvaged from the garbage left for
collection on the street, hang from nails in the plywood wall.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is closer to that of a camp site than the
cardboard cities of London or Manhattan. But that is what this is:
the most extreme and pathetic manifestation of Japan's economic
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many homeless people there are in Japan, but
since the early 1990s, when the bursting of the ``bubble economy''
first began to set off redundancies and bankruptcies, their number
has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, there were no cardboard houses along the
Sumida; now there are an estimated 500, and the pattern is repeated
in parks, stations, and covered arcades around Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   To a European or American eye, the homeless of Japan are unique:
clean, neat and resourceful, and clinging to self-respect. But in a
society of insiders, their exclusion also brings unique sufferings.
</P>
<P>
   The career of Masami Kobayashi is typical of those who end up
living in the blue boxes by the Sumida River. In 1960, as a
30-year-old steeplejack, he came to Tokyo from his home in Kyushu,
Japan's southernmost island.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades, Japan boomed, and no sector
benefited more than the building industry. Even without skills or
an education, an able-bodied man could always find casual work on
the construction sites _ a last resort for the unskilled or
unattached, many of them escaping divorces or business failure or a
spell in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the job market in day laborers was a few hundred
yards from the river, in the area known as Sanya. It was there,
after jobs in various parts of Japan, that Kobayashi arrived. Ten
years ago, there was enough work to go around, even for men of
Kobayashi's age, but all that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government announced that male unemployment had
risen to a record postwar high of 4.3 percent and, since the
collapse of the property market in the early 1990s, construction
has been especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiters now pick only the youngest and fittest men.
``There are too many looking for work,'' says Kobayashi, ``and if
you're over 60 it's almost impossible. I haven't worked for three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains the most striking characteristic of Japan's
homeless _ overwhelmingly they are older men.
</P>
<P>
   One survey, of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, found that more than
90 percent were over 40. The streets around Sanya are full of them,
sitting on the pavement, staring into space, and sipping cups of
cheap sake dispensed from vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that I have a place to live,'' says Hiroshi, a
62-year old, who lives in four square yards of tatami mat in a
cheap hotel paid for by the government. ``But I have no one to talk
to here, and I am a lonely person.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived on the street until three years ago, when he was struck
by a car while drunkenly crossing the road. The permanent injuries
to his legs and arms guaranteed him a place to live, but put paid
to any hope that he will ever work again.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese social security is hedged around with conditions and
exclusions and many of the neediest people, like Kobayashi, fall
through the net. The blue boxes by the river are tolerated by the
authorities, but their occupants are acutely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Yakuza gangs often employ the homeless as drug pushers or
messengers. Homeless women are a minority, but they are at the
greatest risk, from sexual assault and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest killer, however, is probably the cheap sake. ``Sanya
has always been a place for alcohol, but it's really getting
serious,'' says Megumu Mizuta, a voluntary worker. ``There's a big
difference between drinking after work, and drinking all day when
you have nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the physical threats. Tokyo freezes in the
winter; now, and until September, it is baking hot. Apart from
common ailments, there have been cases of tuberculosis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Fights and violence are common _ three weeks ago two homeless
men were stabbed to death by a third who was pursued across the
river by police helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to that,'' says Kobayashi. ``Fireworks. The schoolkids
come out in the evenings and throw them into the homes where people
are sleeping.'' Several men have been burned as a result.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mental suffering of alienation _ in a society based
upon groups, rather than individuals _ that is hardest to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these men have no families of their own,'' says
Professor Masami Iwata of Japan Women's University, who has studied
homelessness in the country. ``Their personal identity comes from
their role as workers, and now they have no work. They don't think
of themselves as victims, but as failures, and many of them are
very ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, compared to the population as a whole, the homeless are
few. Apart from a few isolated areas, like Sumida-gawa, they are
not a social problem, certainly not one that politicians or local
government officials are worrying about _ although that may change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, we noticed a few men wearing ties and business
suits,'' says another voluntary worker. ``We were very surprised,
but they didn't want to talk. They're a minority now, but in a few
years who knows how many of them there will be?'' &QL;

through the net. The blue boxes by the river are tolerated by the
authorities, but their occupants are acutely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Yakuza gangs often employ the homeless as drug pushers or
messengers. Homeless women are a minority, but they are at the
greatest risk, from sexual assault and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest killer, however, is probably the cheap sake. ``Sanya
has always been a place for alcohol, but it's really getting
serious,'' says Megumu Mizuta, a voluntary worker. ``There's a big
difference between drinking after work, and drinking all day when
you have nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the physical threats. Tokyo freezes in the
winter; now, and until September, it is baking hot. Apart from
common ailments, there have been cases of tuberculosis and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Fights and violence are common _ three weeks ago two homeless
men were stabbed to death by a third who was pursued across the
river by police helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to that,'' says Kobayashi. ``Fireworks. The schoolkids
come out in the evenings and throw them into the homes where people
are sleeping.'' Several men have been burned as a result.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mental suffering of alienation _ in a society based
upon groups, rather than individuals _ that is hardest to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these men have no families of their own,'' says
Professor Masami Iwata of Japan Women's University, who has studied
homelessness in the country. ``Their personal identity comes from
their role as workers, and now they have no work. They don't think
of themselves as victims, but as failures, and many of them are
very ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, compared to the population as a whole, the homeless are
few. Apart from a few isolated areas, like Sumida-gawa, they are
not a social problem, certainly not one that politicians or local
government officials are worrying about _ although that may change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, we noticed a few men wearing ties and business
suits,'' says another voluntary worker. ``We were very surprised,
but they didn't want to talk. They're a minority now, but in a few
years who knows how many of them there will be?'' &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Sumida-gawa, which divides Tokyo's east and west, is
among the ugliest of the world's rivers, but also one of the most
immaculate.
</P>
<P>
   A jumble of colorless buildings are reflected in the grey-brown
waters; cars hum constantly along the concrete expressway suspended
above them. But the wide pathways, with their thoughtfully provided
picnic tables, are free of litter.
</P>
<P>
   The flotsam _ human and inanimate _ which usually accumulates
along urban river banks is nowhere to be seen. In fact you could
walk straight past without ever suspecting that this is the saddest
place in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   You might be puzzled by the neat cubes, the size and shape of
shipping containers, which line the walkway. They are made of
cardboard and carefully wrapped with string in waterproof blue
tarpaulins, like giant Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside one _ after removing your shoes _ and you would
discover that each contains a tiny home, with mattress and quilt,
and a makeshift shelf containing comics and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   One occupant even has even rigged up a portable electric
generator. Pots and pans, salvaged from the garbage left for
collection on the street, hang from nails in the plywood wall.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is closer to that of a camp site than the
cardboard cities of London or Manhattan. But that is what this is:
the most extreme and pathetic manifestation of Japan's economic
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many homeless people there are in Japan, but
since the early 1990s, when the bursting of the ``bubble economy''
first began to set off redundancies and bankruptcies, their number
has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, there were no cardboard houses along the
Sumida; now there are an estimated 500, and the pattern is repeated
in parks, stations, and covered arcades around Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   To a European or American eye, the homeless of Japan are unique:
clean, neat and resourceful, and clinging to self-respect. But in a
society of insiders, their exclusion also brings unique sufferings.
</P>
<P>
   The career of Masami Kobayashi is typical of those who end up
living in the blue boxes by the Sumida River. In 1960, as a
30-year-old steeplejack, he came to Tokyo from his home in Kyushu,
Japan's southernmost island.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades, Japan boomed, and no sector
benefited more than the building industry. Even without skills or
an education, an able-bodied man could always find casual work on
the construction sites _ a last resort for the unskilled or
unattached, many of them escaping divorces or business failure or a
spell in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the job market in day laborers was a few hundred
yards from the river, in the area known as Sanya. It was there,
after jobs in various parts of Japan, that Kobayashi arrived. Ten
years ago, there was enough work to go around, even for men of
Kobayashi's age, but all that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government announced that male unemployment had
risen to a record postwar high of 4.3 percent and, since the
collapse of the property market in the early 1990s, construction
has been especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiters now pick only the youngest and fittest men.
``There are too many looking for work,'' says Kobayashi, ``and if
you're over 60 it's almost impossible. I haven't worked for three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains the most striking characteristic of Japan's
homeless _ overwhelmingly they are older men.
</P>
<P>
   One survey, of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, found that more than
90 percent were over 40. The streets around Sanya are full of them,
sitting on the pavement, staring into space, and sipping cups of
cheap sake dispensed from vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that I have a place to live,'' says Hiroshi, a
62-year old, who lives in four square yards of tatami mat in a
cheap hotel paid for by the government. ``But I have no one to talk
to here, and I am a lonely person.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived on the street until three years ago, when he was struck
by a car while drunkenly crossing the road. The permanent injuries
to his legs and arms guaranteed him a place to live, but put paid
to any hope that he will ever work again.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese social security is hedged around with conditions and
exclusions and many of the neediest people, like Kobayashi, fall
through the net. The blue boxes by the river are tolerated by the
authorities, but their occupants are acutely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Yakuza gangs often employ the homeless as drug pushers or
messengers. Homeless women are a minority, but they are at the
greatest risk, from sexual assault and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest killer, however, is probably the cheap sake. ``Sanya
has always been a place for alcohol, but it's really getting
serious,'' says Megumu Mizuta, a voluntary worker. ``There's a big
difference between drinking after work, and drinking all day when
you have nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the physical threats. Tokyo freezes in the

</P>

<P>
   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use the money at any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior ends up at Harvard or Bennington, you'll simply have
to pay the difference in cost. Grandparents are also allowed to set
up a plan in the state where their grandchild lives.
</P>
<P>
   The savings plan will prove too conservative for some investors
_ the plans shoot for just a 5 percent to 6 percent gain, though
the tax advantages shouldn't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid-tuition plans offer more of a hedge against runaway
inflation. ``States monitor tuitions and make sure earnings keep up
with tuition inflation,'' says Kathy Tyson, research manager at
CSPN. ``With savings plans, states try to earn as much money as
they can on them, but there's no guarantee they'll keep up with
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child decides to pursue his or her acting dream and
forgo a college education together, there may be a considerable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Wisconsin, charge a 1 percent fee to
withdraw money from the plan. Others, such as Florida, will return
your money but without the interest it accrued _ a considerable
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more reason to insist that the little ones finish their
education. &QL;

   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use the money at any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior ends up at Harvard or Bennington, you'll simply have
to pay the difference in cost. Grandparents are also allowed to set
up a plan in the state where their grandchild lives.
</P>
<P>
   The savings plan will prove too conservative for some investors
_ the plans shoot for just a 5 percent to 6 percent gain, though
the tax advantages shouldn't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid-tuition plans offer more of a hedge against runaway
inflation. ``States monitor tuitions and make sure earnings keep up
with tuition inflation,'' says Kathy Tyson, research manager at
CSPN. ``With savings plans, states try to earn as much money as
they can on them, but there's no guarantee they'll keep up with
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child decides to pursue his or her acting dream and
forgo a college education together, there may be a considerable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Wisconsin, charge a 1 percent fee to
withdraw money from the plan. Others, such as Florida, will return
your money but without the interest it accrued _ a considerable
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more reason to insist that the little ones finish their
education. &QL;

<P>
   When an argument misses the whole point, the result is likely to
be irrelevant, confusing, or just plain wrong. Much of the debate
about the future of Social Security misses the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether Social Security is fundamentally sound
or fundamentally bankrupt, or whether privatizing Social Security
with some kind of giant 401(k) plan would provide us with a more
comfortable old age. At its core, the risk we face has nothing at
all to do with what we now call financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement has become a central issue of national concern
because the number of retirees is going to grow more rapidly than
the number of people of working age, and that problem intensifies
with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The great uncertainty, then, is whether the economy will be able
to produce sufficient goods and services to support the retired
baby boomers in the style to which they have been accustomed, while
still leaving enough for the younger working members of society to
live in the style to which they would like to become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the real risk is in the productivity of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   All the money in the world piled up in retirement funds will be
worthless unless the economy can provide the stuff we will want to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing accomplished by money flowing in and out of
retirement funds is the determination of who gets what, not how
much is available. Money is the ticket to the show but does not
determine what the show will be.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that more people can enjoy the show if we
can increase the number of available seats. That is why I emphasize
that the standard of living the aging baby boomers can enjoy will
ultimately depend far more on the productivity of the nation than
on the financial arrangements we concoct to fund their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then how do the financial arrangements enter the picture?
Consider the process by which we finance our everyday spending or
pay off our creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If we are regularly writing checks to pay our bills, or drawing
cash by check or from the ATM, we must be sure to have some way of
replenishing our bank accounts. Money has to come in from
somewhere, or we will go belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   People with jobs bank the wages and salaries they receive from
their employers. People who do not work must look elsewhere to
raise cash _ welfare, monthly pension-fund receipts, a friendly
relative, interest and dividends on investments, or the proceeds
from liquidating assets that have been accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Note that every one of those sources depends in turn on payments
from somewhere else. For example, the government will not mail
welfare benefits or pay the interest on its bonds unless citizens
pay their taxes or buy the bonds issued to cover budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend payments on equities won't be forthcoming unless
corporations can find a market for their output. The accumulated
assets cannot be liquidated if there are no buyers for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This illuminates the true function of retirement funds. A
retirement fund owns stocks and bonds and other investments but
cannot itself finance the spending of the retirees unless the fund
has money in the bank first.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, no matter how much shares of stock and no matter
how many bonds the fund owns, no pensions can be paid unless the
bonds and stocks are paying an income or unless the market is
receptive to buying the investments the fund chooses to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, then, retirement benefits are financed from outside
the fund rather than by the fund itself. Retirement funds are
merely conduits; they determine who gets what, not how much is
available _ which means that the true function of the assets in
these funds is to serve as collateral to secure the claims of
future retirees on future production.
</P>
<P>
   But no restructuring of Social Security, no privatization or
other type of reform, will do the trick unless the economy is
prosperous _ unless taxpayers have jobs, corporations can pay
dividends, borrowers can meet their interest payments when due, and
the capital markets are buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   The people who miss the whole point worry that the Social
Security trust fund will be depleted before most of the baby
boomers can claim their rightful share. Yes, if that dread moment
were ever to arrive, the collateral held to secure the promise of
Social Security would no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean society would necessarily let its senior
citizens starve; it means only that their needs could not be met by
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Even if reform assured the existence of some form of collateral
for retirement benefits in the years ahead, the existence of that
collateral is still no guarantee that society will be able to
provide senior citizens with the wherewithal to pay for their
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we did reform Social
Security. Suppose, too, that the economy of 2010 cannot produce
enough to satisfy the needs of both those who are employed and the
larger number who are retired.
</P>
<P>
   If the collateral of the retirees _ the value of the securities
they own _ is large, the retiree claim will be excessive and the
working people will see their living standards decline.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting social tension will push the working group to
insist upon their rightful share. Wages will escalate, either
causing inflation or disrupting the reliable flow of interest and
dividends and the vibrant market on which asset liquidation
depends. Then the purchasing power of the retirees' collateral will
be much less than today's expectations seem to promise.
</P>
<P>
   The financial arrangements are not the solution. They are part
of the problem. The solution is in economic prosperity over the
long run. &QL;

provide senior citizens with the wherewithal to pay for their
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we did reform Social
Security. Suppose, too, that the economy of 2010 cannot produce
enough to satisfy the needs of both those who are employed and the
larger number who are retired.
</P>
<P>
   If the collateral of the retirees _ the value of the securities
they own _ is large, the retiree claim will be excessive and the
working people will see their living standards decline.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting social tension will push the working group to
insist upon their rightful share. Wages will escalate, either
causing inflation or disrupting the reliable flow of interest and
dividends and the vibrant market on which asset liquidation
depends. Then the purchasing power of the retirees' collateral will
be much less than today's expectations seem to promise.

   The financial arrangements are not the solution. They are part
of the problem. The solution is in economic prosperity over the
long run. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When an argument misses the whole point, the result is likely to
be irrelevant, confusing, or just plain wrong. Much of the debate
about the future of Social Security misses the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether Social Security is fundamentally sound
or fundamentally bankrupt, or whether privatizing Social Security
with some kind of giant 401(k) plan would provide us with a more
comfortable old age. At its core, the risk we face has nothing at
all to do with what we now call financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement has become a central issue of national concern
because the number of retirees is going to grow more rapidly than
the number of people of working age, and that problem intensifies
with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The great uncertainty, then, is whether the economy will be able
to produce sufficient goods and services to support the retired
baby boomers in the style to which they have been accustomed, while
still leaving enough for the younger working members of society to
live in the style to which they would like to become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the real risk is in the productivity of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   All the money in the world piled up in retirement funds will be
worthless unless the economy can provide the stuff we will want to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing accomplished by money flowing in and out of
retirement funds is the determination of who gets what, not how
much is available. Money is the ticket to the show but does not
determine what the show will be.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that more people can enjoy the show if we
can increase the number of available seats. That is why I emphasize
that the standard of living the aging baby boomers can enjoy will
ultimately depend far more on the productivity of the nation than
on the financial arrangements we concoct to fund their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then how do the financial arrangements enter the picture?
Consider the process by which we finance our everyday spending or
pay off our creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If we are regularly writing checks to pay our bills, or drawing
cash by check or from the ATM, we must be sure to have some way of
replenishing our bank accounts. Money has to come in from
somewhere, or we will go belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   People with jobs bank the wages and salaries they receive from
their employers. People who do not work must look elsewhere to
raise cash _ welfare, monthly pension-fund receipts, a friendly
relative, interest and dividends on investments, or the proceeds
from liquidating assets that have been accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Note that every one of those sources depends in turn on payments
from somewhere else. For example, the government will not mail
welfare benefits or pay the interest on its bonds unless citizens
pay their taxes or buy the bonds issued to cover budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend payments on equities won't be forthcoming unless
corporations can find a market for their output. The accumulated
assets cannot be liquidated if there are no buyers for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This illuminates the true function of retirement funds. A
retirement fund owns stocks and bonds and other investments but
cannot itself finance the spending of the retirees unless the fund
has money in the bank first.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, no matter how much shares of stock and no matter
how many bonds the fund owns, no pensions can be paid unless the
bonds and stocks are paying an income or unless the market is
receptive to buying the investments the fund chooses to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, then, retirement benefits are financed from outside
the fund rather than by the fund itself. Retirement funds are
merely conduits; they determine who gets what, not how much is
available _ which means that the true function of the assets in
these funds is to serve as collateral to secure the claims of
future retirees on future production.
</P>
<P>
   But no restructuring of Social Security, no privatization or
other type of reform, will do the trick unless the economy is
prosperous _ unless taxpayers have jobs, corporations can pay
dividends, borrowers can meet their interest payments when due, and
the capital markets are buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   The people who miss the whole point worry that the Social
Security trust fund will be depleted before most of the baby
boomers can claim their rightful share. Yes, if that dread moment
were ever to arrive, the collateral held to secure the promise of
Social Security would no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean society would necessarily let its senior
citizens starve; it means only that their needs could not be met by
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Even if reform assured the existence of some form of collateral
for retirement benefits in the years ahead, the existence of that
collateral is still no guarantee that society will be able to
provide senior citizens with the wherewithal to pay for their
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we did reform Social
Security. Suppose, too, that the economy of 2010 cannot produce
enough to satisfy the needs of both those who are employed and the
larger number who are retired.
</P>
<P>

</P>

<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

   What a great time to be selling a house. Buyers are manic over
low interest rates. The new tax law lets sellers pocket up to
$500,000 in tax-free gains.
</P>
<P>
   But you're hardly the only seller on the block, so your chalet
could probably use, say, a grand's worth of attention. You'll
recoup the investment many times over when your house sells faster,
at the price it's really worth.
</P>
<P>
   Have a trusted friend walk through the property and point out
everything that's wrong, says Diane Shrewsberry, a real-estate
agent with Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   It'll hurt, but it's important, because you've stopped noticing
the tear in the screen, the lock that sticks, and the, uh, aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Take a walk yourself through a few builders' models, then steal
ideas, says Michael Holigan, host of the television series ``Your
New House.'' If white interiors are the rage now and you've got
busy wallpaper, start painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many buyers drive up to a house then refuse to go in because
something minor about the exterior turns them off, says
Shrewsberry.
</P>
<P>
   A new mailbox is an inexpensive way to make a good first
impression. So is a new welcome mat or even a new front door (or a
coat of paint on the old one.)
</P>
<P>
   Some more tips:
</P>
<P>
   Unclog the driveway. If your cars don't fit in the garage, park
in the street, says Ralph Roberts of Ralph R. Roberts Real Estate
in Detroit, Mich. Keep the garage door closed and trash cans out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape. Plant whatever should be blossoming that time of
year, says Daryl Jesperson, president of RE/MAX International in
Denver, Colo. De-landscape, too: Overgrown trees make a house look
small; overgrown bushes block light.
</P>
<P>
   For indoor improvements, concentrate on the kitchen and master
bath, ``where people picture they'll spend most of their time,''
says Holigan. Essential: Wallpaper bathrooms. Re-caulk around tubs
(yellow caulk shows sales). Hang new shower-curtain liners.
</P>
<P>
   Think bright. Install higher-watt bulbs in low-light areas, like
closets. Make sure every single bulb in the house works. ``It's
quite a blooper when the lights don't come on,'' says Holigan.
</P>
<P>
   Simplify. Clear kitchen counters. De-junk closets, drawers and
medicine cabinets. If the space doesn't look big enough for your
stuff, it won't look big enough for theirs, says Jesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on a realtor to provide info on schools in your area,
says Holigan. Leave information packets from local schools on your
kitchen counter, with your name, address, and phone number on top.
</P>
<P>
   Create a packet about your house, too, says Roberts. Have a
mortgage broker write out the cost of buying your home with various
percentages down. A buyer who might have considered the place too
expensive could realize that it is within range.
</P>
<P>
   By including the amounts of your monthly tax and utility bills,
you'll make buyers suspicious of homeowners who don't.
</P>
<P>
   A final caution: Once you've restored the house to its original
glory, be prepared to start wondering why you're moving out in the
first place. &QL;

   PROSECUTORS-DEALS (Washington) _ The Justice Department seek to
reverse an appellate court decision that invalidates the

 &HT;    CONGRESS POURING MONEY INTO HEALTH RESEARCH
 &HT;    1230&AMP;insert.
 &HT;    With NIH-DATA. For release Saturday, July 11.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., likes to tell a story about
the day retired Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf appeared at a Senate
committee hearing and took no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these days the American people are going to wake up and
realize how little you guys have invested in basic medical
research,'' Mack recalls the straight-talking Schwarzkopf telling
senators on the committee. ``And when they do, they're going to be
mad as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack, a longtime Senate champion of increased federal support
for medical research, was happy to find a supporter in ``Stormin'
Norman,'' commander of Allied forces in the Persian Gulf war and a
survivor of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years later, Mack finds himself surrounded by
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   A growing impression that scientists are on the brink of
fundamental breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer, heart
disease, Alzheimer's, AIDS and other modern plagues has pushed
medical research to the status of a political sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate
Republican leaders all are on record as supporting dramatic
increases in the budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
</P>
<P>
   With a budget that already exceeds $13 billion, NIH is the
dominant supporter of America's search for the basic biological
knowledge that underpins the development of new treatments for
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The country's largest private medical philanthropy, the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute, awards about $400 million a year in
research grants, less than 4 percent of the $10.4 billion in
contracts and extramural research grants NIH awarded last year to
scientists at universities, medical schools, private start-up
biomedical enterprises and other research centers. (The remainder
of the NIH budget pays the agency's expenses and funds its own team
of intramural scientists.)
</P>
<P>
   While Congress this year apparently will fall somewhat short
doubling NIH's research funds in five years _ as both Clinton and
Gingrich have advocated _ it's clear to Mack and others that the
country is about to dramatically increase its investment in medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee is tentatively scheduled to
take up a bill Tuesday that would increase NIH's budget by slightly
more than 9 percent next year. At that rate, the agency's budget
would double in eight years, rather than five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take what we can get,'' Mack said. ``I think we could
end up with an increase this year of a billion to a billion-five.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an additional $1 billion or more has
researchers, about 80 percent of whom now find their proposals for
NIH support rejected because of limited funds, marveling at their
improved prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to grab a piece of the upcoming government largesse,
scientists are churning out grant proposals at places like Emory
University in Atlanta; the North Carolina research empire in
Durham, Chapel Hill and Raleigh; the University of Alabama at
Birmingham; St. Louis's Washington University; dozens of
universities and science institutes in California and Texas; Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore; Harvard University, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is basically no other source of funds for the kind of
research I do,'' said Makkuni Jayaram, a molecular biologist at the
University of Texas at Austin. Jayaram's work is aimed at
understanding how obscure proteins round up isolated pieces of DNA
and assemble them into working genes at just the moment those genes
are needed to carry out a specific activity inside the cell.
</P>
<P>
   When a gene's work is done, the proteins disassemble it and stow
the pieces back on the cell's genomic shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Jayaram, who received $350,000 in research support from NIH last
year, noted that there's no way at this point to predict how
understanding the biochemical processes he is exploring could
someday lead to better ways to treat AIDS, cancer or some other
disease. That's why only NIH can afford to support it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Georgia, leaders of a government-industry-academic
alliance that helps universities in the state attract the
top-flight scientists whose work excites NIH grant makers, also are
pleased at the prospects of new government support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, Atlanta lost a lost a competition to
Austin, Texas, as the site of the Micro-electronic Computer
Consortium,'' said Bill Todd, president of the Georgia Research
Alliance. ``Since then, that area has became one of the top centers
in the semiconductor industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the experience caused Atlanta business leaders to think
in terms of getting the city in shape for the next competition and
led to creation of the consortium of businesses, state agencies and
six universities dedicated to bringing top scientific researchers
to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Biomedical technology is one of the group's principal focal
points, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many smart people believe we're on the cusp of a biological
revolution that at least replicates, and maybe dwarfs, the
information revolution'' of the past 20 years, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Research grants from NIH will be the main force driving the
development of the new industry, Todd believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To double NIH would be in the national interest because you
can do well by doing good,'' he said. ``The opportunities are there
to subdue disease like Alzheimer's, cancer and heart disease. We
would be using some very advanced technologies that not only serve
the national interest by taking care of people but will fuel the
economy also.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd said the research alliance has raised nearly $200 million
in state appropriations and private support in the past seven years
to endow 27 research chairs at universities, provide modern
laboratory equipment, and support efforts to recruit leading
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to Emory's successful effort three years ago to lure
vaccine researcher Rafi Ahmed away from the University of
California at Los Angeles as an example of the area's focused
campaign to build a biomedical brain trust.
</P>
<P>
   NIH records show Ahmed received four grants totaling more than
$800,000 last year for his studies of the interaction of the body's
immune system with such viruses as HIV and ebola.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional insert.)
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Emory's NIH grants and contracts totaled around $91
million last year, a 26 percent increase since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The records place Georgia 20th in the nation in total NIH
support, between Alabama and Florida. California, which received
more than $1.5 billion from the federal agency, also was home to
some of the fastest-growing grant recipients, with a statewide
increase of 33.5 percent over 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Alabama at Birmingham, with a medical school
that is only 25 years old, received $118 million from the national
institute in 1997, an increase of more than 43 percent since 1993.
Other leading biomedical research centers in the South include Duke
University, which got $152 million last year, and the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which got $142 million.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida received about $50 million and the
University of Miami, $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, medical schools in Galveston, Dallas, Houston and San
Antonio shared $280 million in NIH funds, and the University of
Texas at Austin, which does not have a medical school, received
nearly $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The institution with the most support was Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, with $292 million, although several
hundred million dollars granted to various Boston-area hospitals
and other institutions appeared primarily to underwrite Harvard
University research.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional insert.)
</P>
<P>
   While there are several theories about the sudden political
popularity of doubling the NIH budget _ including the fact that the
politically powerful ``Baby Boomer'' generation is reaching the age
where people worry more about their health _ Mack is convinced that
a national awareness of coming breakthroughs is the driving force.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to tell the story of another witness who testified at
the same Senate hearing where Schwarzkopf appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Roy, a student who was injured in the first few seconds
of his first game on the Boston University hockey team and was left
a paraplegic, told senators his dream for years had been to play
hockey for Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my dream is to be able someday to hug my mom again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that story had been told 15 or 20 years ago, the emotion we
all felt would have been the same, but we would have said there is
nothing we could do about it,'' Mack said. ``Now, more and more,
people are becoming convinced that there are things, and there will
be things, that we can do about some of these once-hopeless
diseases and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a growing sense out there that we are getting
very, very close.''

`MADELINE': STEPPING OUT OF THOSE TWO STRAIGHT LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

<P>
   There's a picture-book prettiness to the terribly sweet film
version of Ludwig Bemelmans' ``Madeline'' stories, so that the
Paris and the schoolgirls and the matching hats of the author's
delightful drawings really do spring to life. But ``terribly'' is
the key word in that sentence, since the film's preciousness often
threatens to eclipse its ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   With a cast of 12 pert little girls who seemingly have been
encouraged to lisp, and with a primness that outlasts the film's
ingenuity, this ``Madeline'' is best watched by viewers who
approach the material in a state of pre-adoration. Anyone else will
begin to wish that a 13th, hell-raising little iconoclast had been
thrown into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ``Madeline'' features the work of talented
individuals whose specialties are beyond the realm of adorable
children's stories and whose presence creates an element of
surprise. For instance, Frances McDormand plays Miss Clavel, the
nun who is the little girls' mother hen, within the narrow limits
of the picture-book character. Yet she adds a wide-eyed
astonishment and a flinging of hands that give Miss Clavel as much
spirit as her young charges.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Hawthorne brings a note of melancholy to Lord Covington, a
k a Lord Cucuface, who serves as the story's villain, and Stephane
Audran appears briefly as his elegant wife.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Daisy von Scherler Mayer, is known for ``Party
Girl'' with Parker Posey rather than for treacle. The production
designer, Hugo Luczyc-Wyhowski, has worked on ``Nil by Mouth'' and
``The Music of Chance'' in a very different vein, while
cinematographer Pierre Aim shot Mathieu Kassovitz's starkly
black-and-white ``Hate.'' Together they give this film a spare
visual sophistication that is of much more interest than its
heroine, played with much spunk by Hatty Jones. Production notes
describe Ms. Jones as ``a cherub-faced redhead with wise brown
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, by Malia Scotch Marmo (``Hook''), Mark Levin and
Jennifer Flackett, does an able job of interweaving characters from
four different Madeline books so that the appearance of the boy
next door named Pepito (Kristian De La Osa) or the band of Gypsy
circus performers is sure to seem nostalgic to readers of the
series. Still, it's hard to spin a real plot out of this material,
so the film doesn't quite have one. What it has are clever
settings, bright costumes, lovely Parisian scenery, a string of
uneventful-seeming crises and music by Michel Legrand. Carly Simon
can be heard over the closing credits, singing about Bemelmans' 12
little girls in two straight lines, who still look better on paper.
</P>
<P>

SORTING OUT FACTS, FICTION ON OUR HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vast majority of us are doing little to promote our own
health.
</P>
<P>
   We know the value of exercise and a healthful diet, yet only 20
percent of us actually consume the recommended seven fruits and
vegetables each day, and only 10 percent exercise on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   We are poor models for our children, 20 percent of whom are
already decisively overweight and sedentary by the age of 12 _ and
we are dooming ourselves to an unhealthy old age _ if we live long
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than helping the problem, I sometimes think we in the
media compound it with our explosions of often conflicting
information.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   To clarify what we know about how diet, dietary supplements,
exercise and other interventions contribute to better health and
longer life, 14 national experts in gerontology, exercise and
nutrition got together recently to write a ``Prescription for
Longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   They separated out some of the fads, folklore and false
information, and published their conclusions last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so much hype for products promising the eternal fountain
of youth and many contradictory research findings, people are
confused about what they can do to ensure good health,'' says Dr.
Robert Butler, president of the International Longevity Center and
professor of geriatrics at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Center and Canyon Ranch health resort in Tucson, Ariz.,
co-sponsored the discussion. The group particularly addressed the
question of which of the much-hyped dietary supplements and other
interventions are truly effective and safe.
</P>
<P>
   For optimum health benefits, participants recommend strength
conditioning with light weights and walking four miles a day, five
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   However, Butler says the experts don't want anyone to be
discouraged by the amount or type of exercise prescribed, noting
that the recommendations ``should be viewed as a goal that has many
graduations in between because any amount of exercise is better
than none.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that supplementing the recommended daily
allowance (RDA) of nutrients can reduce the risk of age-related
diseases. For example, high levels of folate and vitamin B-6 have
been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease in women; vitamin C
has been shown to reduce smoking-induced oxidative damage; and
vitamin E supplementation is known to reduce the risk of cancer and
cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   They prescribe:
</P>
<P>
   _ At least two to four helpings of fruit and three to five
helpings of vegetables per day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Calcium supplements, if necessary, to ensure a daily intake of
1,200 milligrams for men and 1,500 for women (1 cup skim milk has
301 milligrams, 3 ounces of sardines, 324 milligrams).
</P>
<P>
   _ One multivitamin tablet per day to ensure adequate intake of
vitamins B-6, B-12, C, D, E and folic acid (with no or low amounts
of iron for the elderly).
</P>
<P>
   _ Dietary fat reduction to 30 percent or less of total caloric
intake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regular sun exposure to maintain adequate vitamin D levels and
the sleep/wake cycle. Excessive exposure should be avoided to
reduce the risk of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Obesity should be avoided at any age but especially to prevent
excessive weight gain with increasing age.
</P>
<P>
   _ One children's aspirin (81 milligrams) per day to reduce the
risk of heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress reduction/relaxation activities including exercise,
yoga and tai chi.

   TOKYO _ From the surface of the earth at least, nowhere could
appear less sinister than Toyama Park.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in Shinjuku Ward, in the heart of central Tokyo, it is
an unremarkable little place of trees and gravel, a spot where
salarymen take their lunchtime sandwiches and old ladies walk their
poodles. A famous university is next door; a number of hospitals
stand close by.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground beneath Toyama Park contains a secret _ a truly
horrible secret, one of the most dreadful of 20th-century Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, bureaucrats, politicians and local
people have been passing it around from one to the other, a
historical hot potato which nobody wants to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins more than 60 years ago during the seemingly
unstoppable advance of the invading Japanese Imperial Army through
Manchuria.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Harbin, a special division was established
officially called the Prevention of Epidemics and Water Supply
Section, but better and more notoriously known as Unit 731.
</P>
<P>
   Its true function was controversial in itself _ the development
and testing of biological and chemical weapons, including anthrax
and bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   But the fearful thing about Unit 731 was the means which its
doctors used to carry out their research: experiments on live
prisoners who were deliberately infected in the name of science and
dissected while they were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the human experiments took place in Harbin but,
according to the accounts of former Unit 731 members, experiments
were also carried out in the Imperial Army's medical college and
research headquarters _ now the site of Toyama Park.
</P>
<P>
   The park is about to be dug up for the construction of a brand

   TOKYO _ From the surface of the earth at least, nowhere could
appear less sinister than Toyama Park.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in Shinjuku Ward, in the heart of central Tokyo, it is
an unremarkable little place of trees and gravel, a spot where
salarymen take their lunchtime sandwiches and old ladies walk their
poodles. A famous university is next door; a number of hospitals
stand close by.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground beneath Toyama Park contains a secret _ a truly
horrible secret, one of the most dreadful of 20th-century Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, bureaucrats, politicians and local
people have been passing it around from one to the other, a
historical hot potato which nobody wants to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins more than 60 years ago during the seemingly
unstoppable advance of the invading Japanese Imperial Army through
Manchuria.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Harbin, a special division was established
officially called the Prevention of Epidemics and Water Supply
Section, but better and more notoriously known as Unit 731.
</P>
<P>
   Its true function was controversial in itself _ the development
and testing of biological and chemical weapons, including anthrax
and bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   But the fearful thing about Unit 731 was the means which its
doctors used to carry out their research: experiments on live
prisoners who were deliberately infected in the name of science and
dissected while they were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the human experiments took place in Harbin but,
according to the accounts of former Unit 731 members, experiments
were also carried out in the Imperial Army's medical college and
research headquarters _ now the site of Toyama Park.
</P>
<P>
   The park is about to be dug up for the construction of a brand
new public sports ground. The project will involve excavating the
site where human experiments are believed to have taken place,
threatening to bring the horrible episode literally up to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   For _ apart from its present-day role as a place of recreation _

AOL FOLLOWED TWISTING ROAD TO SUCCESS IN CYBERSPACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. may dominate the world of computer software, but
a smaller company may be developing its own stranglehold on
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, long considered a dark horse in the race to
control the online world, has emerged as the single most dominating
provider of Internet access worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's twisting, turning road from floundering start-up to
undisputed industry leader is chronicled in a new book from Wall
Street Journal reporter Kara Swisher, ``aol.com _ How Steve Case
Beat Bill Gates, Nailed the Netheads and Made Millions in the War
for the Web'' (Times Business, $25, 333 pages). It is the most
detailed profiles yet written about the company behind one of the
Internet's best-known brands.
</P>
<P>
   Now with 12 million subscribers, AOL has more than four times as
many paying customers as its nearest rival. And this year, it
cemented its hold on the industry's top spot by acquiring its
closest competitor and longtime rival CompuServe Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher, who started compiling information for a book on the
Virginia-based AOL more than two years ago while covering the
company as a reporter for The Washington Post, provides a
relatively comprehensive review of AOL milestones and misfires.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly insightful is her recounting of Microsoft efforts
to buy AOL in the early 1990s before the software company launched
its own rival Microsoft Network online service that many had
predicted would wipe out emerging companies such as AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher also provides detailed accounts of some of the darker
days in AOL's history, including the company's infamous 19-hour
outage in August 1996 and its decision later that year to change a
controversial accounting procedure that produced one-time
write-offs running into the hundreds of millions of dollars that
literally wiped out all the profits the company had ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher also provides the best, most balanced profile of AOL's
chief executive, Case, the quiet but effective entrepreneur most
responsible for AOL's rise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to detailing Case's strategies for guiding AOL to
the top, the author also writes about his affair with one of his
top marketing executives that led to his own divorce and, for a
time, may have threatened his ability to continue running the
company.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Swisher is guilty of some hero worship and corporate
cheerleading in the pages of ``aol.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly everything that goes right with AOL, in this book at
least, is credited to the wisdom and foresight of AOL's founding
fathers. In cases where AOL is the center of controversy or
flat-out mistakes in market judgment, the blame game often
overlooks or soft-pedals the trouble that AOL executives caused for
the company.
</P>
<P>
   In passages that detail negotiations that AOL held in selecting
the Web browser software used on the service, for example, Swisher
describes the formation of a series of deals with software
developers Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Microsoft won the rights to have its Internet
browser integrated into AOL, a turn of events that seemed to leave
Netscape as a jilted partner. Swisher conveys the anger of Netscape
executives at the end result of the negotiations but never really
tells the reader whether AOL misled Netscape in its dealing on
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that one fault, Swisher's book provides a thorough
review of the evolution of AOL. And even if the prose is viewed
through AOL-tinted glasses, it provides keen insight on how
cyberspace has developed to this point and a better understanding
of the people likely to shape much of the Internet's future.

`SMALL SOLDERS' DIRECTOR HAS FOUGHT THIS BATTLE BEFORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it took 15 years, we finally got a remake of
``Gremlins.'' At least its original director, Joe Dante, did it,
although he probably thought he'd be making other kinds of movies
by now. This time around, instead of ``don't ever get them wet,''
the lesson becomes, ``don't ever put munitions computer chips in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens here. Irwin (David Cross) and Larry (Jay
Mohr) are a pair of hapless leftovers at Heartland Play Systems
when it's swallowed whole by the Globotech conglomerate. Whenever
Globotech head honcho Gil Mars (Denis Leary) strides into the
action, you know there's trouble. He's always wearing the official
uniform of heartless capitalist scum everywhere _ the
double-breasted suit.
</P>
<P>
   Spitting out his lines as if he doesn't want to miss his ride,
Mars combines two ideas _ Irwin's pacifist but monstrous-looking
Gorgonites, and Larry's buffed he-man dolls, the Commando Elite _
into a single set of toys. Bored by toys that can't do the stuff
you see in commercials, Mars demands more, so Larry installs
secret-weapon computer chips into the toys. When asked if the toys
won't be too violent for kids, Mars cracks, ``It's not violence.
It's action. Kids love action.'' If the rest of ``Small Soldiers''
were that good, we'd be going somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of stuff that Dante has done so much it's hard
to see how he keeps awake. He makes David Lynch-type entertainment
for kids, set in sun-splashed idyllic small towns where not much
happens, but where something creepy festers beneath the surface. In
``Small Soldiers,'' the small town is Winslow Corners, Ohio, where
Alan (Gregory Smith) has just moved with his parents after he's
been kicked out of a couple of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Alan is a sweet kid who wants to start over, and he helps run
his dad's yuppie-fantasy plaything store, called The Inner Child,
where there are no military toys. When Alan sneaks the Commando
Elite and Gorgonites into the store, they come to life and start
fighting. At least, the Commando Elite do; they seem to run on
sheer testosterone, not the built-in, lifetime batteries. The war
between the toys consumes Alan's life, and gets in the way of his
getting next to Christy (Kirsten Dunst). Except when they battle
the Commando Elite together.
</P>
<P>
   If kids want to see one talking-creature movie this summer,
``Small Soldiers'' may not be it; the animals in ``Dr. Dolittle''
have far more personality. The toys in ``Small Soldiers'' have
limited appeal, since they have the inflexible facial expressions
of, well, toys. The funniest thing about them is that Commando
leader Chip Hazard is voiced by Tommy Lee Jones, who often seems
like a wind-up toy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Dante always packs his casts with able comic actors _ Cross,
Mohr, Leary, Dunn, Ann Magnuson, the late Phil Hartman _ and mixes
in his repertory company (Dick Miller, Robert Picardo, Wendy
Schaal). ``Small Soldiers'' is glib and fast-moving, but it's
merely a competent, uninspired reprise of what Dante has done
before, Id versus Superego, that dates all the way back to ``The
Howling,'' the vivacious werewolf movie parody that first got him
attention. ``Small Soldiers'' is so cramped that you may start to
feel bad for Dante. That's when the real horror sets in.

SCREEN ADAPTATION OF `MADELINE' IS SWEET BUT NEVER CLOYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mercifully, it's not strung together with a series of rhyming
couplets like the Ludwig Bemelmans books upon which it's based, but
the film adaptation of ``Madeline'' sets its tone early.
``Madeline'' opens with a wonderful piece of animation _ a
shimmering, vibrant piece that has a comforting, primitive look
similar to the old Colorforms appliques.
</P>
<P>
   The animation fades to the real, homey manor house where
Madeline, the original Miss Can Do, and her classmates attend
school; it's a large and friendly private girls-only edifice that's
slightly run down. It makes sense that Daisy von Scherler Mayer
would direct the screen adaptation of ``Madeline.'' Her first film,
``Party Girl,'' in which Parker Posey played an up-to-the-minute
version of a self-absorbed screwball comedy heroine, was basically
the hippest Afterschool Special of all time. Mayer has a talent for
giving women center stage without either condescending or
proselytizing her Girl Power sensibility lends itself to children's
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Frances McDormand, as the girls' teacher, Miss Clavel, has
extra-sensitive antennae. Her eyes pop open like a silent movie
star's whenever something's going on. She's spiritually connected
to her charges, especially to the orphaned Madeline, whose eyes
sparkle with practicality. However, Madeline's brand of
practicality is unique; when she decides to become a vegetarian
after riding in a car with the chicken that was transformed into
dinner, her noisy, fowl-less stance attracts all of the other
girls. (But when it suits her, she reverses herself.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie is dependent on the appeal of its star, little Hatty
Jones, whose old-lady name fits her serious voice and ringing
British accent. In her film debut, Jones' utter conviction in
everything she says and does _ which is what Madeline is all about
_ registers, and it isn't adult or mature at all. (Jones'
willfulness is all performance; with David Letterman recently, she
fell quiet with awe after learning that the Spice Girls were
around.) Mayer has found a group of girls who are distinctive
enough to register as individuals immediately. When they band
around the little star, it feels as if she's won them over by sheer
force of personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeline'' is full of energy and personality. The movie may
feel a little episodic, if only because elements from several of
the Madeline books are used to bring the little heroine to the
movie screen. The bitter presence of Lord Covington (Nigel
Hawthorne, who seems to have burned away into a spiteful snarl)
hovers over the girls' school. Covington wants to get rid of the
house, and the memories of his late wife that it represents.
</P>
<P>
   But if the house is sold, the orphaned Madeline will have
nowhere else to go. As Covington tries selling it to a series of
buyers, his ambitions are thwarted by Madeline, her newfound dog _
who saved Madeline after a fall into the Seine _ and Pepito
(Kristian De La Osa), the boy next door. Pepito is also the son of
the Spanish ambassador, and the girls all take note of his
charisma. Madeline and Pepito form a special bond when they're
kidnapped by Leopold, Pepito's inept con-man of a teacher (Ben
Daniels, who's audacious and funny _ his lecherous conversations
with Miss Clavel almost rate their own movie).
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeline'' is a likable lollipop of a movie; the audience of
mostly girls I saw it with gave it their full and rapt attention.

`SIGHT READINGS': A BRIGHT, BREEZY WINDOW ON A CENTURY OF AMERICAN
WRITING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of John Updike's literary criticism, Elizabeth Hardwick writes:
It ``does not hug the shore but instead sails out in an open boat
where his curiosity and great intelligence seem to sail on and on,
wherever.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might well be said of Ms. Hardwick's own sprightly
essays, collected, most recently, in ``Sight Readings: American
Fictions.'' Although most of these pieces were the result of
arbitrary assignments from an assortment of publications (most
notably The New York Review of Books), they are held together by
the author's free-ranging, speculative intelligence and her
flashing prose. Together, they provide the reader with a bright,
breezy window on a century of American writing, from the novels of
Edith Wharton and Henry James to the fiction of John Updike, Philip
Roth and John Cheever.
</P>
<P>
   Discursive in form, meditative in mood, these essays tend to
meander around their subjects, as Ms. Hardwick amplifies her
observations with historical analogies, personal asides and sharp
apercus. She writes with an ample knowledge of literature,
scripture and pop culture, and she uses that knowledge to
illuminate her subjects with witty, unexpected analogies that make
her points with panache. She can also be very funny: Mary
McCarthy's thinly veiled fictional portraits of her former husband
Edmund Wilson, Ms. Hardwick wryly observes, were disguises ``on the
order of sunglasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hardwick describes such Updike sex romps as ``The Witches of
Eastwick'' and ``Couples'' as Restoration comedies, full of
``loose-girdled ladies, toffs, lecherous squires'' and bawdy
theatrics. She suggests that Philip Roth's novel ``Operation
Shylock'' grapples with charges that he has defamed the Jews,
allowing us to think of him as a kind of ``Richard Jewell, falsely
accused in the 1996 Olympic bombing in Atlanta.'' And she compares
Gertrude Stein's demanding, repetitious oeuvre to that of Philip
Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Her sketches of the writers themselves can be equally
entertaining _ and telling. Stein is described as being as ``sturdy
as a turnip,'' a ``tough root'' native to the Old World, while
Cheever is depicted as an ``Episcopalian anarch'' who ``existed
lifelong in captivities imposed by the complications of his nature,
his masks, his loyalties and the protection of his talent.'' Of
Edith Wharton, Ms. Hardwick writes: ``In her finesse and talent,
her glamour and worldliness, she shares in some of the renewed
affection for the threatened New York City architecture of the
Beaux-Arts period.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Herself a native of Kentucky, Ms. Hardwick is keenly attuned to
the crucial role that place _ the place where a writer spent his
formative years, the place that first imprinted his imagination _
plays in shaping an artist's work. She describes Margaret Fuller as
``a sort of stepchild, formed and deformed'' by the rarefied
intellectual world of Concord and Boston, an intellectual landscape
unsuitable ``not only to the fact that she was a woman who had to
earn her living but to her nature.''
</P>
<P>
   And she argues that the so-called Prairie Poets, Carl Sandburg,
Vachel Lindsay and Edgar Lee Masters, were indelibly marked by
``birth or youth in Illinois,'' which left them with proprietary
feelings about the country, a longing to transform its ``restless
genetic material'' into ``a hardy stock with the name `American' on
it, like a packet of sunflower seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these essays, for that matter, underscore Ms. Hardwick's
interest in the connections between an artist's work and life, and
the disparity between that life and the ``life'' so often depicted
by biographers, a species of writer Ms. Hardwick describes, with
some distaste, as ``the quick in pursuit of the dead.'' Taking the
side of defenseless biographical subjects who ``do not understand
that they are chatting away in a bugged universe,'' she grumbles
about voyeuristic biographies that substitute pages and pages of
facts for a more subtle truth, biographies that assume a simple
one-to-one correspondence between experience and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Hardwick's own essays are not blind to the ``pathos
of autobiography lurking'' in a text, they are sophisticated in
their understanding of the alchemical, imaginative transactions of
art and the importance of style and craft. Indeed, Ms. Hardwick
reveals herself in these pages as a shrewd, tough-minded critic,
adept at both describing the delicate clockwork mechanisms that lie
behind the polished face of a writer's work and giving the reader a
fiercely tactile feeling for their prose.
</P>
<P>
   She observes that Joan Didion's work is full of ``abrupt
closures rather like hanging up the phone without notice'';
discerns the ``tradesman's shrewdness'' in Edith Wharton's novels,
and complains that too many contemporary biographies feel like
``being on a long trip with the subject in the family car.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pieces in this volume _ a review of Philip Roth's
novel ``American Pastoral'' and an essay on Nadine Gordimer's
fiction (bizarrely included in a book subtitled ``American
Fictions'') _ rely too heavily on perfunctory plot summaries, and a
few evince decidedly debatable views. Ms. Hardwick, for instance,
takes Edith Wharton to task for depicting a narrow, rarefied New
York world, contending that she records ``dreams much less true to
the city, as history, than those of Sister Carrie,'' an unfair
comparison that does justice to the methods and ambitions of
neither Wharton nor Dreiser.
</P>
<P>
   Such lapses, however, are rare in ``Sight Readings,'' a
collection, like the author's earlier volumes of essays
(``Seduction and Betrayal,'' ``A View of My Own'' and ``Bartleby in
Manhattan''), that attests to Ms. Hardwick's perspicuity as a
critic, her eloquence and wit as a writer.

`HOME BEFORE DARK': UNEVEN AND HEAVY HANDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe on a rainy day after school or late at night on the Family
Channel there is a slot on television for ``Home Before Dark.'' But
no compelling reason exists for running out to see this listless,
tiresome movie in a theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Before Dark'' may smack of truth, but it does not ring
with art. The acting is uneven and often heavy-handed. Attempts at
humor fall flat. And crayons couldn't underline the action more
obviously than the music. But ``Home Before Dark,'' written and
directed by Maureen Foley, tells a sad story that seems rooted in
reality, and its central figures _ a family shattered by a fatal
accident _ evoke sympathy and the hope that their burdens might
ease even if they never vanish completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Before Dark,'' set in rural Massachusetts in 1963, tells
the story of Nora James (Stephanie Castellarin). Nora is a
pubescent 11-year-old with literary ambitions and a mother, Dolores
(Patricia Kalember), who has retreated into depression and despair
because of an automobile accident five years earlier that killed
three of her children.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Nora, who attends parochial school, has more than
an ordinary share of responsibilities in a household that includes
two mischievous preschool children and a decent but harried father,
Martin (Brian Delate), who is struggling to make a living as a
carpenter and deal with his misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, whom Dolores once met, prompts her to attempt suicide. She
is institutionalized in Boston; the younger children are dispatched
there to live with an aunt and uncle, and Martin also moves to
Boston, where he can find more work. But Nora, because of her
schooling, is left behind to live with another aunt, the unhappily
married Rose (Katharine Ross of ``The Graduate'' and ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'').
</P>
<P>
   Nora is unwilling to adapt to the childless Rose's mold, and
when Rose tries to suppress the family fiction Nora is writing in
her hope of winning a Seventeen magazine literary contest, their
relationship worsens. Eventually Nora threatens to expose Rose's
infidelity unless she can count on her to help reunite the family
and bring everyone home.
</P>
<P>
   Will Dolores overcome her fear of further loss and return to her
family? Will Nora survive the machinations of her jealous
classmates and win the contest? Nothing about ``Home Before Dark''
is surprising.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whenever Leonard Bernstein had to list his profession
on some official form, like his income tax returns, he did not
write composer, conductor, pianist or any other limiting term. He
called himself a musician. He liked the word's embracing quality
and venerable history. In earlier eras, all professional musicians
were composers as well as performers, not to mention teachers,
proselytizers, organizers and whatever else it took to keep the
tradition going.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in evaluating Bernstein, people still look at his
accomplishments separately. They argue over the quality of his
compositions, his conducting, his piano playing, even his legacy
with the New York Philharmonic, of which he was music director for
11 dynamic years, from 1958 until 1969, when he was made laureate
conductor. But viewed in toto, which is the way he viewed himself,
he was one of the most dominant musicians of this century. And the
best thing about the Lincoln Center Festival's current Bernstein
Celebration is the chance it provides to consider the wide scope,
and some little-explored corners, of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, who would have turned 80 on Aug. 25, died eight years
ago, enough time, perhaps, for a re-evaluation of his work to make
sense. While he was alive, his presence was too galvanizing. This
is the view of Jonathan Sheffer, a composer and conductor who will
direct the Eos Ensemble in a festival program called ``Literally
Bernstein'' on July 23 at Alice Tully Hall. In the program notes
for this concert, Sheffer compares the death of a ``towering
personality'' like Bernstein to the death of a parent, which ``may
be both tragic and the first opportunity for clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   This past week, the New York Philharmonic under Kurt Masur
offered two concerts as part of the celebration, presenting
Bernstein's first two symphonies, ``Jeremiah'' and ``The Age of
Anxiety,'' along with music by composers Bernstein championed, most
notably Copland and Mahler. Bernstein's early symphonies are the
efforts of a clearly gifted young musician to fashion American
jazz, Hebraic chant, Mahlerian angst and Stravinskian
propulsiveness into big, sweeping statements.
</P>
<P>
   How we react to them today probably depends upon whether they
strike us as the searching sound of an imperfect but impassioned
new voice or the slapdash product of an overreaching composer with
vacuum-cleaner ears. Bernstein will loom over a free concert friday
night on the Great Lawn of Central Park, an event officially
offered as part of the New York City 100 Centennial festivities.
The concert was jointly produced by the Lincoln Center Festival.
Skitch Henderson and the New York Pops, and the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra will get things going. Then lyricists Betty Comden and
Adolph Green will sing songs from the great show they wrote with
Bernstein, ``On the Town.'' Finally, Masur and the Philharmonic
will offer a tribute to two quintessential New Yorkers, Gershwin
and Bernstein. Masur will conduct Bernstein's Overture to
``Candide'' and the Symphonic Dances from ``West Side Story.'' I
bet that Bernstein would have preferred a program that also
included less familiar works. Even during festive outdoor concerts,
Bernstein liked to challenge listeners.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget a summer concert I heard him do with the New
York Philharmonic in a tent on the campus of C.W. Post College when
I was in high school in the mid-1960s. The program was Beethoven's
``Eroica'' Symphony and Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring.'' And in
Bernstein's readings, there was a striking reciprocity between the
Classical symphony, which he made sound audacious and modern, and
the path-breaking 1913 ballet, which was thrilling and terrifying,
yet seemed compositionally inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Other coming events in the festival promise more adventurous
offerings. In addition to the Eos Ensemble concert,
pianist-conductor Michael Barrett will direct a program called
``The Unknown Bernstein'' on July 20 at Alice Tully Hall,
presenting smaller-scaled works for voice, piano and chamber
ensemble. The Hamburg Ballet, in three performances at the New York
State Theater, on Wednesday and July 18, will give the United
States premiere of ``Bernstein Dances,'' with a score that uses
songs and music from all stages of Bernstein's career.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most intriguing events may be two symposiums at the
Kaplan Penthouse in Lincoln Center's Rose Building. The first, on
July 20, ``Leonard Bernstein as Student: Classical Education for
Musicians,'' will explore Bernstein's schooling and training. The
other, on July 23, is ``Leonard Bernstein as Teacher: The Young
People's Concerts and the Norton Lectures.'' This should provide a
helpful context for Bernstein's work, because everything he did was
driven by a passion, even a compulsion, to teach.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed the exhilaration of his teaching up close during the
summer of 1987 at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Mass. For
six days, Bernstein rehearsed a student orchestra in ``The Rite of
Spring,'' in preparation for a special concert in the Music Shed. I
was allowed to sit next to the violins for all the rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein walked in for the first session that summer on a hot
August afternoon, wearing jeans and a sweatshirt that had Harvard
spelled in Hebrew characters. Short of breath, stooped in the
shoulders, his sizable paunch sagging, he looked endearingly
unmythic. The students greeted him with applause, whoops and
bravos.
</P>
<P>
   First thing, Bernstein established the seriousness of the work
at hand, and the importance of the tradition he represented, by
explaining that the orchestra parts on all the music stands were
his own, a gift from his mentor, and Stravinsky's friend, Serge
Koussevitzky, who had always used them. ``So honor these parts,''
Bernstein instructed the orchestra with the gravity of a Talmudic
scholar. The young musicians were in awe.
</P>
<P>
   The rehearsals were exacting and detailed. Despite his penchant
for easily getting emotive and weepy, he was single-minded and
mentally sober, never asking for a particular passage to be
``anguished'' or ``joyous'' or anything so vague. All his
suggestions were explicit and musically referential.
</P>
<P>
   To the bass players he said at one point, ``That low tune should
be like Chaliapin singing.'' To a quartet of bassoons he explained
that a particular passage was not a fanfare. ``Ever heard a Russian
choir singing in elongated notes?'' he asked. And to a battery of
brass players during the fortissimo glissandi in the primordial
``Spring Rounds'' section, he said, ``This has to be an assortment
of groans and wails and troll sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   After two days, Bernstein and the students had worked in
exhausting detail through the first long part of this two-part
piece. Coming back from a rehearsal break (every 45 minutes or so,
Bernstein, having perspired right through his sweatshirt, needed to
change), he sensed that the young players could use a lift. So he
gave them a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' he said. ``Either we can play through
Part 1 for fun, no stopping, no matter what happens, I promise. Or
we can begin detailed work on Part 2.'' The students looked at each
tentatively at first, but soon the consensus among them was clear;
they wanted to begin work on Part 2, they wanted Bernstein to keep
teaching them, demanding of them and revealing the secrets of this
astounding piece. The fun of playing it would come soon enough.

STUDIO HYPE KINDLES MIXED SIGNALS ABOUT `SMOKE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miramax is happily hyping ``Smoke Signals'' as the first
(nationally distributed) film written, produced and directed by
Native Americans, and as such, it contains the expected amount of
stereotype-busting. But all the hype makes the movie seem more
special than it is.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's well-made, funny and poignant, it's hardly
Earth-shattering; it comes down to a story of father-and-son
conflict, with some elements of road movies and buddy movies thrown
in.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buddies is Victor Joseph (Adam Beach), a young Coeur
D'Alene Indian who has had a chip on his shoulder ever since his
father abandoned his family when he was 12. Victor is strong,
handsome with traditional flowing locks and an anti-social attitude
that keeps everyone at arm's length. Everyone, that is, except for
Thomas Build-the-Fire (Evan Adams), who has been inexorably linked
to Victor since they were rescued from a Bicentennial July Fourth
fire when they were babies.
</P>
<P>
   With his glasses, braids, oversized teeth and omnipresent nerdy
suit, Thomas looks like an Indian Urkel. His one physical virtue is
his lilting voice, which he uses to continue the Indian tradition
of oral storytelling _ except that he can never quite keep his
tales straight, and he's constantly telling them to Victor, who
doesn't really care.
</P>
<P>
   When word comes that Victor's father has died in Arizona, the
two young men travel together by bus to retrieve the body. Or
rather, the ashes _ the movie's title is the first sign that it's
big on fire metaphors, and it never misses a trick (Victor's father
even dies near Phoenix, a town named for a firebird). There, they
meet a young woman (Irene Bedard, the voice of ``Pocahontas'') who
befriended Victor's father and tries to help Victor come to terms
with their estrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Director Chris Eyre and screenwriter Sherman Alexie, who based
his script on several of his own short stories, are intent on
making this a mainstream entertainment; the buzz about Native
American filmmaking seems to distract from their purpose. Because
we all have fathers, some of whom have remained close, some of whom
have abandoned us, the father-son theme is far more universal than
all the ads and articles would have us believe.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie does take some amusing shots at movie representations of
Indians, ribbing Victor's stoicism, which he seems to have borrowed
from John Ford movies, and Thomas' attempts at ``Dances With
Wolves''-style mysticism. And there's a great running gag with
Leonard George as a ``traffic'' reporter on the Indians' desolate
Idaho reservation. But when Adams' beautiful voice is put to good
use reading Dick Lourie's poem ``Forgiving Our Fathers,'' you don't
have to be an Indian to relate. It's another example of how ``Smoke
Signals'' may be fine in execution, but isn't the revelation that
its studio wants you to expect.

   &LR;  EXPLOITING TELEVISION'S POWER
</P>
<P>
   The Young People's Concerts represent an entirely different
facet of Bernstein the teacher. And it's easy to poke fun at his
persona from these famous live-broadcast performances: Uncle Lenny,
the cool daddy of music education who will make it all clear for
us, or, in Tom Wolfe's memorable phrase, Bernstein, ``the village
explainer.''
</P>
<P>
   But looking at tapes of these concerts today reveals what an
astonishing achievement they were. Bernstein was the first great
artist to comprehend the power of television as an educational
medium, and he knew he had the perfect combination of telegenic
charisma and musical brilliance for the job. Nothing educational
television has done since has surpassed these broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for one, a program from the fall of 1964, ``What Is Sonata
Form?'' To begin, Bernstein walks to the podium and greets the
audience, filled with youngsters, by saying: ``It's good to be back
after a nice summer. And since you are all looking so bright and
ready for work, I decided to try something I've avoided for years.
Not because it's so difficult, but because so many words have been
spilled about it in music appreciation classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready for work? Cultural programming today is more concerned
with entertaining or even placating viewers than with asking them
to sit up, pay attention and work. Of course, Bernstein knew how to
make work fun, not just because he was so engaging, but also
because he made complex musical concepts understandable and
audible.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining sonata form, he can't avoid using what he calls
those ``nasty road map signs,'' the sectional terms he had ``never
been fond of'': exposition, development and recapitulation. But he
explains the overall concept in terms of simple three-part (ABA)
form, and boosts the confidence of his young listeners by giving
them a diversity of comprehensible examples, from nursery tunes to
a Bizet aria. SINGING A BEATLES SONG
</P>
<P>
   Just when he senses the kids need a charge, he uses a Beatles
song, ``And I Love Her,'' to illustrate a point, playing it on the
piano, singing it in his croaky baritone and inviting them to laugh
a bit at him, which they do. But as the camera pans the audience,
you see the face of enthralled children who get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he discusses the complex, gigantic form of the first
movement of Mozart's ``Jupiter'' Symphony, which he performs with
the Philharmonic twice, and very well indeed. Never in this program
do we hear one word about Mozart the Wunderkind or Mozart the
struggling Viennese composer. It's all close listening, analysis,
comparison and the joy of digging deeper into music.
</P>
<P>
   Other Young People's Concerts were similarly substantive.
Bernstein explored modern music, modal music, opera, jazz, the
music of Sibelius. He even did one program examining Beethoven's
rejected sketches for the Fifth Symphony and speculating as to why
he rejected them.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bernstein left the full-time Philharmonic post, he slowly
withdrew from the Young People's Concerts. Did he also sense that
television was already getting restless with substance? It's a
question that should be put to one panelist in the symposium about
the concerts: Roger Englander, the producer at CBS who was
responsible for these visionary broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's legacy as a conductor rests safely with his enormous
and indispensable recorded discography. But to assess the depth of
his legacy as a composer, his music will need greater exposure. A
little more tolerance in university circles would help too. Of
particular interest in this regard should be Sheffer's performance
of the seldom-heard Bernstein score to the Jerome Robbins ballet
``Dybbuk Variations,'' first performed in 1974 by the New York City
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of this entire program is to demonstrate the
sophisticated literary and intellectual aspects of Bernstein's
compositions,'' Sheffer said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to ``Dybbuk,'' which relates the Hebrew tale of a
young man and woman whose love and intended marriage had been sworn
to by their fathers, even before the children were born, Sheffer
added: ``I think it's one of Bernstein's most intensely composed
works. The form of each movement brilliantly reflects what is
happening in the story. It's rigorous, attentive to the numerology
of Hebrew alphabet and the mysticism of numbers. It will surprise
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Sheffer was taking a class with Bernstein, who was then
a guest professor at Harvard, when one day Bernstein showed up with
the just-completed score for ``Dybbuk'' in a four-hand piano
arrangement. With a student pianist to help out, Bernstein played
the score right through, Sheffer said. At the end, the giddy
composer leaped to his feet and shouted, ``Another Leonard
Bernstein triumph!''
</P>
<P>
   He was seldom so confident. All his life, Bernstein worried that
other musicians considered him a brilliant but superficial
Jack-of-all-trades.
</P>
<P>
   This struck me the only time I ever interviewed him, during
those ``Rite of Spring'' rehearsals at Tanglewood. Bernstein was
reluctant to do interviews just then, having just been burned by
Joan Peyser's tell-all, salacious, unauthorized biography. So to
win his confidence, I mentioned that I had studied with a respected
colleague of his, the pianist Leonard Shure. A MINI-TIRADE
</P>
<P>
   He seemed warmer for a moment, but immediately launched into a
mini-tirade about the way he was perceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get in trouble for doing everything,'' he said. ``The
composers don't consider me a real composer, the conductors don't
consider me a real conductor and the pianists don't consider me a
real pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   What was going on? Was he shamelessly fishing for a compliment?
Or was the world's most famous classical musician revealing his
true insecurity, thinking that I, no doubt, was another one of
those pianists who didn't consider him a real pianist.
</P>
<P>
   I answered by mentioning several of his recordings as a pianist
that I genuinely treasure, especially an arresting 1947 performance
of Copland's Piano Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein brightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one I like is my record of the Mozart Piano Quartets with
members of the Budapest Quartet,'' he said. ``Now that one is
good.''

SOME EXPS QUESTION EFFECTIVENESS OF MEGAN'S LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMELYN CRUZ LAT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Megan's Law, the measure requiring the police to
make information about convicted sex offenders public, remains
politically popular despite reports of vigilantism, noncompliance
and, most recently, a parolee who committed suicide after his
neighbors were notified of his criminal past.
</P>
<P>
   Even as critics say the law is causing problems, some
politicians are maneuvering for even tougher legislation in
California. More than 29 bills related to increased penalties for
sex offenders are working their way through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very popular law,'' said Elizabeth Schroeder,
associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union of
Southern California. ``These types of laws are easy to pass and
don't cost a whole lot of money, whereas true solutions to problems
require an incredible amount of resolve and public resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Megan's Law, named after a New Jersey girl murdered in
1994 by a paroled sex offender who lived in her neighborhood, the
police are allowed to notify neighbors about convicted sex
offenders living nearby if they believe the offenders pose a danger
to the community.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Michael Allen Patton, the parolee who committed
suicide, the Santa Rosa police said they were following the law in
identifying him as a high-risk sex offender in a notice distributed
to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, apparently depressed about the flier, hanged himself
Sunday in a redwood grove on Santa Rosa Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said it was inevitable that someday, some child
molester would kill himself after his name and picture was
distributed in a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will become something common,'' she said.
``However, it ought to give pause to other police departments
considering public notification.''
</P>
<P>
   California has required freed sex offenders to register with law
enforcement agencies since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, state lawmakers authorized the police to notify
residents when high-risk sex offenders moved into a community, and
a hot line was set up to allow criminal records checks of suspected
offenders. A high-risk offender is defined as someone with a record
of multiple, violent sexual offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on the law and crime said that since increasingly
aggressive measures to notify the public have been used, reports of
vigilantism and parolees refusing to register or moving around have
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement officers in California have reported that
prior to Megan's Law, they knew pretty much where all the sex
offenders in their community lived,'' Schroeder said. ``Now, people
are starting to go underground.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem of ``Megan's flight'' has gotten worse since the law
went into effect in the fall of 1996, according to a state
Department of Justice task force that keeps tabs on sex offenders
who fail to register.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,600 parolees in California are considered high-risk sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   However, as many as 40 percent of convicted sex offenders have
failed to register. And many who appear on registration lists have
since moved to unknown addresses, have died or have gone back to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   One legal expert said Megan's Law might give the public peace of
mind, but it did not necessarily prevent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have any hard data to either support Megan's
Law or to disprove it,'' said Louis Yablonsky, emeritus professor
of criminology at California State University at Northridge.
``There's no question that for the general populace, the law gives
people a feeling that something positive and constructive is being
done about the dreadful problem of sex offenders and child abuse.
But this does not necessarily mean that it is controlling and
diminishing the sex offender problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Policies should focus on prevention and treatment, said Wendy
Kaminer, attorney and public policy fellow at Radcliffe Public
Policy Institute in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect that (Megan's Law) will be terribly effective
in protecting children,'' she said. ``A lot of people simply won't
register. They will go underground and will not get the treatment
that they need.''

`PATIENCE AND SARAH': A FLAWED CHAMBER OPERA THAT STILL WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Composer Paula M. Kimper and librettist Wende
Persons, whose three-act chamber opera ``Patience and Sarah''
received its world premiere on Tuesday night as part of Lincoln
Center Festival '98, believe that the opera is the first to portray
an openly romantic relationship between two self-affirming women.
</P>
<P>
   They may be right. Not that opera isn't filled with countless
instances of bonded, loving women singing gloriously in duet. But
these relationships are seldom explicitly romantic unless one of
the women plays a boy, as in ``Der Rosenkavalier.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the female voice is the glory of opera. So even though, say,
Bellini's ``Norma'' turns on the rivalry between a Druid priestess
and her confidante over a handsome Roman consul, the soaring duets
for the women reveal the subtext of the story _ that theirs is the
real loving relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to portray lesbian love openly is new to opera, which has
not exactly been in the vanguard of social change. This must
account for the pre-premiere response to ``Patience and Sarah,''
which was commissioned and developed by American Opera Projects
Inc. and played to a sold-out opening night house at the John Jay
College Theater. Though the opera has flaws, it was impossible not
to be moved by the sight of so many excited, eager women in the
audience, many of them in couples.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the proudly lesbian creators had a sure bet in the
story, taken from a novel of the same name by the late Isabel
Miller that has gained cultish popularity. The novel was in turn
inspired by the lives of two early 19th-century women from Puritan
families in Connecticut who settled together on a small farm in New
York's Greene County, Mary Ann Willson, a painter with some
inherited money, and her companion, known as Miss Brundage.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is strongest at depicting the dangerous yet ecstatic
courtship between these bold women. When the tomboyish Sarah (the
Miss Brundage character), dressed in breeches, boots and a rawhide
coat and affectingly portrayed by the mezzo-soprano Elaine Valby,
shows up to deliver firewood to the fine house where Patience lives
with her stern brother, Edward, and his obedient wife, the
well-educated Patience, sung by the formidable soprano Lori
Phillips, is completely smitten.
</P>
<P>
   The opera effectively depicts the perils of their relationship:
Sarah's naivete in talking about her powerful love too openly to
her possessive younger sister; the beating she sustains from her
brutish father when he finds out; the weakness Patience gives in to
when her brother forbids her to see Sarah again.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Persons' libretto is mostly effective, appropriately simple
in prose and even spiked with moments of wry humor. When Edward
tells his sister that he thought she was going to pray hard to
overcome her sinful desires, Patience answers, ``I meant to pray
last summer; I got as far as my knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kimper's score is earnest, but often misconceived. She calls
the work a ``folk opera,'' and its strongest musical moments were
when it sounded like onY+Q!MQA% !e59M9M &QC; 9M UQ5M-%5AIIUQ &QC; Q!MQ59M

FOURTH OUTING IN THE SERIES SERVES UP MORE OF THE SAME _ WHICH
ISN'T SO BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it seems strange to think that ``Lethal Weapon 4'' is part of
a franchise that's now more than a decade old, it's even stranger
to realize how safe these ``Weapons'' have become. Once a mean
series with some funny moments, it has become a comedy series with
some mean moments.
</P>
<P>
   When Mel Gibson first played wildman cop Martin ``Lethal
Weapon'' Riggs, Riggs was a near-suicidal psychotic, sticking guns
in his mouth and keeping folks from killing themselves by jumping
off buildings with them. Now he's the class clown, doing everything
but sticking ``kick me'' signs on his partner's back.
</P>
<P>
   And he's growing a sensitive side _ he's gonna be a daddy,
although his companion Lorna Cole (Rene Russo from ``Lethal Weapon
3'') looks less like she's weeks from delivery and more like she
just decided to stuff that embarrassing load of dirty underwear
under her sweater. And partner Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is
gonna be a granddad. This may be the noisiest movie to ever have
people cooing ``how sweet'' before the final credits.
</P>
<P>
   And boy, is it noisy, which isn't to say it's boring. It's about
as much stupid fun as you'd expect, maybe more after the
forgettable ``Lethal 3.'' Once again, Richard Donner directs with a
kick-out-the-jams attitude that simply says, if you keep things
moving fast enough, there won't be time for anyone to notice how
dumb they are. And, yes, when the movie hits the brakes, especially
in scenes in a dentist's office and the inevitable maternity ward,
it looks pretty dumb.
</P>
<P>
   If by now you're impatient to read some plot details, this
probably isn't the movie for you. More and more, the plots in this
series are beside the point; suffice to say that this one involves
some Chinese immigrant smugglers, a slave ring, some counterfeiting
and some very important gangsters. But really, the plot's just an
excuse to get from place to place _ or rather, chase to chase.
</P>
<P>
   Donner makes sparing use of Asian action star Jet Li, who plays
a formidable villain in his first English-language (and first
bad-guy) role. It may seem that Li is being underused, but his
whipcrack-fast speed may simply be too much for a Hollywood camera
at this point _ even in slow motion, this guy looks like he's going
faster than the speed of light, and he's really too much for the
aging Gibson to handle. To the script's credit, it acknowledges
this, but as we've seen before, no ``Lethal Weapon'' villain is
indestructible.
</P>
<P>
   If we don't see enough of Li, it's partly because of the
top-heaviness of the script, which is typical of the series _ every
new entry has added new characters, such as Joe Pesci's annoying
twerp Leo Getz and Russo's Lorna, and now Chris Rock is on board as
Lee Butters, a young detective who seems unusually fond of
Murtaugh. Put that many people into the mix, and someone's gonna
get cheated _ and that's just about everyone except Gibson and
Glover, whose chemistry remains the best thing about the series.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that and the action, which is often preposterous but never
yawn-inducing. The litmus test here comes when Gibson (OK, his
stunt double) is skiing down the freeway on the bottom side of a
dining-room table with Glover and a bad guy in hot pursuit. If that
makes you roll your eyes, you'd better skip Part 4. The rest of us
will be sitting there munching popcorn, adrenalin rushing and
brains happily turned off.

FLYING TO MAINE FOR A LUNCH OF LOBSTER ROLLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: optional sidebar at end of article) 
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The thing of it is not so much that thanks to my
neighbor, Howard Tedoff, we ended up flying to Bar Harbor, Maine,
just to eat some lobster rolls on a recent Saturday, but that we
got to experience rich man's time.
</P>
<P>
   A very long time ago, when I had an old third-hand Chevy with
cat's-eye brake lights that meant more to me than any car I have
since owned, my friends and I would leave Manhattan for what we
would think of as a day in the country and go up to Yonkers, N.Y.,
to have hot-fudge sundaes at the Adventurer's Inn and then play
miniature golf.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I was relatively poor back then, I think of those
outings as examples of rich man's time, when you can make things up
as you go along and squander time in the pursuit of whims.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that is what I thought wHen Howard, who lives three
floors below me, asked me if I wanted to go flying with him in his
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where to?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh?'' I asked, not really knowing why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh is a nice flight,'' he said and suggested I might
also want to think about Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay. ``They
serve soft-shell crabs there by the bushel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We agreed I would come up with a destination by the time we left
on the following Saturday, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the soft-shell crabs he had mentioned, or maybe it
was the newspaper article I read about lobsters being at their most
delicious for having just molted that led me to think of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   I like Maine, and it lay far enough away to make for a
sufficiently extravagant one-day ramble. I recalled how last year,
a friend who lives in Boston had raved on quite a bit about finding
the greatest lobster roll in the world somewhere in Penobscot Bay.
</P>
<P>
   I called her, and she said absolutely I should fly to Bar Harbor
and then take a ferry to Frenchboro and look for Lunt's deli, the
home of the magnificent lobster roll. She said I should wash it
down with Moxie, the regional soft drink that traces its ancestry
back to 1840. Realizing that every journey needs a quest, it seemed
that lobster roll and Moxie would do fine.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the weather permitted, and at 8:15 on the
appointed Saturday morning we drove from Manhattan's West Side to
the Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. Howard showed polite
enthusiasm for the brunch that lay ahead, but it was quite clear
that for him the real thrill was in the flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait until you see Penobscot Bay from a small plane.'' he
said. ``It is unbelievable. It is amazing.'' He has been flying for
20 years, and not only does he love the experience and sensations,
he wants other people to love them, too. He can talk about clouds
as gardeners talk about flowers, commenting on their size and
texture, and on the shade they cast on grasslands or water or wheat
or towns.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 o'clock, we were up, heading northeast, crossing the Hudson
near the Tappan Zee Bridge. The plane, a Cessna Skylane, was a
single-engine four seater. I sat next to Howard, and we talked
through the microphones on our helmets. Occasionally, our plane
would be called by the air traffic controllers who monitored our
flight to its destination, passing us along as we entered different
areas of radar.
</P>
<P>
   All the communications were wonderfully polite. We were
addressed by the registration letters on the fuselage, 7304T, only
the ``T'' was prounced ``tango,'' just as Smilin' Jack, the
comic-strip flyboy, would have said it. The voices from the ground
would occasionally break in and say, ``Seven three oh four Tango,
there's an aircraft approaching at 2,500 feet at 11 o'clock.''
Howard would say ``Thank you'' or ``Much obliged,'' and sure
enough, pretty soon we would see the plane 3,000 feet below us.
</P>
<P>
   Among the instruments in the cockpit was one that used a little
electronic screen to show us exactly where we were, with the
nearest airports marked. That was comforting, and so was another
device that scanned the region for storms. There was nothing of the
sort around. Indeed, there was not a cloud to be seen, which made
me feel a little bad for Howard. ``Maybe we'll have some clouds
when we reach the shore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The voice on the radio said that there was some turbulence at
5,000 feet, but that the air was smoother at 6,000. Howard asked me
my preference. I tried to read his mind, and guessed that he would
like to fly bumpy. ``Turbulence,'' I said, and from his smile I saw
I had guessed right.
</P>
<P>
   We were buffeted for a while, and it enhanced the sensation of
flying. From the controls, I could tell that we were flying at
groundspeeds that fluctuated with the winds from 140 to 165 miles
an hour. With no clouds whooshing by, you could not feel when the
plane was going faster or slower.
</P>
<P>
   The gizmos and the helmets and the radio were fun, but the best
thing was the view of the land spreading out, which looks very
different from 5,000 feet than it does from commercial planes that
fly much higher. It struck me that there was an awful lot of
forest, more than I would have expected, and that there seemed to
be more golf courses than baseball fields.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there were many more airports around than you notice when
you ride on the ground. Another thing was the Connecticut River,
whose meandering modest width struck me as very English.
</P>
<P>
   From our altitude, you could easily see cars, and sometimes you
could even see people, though you could not tell if they were happy
or not.
</P>
<P>

   FINDING PRIVATE PLANES IN PUBLIC PLACES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A number of flight schools in the New York metropolitan area
will rent planes of varying sizes to licensed pilots. Hourly rates
for time spent in the air can range from $50 to $170, depending on
the size of the aircraft. Charter flights cost considerably more
(from $1,500 to more than $4,000, depending on factors like
distance and waiting time for pilots) because of federal
regulations about insurance and plane size for such trips. Here is
a selection of companies that offer airplane rentals.

TURNER PRIZE NOMINATIONS: NO OUTRAGE THIS TIME  
 VICTORIA AND ALBERT RENOVATION  
 TATE SEEKS A VAN DYCK PORTRAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Tate Gallery's announcement of the four finalists
for its Turner Prize, awarded annually to an outstanding British
artist under 50, has in recent years provoked outrage in the
contemporary art world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, many people were upset that the nominees were all
women; in other years, experts were infuriated because painters
were not represented. Three years ago, the nomination and victory
of Damien Hirst was criticized because he had created installations
with dead animals.
</P>
<P>
   But when this year's names were released last week, there was no
outcry. The finalists included one man (a painter) and three women,
and there was little to get upset about in their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't try for such a well-rounded list,'' said Nicholas
Serota, director of the Tate. ``It just turned out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The four finalists for the $32,000 prize are Chris Ofili, a
painter; Sam Taylor-Wood, who works in film, video and photography;
Cathy de Monchaux, a conceptual artist, and Tacita Dean, who works
mostly in 16-millimeter film. All have had their work shown in
high-profile places, including the much-talked-about ``Sensation''
show at the Royal Academy here and at last year's Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest is Ofili, 29, whose work was shown in the
``Sensation'' show. Ofili, whose parents came to England from
Nigeria, examines issues of black culture and sexual stereotyping.
Recently, he has been incorporating lumps of elephant excrement in
his canvases, inspired, he has said, by a visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor-Wood, 31, is perhaps the best known of the group. Her
work focuses mainly on human relationships. At the Venice Biennale,
she showed ``Atlantic,'' made up of video images in three monitors:
a woman's face, the woman sitting with a man in a restaurant, and a
close-up of the man's fidgeting hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Monchaux, 37, is known for her wall-mounted sculptures
exploring themes relating to the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dean, 32, is fascinated by the sea, which is a central theme
in much of her work. One of her recent films, ``Disappearance at
Sea,'' was inspired by the story of Donald Crow-hust, an amateur
yachtsman who vanished whilg sailing in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of works by the finalists will be shown at the
Tate from Oct. 28 through Jan. 10, 1999. The winner will be
announced Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The V and A's Ticket
</P>
<P>
   The Victoria and Albert Museum is hoping to receive $36.8
million from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help pay for renovations
of its much-loved British Galleries. The galleries, which are 10
percent of the museum's exhibition space, include its famous period
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   They have not been altered since 1945, when Sir Leigh Ashton, a
former director, arranged them chronologically. The renovation
project is expected to cost about $50 million; $12.8 million has
already been raised from private sources. An announcement of the
Lottery Fund award is expected on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still the only major London museum that has not had a
major lottery grant,'' said Dr. Alan Borg, director of the Victoria
and Albert.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries explore the history of art and design from the
reigns of Henry VII through Victoria, and include 3,000 objects by
every important name in British design from Christopher Dresser to
Charles Rennie Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are objects produced by influential workshops and
factories, including Dwight's Fulham Pottery, the Mortlake tapestry
workshops, Bow Porcelain, Spitalfields Silk Workshops and
Wedgewood, as well as items associated with monarchs. On view is
Henry VIII's writing cabinet and James II's wedding suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These galleries are worn out,'' Borg said. ``We've acquired a
lot of new objects over the last 50 years that haven't been
properly shown. We've also acquired a lot of knowledge about how
spaces can best be designed to suit different audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the lottery money doesn't come through, Borg said, the
renovation will go ahead, with a team already in place to do the
work. Alistair Gourlay, a London firm, will be the architect, and
two London designers will execute the designs of the spaces: David
Mlinaric, known for his renovation of Spencer House, and Dinah
Casson, an experienced museum designer.
</P>
<P>
   The plans include the installation of audio and video equipment
as well as new ways to show delicate textiles and costumes that the
museum has not been able to exhibit because of poor climate
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period rooms will be arranged so you can actually be able
to walk through them,'' Dr. Borg said. ``Visitors will be able to
take a route so they can hit 50 of our greatest masterpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The galleries are expected to close for renovations by the end
of the month, and the work is expected to be complete in the fall
of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Tate's Fair Lady
</P>
<P>
   A full-length portrait of Lady Lucy Percy, Countess of Carlisle,
painted by van Dyck around 1636, was withdrawn by Christie's just
days before an auction Wednesday because the Tate Gallery wants to
acquire the work.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was of art and objects from Wentworth Woodhouse in
Yorkshire, which were being sold by the Trustees of Olive, Countess
Fitzwilliam, sellers and heirs to the contents of Wentworth
Woodhouse. The government-owned Tate approached the trustees,
offering to accept the painting in lieu of taxes the estate owes.
Christie's estimates that the portrait is worth about $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the nation's interest that the painting should come
into the public domain,'' said Serota, the Tate's director.
</P>
<P>
   The Tate has only one van Dyck portrait, of the Countess of
Spencer. But the one of the Countess of Carlisle is considered much
better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the museum and the trustees can agree on a price for the
painting, the final decision is up to Chris Smith, the British
Culture Secretary, who oversees museum commissions.

BYTE-SIZED NUGGETS FROM THE INTERNET

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUTOMOBILE ART: People do strange things, and the Internet is
their platform.
</P>
<P>
   Take Don Hermes of Novota, Calif., and his Army Man Car. Hermes
has glued hundreds of plastic soldiers and figures to his Honda
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Making it more bizarre: He has created a page
(www.crl.com./\Phermes/car) detailing his project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had wanted to make a statement with my car,'' Hermes said.
``It's just a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermes, a computer programmer, is pondering a title for the
project. His choices include ``Battle for the soul of a piece of
Japanese steel'' and ``When you write code for 15 hours straight,
you've just got to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter choice makes the most sense of this project.
</P>
<P>
   ADDRESSES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS: Is it really good to have an
online database of personal and e-mail addresses of more than
12,000 entertainers, athletes, artists and politicians?
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hate mail saying we were members of the paparazzi,
which we're not,'' said Jordan McAuley, president of Los
Angeles-based J&AMP;M Publications, which produces Celebrity Addresses
Online (celebrity-addresses.com) for free or for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand how people are concerned, but our address
collection has helped many people'' reach celebrities for charities
or worthy causes, McAuley said.
</P>
<P>
   J&AMP;M Publications has published celebrity address lists since
1993, providing addresses to trade magazines and publishing houses.
Moving to the Web will allow more real-time updates, McAuley said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what this world needs: Cyber-''paparazzi.''
</P>
<P>
   SO LONG, SINGING COWBOY: The best tribute to the late Roy Rogers
is at Alan Davis' Happy Trails Web site
(home.earthlink.net/\Padavis1).
</P>
<P>
   Davis' site has a ``Happy Trails'' sound file and lyrics to
Rogers and Dale Evans' signature song. It also links to several
other Rogers sites, including the King of the Cowboys' official
museum site (www.royrogers.com).
</P>
<P>
   On his site, where Davis is posting condolences he receives,
Davis writes: ``It may be a cliche, but Roy was truly an American
original. The world is a better place because of the messages he
taught children and adults.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Tell the kids that you need help in the garden this summer.
</P>
<P>
   No response? Tell them you want to make tussie-mussies or
hollyhock dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Some response? Mention bugs and pond creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Let them know that these topics are a few of the kid-friendly,
hands-on gardening subjects available for children at Garden.com
(www.garden.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Austin-based site has a series of projects that appear as a
regular feature called Kids' Gardening Camp. The projects focus on
the education beyond gardening, from vocabulary to reading
comprehension to measurement and math.
</P>
<P>
   This week's project is growing a vine tunnel.

SPORTS COLUMN: FLOPPING IS AN ART FORM  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ I once met a man who had died 100 times. He lived in
Rome and was a writer or a waiter, something like that. To
supplement his income, he specialized in dying.
</P>
<P>
   He had tumbled down the Spanish steps, he had drowned in the
Trevi Fountain, he had been shot in the Piazza Navona (a terribly
painful place to be shot). Whenever they needed a victim, Italian
film directors would ring him up and tell him to start flopping.
</P>
<P>
   He could quiver, he could gasp, he could moan, he could groan.
He was a kindred soul to the World Cup soccer players, the greatest
collection of fakers and con-men and whiners I have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Take Slaven Bilic, for example. This Croatian defender will
never win an Academy Award for subtlety (whoever did, come to think
of it?) but he is the reason Laurent Blanc, one of France's most
sportsmanlike players, has been suspended for Sunday's World Cup
final against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   So convincingly did Bilic grab his chest, his eyes, his throat,
searching for the source of his inner pain, that Jose Manuel Garcia
Arranda, the fascinated Spanish referee, promptly waved a red card
at him. France had to play nearly 20 minutes a man short,
preserving its 2-1 lead, and now must play Sunday' final without
its steady defender.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Blanc had waved a handful of knuckles in the general
direction of Bilic, but the Croatian did such a gross impersonation
of a man fighting off invisible demons that Blanc is automatically
suspended, with no recourse to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the friendly folks from FIFA, the world soccer
body, not yet evolved to civilized smoking controls at stadiums,
they have not discovered contemporary film review to undo
injustices. The ref got suckered. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible about it,'' Bilic said afterward. ``If I could
do something about it, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilic is a thorough professional, 30 years old, currently with
Everton in the English league. He has a thick mop of curly hair,
wears an earring, and has the roguish smile of a young Donald
Sutherland, backed up with muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is a great player,'' Bilic said. ``He hit me, I
tried to defend myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Where exactly did Bilic get hit? ``He hit me somewhere around
here,'' Bilic said, gesturing in the general direction of his chin.
``It's hard to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no noticeable welts or cuts or gashes or bruises
above his shirt line. He seemed fine. ``He hit me, I reacted,''
Bilic said. ``That's part of the game, to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting is surely part of modern soccer. The Argentines were
falling on the ground during their anthem. The Italians were
flailing when they got off the bus. The Bulgarians were calling
their concierge to complain about enemy cleats. There are allegedly
yellow cards for diving, but the players know the tactic pays.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the French are not slouches at faking it. My
personal favorite is Emmanuel Petit, with the blond ponytail and
the elaborate mannerisms from a remake of the Three Musketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Athos or Porthos, or maybe it was Harpo, fell to
the ground with an enemy sword clattering on both sides of his poor
punctured body? Kind of scary. But then he would jump back into the
fray, shouting, ``Eet ees only a flesh wound.'' In soccer, it is
almost always less than a flesh wound.
</P>
<P>
   I keep imagining Michael Jordan going into convulsions every
time somebody came near him. (Michael doesn't have to, you say,
he's got the refs looking out for him. Good point.) I'd like to
have seen good old Lawrence Taylor performing the DelPiero 1{
gainer, or good old Mark Messier doing the Ortega double spasm, or
good old Cal Ripken doing the Stoichkov death rattle.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, the American soccer players can't dive,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Laurent Blanc recalled the moment he got pulled into
somebody else's sidewalk art performance. He's a 33-year-old pro
with Olympic of Marseilles, one of the first French players to
toughen himself in the Italian and Spanish leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a free kick for us, so I don't see why I would hit
him,'' Blanc said of Bilic. ``I threw no elbow, no feet. He played
his game to get me thrown out. He came up to me afterward and said
he feels sorry he got me thrown out of the final. I guess I should
have hit him right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, there's no fighting in soccer, just a lot of wholesale
flopping. I haven't seen that guy from Rome in years. I hope he is
making a living coaching these actors.

`MY OWN COUNTRY': FAILS TO RISE ABOVE DISEASE-OF-THE-WEEK FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mira Nair, the director from India, seems a bold choice to make
a disease-of-the-week television film. With ``My Own Country,'' on
Showtime's Sunday night schedule, she puts her own imaginative and
exotic stamp on the lumpen form, conjuring moments that satisfy the
eye and the heart. Ultimately, though, that form's limitations
defeat Ms. Nair (whose movies include ``Mississippi Masala'' and
``Salaam Bombay!'') and her familiar cast.
</P>
<P>
   This film is inspired by the true story (naturally) of a
dedicated doctor named Abraham Verghese, who confronts AIDS just as
it appears in Johnson City, Tenn., in the mid-1980s. AIDS, in this
version of reality, turns nearly everyone in its path into a noble
and eloquent martyr. The simplistic notion that the disease wraps
people in a cloak of polyester holiness, dispatching them to death
with self-satisfied smiles, trivializes the suffering it recounts.
</P>
<P>
   A quick prologue introduces Verghese _ born in Ethiopia to
Indian parents, trained in India and the United States _ who was an
intern in Johnson City. As the story actually begins, he has
returned to Tennessee with his Indian-born wife, hoping to find a
real home at last (hence the film's title, taken from Verghese's
1994 book about his experience). He has become the local hospital's
single AIDS expert: ``It's my only chance to play hero.''
</P>
<P>
   The good doctor is played by Naveen Andrews, who was the
romantic Sikh in ``The English Patient'' and the pleasure-seeking
prince in Ms. Nair's ``Kama Sutra.'' He looks appropriately dashing
and sincere as he eases the burden of his patients, who include
Glenne Headly, Hal Holbrook and Swoosie Kurtz, all of whom portray
heterosexuals whose contraction of the disease is plausibly
explained. Most of the film's gay characters remain even more
sketchily drawn than the straight ones, although Sean Hewitt and
William Webster _ as a middle-aged couple, deeply decent and deeply
in love _ manage to convey genuine emotion and courage.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning Ellora Patnaik turns the doctor's wife, Rajani,
into the film's one fully realized character. On paper, Rajani is
another stock figure: the lonely woman left at home with the
children while her husband marches forth to his great works. But
her eyes speak of soul-searing pain with an eloquence that the
script, by Jim Leonard Jr. and Sooni Taraporevala, never even hints
at.
</P>
<P>
   What really sets ``My Own Country'' apart is its visual
richness. As shot by Dion Beebe and designed by Phillip Barker, the
film thrills the eye with vivid colors in unexpected places. The
reds and greens of Rajani's traditional Indian clothing reappear in
furniture, on walls, on leaves and flowers, and even in the
intensified skies over Johnson City (portrayed, with cinematic
magic, by Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   Despite her palette, though, Ms. Nair can't create art on a
paint-by-numbers canvas. Like her hero, she doesn't make this alien
territory her own.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTH IN ADVERSITY: For his first film as a director, Dennis
Quaid has decided to stick with a reliable formula, a tale of a
salt-of-the-earth family that finds strength in the face of
dreadful adversity. Not only does ``Everything That Rises,'' airing
8 p.m. ET Sunday on TNT, aim unashamedly for the heartstrings, but
it also finds them and plunks out a pretty fair rendition of ``Home
on the Range.''
</P>
<P>
   The range is in Montana, and a piece of it has been owned by the
Clay family for generations. But someone has said a discouraging
word: debt. Jim Clay (Quaid) is in it up to his Stetson. He stands
to lose his vast acreage and his vaster pride when his son
(14-year-old Ryan Merriman) is severely injured in an accident.
Thanks to Jim's loving wife (Mare Winningham) and his devoted ranch
hand (Harve Presnell), the Clays prevail.
</P>
<P>
   There are no surprising twists in this script, by Mark Spragg,
but the ride is scenic, and the actors, especially Presnell, find
the souls of their characters (although Quaid may have been too
distracted as director and star to modulate his own performance).
The climatic sequence takes place at a rodeo. Will the Clay team
beat the odds? You'll guess. But didn't you guess the outcome of
the competition at the end of ``Babe'' and cry anyhow? Keep your
hanky handy.

CLINTON'S MESSAGE WILL CONTINUE TO RESONATE THROUGHOUT CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 12)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Americans, who are accustomed to their
presidents traversing the globe and making solemn pronouncements
about U.S. relations with other nations, Bill Clinton's journey
through China probably was little more than a blip on the radar
screen of history.
</P>
<P>
   It could be seen as just another stop on the busy schedule of a
peripatetic president who attended an economic summit in England in
the late spring and who will visit with Boris YeltsIn in Russia in
early autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of Chinese, especially the young, Clinton's
trip was of greater significance. His message that democracy and
freedom are an inevitable part of China's future will resonate
through that vast country for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Long after Clinton's presidency has faded, there will be Chinese
who recall the excitement of hearing his televised policy
discussion with President Jiang Zemin and his address to students
at Beijing University. They will continue to be inspired by the
ideas set forth in their country by the leader of the world's most
powerful democracy.
</P>
<P>
   That should be especially true for those Chinese who have feared
that hope for a better way of life was destroyed in Tiananmen
Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Jiang directly on national television, Clinton noted
that he and the Chinese leader continue to disagree about the
``meaning'' of what happened in that tragic confrontation between
young dissidents and government military units.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe and the American people believe,'' said Clinton,
``that the use of force and the tragic loss of life was wrong. I
believe and the American people believe that freedom of speech,
association and religion are, as recognized by the U.N. charter,
the right of people everywhere and should be protected by their
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who have lived under dictatorship rather than
participatory democracy, it can be an intoxicating experience to
think of a day in the future when they will be able to vote and
freely express their political views without fear of reprisal. If
Clinton's forecast proves accurate, the young Chinese who heard his
message will eventually fulfill the dream of those idealistic
martyrs who died in Tiananmen Square nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As if to demonstrate that such monumental change can occur,
Clinton next will visit Russia, where individuals retain vivid
memories of the long, bleak era in which their society was totally
dominated by Soviet totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, American leaders in various fields, including
nine presidents, encouraged people in the Soviet Union and in its
Eastern European satellites to cast off communist dictatorship and
seek freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It finally happened in the Soviet era of Mikhail Gorbachev and
Boris Yeltsin and the American era of Ronald Reagan and George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In China, it might happen in the era of Jiang Zemin, who appears
to be a more enlightened and progressive leader than his
predecessors and who gave permission for Clinton's message to be
broadcast nationally to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was chastised by some American politicians and
columnists for refusing to be more critical of Jiang and for
failing to inject himself and the United States into the
50-year-old dispute over Taiwan's claim to be an independent
country. In addition, he was accused of putting the economic
interests of America's great exporting industries ahead of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   He may, indeed, have done that because he is convinced that
trade and economic development are the keys to success in the 21st
century and that they will help produce more humane living
conditions in countries like China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is an accommodator. He is not a master of
confrontational politics. It would have been easy for him to
grandstand by attacking China's leaders and casting his lot with
Taiwan, but he decided it was more important to build a cordial
relationship between America and the most populous nation on earth.
</P>
<P>
   History must decide whether he was right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Since Theodore Roosevelt sailed to Panama in 1906 to witness the
construction of his majestic masterpiece, the canal between the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, presidents have found it profitable,
from the standpoint of international diplomacy and domestic
politics, to journey abroad and promote democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the trips have simply constituted gestures of goodwill.
Others have resulted in substantive agreements that improved the
climate for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many words he uttered during his nine-day journey,
Clinton did not leave behind a single defining phrase that
distilled the symbolic significance of his journey and his message.
</P>
<P>
   In his rhetoric, there was nothing comparable to memorable
phrases spoken by two former presidents in divided Berlin during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy electrified the citizens of that beleaguered
city in 1963 when he declared: ``All free men, wherever they may
live, are citizens of Berlin and, therefore, as a free man, I take
pride in the words, `Ich bin ein Berliner (I am a Berliner).'''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, Ronald Reagan achieved a similar impact
when, standing beside the wall erected by communists to divide the
city, he demanded, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Phrases that linger in the human consciousness are those that
cut dramatically through hyperbole and, in simple, direct language,
summarize the magic of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know what, if any, words or phrases the
Chinese might recall from Clinton's visit. But his message should
be clear because it created a vivid vision of what could happen in
China's future.

   &UR; TRACKING `ARMAGEDDON' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The most jittery place in town this week is at Walt
Disney Co. whose most expensive film ever, ``Armageddon,'' opened
to a disappointing box office and faces an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Although box office receipts for ``Armageddon,'' which opened
for the Fourth of July weekend, reached a respectable figure, $54.2
million over the holiday, it was below Disney's expectations. The
last two Fourth of July blockbusters were ``Men in Black,'' which
last year took in $79 million in its first five days, and
``Independence Day,'' which grossed $85 million over the same
period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A strong opening was crucial to the momentum of ``Armageddon''
because of the film's huge cost _ at least $150 million, and
possibly far more, with $75 million spent in worldwide marketing.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Disney executives even more nervous are two films
opening this weekend, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``Small Soldiers.''
Both seek the same audience ``Armageddon'' does _ boys and young
men _ and the executives fear that these movies may shift its
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very competitive,'' said Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of
``Armageddon.'' ``Our picture has to have real staying power.
That's what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon,'' directed by Michael Bay and starring Bruce
Willis as a deep-core oil driller who leads a roughneck crew
seeking to destroy an asteroid on a collision course with Earth,
was hurt by several factors. Most important, a similar film, ``Deep
Impact,'' about a comet on a collision course with Earth, opened
two months ago and has emerged as a success, with $137 million
grossed so far. Also, the reviews for ``Armageddon'' were scathing,
although most teen-age boys don't follow the recommendations of
film critics.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, acknowledged, ``If I
read some of those reviews, I probably wouldn't go.'' He insisted,
though, that ``Armageddon'' would earn a profit, largely because of
the overseas audience, which is expected to be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer, one of Hollywood's most successful producers, made
it clear that the critics' reaction upset him. ``I made a different
picture than the one they saw _ I made a real entertaining popcorn
movie, and they didn't get that,'' he said. ``The same critic who
likes `My Dinner With Andre' is not going to have the same response
to `Armageddon.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I make popular entertainment,'' added Bruckheimer, whose other
recent films include ``The Rock'' and ``Con Air.'' ``If critics
don't like popular entertainment, they shouldn't be reviewing it.
Critics who review classical music and opera don't review popular
music, do they?''
</P>
<P>
   But the head of a rival studio, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the disappointing early tally for ``Armageddon''
was not the fault of the critics or even the film itself. He said
the blame should be placed on ``Deep Impact,'' which was made by
Dreamworks/Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the lesson is of `Armageddon,''' he said.
``Don't be second.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCREAMING AGAIN  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Jamie Lee Curtis, then 19, made her acting
debut as the scream queen Laurie Strode, who was stalked by a
masked, knife-wielding maniac in ``Halloween.'' The film, directed
by John Carpenter, with in-joke references to other horror films
and plenty of scares, was an unexpected hit.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Halloween' is the movie of my career,'' said Ms. Curtis, who
added that when she walked down the street or went to the market,
someone inevitably asked: What happened to Laurie?
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Ms. Curtis proposed a 20th-anniversary
``Halloween'' sequel to Bob Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax with
his brother, Harvey, and head of Dimension Films, the company's
genre unit, which made ``Scream,'' ``Scream 2'' and ``The Crow.''
Bob Weinstein, who saw the original ``Halloween'' at the Eighth
Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village, when he was 23, quickly
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater was packed, and it was the scariest movie
experience I've ever had,'' he said. ``I said, `Yes, the time has
come to do this 20 years later.'''
</P>
<P>
   The original movie left Laurie shaken but intact. In the new
film, ``Halloween H20,'' which opens on Aug. 5 and was directed by
Steve Miner (``Forever Young''), Laurie is the headmistress of a
private school, trying to put her life together after all that
mayhem 20 years ago. She is helped by her maternal secretary,
played by Ms. Curtis' mother, Janet Leigh, who screamed her way
through the great Hitchcock film ``Psycho.'' To no one's surprise,
the ``Halloween'' lunatic returns.
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous sequels of ``Halloween,'' including
``Halloween 2'' (1981) with Ms. Curtis. She attributed the success
of the first film, and the strong audience reaction at previews to
the new one, partly to the believability of the characters in an
unbelievable situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laurie was a girl that everyone knew _ slightly repressed,
vulnerable, living in a little bit of a fantasy world, a real
teen-ager,'' Ms. Curtis said. ``In the new film I wanted this to be
a realistic portrayal of someone haunted by demons for 20 years. I
wanted to protect the integrity of that character.''
</P>
<P>
   Horror films don't often open in the summer, which is usually
reserved for action and family movies. But Weinstein is challenging
tradition by opening the movie in August, and the decision made
three studios shift dates: Universal Pictures moved its action film
``Virus'' from August into early next year; an MGM thriller,
``Disturbing Behavior,'' was brought forward by two weeks, to July
22, and Warner Brothers moved the Leslie Nielsen comedy
``Wrongfully Accused'' from Aug. 7 to Aug. 21. The studios didn't
want to collide with ``Halloween H20.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very scary,'' Weinstein said. ``Jamie Lee did not
come back for nothing.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ACTRESS AS PRODUCER  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close, who has had a successful career in films, theater
and television, has just completed a Robert Altman film, ``Cookie's
Fortune,'' and is set to start making ``Mary Stuart'' in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn Close the actress is almost overshadowed by Glenn
Close the producer. Her company, Trillium Productions, has four
films in development, mostly at Walt Disney, as well as a
television movie-of-the-week and a sitcom. She's also set to appear
as Nellie Forbush in the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic ``South
Pacific'' on ABC next year. Ms. Close said that even though the
music would remain intact, the adapters of the television version
would return to the original source material, James Michener's
``Tales of the South Pacific,'' and place it in a more realistic
context, meaning that Nellie will be a more mature woman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Close, 51, has been nominated for five Academy Awards as
either best actress or best supporting actress. She turned to
producing because while reading and developing scripts, she
realized she had a talent for developing material that may have
been suitable not for her but for other actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to create projects that are gifts to other
actors,'' she said. ``Sometimes I might be part of it, sometimes
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Close is one of only a few movie actresses who seem to move
effortlessly into television and theater. On Broadway, she has won
three Tony Awards, including one for her portrayal of Norma Desmond
in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Sunset Boulevard.'' On television, Ms.
Close most recently was an executive producer and starred as Col.
Margarethe Cammermeyer in the critically praised NBC film ``Serving
in Silence,'' for which she won an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I choose television projects very carefully, and I don't want
to be overexposed,'' she said. ``But my feeling is, good material
is good material. And on television, if something is well-written
and effective, it can have a huge impact, more than any other
medium. I did `Something About Amelia' on television, a
groundbreaker about incest. It opened a national debate. That's
what television can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Close said the ideal age for women in Hollywood is 24 to 35,
``and it's getting younger.'' Roles for women, she said, fall into
various categories. ``They're either other women or the wronged
wife, pretty much a cliche,'' Ms. Close said. ``There are a lot of
mothers, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Close, who has a 10-year-old daughter, said: ``Because of
seeing movies with my daughter, I've analyzed the more classic
cartoons, most of which are Disney. Generally, there are either
wicked stepmothers or no mothers at all. You have to remove the
mother in order to have a story because there's nowhere for the
story to go if you have a protective mother. In that way strong
women are problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Close seemed resigned, if not especially sanguine, about the
plight of women over 40 in Hollywood. There are options other than
Hollywood, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut my teeth in theater,'' she said. ``As long as I can walk
and talk, I'll still do theater. That's the way I look at it. I
think of my profession as a craft. I choose to give it that kind of
respect. And wouldn't it be great if a big chunk of actors went to
New York to learn their craft before going into movies? It would
not only make them better actors but also inform their choices of
material.''

`TURANDOT' TO BE STAGED IN BEIJING'S FORBIDDEN CITY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The superlatives are swirling around the ``Turandot''
that will be mounted this September in a 500-year-old courtyard of
Beijing's Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   With Zubin Mehta as conductor and artistic chief, the Chinese
filmmaker Zhang Yimou as director and a colorful temple where
emperors once offered sacrifices to their ancestors as a backdrop,
this production is sure to be an Event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turandot,'' the story of a cruel princess who finally succumbs
to love, was Puccini's idea of a Chinese fairy tale, and not a few
impresarios have imagined it among the splendors of the Forbidden
City. But this is the first time anyone has managed to fight
through Chinese red tape and pull it off. Eight performances are
scheduled, from Sept. 5 to 13.
</P>
<P>
   With a budget of $15 million, this will be the most expensive
opera staging ever, Michael Ecker, the Switzerland-based
co-producer, said at a news conference on Wednesday on the old
palace grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta and Zhang, the filmmaker known for ``Red Sorghum'' and
``Raise the Red Lantern,'' had a trial run with the production last
year in Florence. The producers would like to attract up to 20,000
fans from abroad and are hoping companies will buy blocks of seats.
Still, Ecker said he expected that most viewers would be Chinese,
adding that prices would be cut for local residents at two
performances. The production will be broadcast on television in
much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta, speaking by television hookup from Munich, said that
acoustics were a challenge in the outdoor setting but that he was
confident that the sound engineers could create opera-house
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Florence Opera/Maggio Musicale Fiorentino will provide the
orchestra and chorus, as it did last year. Chinese artists will
design the sets, Ming-style costumes and choreography; a Chinese
ballet company, children's chorus and 500 extras will complete the
cast. Turandot will be sung by Sharon Sweet, Giovanna Casolla and
Audrey Stottler; Liu by Angela Maria Blasi, Barbara Frittoli and
Barbara Hendricks, and Calaf by Lando Bartolini, Kristjan Johansson
and Sergej Larin.
</P>
<P>
   Each performance can be attended by 4,200 people. Tickets start
at $150, but those including a gala dinner with the performers cost
$350, and ``sponsors'' will pay $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Zhang wore his usual doleful expression
until Mehta appeared on the television hookup. Zhang's face came to
life as he waved to the camera, exclaiming, ``Maestro Mehta, it
looks like you've lost some weight!''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said he hoped to create an atmosphere of fraternity
through the production and join people of different countries in a
``spiritual and emotional exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   The official embrace for ``Turandot'' contrasts with the debacle
of ``The Peony Pavilion,'' which was not mentioned at the news
conference. A Shanghai company was to perform the classic Chinese
opera at New York's Lincoln Center Festival this month, but a
cultural official stopped the company from leaving China, saying
the production was pornographic and violated tradition.

`LETHAL WEAPON 4': BONES CRUNCH? JOKES FLY? MUST BE GIBSON AND
GLOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

<P>
   Coming attractions for ``Lethal Weapon 4'' boasted a chase
sequence in which Mel Gibson is dragged behind a trailer truck on a
crowded freeway. Brakes screech, drivers veer and vehicles go bang
while Gibson endures this nightmare until Danny Glover manages to
hoist him off the pavement at high speed. After this, the two stars
crash straight through an office building in their runaway car.
Pardon me for having groaned in anticipation of what, in the full
perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, turns out to
be one of the nicer blow-'em-ups around.
</P>
<P>
   The characters remain funny and likable, and they all live on
Earth. The formula still has some zip. Scenes unfold with that
antediluvian, pre-MTV storytelling logic that some of us still find
helpful, and the story actually has a few substantial ideas in
mind. (It's pro-friends and family; it's anti-slavery.) These are
real virtues even if only relative ones. After all, ``Lethal Weapon
4'' is still a film whose idea of high drama is watching a car get
pushed in front of an oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a flamboyant, tongue-in-cheek adventure fueled by
jokey camaraderie and constant forward motion. The fireworks start
so early that the Warner Brothers logo is the first thing to
explode. This is just a way of saying hello in the language of
violent escapist movies, but it's also a nod to the ``Lethal
Weapon'' gambit of scaling preposterous new heights of danger
whenever possible. So the film's opening sequence finds Gibson and
Glover in the midst of a fiery battle against a faceless enemy
who's straight out of a video game. Buddyhood demands that these
two discuss family matters and share a practical joke while dodging
the flames.
</P>
<P>
   If Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) behave like
longtime pals, the audience has reason to regard them as old
friends too. This 11-year-old series has aged better than most,
sustaining its mix of crazy pyrotechnics, engaging characters and
easygoing rapport. Though it first emerged as one of the more
recklessly violent of action franchises, the ``Lethal Weapon''
formula has come to seem substantial, even venerable, beside newer
and dopier action-adventures. The characters have aged well and the
storytelling wisely made room for new blood.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Chris Rock and his nimble wisecracks have literally
married into the ``Lethal Weapon'' family. (Though the fourth
installment ends on a sweetly valedictory note, Rock helps to make
the prospect of further spinoffs look worthwhile.) Rock plays an
eager-to-please junior detective named Lee Butters who is secretly
Murtaugh's new son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   All Murtaugh knows is that his daughter is pregnant and that he
would hate to have her marry a cop. But Riggs knows the whole
story, which paves the way for the sadistic teasing that is one of
his minor specialties. While Butters tries to curry favor with his
father-in-law, Riggs convinces Murtaugh that the younger man is
making homosexual overtures. Hey, nobody said that these guys had
mellowed past the point of benighted jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Riggs' companion, Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), is also
pregnant, and a ruefully funny member of the series' regular cast
(she calls ``Here, boy!'' whether tossing a snack to Riggs or his
dog), the film spends some time on matters of impending fatherhood.
But it also has a murky smuggling plot in which to embroil the
detectives and their ever-pesty sidekick, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), who
now fancies himself a private eye. Discovering a scheme to smuggle
illegal aliens from China to work as virtual slaves in the United
States, the detectives happen onto a web of trouble involving rival
groups of Chinese gangsters. The main point of this is to introduce
several hair-raising fight sequences and to find a way for Jet Li,
another handsome Chinese action star poised to impress
international audiences, to show off his footwork.
</P>
<P>
   As an equal-opportunity slugfest, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' allows
even the pregnant Lorna to engage in martial arts. And these scenes
are staged by Richard Donner, the series' one and only director,
with his familiar mix of nonchalance and lunacy. One of the better
sequences here has the detectives cornering a Chinese gangster at
his dentist's office and trying to interrogate him while everyone
in the room samples the laughing gas. (``I'm sleeping with my
wife's two sisters!'' the gangster acknowledges amid all the
hilarity.) And for sheer madness, a furious long fight between
Gibson and Jet Li extends the boundaries of bone-crunching for
aging movie heroes everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The series long ago took its name from Riggs' suicidal daring,
and that's still a strong reason why Gibson fits into this role so
well. He seems supremely comfortable with this mixture of charm,
kidding, bullying, boyishness and a tenderness so well concealed
that it's easy to miss.

ANTIQUES: COLLECTORS GO HUNTING FOR TAPAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before there was cloth, there was tapa, or bark
cloth, a primitive kind of paperlike fabric made by tribes in South
America, Africa, Asia and Polynesia. Now, centuries later,
collectors are drawn to these graphically patterned pieces and are
buying them as works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of decorated tapa aren't easy to find; there are a
handful of dealers across the United States. But tapa is still
affordable and attracts both history buffs and collectors of
contemporary and ethnographic art.
</P>
<P>
   In Christie's ``Important Tribal Art'' sale in Manhattan in
November, for example, the first lot was a book titled ``Captain
James Cook,'' printed by Alexander Shaw in 1787. Its text was
attached to a collection of tapa specimens collected in Hawaii,
Polynesia and Tahiti during Cook's voyages. One piece looked like
calico, its beige bark punctuated by charming, flowerlike motifs in
earthy brown. Another had brown polka dots painted randomly between
parallel horizontal lines, intersected by red vertical lines to
form a grid. The book, with an estimate of $10,000 to $15,000, sold
for $43,700.
</P>
<P>
   Tapa is made usually from the inner bark of the paper mulberry
tree but can also be made from the breadfruit tree, the banyan and
the ficus. It is found in the Amazon Basin, Africa, Asia, Hawaii,
Polynesia, Indonesia, New Guinea and Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   It is made from bast, the fibrous skin between the sap and the
bark of the tree. When moistened and beaten repeatedly over a
smooth log, it becomes paper thin and soft. It is then decorated
with vegetal or mineral pigments.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J.P. Meyer, the owner of Galerie Meyer in Paris,
organized a show of oceanic tapa at his gallery earlier this month,
selling a third of it. As he wrote in the illustrated catalog
(available at the OAN Bookstore, 15 W. 39th St., Manhattan):
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapa was the main type of cloth for most early Neolithic
civilizations. Its use among Oceanic cultures dotting the South
Pacific was not just functional and mundane; as a material it was
in its own right a sacred substance. Magic and religious beliefs
are of the utmost importance in its fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   The Meyer show featured many tapa styles: a ceremonial apron and
spirit mask from Papua New Guinea; a fringed sash and an elaborate
red, black and white ornamental panel from Fiji; a coat of arms of
the Tonga kingdom, and a long white lioncloth from Samoa. Prices
ranged from $2,500 to $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   What makes tapa so attractive to Western eyes? ``It hits you in
the gut,'' Meyer said. ``Partly because it is NOT woven; it has
another dimension.'' Joseph Gerena, a Manhattan tribal-art dealer
at 12 E. 86th St., agreed. ``The attraction is primordial,'' he
said. ``Tapa is very tactile and a great medium for paint. It also
lets us see the imagination of peoples with limited technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Alpert, a tribal-art dealer in Dallas who lived in
Indonesia in the 1970s, said that while it was impossible to
decipher an individual tapa's meaning unless one knew the maker,
meaning was irrelevant. ``I look at tapa as art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people learned weaving, cloth superseded bark,'' Alpert
said, explaining why tapa was so precious. ``It was all the rage in
Paris in the 1930s. Max Ernst, Jacob Epstein and Pierre Matisse all
collected it.'' Joel Cooner, of the Cooner Gallery in Dallas, added
that Henri Matisse ``had tapa cloth on the walls of his studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpert suggested that anyone interested in buying tapa should
first read ``Traditional Tapa Textiles of the Pacific'' by Roger
Neich and Mick Pendergraft (Thames &AMP; Hudson, $22), ``Patterns of
Paradise: The Styles and Significance of Bark Cloth Around the
World'' by Anne Leonard and John Terrell (Field Museum of Natural
History, 1980, $40) and The World of Tribal Arts magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Cooner warned: ``There's a lot of trash being sold. Use dealers
who guarantee what they sell.'' He said he had found his tapa in
London, not Nepal or Indonesia. ``The good material is already in
collections,'' he explained. ``It was brought back as curios by
military people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Martin, a by-appointment textiles dealer at 310 Riverside
Drive, has sold several tapa panels to the H.M. de Young Memorial
Museum, part of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. The panels,
from Congo (formerly Zaire), were made by Mbuti Pygmies from the
Ituri forest. She likes Mbuti design because ``it isn't
symmetrical, but it's balanced,'' she said. ``The Pygmies are
wanderers, and the things they draw are related to their
wanderings.'' Her Mbuti panels, about 30 inches square, are $1,500
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Hurst, of the Hurst Gallery in Cambridge, Mass., recently
sold a very rare Tahitian tapa printed with impressions of ferns to
the Minneapolis Institute of Art. He said the ferns were soaked in
reddish-brown dye, then applied to the tapa. ``Only certain people
were entitled to receive tapas like this,'' he said. ``Tapas were
presented to important visitors, like Captain Cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Zarember, the owner of the Tambaran Gallery at 5 E. 82nd
St., Manhattan, grew up in Australia surrounded by bark paintings
in her family's home. Later she went to Papua New Guinea and saw
how people lined the ceilings of ceremonial houses with bark cloth.
She studied tribal art and now sells old tapas from Fiji, Tonga,
Papua New Guinea, Australia and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Throckmorton, at 153 E. 61st St., Manhattan, currently
has two tapas from Samoa, one 68 by 47 inches, the other 58 by 47
inches. Each is covered with tightly interlocking patterns in dark
brown pigment and could be mistaken for a contemporary painting.
One is $1,000, the other $1,500. ``I found them in California,'' he
said. ``You can tell these are 19th century because of the thinness
of the cloth and the tightness of the designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Steele, owner of Fine Tribal Art at 87 E. Houston St.,
Soho, is one of the few dealers who also show Amazonia tapa. He is
selling an early-20th-century tunic he said was worn by shamans
from the Jivaro tribe. It is highly ornamented with polychrome
designs rich in imagery. Though there are fewer collectors for
Amazonian works, Steele's tapa prices range from $3,500 to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the building of Brasilia in the 1950s, no one ventured
into the Amazon interior,'' Steele said. ``Now the Brazilians are
turning their backs on their own culture. The cultures are dying
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Mott, a textile curator at the de Young museum, pointed
out that different tribes have different styles: ``The Ituri
designs are tightly composed and less static. The lines are finer
and the spaces are more interrupted by twists and turns. They are
exuberant and mazelike. Samoan tapas are looser and coarser.''
Speaking of the museum's Ituri tapas, she said: ``They appeal to us
because of our 20th-century esthetic. Some look like Paul Klee or
Kandinsky. The sense of life and movement in these tapas draws
people in.''

RENO TO ATTEND SERVICES FOR SLAIN BORDER AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno is scheduled to attend
funeral services Friday for two U.S. Border Patrol agents killed by
a murder suspect who was being sought by authorities in South
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, will accompany Reno to the funeral masses
for Ricardo Guillermo Salinas, 24, of San Antonio, and Susan Lynn
Rodriguez, 28, of Harlingen. INS oversees the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country. They have
our deepest gratitude,'' said Meissner, who was in El Paso on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Moore, 25, who ambushed the agents and was wanted for
killing two other people in an early morning shooting spree
Tuesday, was buried in San Benito Thursday. The town is about seven
miles north of the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is reviewing the policy that allowed the
Border Patrol agents to assist local officers pursuing Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``After tragic incidents like the one that happened in Texas, I
think one always reviews operational policies,'' Eric Holder Jr.,
deputy attorney general, told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said Justice officials were ``trying to figure out ways
in which you might better protect people who are doing those Border
Patrol functions.''
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that the Border Patrol's role has ``changed over
the years,'' Holder said: ``We will not back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to do the job that the American people
expect us to do on the border with regard to illegal immigration
and also the flow of drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree began before dawn Tuesday when, investigators
said, Moore walked into a Rio Hondo home searching for an
ex-girlfriend. The owner of the home, Margarita Flores, 53, and her
daughter, Dalia Morin, 31, were shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Morin, 22, Flores' son, was critically wounded. The
ex-girlfriend hid during the shooting and was not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County sheriff's deputies responding to the shooting
searched for Moore, last seen driving a white pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas and Rodriguez responded to a call for assistance and
drove their Border Patrol vehicle to the San Benito home of the
suspect's father and questioned him.
</P>
<P>
   When they were walking back to their vehicle, Moore popped up in
a nearby corn field and fired bursts gunfire from a semi-automatic
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas died at the scene. Rodriguez was airlifted to a
Harlingen hospital where she died from her wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Deputy Raul Rodriguez, no relation, was wounded
in an exchange of gunfire with Moore, who was mortally wounded when
other officers returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's father and brother were police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was the first female Border Patrol agent to be killed
in the line of duty. Salinas was a rookie and was still taking
exams to become an agent in the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Meissner are scheduled to attend morning services for
Salinas in San Antonio, and afternoon services for Rodriguez in
Harlingen.

 NUMBER-FILLED `PI' IS SMART BUT HARD TO WATCH  (ko) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be a math whiz to appreciate the heady notions
Darren Aronofsky tosses around in his homemade debut film ``Pi.''
The movie, made for just $20,000, offers a brash horror-comic
variation on a familiar type, the paranoid wild-eyed genius who is
so obsessed with proving a theory that he goes mad. Before he's
finished experimenting on his home computer, Maximilian Cohen (Sean
Gullette), the film's central character, has shaved his head in
order to plug his computer into a specific area of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Pi'' suggests a zany spoof of the Frankenstein myth, the
movie poses age-old questions about the relationships between
genius and insanity, mathematics and numerology, mysticism and
scientific truth. Such questions may have no clear-cut answers, but
considering them forces you to contemplate what exactly is meant by
the word intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   But as smart as it is, ``Pi'' is awfully hard to watch. Filmed
with hand-held cameras in splotchy black-and-white and crudely
edited, it has the style and attitude of a no-budget midnight
movie. Its ink-stained cinematography and jarring electronic score
by Clint Manswell can be extremely grating.
</P>
<P>
   Maximilian is the furthest thing from an advertisement for the
superiority of the intellect. Plagued by migraine headaches that he
treats by popping fistfuls of painkillers, he lives in a squalid
apartment in Chinatown and spends every moment frantically trying
to prove that the gyrations of the stock market are mathematically
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he has a breakthrough, he is besieged by representatives
from two different groups. A greedy Wall Street brokerage house
that has somehow got wind of his experiments offers to give him a
high-powered computer chip if he will go into business with them.
At the same time, he is approached by a Hasidic rabbi who is
convinced that the same set of numbers that can unlock the patterns
of Wall Street is also a code for uncovering the secrets of the
universe and learning the name of God.
</P>
<P>
   The thoughts tossed around in ``Pi'' couldn't be more opposed to
the movie's chaotic style, but that might be the point. We live in
a world where an obsessive irrationality may be a necessary
prerequisite to penetrating the cool logic of numbers.

the toll of death and disability, however, only an estimated 5
percent of stroke patients who might benefit are being treated with
the drug, a genetically-engineered clot-buster called TPA that must
be administered within three hours in order to work. One major
reason is the inability of many Americans to recognize the symptoms
of stroke _ dizziness, numbness, headaches, slurred speech, vision
problems or shortness of breath. Another is that many hospitals and
physicians have been slow to offer the treatment, which can cause
devastating harm if given to the wrong type of stroke patient. By

FAMILY FARE IN NEW YORK: FROGS IN THE BRONX; SPIELBERG FOR KIDS;
WILDLIFE IN QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAUREL GRAEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The frogs at Wave Hill, the public garden in
Riverdale, look as if they've hopped out of a fairy tale: the kind
in which a frog is really a prince. That's because they're several
feet tall and have thoughtful expressions not often seen on the
residents of lily pads.
</P>
<P>
   The only wizardry they've endured, however, is that of Charles
Smith, who created the frogs by heating and welding, rather than
casting, brass and copper. The frogs owe their green skins to a
chemical process and their smiling attitudes to Smith's
imagination. On view throughout the month, they have inspired two
family art projects.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Wave Hill will present ``El Coqui y Sus Amigos''
(``The Frog and His Friends''), a salute to the frogs of Latin
America. Not surprisingly, Puerto Rican frogs have their own
language and do not utter anything as indelicate as ``ribet.''
According to Jorge Crespo, the artist and author who will lead the
workshop, the frogs say ``coqui.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like birds singing,'' Crespo said. ``A legend has it
that the coqui song appeases the spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Crespo will tell frog stories _ two from Puerto Rico, one from
Mexico and one from Peru _ dramatizing them with shadow puppets.
Then families will make shadow puppets and perform their own plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll encourage them to do frogs,'' he said, but other
creatures will be welcome, too.
</P>
<P>
   On July 25 and 26, Jennifer Monson, a dancer, will lead ``Frog
Free-for-All.'' Visitors will make a frog mask or costume and take
part in a frog frolic, using Smith's sculptures as inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Coqui y Sus Amigos,'' Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m.
at the L Learning Center, Wave Hill, West 249th Street and
Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx, (718) 549-3200. Free
with admission: adults, $4; the elderly and students, $2; children
under 6, free.
</P>
<P>
   A Spielberg Encounter
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Steven Spielberg films that appeal to children were
made before today's children were even born. For contemporary
youngsters, that has meant seeing big-screen adventures only on the
small screen, courtesy of a video store.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, they can watch Spielberg's gentle aliens
and enterprising explorers the way they were meant to be seen. ``A
Spielberg Summer,'' at the American Museum of the Moving Image, is
featuring every film he has directed as well as many he has
produced.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, for instance, there will be three showings of
``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' a film in which the
outer-space creatures are so benevolent and intriguing that you can
only hope to blast off with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're showing is the special 1982 edition,'' said David
Schwartz, the chief curator of film and video. ``There are more
scenes in it with the aliens on the spaceship, and it's the edition
Spielberg prefers.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend also includes ``Back to the Future,'' a 1985 comedy
about a teen-ager (Michael J. Fox) who travels to the 1950s and
accidentally endangers his parents' romance (Spielberg was the
executive producer; Robert Zemeckis directed). Then there is ``The
Sugarland Express,'' an early Spielberg feature (1974) starring
Goldie Hawn as a desperate mother who helps her husband break out
of prison. ``It's one of my favorites,'' Schwartz said, ``and I
think one of the underrated Spielberg films.''
</P>
<P>
   All three films are rated PG. The museum's permanent exhibition
``Behind the Screen'' also allows you to play Spielberg: It
includes a segment in which you can add your own sound effects to a
scene from ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Spielberg Summer,'' weekends through Sept. 6 in the Riklis
Theater at the American Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at
36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077. ``Close Encounters of
the Third Kind,'' Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.;
``The Sugarland Express,'' Saturday at 4:30 p.m.; ``Back to the
Future,'' Sunday at 5 p.m. Free with admission: adults, $8.50; the
elderly and students, $5.50; ages 5 to 18, $4.50; 4 and under,
free.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating a River
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers expect to meet almost anything on the shores of the
East River, but on Saturday the creatures there will surprise even
jaded residents: a boa constrictor, a black-footed ferret, lions
and a mermaid.
</P>
<P>
   They will all be part of the East River Festival, a celebration
in Astoria Park in Queens. And although they aren't native to New
York (the lions and mermaid are courtesy of Disney), the festival
will feature several animals that are. A peregrine falcon and a
Harris hawk, for instance, will be shown by the staff of the
Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary in Oyster Bay, N.Y., which is also
bringing the ferret and the snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to introduce people to the idea that New York
City has almost 29,000 acres of parkland,'' said Bram Gunther,
director of the Urban Park Rangers, the founders of the festival.
The exhibits ``help people focus on the fact that animals actually
live in these parks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights will include historical tours of Astoria,
music, dance, sports and ample food. For children, there will be
face painting, crafts and, at 6:15 p.m., a theatrical revue of
numbers from the Disney films ``Pocohontas,'' ``The Little
Mermaid'' and ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you missed the fireworks last weekend, the festival will
go out with a bang at 9.
</P>
<P>
   East River Festival, Saturday from 2 to 9 p.m. at Astoria Park
(enter at 19th Street and 22nd Drive), Astoria, Queens, (888)
697-2757. Free.

   Breezes from the north will import cool air with low humidity
into the Great Lakes States and interior Northeast on Friday.
Clouds and showers will accompany the arrival of cool air over
northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Northeast will have a mixture of clouds and
sunshine. Coastal areas will be seasonably warm until Friday night
when the cooler will arrive from the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Very warm and humid conditions will linger over the Southeast. A
front separating the sultry air from the cooler air to the north
will be the focus for afternoon thunderstorms in the Tennessee
Valley and southern Appalachians. Florida will be hot and humid
with scattered thunderstorms especially near the west coast.
</P>
<P>
   The heat will be unrelenting over the southern Plains, where
afternoon temperatures between 95 and 105 degrees will be common.
Clusters of strong thunderstorms will form at the northern edge of
the torrid air.
</P>
<P>
   Morning showers and thunderstorms over eastern Kansas and
Missouri will weaken as they drift southeastward. During the
afternoon, thunderstorms will develop again from western Kansas to
the central Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The interior West will be unusually warm, especially in northern
sections where sunshine will be most abundant. Farther south,
afternoon thunderstorms will form along many mountain peaks from
Wyoming to New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A few potent thunderstorms will erupt ahead of a cold front in
the interior Northwest. In the wake of the front, coastal areas
will turn cooler with gusty northwest breezes and a few showers.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SUN DOGS
</P>
<P>
   For a time on Wednesday evening, it appeared as though there
were three suns in the sky over northwestern Oregon. In ancient
times, the appearance of mock suns was seen as an omen. Today, it
is known that the brightly colored spots are caused when light from
the sun passes through the ice that comprises wispy cirrus clouds.
When sunlight passes through very small ice crystals, a halo
appears around the sun. However, when larger plates of ice act as
the prism, the complete halo is not formed. Rather, two spots of
light, sometimes called sun dogs, appear on either side of the
sun. &QL;

AIRLINE MUST DECIDE ON DOMESTIC PARTNERS POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Time is running out for United Airlines to
decide whether to comply with San Francisco's pioneering domestic
partners law or to fight the ordinance in court.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, United has shied away from putting its high-profile
corporate identity on the lawsuit that is challenging the
13-month-old equal benefits law. Instead, United has left the legal
fight to the Air Transport Association, an industry organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's position is that if United wants to be exempt
from the statute, it will have to go to court in a separate action
to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed ordinance requires companies doing business with
the city to provide the same benefits to workers with domestic
partners as the companies give to married employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``By entering the lawsuit, United Airlines will prove it's
selected discrimination,'' Supervisor Leslie Katz, a co-sponsor of
the law, said Wednesday. ``They've spent a lot of time and money
recently marketing to the gay and lesbian community, yet they are
denying us benefits and failing to take true steps to recognize our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   United representatives have argued that the dispute isn't over
gay rights, but whether a city can tell a private company how to
manage its business. They say they want to avoid a court showdown
with San Francisco, but may be compelled to follow that course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly hoping that we don't have to do that,'' said
Sue Thurman, a spokeswoman for United.
</P>
<P>
   United's temporary lease for a kitchen and maintenance facility
at San Francisco International Airport is scheduled to expire Aug.
30. The city and United struck a deal in February 1997. If the
airline complies with the domestic partners law, the city will
extend the $25 million lease for another 23 years. If United
doesn't meet the requirements, the lease could be canceled, forcing
the airline to find another site off city property.
</P>
<P>
   United is the largest tenant at the airport and is responsible
for more than 50 percent of the passenger traffic there.
</P>
<P>
   United employs 20,000 people in the San Francisco Bay Area and
71,000 elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The company could provide no specific figure for the number of
employees who would be affected by the city's domestic partners
law.
</P>
<P>
   The airline wants the city to drop its demands until the courts
rule on the legality of the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman described the city's position as unfair. She said
Federal Express, another airport tenant with a new lease, wouldn't
have to adhere to the law's provisions pending outcome of the court
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should United be treated any differently?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Aftergut, San Francisco's chief assistant city
attorney, said the cases are separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want United to keep their word. Federal Express didn't sign
a legal agreement saying it would comply on Aug. 30 or any other
date,'' Aftergut said.

 &HT;    AMD has bigger-than-expected quarterly loss
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ AMD Inc. reported a larger-than-expected loss in the
second quarter, hurt by weak sales of specialized memory chips and
specialty semiconductors even as its shipments of microprocessors
outstripped expectations.
</P>
<P>
   AMD has counted on its K6 and K6-2 products, chips that act as
the brains in personal computers, to lead the company to
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   But as the company has improved its manufacturing operations to
crank out more chips, the prices of those chips have fallen in
intense competition from Intel Corp. and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a major improvement on their yields and
productivity,'' John Lazlo, a PaineWebber analyst, said. ``Whereas
last year, you could chastise (AMD Chairman and Chief Executive
Jerry Sanders) for his execution, that hasn't been the case in the
last quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, AMD lost $64.6 million, or 45 cents a diluted
share. Analysts had expected the company to post losses of 20 cents
a share. AMD had a profit of $9.97 million, or 7 cents a diluted
share, in the 1997 second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sales fell $68 million, or 11 percent, to $526 million from $594
million from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter, AMD shipped 2.7 million K6 and K6-2
microprocessors, more than expected and 1 million more than AMD
shipped in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   K6 sales are rising because more PC makers are using its chips _
which cost about 25 percent less than Intel's _ in their sub-$1,000
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMD rose 12 1/2 cents to $18.12 1/2 in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The financial results were released after the
market closed.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's losses are part of an industrywide slowdown in the
semiconductor industry. On Tuesday, Motorola Inc. posted a $1.3
billion loss, citing weakening demand in Asia and a charge for
restructuring. Intel Corp., another bellwether stock for the chip
industry, will announce its earnings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said in a conference call Wednesday that the company's
results were dragged down by slipping sales and weak demand for its
non-K6 products. Those include chips the company makes for
communications and networking applications as well as its flash
memory business.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said that across the board, sales have been ``pretty
lackluster except for our microprocessor business.'' Sanders said
the company expects weak to flat sales on non-K6 products and will
only see a profit in the third quarter if the company can make $650
to $750 million, primarily in K6 sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, called that claim
``unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going now from a supply constraint to a demand
constraint,'' Kumar said. ``They may be able to increase production
by a million and a half in the third quarter, but then they hit a
brick wall. Intel's not going to let them pick up a million and a
half units a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said he expects Intel to continue pushing its low-cost
Pentium II processor, Celeron, to undercut AMD's K6 lines. Intel is
also expected to counteract AMD's next-generation K7, to be
produced in Dresden, Germany, for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said AMD expects to ship 20 million units of K6 and K7
processors next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out of the reality system we're in,'' Kumar said.
``There's not a chance in the world Intel will let them get away
with 20 million units.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the year, AMD plans to produce about 3.5 million
microprocessors in the third quarter and about 4.5 million in the
fourth quarter for a total of 12 million K6 units for the year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sanders said, sales of Windows 98 in late June have
begun increasing demand for PCs, which were ``dead in the water,''
for April and May.

 &HT;    FLAG BURNERS MAKE ODIOUS, PROTECTED SPEECH
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When my annual membership renewal notice from the
American Legion arrives, I always write a check and slip it into
the return envelope without giving the matter a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been happy to support the American Legion even
though I don't participate in the activities.
</P>
<P>
   When my 1999 renewal notice arrived the other day, it invited me
to look on the back to see what programs my dues were supporting. I
did. I wish my dues did not support one of the programs listed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of you and millions of past and present Legionnaires
there is . . . courage to fight for a constitutional amendment
against flag
</P>
<P>
   desecration.''
</P>
<P>
   I respectfully disagree with my fellow Legionnaires who support
making an exception to the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights
that says, ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom
of speech. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The Flag Protection Act, already passed by the House of
Representatives and now in the Senate, would add a 28th Amendment
to the Bill of Rights
</P>
<P>
   that would declare: ``Congress shall have the power to prohibit
the desecration of the flag of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   I prefer ``no law'' limiting freedom of speech to an asterisk
directing readers to check the exceptions listed below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Glory'' is a symbol of America's liberty. People who
desecrate the American flag are making a statement about this
nation that properly outrages all citizens who love and support
this nation and respect the struggles made to preserve the
principles of liberty and freedom laid down by the Founding Fathers
in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution's Bill of
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the First Amendment's free-speech provision is
that it empowers the people to speak out in opposition to the
government and
</P>
<P>
   its symbols without fear of government restraints or limitations
on those expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Flag burning has twice been held to be speech by U.S. Supreme
Court decisions. The justices reasoned that flag burners were
making a statement that expressed a point of view about this nation
and what it stands for.
</P>
<P>
   I join my fellow Legionnaires and Americans everywhere in
disgust with such a repugnant and odious point of view. But what
outrages Americans
</P>
<P>
   about flag burning is the point of view the statement, the
expression, the speech not the act itself. After all, burning is
the
</P>
<P>
   proper way to dispose of the American flag. The difference is
the point of view of the person doing the burning.
</P>
<P>
   Desecration of the flag then means that government must
determine what the flag-burner was thinking and communicating when
he struck the
</P>
<P>
   match. In most cases that wouldn't be difficult to determine,
but it still is a form of political speech.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that proponents of the flag-burning amendment want to
change the Constitution to give Congress the ability to make an
exception to the First Amendment's free-speech provision is an
admission that flag desecration is speech. Otherwise, Congress
could simply pass another flag-desecration law and give the
conservative majority on this Supreme Court a third chance to
review the law's constitutionality. But lawmakers and
constitutional scholars know it would be a waste of time _ flag
desecration is speech.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that two-thirds of both houses of Congress
and three-fourths all the states couldn't pass a constitutional
amendment giving government the authority to criminalize a form of
political speech most Americans find offensive. The government then
could use
</P>
<P>
   force to protect a symbol of America's liberty at the expense of
liberty itself.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow Legionnaires may disagree, but I think that's a
terrible tradeoff.

 &HT;    Bodybuilder has to rebuild life
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The tear has a long way to fall,
slipping out Neal Keselica's right eye, over orbits and cheekbones
that were shattered, past the nose that was severed, the tongue
that was sliced down the middle and choking him, the jaw that was
split, the gums that lost four teeth.
</P>
<P>
   It falls to the floor of Delray Beach's World Gym, where
Keselica came Tuesday to try to feel like himself again, even if he
may never again look like himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not since May 2, the night the personal trainer was driving
south on I-95 in his Camaro. He had just passed the Southern
Boulevard on-ramp when a tractor-trailer truck cut him off.
Keselica swerved into the sandy median. His car fishtailed,
collided with the rear wheels of the truck, careened back to the
median and flipped over several times, landing on the remains of
its roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to get out of the car,'' says Keselica, 31. ``I
thought it might explode. I knew things were hanging off my face,
eyes hanging out of my skull. I grabbed hold of whatever was
hanging. I looked down at my nose in my hand, staring me in the
face.''
</P>
<P>
   A face not recognizable to a friend who was following in another
car, nor the paramedics who treated him at the Trauma Center at
St.Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach. Keselica's wallet was
left on the highway, with his shoes and socks. His parents found
them all intact.
</P>
<P>
   Neal had used hand signals to relay their phone number to
doctors, and Mike and Pat flew in from New Jersey, to see their
youngest of three sons disfigured, unable to see or speak, facing
hundreds of thousands in doctor bills, probably still alive because
his muscles cushioned his bones.
</P>
<P>
   Their handsome son, who worked to be that way. Narcissism? Sure.
A life devoted to the beautification of others, and himself.
Keselica trained, napped, lay at the pool. Not much else, other
than learning the latest in nutrition. ``A walking doctor,'' says
former roommate David LaMarca.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of his tennis and soccer teams in high school, a
graduate from the Florida Institute of Technology, a defensive end
for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, the
author of Eat Right-Get Fit Made Easy, a former bodybuilding
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-3, 270-pound guy Bill Schiebl, general manager of
Gold's Gym in Boca Raton, thought might intimidate clients. ``A
giant physically, but an angel,'' Schiebl found after Neal rented
the right to work. He saw the most clients _ men, women, lawyers,
doctors, thin, fat, young, old. Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   A man so strong that his clients sought his counsel, on
everything. ``I knew them, they knew me,'' he says. ``I was their
pillar. Now I'm so vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   His size belied his sensitivity. He kept a calendar of family
and client birthdays, he always sent Pat flowers on Mother's Day,
he stopped charging some clients, particularly those with weight
problems. He wrote a letter three weeks after the crash, warning
clients, ``You're not off the hook!'' His ``spies'' would be
watching.
</P>
<P>
   He was referred so much business that he bought a condominium.
And yet, he had no health insurance. Just a list of names and
prices on his desk. Too late.
</P>
<P>
   That's why friends will hold a benefit auction tonight at 7:30
at the Surf Cafe in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   Keselica will undergo major facial reconstruction, which
includes rebuilding his nose with a bone from his skull. But that
won't be for at least a month. First he'll see dentists, and
ophthalmologists, and orthodontists, and pain management
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the doctors treat him for free, part of a mass
outpouring of community support. ``It's been amazing,'' Keselica
says. ``I was becoming a cynic, but I've become a true lover of
humanity. If this is what it took, this is what it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients, family and friends have referred doctors, driven him
around, opened a donation account, stuffed money in water bottles,
and organized the benefit that will be missing one special guest.
</P>
<P>
   One who sleeps in short shifts, who must avoid the sun, who
fears his nose will come off if he sneezes, who wakes up to cry for
an hour, then spends his day seeing doctors and cleaning his condo.
</P>
<P>
   At least he can see. And talk, though it hurts. He just can't
face seeing everyone. That hurts, too.
</P>
<P>
   With this face.
</P>
<P>
   ``People stare, out of compassion,'' Pat says, ``but they
stare.''
</P>
<P>
   They always stared. But in envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would break down,'' Neal says of his decision not to attend
the auction. ``I have enough sympathy for myself when I look in the
mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching tears fall.
</P>
<P>
   A donations account has been opened at Nationsbank in Neal
Keselica's name. For more information call Nationsbank at (954)
776-8000. For more information on tonight's banquet, call David
LaMarca at (561) 995-6674 or Mina Leyhan at (561) 997-2575.

 &HT;    GM dealers feel inventory squeeze from strike
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ A steady supply of 800 new cars once filled the lots at
Red McCombs Chevrolet-Geo, but these days the asphalt is mostly
barren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to 165 new vehicles now,'' said John Depperschmidt,
the new-vehicle department manager at Red McCombs. ``Without a
doubt, we're in bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The dealership on Research Boulevard in Austin is just one of
many General Motors Corp. franchises across the nation struggling
with dwindling inventory and parts shortages _ a ripple effect of
the two-month labor dispute between GM and the United Auto Workers.
Without a quick settlement to the strike, Red McCombs' supply of
new GM cars could be exhausted in 30 days, Depperschmidt said.
Likewise, Capitol Chevrolet, located on Fifth Street and Lamar
Boulevard, is down to just 22 new units on its lot, said general
sales manager David Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably live through July, but it's gonna be real ugly
in August,'' Howard said. ``We're looking at a 20 percent decrease
in sales, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between UAW and GM representatives continued
Wednesday in Michigan. On Tuesday, one of the longest bargaining
sessions yet raised hopes that a settlement might be closer. The
strikes at two Flint, Mich., parts plants have shut down 26 GM
assembly plants throughout North America, including a truck and
sport utility vehicle plant in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Stephen Girsky of the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
brokerage said he saw some reason for optimism in the tone of a
recorded statement made Tuesday by Donald C. Hackworth, vice
president of GM's North American car group. He noted that for the
first time the executive didn't attack the UAW's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a noticeable change in tone,'' Girsky said.
``It's different from what it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   But a rapid settlement still wouldn't spell instant relief for
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Local GM dealers estimated that 1999 model cars won't hit the
showrooms until six to 10 weeks after the strike is resolved, which
will almost undoubtedly postpone the debut of Chevy's new Silverado
half-ton truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at early September, but now we're looking at
the end of October or early November, even if they settle today,''
said Howard, of Capitol Chevrolet. ``They've spent a lot of money
preparing this launch, but now we probably won't order as many as
we would have.''
</P>
<P>
   That stands to benefit the No. 1 automaker's chief rivals,
Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. On Tuesday, Ford cancelled its
owner-loyalty rebate program, designed to lure away GM owners by
promising rebates on certain Ford models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there's no reason for Ford to give up that money, so they
cancelled the rebates,'' said Tommy Perez, a sales manager at
Covert Ford on Research Boulevard. ``Our sales have been up the
past month, and I don't think we've really even felt the force of
(the GM strike) yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, GM dealers are tapping all resources to find
cars that fill the void. Howard said he has been stocking and
selling late-model used cars to try and make up for lost new car
sales. Other dealers said they have scoured locations across the
country in search of anything that diversifies the inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, customers are noticing the shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Ryan Hawken perused Red McCombs' lot for a
Camaro that met his criteria, but came up empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing out there,'' Hawken said. ``They don't have
what I want in the right color, (and) I'd like to buy soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales won't be the only casualty if customers like Hawken are
deterred by the small selection.
</P>
<P>
   With customers only trickling into showrooms, a full slate of
dealership employees are left sitting idle _ feeling the financial
pinch on their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Both Howard and Depperschmidt said their dealerships won't
change hours of operation and plan no layoffs. At Red McCombs,
however, a hiring freeze is in effect, though some respite may come
from transferring salespeople to other dealerships in the Red
McCombs chain, Depperschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to lose employees, but there's a limit to how
far a dealership can go with paying people to sit around and do
nothing,'' he said. ``So it's likely that some might go to one of
our other stores that sells something other than a GM product, and
a few people are using this chance to take vacation time.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of GM parts affects even those consumers who
already own GM vehicles. Dealership service departments are
battling a backlog of orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been feeling (the strike's effects) for the past 30 days
on the service end,'' Howard said. ``We even have a couple used
cars in the lot that need parts that we just can't get right now.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Master of Masters
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My first major golf tournament was the 1975 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jack Nicklaus' 79th in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Both newspapers in town had rookies on the golf beat _ Mark
Purdy of the old Journal Herald, and me here at The Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   We drove to Augusta, Ga., together, pulled down Magnolia Lane,
took a right turn into the old parking lot and went on to witness
something we still marvel about to this day.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Masters in which Johnny Miller and Tom Weiskopf
were at their peaks and there was Nicklaus, by then 35, and
everyone wondering if he was ready to cede his spot at the top of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   So came Sunday and there were Nicklaus and the two challengers
painting the scoreboard red, and now Nicklaus was on 16 with
Weiskopf and Miller over on 15 green, a couple hundred yards away,
watching. And Nicklaus spanked this 45-foot putt up and over the
hill to a back-right pin and the ball somehow went down, and here
came Nicklaus _ The Golden Bear _ running off the 16th green,
putter high in the air, leaving, as Weiskopf would say later,
``Bear tracks'' on the green.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, with Nicklaus finished at 12-under-par,
both Miller and Weiskopf had 10-foot birdie putts at 18 to force a
playoff. It was the highest of golf drama. And both barely missed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as we drove home, Purdy and I talked about what we'd just
seen and wondered if, as we thought, we might have just seen the
greatest golf tournament in history.
</P>
<P>
   But what did we know? We were a couple of rookies. We had
nothing to measure it against.
</P>
<P>
   We still laugh about it when we see each other because that 1975
Masters is indeed considered one of the greatest tournaments ever
by the historians of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That was my introduction to big-time golf and to Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   And that memory and a dozen others came flooding back Wednesday
when I heard Nicklaus was withdrawing from the British Open,
breaking his 154-consecutive major tournament streak.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered our golf writer, Bucky Albers, and I walking with
him for 72 holes at Baltusrol in 1980 when he won the last of his
four U.S. Open titles. I remembered that last grasp of glory in
1986 when at age 46 he shot a 30 on the back-nine on Sunday to win
his sixth Masters and mesmerize a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has been, along with Babe Ruth, Jim Brown, Michael
Jordan and Wayne Gretzky, the defining athlete in his sport _ the
athlete against whom others will forever be measured.
</P>
<P>
   Including two U.S. amateur championships, he won 20 majors _ an
outrageous figure _ and finished second in 19 others.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, for all those wins, there is more to the man. Golf
is a game that lends itself to graciousness, but Nicklaus raised it
to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Of all my memories of the man in combat, the one at the 1977
British Open at Turnberry, Scotland, stands tallest. He and Tom
Watson raced away from the field on the last two days, Watson
finishing 65-65; Nicklaus, 65-66. As they walked up the 18th that
last day, Watson's one-shot victory assured, Nicklaus wrapped his
arm around Watson's shoulder and told him how proud he was of the
way Watson had played.
</P>
<P>
   I keep a picture of that moment on the wall of my office at home
as a reminder of the essence of sport. The picture, clipped from a
magazine, is curled at the corners and faded, a fate Nicklaus'
accomplishments nor his legend will ever face. -----

 &HT;    Will ownership ties hinder Selig?
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bud Selig is named baseball's ninth commissioner today, two
questions will rise like a Roger Clemens fastball:
</P>
<P>
   How much power will Selig wield and will he be looking out for
the best interests of the game or of the owners?
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who owns the Milwaukee Brewers, has been the ``acting''
commissioner since he was part of a group that helped force Fay
Vincent to resign in 1992. Vincent didn't always side with the
owners, who are expected to give Selig near-unanimous approval
today.
</P>
<P>
   Power is something Selig neither craves nor wants. His view of
the commissioner's role is in line with baseball's move from the
iron-fisted days of Mountain Landis and even the firm grips of
Peter Ueberroth and Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A commissioner is not czar sitting above the law,'' Selig has
said. ``Yes, a commissioner has a lot of power, but it must be
confined to certain areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig's daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, has been running the
Brewers since Selig became acting commissioner in September of
1992, and the plan now is to put the team in trust so Selig is not
in a position that could be construed as a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean there won't be skeptics, even among
owners. Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf has suggested
voting against Selig and bringing in someone with no obvious ties
to ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office was created in 1920, when owners
decided they needed a strong leader to rebuild the game's image
following the 1919 ``Black Sox'' scandal, in which eight members of
the Chicago White Sox were banned from baseball for conspiring to
throw the World Series. The owners hired Judge Kenesaw Mountain
Landis, who ruled the game until his death in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Landis created a position of strength, but Ueberroth and Vincent
likely were the last commissioners to control the game _ and it
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people realize how the office of the
commissioner has changed since 1921,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Or 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris said the commissioner
search committee turned up other candidates, but no other names
have surfaced and there is no proof that anyone besides Selig was
seriously considered.
</P>
<P>
   So Selig, 63, will have a five-year term, but he'll continue to
rule by consensus. It's a role in which he's comfortable, having
governed the game longer than the terms of the previous three
full-time commissioners (Ueberroth, Bart Giamatti and Vincent).
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back on the last five years, it's easy to make the
case that it's been the most active five years in baseball
history,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Those years include the game's lowest point since the Black Sox
Scandal _ a 230-day players strike that canceled the 1994 World
Series and led to a 20 percent drop in attendance in 1995 and $850
million in operating losses from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig has overseen healthy changes, including the wild-card
playoff format, interleague play and increased revenue sharing
between the large- and small-market clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bud has done an incredibly good job navigating
baseball through tough times,'' Ueberroth said. ``He'll be
recognized one day by the Hall of Fame for his efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig faces three immediate issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Marge Schott. The Cincinnati Reds owner was forced out of
day-to-day control of the team because of racist remarks in 1996.
The sanctions end after the season, but baseball officials are
considering a continued limit on her control of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Minnesota Twins. They're threatening to move because
Minnesota's government won't fund a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pete Rose. Baseball's career hits leader, banned for life in
1989 following a gambling investigation by Giamatti, has applied
for reinstatement, which would make him eligible for the Hall of
Fame. ``I think Bart did the right thing,'' Selig has said.
``There's no reason to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the issues, Selig is ready for the challenge. This
after spending much of the last five years insisting he didn't want
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant that, I really did,'' he said. ``But as time went on,
many people came to me and said they felt this would be best for
baseball. And that, ultimately, is what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Boston Red Sox CEO John Harrington: ``He wants to show the
world he can be one of the best commissioners ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell, but as San Diego Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn
says, at least baseball has an official leader again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, it's nice to know somebody's going to be there to
answer these questions, to give the fans peace of mind,'' Gwynn
said. ``The fans want to know that one guy is in charge of the game
and looking out for the game.'' The Associated Press contributed to

 &HT;    Phillips had better watch his soiled step
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ This sordid story of he said/she said will end
when Dolphins head coach Jimmy Johnson says it ends.
</P>
<P>
   And, at least for now, Johnson says it has.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonists in the soap opera are Dolphins running back
Lawrence Phillips and a West Palm Beach woman by the name of
Michelle Black. In briefest review of the situation:
</P>
<P>
   Black says Phillips punched her in the face when she refused his
invitation to dance at a Plantation nightclub; Phillips says Black
is lying. The Dolphins, after conducting their own investigation,
are satisfied with Phillips' side of the story (big surprise,
huh?). A police investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   There, you're caught up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the notion that Phillips is a bad guy is hardly bubbling to
the surface for the first time. While at the University of
Nebraska, for example, Phillips was sentenced to a year of
probation and ordered to pay restitution for assaulting Cornhuskers
basketball player Kate McEwen, who happened to be his
ex-girlfriend. And that episode is only the ugliest of a long list
of incidents in which Phillips has been involved.
</P>
<P>
   But is it possible Black, who has a police record of her own,
has exaggerated what transpired during her alleged contact with
Phillips?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, absolutely ye$$$$$.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, desperate to establish a running game, decided
big-back/big-trouble Phillips was worth the behavioral risk when he
signed him late last season after St. Louis released him. Even the
hapless Rams and head coach Dick Vermeil, who coddled Phillips,
eventually tired of the constant baby-sitting chores.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, upon bringing Phillips into the fold, said: ``There's
one rule _ do what's right _ and that encompasses a lot. And I
determine what's right and what's wrong ... and it's not public
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's our J.J., ol' Judge and Jury.
</P>
<P>
   And here's what Johnson said Wednesday afternoon in the wake of
the latest occurrence suggesting a link between Phillips and
trouble: ``He related the incident and what happened and, with all
the information we collected, I believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing more than a coach trusting a player, however
prejudicially. That's nothing more than a coach protecting an
investment, however stubbornly.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the police investigation turns up information
contradictory to findings made by the Dolphins?
</P>
<P>
   ``If something comes up that I'm not aware of, then I'll deal
with it,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is Johnson will wait on due process, which is
right and good.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll continue to experiment at Phillips'
tailback position in an attempt to squeeze consistent production
from a group. Johnson is talking up the talents of one Ray Nealy, a
scout-team player last year, and says incumbent Karim Abdul-Jabbar,
too, ``stood out'' during summer camps. This year's first-round
pick, John Avery, is also present.
</P>
<P>
   Of Phillips, Johnson was less than effusive between Wednesday
afternoon's practice and evening's scrimmage. He said only that
Phillips ``has looked good'' and ``done a nice job.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that Johnson's method of sheltering Phillips? Or is it
Johnson sharpening a knife?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took no one else's word on Phillips, who may yet win or
lose a roster spot based strictly on his performance.
</P>
<P>
   But if he has lied to Johnson, Phillips should know something.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be gone faster than he can say, ``Wanna dance?''

`SMALL SOLDIERS': THE FEW, THE PROUD, THE COMPUTER-GENERATED
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing beats a plaything when it comes to commandeering the
attention of children, so Joe Dante's ``Small Soldiers'' should
have had the makings of a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   It presents a boy named Alan (Gregory Smith) who is left alone
to run his father's toy store (definitely a kiddie-friendly
concept) and discovers a set of battling action figures that come
to computerized life. There are innocent echoes of ``Toy Story''
and darker ones of Dante's own ``Gremlins'' pictures, which had the
witty balance of mischief and horror that ``Small Soldiers''
strangely lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Even the introductory scenes, which are forgotten by mid-story,
reveal confusion about what could have been a smart, simple
premise. We watch a small toy company being taken over by a big
conglomerate (``Turning Swords Into Plowshares for You and Your
Family''), with Denis Leary as the arrogant corporate chief. And we
see two holdovers from the old regime, played by Jay Mohr and the
comically nerdy David Cross, trying too hard to please the new
boss.
</P>
<P>
   One of them has the bright idea of putting cutting-edge computer
chips that are meant for munitions into military dolls, turning the
dolls into crazed supersoldiers. As in Dante's strangely prophetic
``Explorers,'' this creates a realm where all sorts of slogans,
movie lines and other pop detritus can pile up in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   So Chip Hazard, the platoon leader with the flattest of flattops
and the voice of Tommy Lee Jones, can say things like ``Meet death
with honor, coward!'' and ``Damn the torpedoes or give me death!''
and ``We have ways of making you talk!''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the voice talent here is extraordinary. The
Commandos' voices are supplied by members of the original ``Dirty
Dozen'' cast: Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, George Kennedy and Clint
Walker, with Bruce Dern added to the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, their hapless and much more likable rivals, a group
called Gorgonites led by Frank Langella's gentlemanly Archer, are
actually Spinal Tap in disguise, with the voices of Christopher
Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean. The voices of the story's
mutant Barbie Doll types, called Gwendy Dolls, come from Christina
Ricci and Sarah Michelle Gellar.
</P>
<P>
   Bet you're wondering what mutant Barbies are doing in the midst
of this toy-filled fable. They're scaring the children who mistook
``Small Soldiers'' for something cheerier, that's what. After
forgetting to direct more much-deserved satire at the toy industry,
the film braces for battle and moves into the realm of the
grotesque. The female dolls are stripped down to bikinis (though
such dolls are always funnier with their clothes on) and given
ghastly faces and dimwit feminine wiles.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, as Alan and his teen-age flame, Christy Fimple
(Kirsten Dunst) go to war against the Commando side, they wind up
mowing these dolls with a lawnmower. The dolls also tie up and
torment Christy, Gulliver-style. By this point, the film is too
absurd to be frightening and too creepy for lighthearted fun.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason not to laugh is the presence of Phil Hartman as
Christy's fatuous father. This adroitly silly performance was
Hartman's last, and it is inevitably overshadowed by that sad fact.
</P>
<P>
   As with many films in which special effects are the real stars,
the technology here commands more respect and interest than the
material otherwise warrants.
</P>
<P>
   With Stan Winston in charge of animation and animatronics, and
with substantial puppetry and use of computer-generated images, the
figures themselves are impressive accomplishments. Creating and
animating the film's toys is said to have taken more than 16
man-years' worth of work.
</P>
<P>

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ARMAGEDDON,' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.
Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes). This big, showy,
spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a single heartfelt
moment, unless you count its sequence set in a strip club. Imminent
doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid) becomes the excuse for
rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and a notion of heroism
that has nothing whatever to do with real courage. Willis gets the
film's noblest lines for the same reason that he probably got the
set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries gamely to seem mad about Ms.
Tyler, who serves as window-dressing at NASA headquarters. Totally
predictable elements _ loud noises, frequent explosions and bright
computer-screen colors _ seem as inevitable and deadly as the
asteroid while they create the illusion of escapist fun (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP IMPACT,' starring Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Vanessa
Redgrave and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mimi Leder (PG-13, 120
minutes). Apparently there is no better aid to family therapy than
a murderously large meteor hurtling toward Earth. So this is a more
sensitive sci-fi disaster film than most, with lovers bonding and
old wounds healing as the summer's first colossal cinematic
catastrophe looms. This thriller is vigorously made, but it
provides less grisly mayhem than might be expected. As the planet
faces extinction, attention is paid to rescuing art, antiques,
elephants and flamingos. Special-effects wizardry provides a
suitably devastating tidal wave (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DR. DOLITTLE,' starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Betty Thomas
(PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr. Dolittle talks to the animals,
they pile on the back talk, thanks to the stellar cast of vocal
talent (Ellen DeGeneres, Garry Shandling, Paul Reubens, John
Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks flying. And Murphy plays
straight man with hilarious aplomb. This good-humored family film
is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot less corrosive than
``The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to Murphy's understated
timing, but also to expertly computer-enhanced performances from
the animal cast (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GODZILLA,' starring Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria
and Maria Pitillo. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 139
minutes). The ads for ``Godzilla'' proclaim that ``size does
matter.'' But it turns out that bigger doesn't necessarily mean
better. The animatronic lizard that rises from the ocean and stomps
on a number of New York City landmarks has thundering metallic
footsteps but still has the impact of a weightless cartoon monster.
The movie doesn't get scary until halfway through, when the beast's
eggs hatch (in what's left of Madison Square Garden) and an army of
more lifelike baby Godzillas threatens to devour the search party.
The storytelling and acting in this $120 million wad of gummed-up
popcorn reaches new depths of crudeness and ineptitude for a
so-called Event Movie (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GONE WITH THE WIND,' starring Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia
de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by Victor
Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of robust life left
in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's
romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it never existed) just
before, during and after the Civil War. Not a great film but a
satisfying one. The performances by Leigh, Gable and McDaniel are
ravishing, and there's grandeur in the meticulous physical
production. The movie shows its age most unfortunately in the
uneven quality of the Technicolor prints, which, though new, go
sort of pinkish more often than they should (Vincent Canby).
</P>
<P>
   `HENRY FOOL,' starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and
Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The
affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look
and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Hartley moves into a
much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art,
trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool
(Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim
(Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the
results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly
sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few
glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's
elegance of vision (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HIGH ART,' starring Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Directed by
Lisa Cholodenko (R, 96 minutes). Ms. Sheedy gives a fierce, tricky
performance in the role of a once-celebrated photographer, spooked
by fame, who long ago retreated from the art world to live a
reclusive, druggy life among lesbian friends. This steamily intense
story follows her spider-fly relationship with Ms. Mitchell's
bright-eyed, ambitious ingenue, who works for a desperately stylish
photography magazine. Ms. Cholodenko's seductive, powerfully
atmospheric first feature explores their relationship with
intelligence and avidity. But it sacrifices any hope of raw edges
and real emotion to its own chic sensibility, which proves so
studiously alluring that it overwhelms the story. Patricia Clarkson
does a scene-stealing turn as Ms. Sheedy's lover, a glamorously
decadent German actress who never got past the Fassbinder years
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,' starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Stillman's
smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway between
``Metropolitan'' and ``Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes
post-college career worries with improbable discomania. A
delightful cast engages in nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting
debate, rendered with Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms.
Beckinsale, an English actress with a flawless American accent here
and diffidence that's just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at
the center of a bright and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone
willing to entertain the notion that the spread of environmentalism
was sparked by the revival of ``Bambi'' during the disco
generation's formative years (Maslin).

   BOMBS-RUDOLPH _ Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force still

symbolic.'' Speaking to a Democratic group here on a wide range of
Israeli issues, Gold said the U.N. vote -- which passed ov
overwhelmingly -- represents ``no effective change'' in the PLO

 UNDATED: years (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `MULAN,' with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and B.D.
Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86 minutes).
Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender stereotyping
in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but
also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation. This
is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films,
right down to the jokey sidekicks, would-be ``Under the Sea''
production number and Destiny ballad from the intrepid heroine
(``When will my reflection show who I am inside?''). Murphy's very
funny wisecracks make the character of a little dragon
entertaining, but this black-sounding character is also treated as
a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action crowd scenes more
often than it takes audiences to the realm of the imagination
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,' starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan,
Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100 minutes).
Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully acerbic comedy
finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from nasty little
Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil twin.
Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this film and
announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart of gold.
Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally skewers
preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUT OF SIGHT,' starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer afternoon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A PERFECT MURDER,' starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow
and Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The
characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted
update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film)
``Dial M for Murder,'' but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play
are icily amusing. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled,
riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader
in deep financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover
(Mortensen), a con man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's not
as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic, is the wife, Emily,
a translator at the United Nations, who has her own agenda. The
story takes enough surprising twists to keep you engrossed, and the
high-style ambiance (especially the Taylors' Fifth Avenue
apartment) is mouthwatering (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS,' starring Anne Heche and Harrison Ford.
Directed by Ivan Reitman (PG-13, 146 minutes). This escapist
romance for the Treadmill Generation is a workout in its own right,
putting its stars through the wringer (and into a ``From Here to
Eternity'' surf clinch complete with hiking boots). The leads are
attractive and funny, and the screenplay strives for a
Tracy-Hepburn dynamic, but this truly strenuous love story is as
long on tropical scenery as it is short on new ideas. Once the
stars are marooned in splendid isolation, the film has to cook up
pirates and a snake in Ms. Heche's shorts just to keep afloat. In
supporting roles, David Schwimmer makes a drippy beau for Ms.
Heche; Temuera Morrison deserves his own pirate picture, and the
ex-grocery clerk Jacqueline Obrados torches up the film as if Salma
Hayek were in town (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TRUMAN SHOW,' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir (PG, 104 minutes). The ultimate in
high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and cartwheels for this ingenious
media-age fantasy are over the top, but by comparison with
Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie fare, it's definitely a
dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of shtick, gives an instantly
iconic performance as a guinea pig for an entertainment-happy
nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud contrived by Harris'
so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate edge of volatility
gives the material, from a screenplay of transfixing sci-fi
intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as the actress playing
a wife whose bluff could be called at any moment, is the story's
spookiest character as well as its perkiest. Weir unifies the
story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE X-FILES,' starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.
Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115 minutes). Conspiracy theorists,
consider this: what if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania
surrounding the first ``X-Files'' feature film were part of a giant
scheme to hide the uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle?
It's as possible as much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If
devotees of the television series approach the film with enough
baggage for a six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience
of watching a middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But
this film will strike true X-fanatics as watered down and remains
fairly bewildering to the uninitiated. And no, Scully and Mulder
don't quite take their working relationship to a higher plane
(Maslin).

   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   `UNIVERSAL COMEDY.' Four weeks, 21 films and countless laughs.
That's the prospect beginning Friday at New York City's Film Forum,
where the series ``Universal Comedy'' brings classics of the genre
starring Mae West, W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers and Abbott and
Costello and directed by masters of the merry like Ernst Lubitsch
and Preston Sturges. Other highlights include a Rock Hudson-Doris
day twin bill and James Stewart in ``Harvey.'' Many of the films
are in new 35-millimeter prints, including the opening attraction,
a double-barreled blast of Mae West, playing through Sunday: ``She
Done Him Wrong'' (1933) and ``I'm No Angel'' (1933), both with Cary
Grant and immortal lines like ``come up and see me sometime.'' The
series continues through Aug. 6 at the Film Forum. Admission:
$8.50; $4.50 for members. Information: (212) 727-8110 (Lawrence Van
Gelder).

 &HT;    ISRAELI DIPLOMAT: ``SYMBOLIC' UN PLO VOTE COULD HURT STALLED
PEACE PROCESS
 &HT;    By Samar Abulhassan 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations on
Thursday reaffirmed that this week's General Assembly decision to
expand Palestinians' rights in the U.N. delegation was largely
``symbolic'' and does not change the PLO status.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group here on a wide range of Israeli issues, Dore
Gold labeled the move as a violation of the 1993 Oslo peace accords
which could hurt efforts to restart the 16-month impasse in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in May, 1999, the Palestinians declare a state instead of
negotiating a permanent status agreement,'' Gold said, ``they've
fundamentally abrogated the Oslo agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech to the Washington-based Democratic Leadership Council
comes just a day before Palestinian negotiators are expected to
arrive here to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. The negotiators, Nabil Shaath and Saeb Erekat, will
discuss the U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop pullback from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, a top advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said the Tuesday vote that gave the Palestinian observer
mission a nonvoting seat in the 185-member U.N. General Assembly
merely enhanced the Palestinian position as observer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symbolism is what created the great effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians and others view the 124-4 vote, which granted
them a voice in the assembly, as a large step toward statehood.
They will not have the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer period, Gold said that a controversial
Israeli plan to expand Jerusalem's municipal authority was a
``local'' problem and not an international issue. The ``umbrella''
plan approved last month by the Israeli Cabinet would draw several
settlements and suburbs around Jerusalem under the city's
jurisdiction in such matters as planning and development.
</P>
<P>
   But Gold maintained that the plan, which is opposed by
Palestinians, attempts to strengthen Jerusalem as a city and does
not infringe on any borders.
</P>
<P>
   Gold also touched on relations between the U.S. and Israel,
which he said despite recent disagreements, ``are making a very
serious effort to bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the difficulties, the state of Israel is determined to
make this peace process work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of terrorism, a theme which Gold said continues to
handicap the peace process, he said Israel would reciprocate once
Palestinians ``dismissed Hamas and the Islamic jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do our end of the bargain,'' he said. ``We're not going
turn land over for nothing.''

RARE CONDITION ROBS VICTIMS OF VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - When Norma Barer began having trouble speaking 40
years ago, she was told it was stress, it was nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors blamed her gender. Psychologists said it was all in
her head.
</P>
<P>
   Speech therapists attempted to retrain her voice. She tried
tranquilizers. She tried resting her voice. She was given
electroshock therapy. She was ordered to sniff noxious vapors.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked, and bouts of depression plagued her over the
next decades as her condition worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horror story,'' Barer says.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the late 1980s that she finally received a
definitive diagnosis. Her problem was not nerves or being born a
woman. But it (begin ital) was (endital) all in her head _ in her
brain, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Barer is one of the estimated 30,000 to 50,000 Americans who
suffer from a vocal disorder called spasmodic dysphonia, in which
nerve signals from the basal ganglia area of the brain send
improper signals to the vocal cords, causing them to either squeeze
tightly shut or remain wide open, interfering with speech.
</P>
<P>
   Although spasmodic dysphonia can be rapidly diagnosed today and
is easily treated with injections of a medicine that temporarily
paralyzes the vocal cords, Barer believes that many people in the
past suffered horror stories like hers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1950s. Barer was a young wife and mother of two when
she first noticed intermittent periods of voice failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, my voice would catch,'' she says. ``Sometimes
it was perfect. Other times, it was just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   She consulted a psychologist at Phoenix College in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all attributed to nerves, being a woman,'' she says.
When she was referred to a psychiatrist who concurred, ``I sat in
that chair and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Barer herself began to doubt her sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how desperate you get,'' she says. ``You'll
do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She even agreed to five sessions of electroshock therapy,
performed by a psychiatrist who assured her that the procedure was
harmless. Though the therapy has left no serious impairment, Barer
believes that she suffered some memory problems. And the therapy
did nothing to improve her voice.
</P>
<P>
   Another doctor had her inhale some sort of gas _ she's not sure
what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a nightmare,'' she says. ``I felt like I was
dying, like I was sinking into a deep, black pit.''
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre treatment also proved ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Barer feared that her voice problems would ruin her career as a
dance instructor. On bad days, she had trouble barking out commands
in the classroom. Students often had to strain to hear. For Barer,
the effort to speak was fatiguing.
</P>
<P>
   When she got a job teaching dance at Scottsdale High School, the
children learned that Mrs. Barer was a special teacher who taught
in whispers. They were sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find help, Barer resigned herself to her condition.
Like others with spasmodic dysphonia, she learned tricks that help
facilitate speech. She avoided difficult words _ words with many
vowels. One man with spasmodic dysphonia, she has heard, even
changed his vowel-laden name.
</P>
<P>
   Some sufferers find that their voice improves when they sing. Or
when they scream _ which forces open the vocal cords. Barer says
she discovered that her voice sounded clearer at a higher pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you raise your voice high, it gets better. But you can't go
around talking like Mickey Mouse,'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find a career to fall back on if she had to quit
teaching, Barer returned to Arizona State University in Tempe,
Ariz., and earned a master's degree in counseling. That proved to
be an unwise choice. Speaking to clients for long periods was
taxing: ``I was a mess,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Again, she sought a diagnosis. Again, she was told that her
problem was psychosomatic, which she fiercely denied. In
desperation, she consulted a speech therapist in Beverly Hills, a
so-called therapist to the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take me long to see what a fraud he was,'' Barer
says.
</P>
<P>
   Saddened, she finally took early retirement from Scottsdale High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty bad,'' she says. ``I was in bad shape, and I was
really depressed. I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I
retreated. I didn't want to see people.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1989, hope.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, who lived in Los Angeles, saw an article in the
``Los'' ``Angeles Times'' about a study being done in Dallas on a
vocal disorder whose symptoms sounded like Barer's. Doctors were
recruiting volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Flown to Dallas, Barer was accepted into the study and diagnosed
with spasmodic dysphonia. Doctors there were not treating the
disorder, but she heard of a program at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., where a new therapy was being used: injections of
botulinum toxin, or botox.
</P>
<P>
   In large doses, botulinum is one of the deadliest known poisons.
In small, controlled doses, it can be a safe, effective remedy for
sufferers of spasmodic dysphonia.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, the doctor heading those studies was her
son-in-law's cousin, Dr. Arnold Aronson.
</P>
<P>
   Barer traveled to Rochester and received her first injection of
botox _ a shot into each vocal cord.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of weeks, her voice was reduced to a breathy
whisper. She loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sounded like Marilyn Monroe,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a strong voice, but even its puny volume was an
improvement over a voice that was strained and cracked. During the
next month, her voice became stronger and soon sounded normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most wonderful thing,'' Barer says, her face
beaming. ``It was the biggest relief in the whole world. It just
lifted my spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Barer now receives botox injections every three to four months
at the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, where Dr. Stephen Bansberg, an
otolaryngologist, has a client base of about 200 spasmodic
dysphonia patients.
</P>
<P>
   She received her 30th injection June 25. Bansberg injected the
botox _ 1.25 units into each vocal cord under topical anesthetic _
while Dr. Charles Adler, a Mayo neurologist, directed placement of
the needle using an electromyography monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure took less than five minutes, and Barer experienced
no discomfort. She calls the shots ``no big deal.'' During the next
few days, she expected her voice to weaken somewhat and then
gradually become stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Barer, who heads a Valley spasmodic dysphonia support group and
has served on the board of the National Spasmodic Dysphonia
Association, used to celebrate every recovery period. Now, she says
with a shrug, it's old hat.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it's any less miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a thrill,'' she says. ``I'll never get over how
great this is. It's as if this big weight has been lifted. I just
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barer is even teaching dance again. As a faculty associate at
ASU, she conducts a course called Learning Through Movement,
designed for elementary-school teachers. She also leads exercise
classes for mature women at the Unitarian Universalist Church in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``To have this treatment available,'' she says, ``has changed
my life.'' &QL;

ART REVIEW: WATCHING PARIS CHANGE AT ST.-LAZARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Art exhibitions that resemble art history seminars
often do so at their peril. Full of wordy text panels, such shows
can swamp the viewer with extraneous information or make
interesting points that one would rather encounter in book form,
sitting down.
</P>
<P>
   But every pitfall has escapees carefully skirting its brink.
Curators are becoming increasingly skilled at mixing and matching
artworks and ancillary material to conjure up the times, places and
personalities that produced those artworks. There are growing
numbers of shows in which words and pictures share the wall to
mutually illuminating effect, so that looking and reading become
one, or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   A rewarding example is ``Manet, Monet and the Gare St.-Lazare,''
a small, beautiful show that moved to the National Gallery of Art
here after appearing at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. The show was
organized by Juliet Wilson-Bareau, a London-based Manet scholar;
Philip Conisbee, senior curator of European paintings at the
National Gallery, and Florence Coman, the Gallery's assistant
curator of French paintings. It is not just another pretty
exhibition of Impressionism and environs thrown together to attract
an eager public.
</P>
<P>
   If one attends to its brief wall texts, its often outstanding
paintings and its diverse supporting material (an array of prints
and drawings, maps, photographs and newspaper engravings), this
exhibition can enthrall the eye and make the head buzz with the
sense of a great city in transition and the differing responses of
the artists it inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The city, of course, is Paris as it emerged from the trauma of
the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune and began to take stock of
the ambitious modernization of the city overseen by Georges Eugene
Haussmann. Prominent among these improvements was the big, shining,
newly expanded St.-Lazare train station and its grand, massively
girdered approach, the Pont de l'Europe, which spanned the
station's rail yard. Both were depicted by two of the period's
leading painters, Edouard Manet and Claude Monet, while some of
their colleagues, less original artists like Gustave Caillebotte,
were also attracted to these signs of the city's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated, radical and yet devoted to the history of his
medium, Manet was the perpetual rebel of the official Salon,
doggedly submitting work to nearly all its exhibitions from 1861
until his death in 1886. In many of these years, Manet's
seductively subversive images scandalized the public and critics
alike, especially ``Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe,'' seen in 1863 at the
Salon des Refuses, and his forthright nude ``Olympia,'' seen in the
Salon of 1865. But he refused to abandon the possibility of
official recognition or to exhibit independently with the slightly
younger artists known as Impressionists, whose work he had
influenced and whose leader was, arguably, Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Monet, Manet and other artists had studios in the Quartier de
l'Europe, the neighborhood around the St.-Lazare station.
</P>
<P>
   The show's central image is ``The Railway'' of 1873 by Manet,
which was the first painting to claim the St.-Lazare station as an
emblem of ``the wonders of industrialization,'' in the words of one
art historian. At times, this show can feel a bit scattered. Each
of its five galleries makes a different point, like a succession of
research papers grouped around a central subject. But it is
anchored by substantial groups of work by both Manet and Monet.
</P>
<P>
   From Monet's brush there is a series of 11 paintings, reunited
here for the first time, that he produced from different vantage
points inside the station in 1877, after he gained permission to
set up his easel under its soaring glass roof. They are his first
series clearly devoted to varying views of a single subject,
precursors of his better-known images of haystacks and the facade
of Rouen Cathedral, from the 1890s, and the English Houses of
Parliament and the waterlilies at Giverny after 1900.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From this central core, the show spreads out in several
directions. In the first two galleries, the ambitiousness of
Haussmann's plan is evident from Paris maps of the time. In the
next gallery, a group of Manet's prints of dead soldiers,
barricades and the civilian uprising in the city's streets give
some sense of the trauma of the recent war and the Commune, and of
Manet's sensitivity to it.
</P>
<P>
   Also here is Henri Fantin-Latour's quietly celebratory ``Studio
in the Batignolles,'' a group portrait of contemporary painters
that includes Monet, Renoir, Bazille and the writer Zola. Manet is
at the center, before his easel, the teacher among his disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes a glorious gallery, centered on ``The Railway,'' that
is worth the entire visit. Like all Manet's best paintings, this
work is at once unsettling, austere and alluring. It features a
well-dressed young woman, seated by an iron fence with an open book
and a sleeping puppy in her lap, who gazes upon us with mild
curiosity. Next to her is a beautifully coiffed and attired
Parisian child with her back to us. She grasps one of the vertical
bars of the fence, which measures off the painting's surface in
ribbons of paint and space as wide as the thick sash of her dress,
as she looks down on the the rail yard, where an arriving
locomotive is all but obscured by clouds of billowing white steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Railway'' was widely ridiculed when first introduced in
the Salon of 1874, and the show includes the sharply satiric
newspaper cartoons to prove it. (Some cartoonists insisted that the
bars of the fence were keeping the models in the picture; others,
in an insane asylum.) Here it is flanked by two other equally
enigmatic, formally daring Manets: ``Young Lady of 1866 (Woman With
a Parrot)'' from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and ``The Street
Singer'' from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, with their broad
areas of uninflected color, puzzling expressions, inexplicable
accouterments and sly art historical references.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Lady appears in a glamorously plain pink pegnoire, a
monocle around her neck and a quizzically intimate look on her
face, as if directed at a male companion. (The image may have been
painted in response to Courbet's ``Woman With a Parrot,'' a nude
that may itself have been a response to Manet's ``Olympia.'') The
Street Singer, in her gray triangle of a dress, is shown leaving a
cafe too well turned out for her job; she grasps a guitar and her
gathered skirt in one hand and in the other holds a bunch of red
grapes to her mouth, a gesture of provocative, inherently sexual
indolence at odds with her brisk, businesslike demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The model in all three paintings is Victorine Meurent, the
slightly tough, level-gazed beauty who posed for both ``Dejeuner''
and ``Olympia.'' Except in ``The Street Singer,'' she wears around
her neck the thin black ribbon that is so prominent in ``Olympia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next gallery we see other artists tackle St.-Lazare,
gaining a sharper appreciation of Manet's radicalness and
importance. Working in a fairly academic manner that is better than
his later, more devoutly Impressionistic mode, Caillebotte selects
the powerful girders of the Pont de l'Europe as a dramatically
impersonal backdrop for Parisian boulevardiers, sometimes depicting
the walkway on which they stroll in plunging perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A striking contrast with this work is a small painting of almost
photographic if also saccharine refinement by Jean Beraud, who
retreats to the opposite side of the bridge, deflating the girders'
imposing scale. He fills the middle distance with a cast of
exquisitely dressed men and women as carefully placed as cut-out
paper dolls (none of the figures overlap), who seem about to burst
into song _ say, the ``Ascot Gavotte'' from ``My Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the fourth gallery, Monet has his say, in the 11
works from 1877, painted from inside the station looking out and
showing curling clouds of steam against the sky at different times
of day. These images are strikingly different from Manet's emphasis
on the individual participants in modern life, their dress,
carriage and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   For Monet, industry was in effect another form of nature. Events
unfold at a distance: the roiling or drifting steam dwarfs the
trains, the trains dwarf the blurred, shadowy crowds clustered
about them. And throughout, Monet's quick nervous brushwork holds
sway, experimenting with different textures and rhythms in each
painting.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gare St.-Lazare: Arrival of a Train,'' the steam rises in
tight, almost Futuristic curls; in ``Le Pont de l'Europe (Gare
St.-Lazare),'' it is spread about in thin atmospheric patches.
Elsewhere it is tinged with the pink of sunset or it accumulates in
horizontal elongated patches that, if one turned the paintings
upside down, would resemble the artist's late waterlily paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Embracing one of the most aggressive symbols of modern progress,
Monet still kept his priorities straight. The story goes that,
delighted by the shifting subtleties of his vistas, he said: ``They
will need to delay the Rouen train. The light is better a half-hour
after its departure time.''

MISHA DICHTER AND CARAMOOR CELEBRATE 25 YEARS

<P>
   Anniversaries are a peculiar commodity in the classical music
world. Concert programmers and record company executives believe _
and the anecdotal evidence suggests they may be right _ that when
composers reach even-numbered anniversaries, listeners become eager
to hear their music again, even if they've been hearing it all
along. Institutions and performers use their own benchmarks as a
reason to party, and that being the case, an anniversary of some
sort can almost always be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, N.Y., and
pianist Misha Dichter have found an anniversary to celebrate
together: the 25th anniversary of Dichter's debut at Caramoor, and
of an association that has included recitals, concerto
performances, chamber music and master classes every year since
then. For the occasion, the festival is building its programs
around Dichter this weekend, and has established the Misha Dichter
Piano Performance Endowment Fund in his honor. The endowment is now
at $50,000, but Caramoor's executive director, Howard Herring, said
he hoped to raise $1 million; it is meant to pay pianists' fees for
recitals, concerto appearances and special projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart now is very much in Caramoor,'' Dichter said. He
noted that he and his wife, Cipa Dichter, who is also a pianist,
have a house in North Salem, about 10 minutes from the estate where
Caramoor presents its 31 concerts every summer, about a third with
the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the rest chamber music, recitals
and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, its direction is serious, and its scale is just
right,'' Dichter continued. ``As A &AMP;estival, it doesn't try to be
Tanglewood. And although we've ventured into master classes, it
doesn't aspire to be Aspen, in the sense of having several hundred
string players filling out the ranks of various orchestras.''
</P>
<P>
   Caramoor's celebration of, or with, Dichter includes his
performance Saturday evening of the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.
2, and a chamber concert with works by Saint-Saens, Schumann and
Ravel on Sunday afternoon. His confederates in the chamber
performance will include his wife, with whom he has been playing
duo piano recitals since they were students in the mid-1960s; they
married in 1968 and have two sons. The other performers will be
Robert McDuffie and Nicholas Mann, violinists; Lawrence Dutton,
violist, and Carter Brey, cellist. Blythe Danner will join the
company to read Ogden Nash's descriptive poems for Saint-Saens'
``Carnival of the Animals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rachmaninoff Second is the first piece I played in public,
when I was a teen-ager and I knew nothing, and I still associate it
with feelings of being 15 and bright-eyed,'' said Dichter, 52.
``But that's not why I'm playing it at Caramoor. I suggested it
because it bothers me that everyone thinks it's a cliche, a war
horse. I don't understand that attitude, because for the performer,
the pieces don't get easier, and the discoveries remain fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a piece I've played hundreds of times,'' he added,
``but I'm still learning new things about it. A couple of years
ago, I was playing the Rachmaninoff Cello Sonata with Ralph
Kirshbaum. It's from the same period as the concerto, and it gave
me new insights, so that when I went back to the concerto I felt as
though I hadn't known anything about the piece until now. It just
cleared it up for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dichter was born in Shanghai in 1945 _ his parents were Jewish
refugees from Poland _ and grew up in Los Angeles, where he studied
with Aube Tzerko, who was a student of Artur Schnabel. Later he
studied at the Juilliard School with Rosina Lhevinne.
</P>
<P>
   His career began after he won the Silver Medal at the
Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1966, but that victory, along
with his fondness for Liszt, whom he has recorded plentifully,
typecast him as a virtuoso technician rather than a player
concerned with works that had deeper intellectual underpinnings. A
few years ago, he sought to redress that view by programming more
Schubert, Beethoven and Brahms in his recitals. His programs at
Caramoor this weekend touch on both the dazzling and the more
thoughtful sides of the repertory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These days, Dichter said, he plays about 90 concerts a year and
confines his teaching to summer master classes, like those he gives
at Caramoor. The summer is also a time for freshening up his
repertory for the coming season, although he said that lately his
approach to this has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started performing professionally, 32 years ago,'' he
explained, ``I would make a point of learning two new concerti and
a new recital program every summer.'' He added: ``The repertory
really grows that way. But it's also exhausting. This is the first
period when I've mostly gone back to old, friendly pieces. I'll add
new works here and there _ I haven't played all the Mozart concerti
in public, or all of the Beethoven sonatas _ but learning so many
new works every year is not an obsession any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also realized that there's life outside practicing. Cipa
and I went to Paris in May, for the first time unrelated to any
musical event. We dropped our bags, walked, had meals, rested and
went to museums for four days. And I thought, `Wow! That's what
people do!' It was amazing. It was a revelation to me, to not have
to ask: `Where's the rehearsal? Where do I practice?' I didn't see
a piano for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' he added, ``after four days away, it took me a
good two, two and a half weeks to feel myself again at the
keyboard.''
</P>

AUCTION OF RARE VIDEOS  
 INDEPENDENTS PREPARE NEW RELEASES

   Going Once, Going Twice
</P>
<P>
   It just could be an original concept: the video auction. Later
this summer, Norman Scherer, a rare-tape dealer in New York, plans
to put scores of films and other titles under the electronic gavel
at www.videooyster.com, the Web site named for his company, Video
Oyster. For those movies no store ever seems to carry, the site
might become a good place to look.
</P>
<P>
   A video bounty hunter of sorts, Scherer has tracked the
hardest-to-find material, from out-of-circulation Disney films to
obscure cult items, for nine years. Now he's about to broaden that
approach by posting entire store inventories at his site and
selling them to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes will come from stores that are going out of business.
Proprietors will share in the proceeds and presumably get more than
they would by dumping their stock with tape brokers, Scherer said.
Dealers will submit lists of titles they want to get rid of and
these will be added to a master list at the site, which is updated
monthly.
</P>
<P>
   For $10 a month, anybody can bid on whatever they want. Bidders
might be individuals looking for special titles or retailers
looking for films to fill out their own inventories. Bids will go
up at the rate of only $1 at a time, which should give most
interested parties, private or commercial, ample leeway to compete.
At the end of the month, the highest bidder gets the tape.
</P>
<P>
   During the month one can look in on the progress of the bidding
and respond accordingly. Final prices are hard to predict, but
bargain rates could prevail for particular movies that relatively
few might want.
</P>
<P>
   Scherer said he suspected there would be more bargains than
bidding wars. ``No one can tell what's in demand and what isn't,''
he said. ``Everybody has their own top 100 films.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing Releases
</P>
<P>
   This week, while most of the video industry is off at its annual
convention in Las Vegas, some of its best small operators are
staying at home and getting ready for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Few independent distributors prepare the ground more carefully
than Milestone Film and Video, a New York company. On Sept. 29,
Milestone plans to issue Orson Welles' ``Trial,'' based on Franz
Kafka's novel and starring Anthony Perkins, Jeanne Moreau and
Welles. The film, looking remarkably sharp and refurbished after
being transferred from a print made from original elements
recovered in Manhattan, is already in its slipcover with blurbs in
place (``Say what you like but it's the best film I ever made,''
Welles says in one.)
</P>
<P>
   Yoichi Higashi's fascinating ``Village of Dreams'' (1997), about
one long ago summer in the lives of rambunctious 8-year-old
Japanese twins, will be released by Milestone on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the year the lineup includes ``Antonio Gaudi,''
a study of the Catalan architect (October); Hiroshi Teshigahara's
``Woman in the Dunes'' (October); Curtis Harrington's ``Night
Tide,'' with Dennis Hopper in his first leading role (October), and
``Sweetheart: The Films of Mary Pickford'' (November). Information:

   Even the sea has frozen solid on the icy winter day that Elspeth
(Phyllida Law) drops in unannounced and unwanted on her recently
widowed daughter, Frances (Emma Thompson, who is actually Ms. Law's
daughter). Having resumed life in northern Scotland with her
teen-age son (Gary Hollywood), Frances is unreceptive to her
mother's emotional support. As a sort of counterpoint, Alan
Rickman's solemnly talky film weaves in the stories of three pairs
of villagers and ends on a warmly mushy note in, Stephen Holden
wrote in The New York Times, ``a fussy, sentimental exercise in
theatrical counterpoint.'' &QL;

formula, Nick Gomez's film does present a cool, dreamy gangster's
world with intimations of purgatory at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Dante (Michael Rapaport) and his lover, Micky (Lili Taylor), are
routinely peddling the stuff when their former partner, Gabriel
(Adam Trese), gets out of jail and, as the characters' names
suggest, rakes up memories of past betrayals. With no plot trails
to break, Gomez turns ``Illtown'' into ``a sleek metaphysical
experiment in visual style'' (Maslin). &QL;

   Swept From the Sea
</P>
<P>
   Xenophobic Cornish villagers mistake the babbling young man to
be a crazy person, but he's really the dashing Ukrainian adventurer
Yanko Gooral (Vincent Perez), who's washed ashore after his ship
goes down on its way to America. In Beeban Kidron's heavy-handed
adaptation of Joseph Conrad's story ``Amy Foster,'' Gooral is
nursed to health by a beautiful but strange servant girl (Rachel
Weisz). Despite a loud, determinedly romantic symphonic score,
Perez and Ms. Weisz strike sparks like a wet book of matches. Also
blame the film's soggy thud on ``too much rain, too many shots of
the churning sea and far too much music'' (Holden).

ON THE TRAIL WITH BILL BRYSON: UPHILL, DOWNHILL AND OUT OF SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HUBERT B. HERRING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A book about hiking the Appalachian Trail? Spare me.
</P>
<P>
   I could imagine it: We walked. We saw trees. We went up. We went
down.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me while I watch some paint dry, or curl up with a good
phone directory.
</P>
<P>
   So why, on a sunny, crisp day, did I drive three hours to walk a
few miles of that trail with the book's author?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Because the author is Bill Bryson, whose ``Notes From a
Small Island'' is a decidedly untouristy, nonlinear trek around
England, where he lived for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   And ``A Walk in the Woods,'' published by Broadway Books and on
The New York Times best-seller list for the fifth week July 12,
turned out to be far more than a walk on the Appalachian Trail. His
comically out-of-shape hiking partner, Stephen Katz (``he brought
to mind Orson Welles after a very bad night''), announces at the
outset that he cannot go an hour without a doughnut. And trail
banter is not the high-minded soul-searching of, say, Meriwether
Lewis, but: ``These college kids are willing to trade Pop Tarts for
Snickers. What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   And why did he tackle the trail? No furrowed-brow, Everest-size
rationale _ no ``because it's THERE'' _ for Bryson. No, it was so
that the sight of the ``guys in camouflage pants and hunting hats''
at the local diner wouldn't make him ``feel like such a cupcake.''
</P>
<P>
   Splitting the difference between New York City and his home in
Hanover, N.H., we met in Williamstown, Mass.; the Appalachian
Trail, bouncing along the Berkshires, passes near here.
Appropriately, considering the junk-food theme that meanders so
defiantly through the book, we met at a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   What was I in for? Bryson, on the page, seems like a cross
between boisterous stand-up comic and jovial misanthrope, skewering
practically everyone in his, well, path. Was I turning myself into
comic fodder?
</P>
<P>
   Probably. But when Bryson stepped out of his minivan, trademark
pipe in mouth, I didn't see a boisterous comic. I encountered a
gentle man, with a reddish beard, a National Geographic cap and
probably a bit more bulk than he had when he was in hiking trim.
</P>
<P>
   He and I headed off on our quest, which, befitting the book's
loony tone, nearly evolved into ``Searching for the Appalachian
Trail With Bill Bryson.'' He'd said in his book that often the
hardest part was getting onto the trail, and, sure enough, back and
forth we drove: ``Right past here.'' ``No, couldn't be this far.''
``I remember after coming out of the woods, sitting and having a
smoke just there.'' Even though he is an Iowa native, he has
acquired a hint of a British accent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after asking a couple of neighbors, we tracked it down:
a skinny parting of the woods, a single white blaze painted on a
tree set back from the road.
</P>
<P>
   And it was through this inauspicious gateway that we stepped
onto the great trail. When one hears of the Appalachian Trail
marching grandly from Georgia to Maine, the Holy Grail of thousands
of hikers, it is easy to imagine some glittering promenade,
something out of ``The Wizard of Oz'' perhaps. Or, at the very
least, a wide, formidable path.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is often more like what we encountered: dense,
rocky woods, sometimes with something resembling a path, sometimes
just a scramble. The hiker is essentially alone in the vast forest
that covers much of the Eastern United States, following, like
Hansel or Gretel with backpack, the white rectangles of paint that
the kindly trail-blazers have sprinkled in their wake. These
blazes, depending on the terrain, might appear on trees, standing
or fallen, or on a rock outcropping.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 100 yards into the woods, whose leaves were just gearing
up for their coming-out party, the shy Appalachian Trail finally
announced itself, with a sign assuring us that, ahead, lay Mount
Greylock and points south. Perhaps in understatement, perhaps not
to dispirit ``through hikers,'' it did not give the distance to
Georgia, which is perhaps 1,500-plus miles.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson walked ahead of me, clearly in his element out on this
trail, but seemingly exerting himself more than a seasoned hiker
would be expected to, even though he was not burdened by a hefty
backpacker's pack. In fact, to my surprise, he had no pack at all,
and turned down several offers of water from my daypack.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed a swampy area, where logs split lengthwise had been
inserted as a bridge, then headed up Mount Greylock, a solitary
peak that dominates the landscape here. As we did, the comic in
Bryson poked softly through as he related the unusual way he was
catapulted into full-time writing, something he had long pined to
do.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, while he was an editor at The Times of London, he and
his family were vacationing in Yorkshire. He ``was moaning more
than usual'' about escaping to some such place and focusing on his
writing. A few days after returning to work, his wife, Cynthia,
called and said: ``I've put the house on the market. If you're
going to do it, do it.'' (He recounted this with a laugh, but when
I asked his wife about it later, she said, ``He was furious.'')
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the house was sold, they moved to the country
and the rest is history, or at least Bryson's particular brand of
travel writing.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he'd written with reverence that the trail ``is
said to be the largest volunteer-run undertaking on the planet.''
On his walk, he'd seen various volunteers doing trail maintenance,
and his reverence was intact now. ``Look,'' he said, pointing to a
fallen sawn-off log. ``Someone came up here with a chain saw _ FOR
US.'' A pause, then a childlike, heartfelt, ``Bless them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whoops. We suddenly realized that the trail, and the white
blazes, had vanished. There is always a danger in the woods,
especially if you get lost in conversation or in reverie, that the
trail can zig when the instinct of your feet tells you to zag.We
retraced our steps, found the missed turn _ sure enough, it had
been marked by a log laid across the trail-not-to-be-taken, but we
had stepped right over it _ and headed steeply uphill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get lost on the trail,'' Bryson said as we huffed
upward, ``but once you do, it's easy to compound it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he tells of being accidentally separated overnight
from Katz deep in the Maine woods. It ended well, on a typically
comic note (``Lost, no water _ and you with the chocolate chip
cookies,'' Katz whined), but Bryson said now with true emotion,
``I've never been so happy to see another person.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz is a butt of so many jokes _ he balked at leaving a motel
to return to the trail because ``The X-Files'' was on and he'd just
stocked up on cream soda _ that I'd marveled that he didn't mind
the ridicule. ``It's a pseudonym,'' Bryson said. ``Katz was the
name of a Des Moines drugstore.'' Was ``Katz'' exaggerated?
``Plenty!'' he shot back with a grin. ``But is that what the trip
was like? Exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   On their 1996 trip, Bryson and ``Katz'' did not finish the
trail; they did a long stretch here, little bits there, for a total
of 870 miles out of more than 2,100. ``I plan to do the whole
thing,'' Bryson insisted now. But his writing is so giddy, so
loopy, that completeness would somehow seem a sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only part I feel guilty about,'' he said, ``is not
finishing the 100-mile wilderness in Maine,'' a weeklong trek that
completes the trail with a triumphant ascent of Mount Katahdin.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson, who is 46 (``but I have a body that's much older''), had
lamented how quickly he had gotten out of shape. And at one
particularly rugged spot, with the trail rising dramatically
through a stand of evergreens, the views starting to open up
through the trees, he said, ``If this gets much steeper, this'll
have to be a memorial article: the end of Bill Bryson.''
</P>
<P>
   He does walk most places: ``I have to because I've written about
it so much.'' In the book, he comes up with the startling statistic
that an average American walks just 350 yards a day, a state of
affairs he calls ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   We hiked an hour or so to a windy clearing that delivered a
stunning vista of Williamstown and the Vermont hills beyond. After
coming north through New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, the
trail from here skims the spine of Vermont's Green Mountains, then
crosses into New Hampshire at Hanover, where, since 1995, Bryson
has lived with his wife and four children, aged 7 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   From a spot like this, I could easily imagine the lure of the
Appalachian Trail, the lure of being pulled along over those
mountains. The trail, from here, seemed like an idyllic stroll over
modest mountains, though in fact it ranges from the literally
pedestrian _ walking along roads or across the Bear Mountain Bridge
in New York _ to the grueling, like the steep, rocky, wind-blasted
ascent of Mount Washington in New Hampshire's White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Even knowing that, the pull was strong, but reality intruded.
Time was scarce. We would have to turn around here.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference is
celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Appalachian Trail this
year, dating to the 1923 completion of a section in Harriman State
Park. Bryson, in giving the history of the trail, notes that work
began in earnest in 1930 and the trail was completed in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   I offered some trail mix, but he turned it down. ``I can't eat
things like that anymore,'' he said. ``I ate so much of it.'' But
he eyed my particular mix with scientific interest, clearly having
become a connoisseur. Then, with a cold wind blowing and the
sweeping vista as a backdrop, he huddled under his jacket to light
his pipe. On his hike, he said, he got bored at his campsite at
night, so he picked up a pipe when he first dropped in on
civilization. But ``I plan to quit on the book tour,'' he vowed.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson glanced longingly at the sign that said three miles or so
to the top of Greylock, pointing to another inauspicious parting of
the woods, and said, ``I wish we had time to go the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   He was about to take a break for a trip to England, ``to get
away from my publicist,'' he said with a laugh. ``No, it's to plan
a TV series _ a sort of `Notes From a Small Island' on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   And his next book? ``It will be about Australia,'' he said.
``I'd always thought of Australia as `Baywatch' with cricket, but
after going there I know there's a lot more to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This hike, he said as we reluctantly headed down, ``was one of
my favorite days on the trail.'' Then he paused and added with a
slight sigh: ``I could DO this. If someone said, `I'd give you a
living wage to go out and walk every day,' I'd do it.''

TEXAS WOMAN ACCUSED OF SETTING HUSBAND ON FIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An east Texas man was in critical condition at a
Houston hospital Thursday after his wife allegedly drenched him in
gasoline as he slept and set him afire.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at Hermann Hospital said the victim, William
Brocco, 35, of Bellville, suffered second- and third-degree burns
over 60 percent of his body.
</P>
<P>
   The man's wife, Carletta Brocco, 38, was held in lieu of
$250,000 bond in the Austin County Jail in Bellville, about 55
miles west of downtown Houston. She is charged with attempted
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's sisters said the 1:30 a.m. Wednesday attack was the
second time Brocco's life has been touched tragically by fire.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Jody, now 9 and living with Brocco's ex-wife, was
severely burned six years ago as she and another child played with
a butane torch. The torch ignited the child's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel W. Leedy, an Austin County assistant district attorney,
said the latest attack occurred at the couple's mobile home. A
five-gallon gasoline container was found discarded outside the
residence, but authorities have not determined how much fuel was
poured on the man.
</P>
<P>
   After being ignited, Leedy said, Brocco ran to a neighbor's home
for assistance. He was driven to a Bellville hospital by private
vehicle, then taken by helicopter to Hermann.
</P>
<P>
   Leedy said Brocco, heavily sedated and breathing with the aid of
a respirator, has not been extensively interviewed by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Leedy said Brocco and his wife had filed simple assault charges
against each other within the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted murder charge may be taken to the grand jury as
early as July 22, Leedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she was a strange character,'' Brocco's sister, Bonnie
Schrader, said of her sister-in-law. ``He said he either had to
beat her up or marry her. We kept telling him to leave her, but he
said he loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader said her brother's marriage was characterized by
violent quarrels.
</P>
<P>
   A second sister, Doris Hampton, said the couple had been married
about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had known her about four years,'' she said. ``He was kind
of outcasted from the family because of her.''

 &HT;    Arnett claims to be nothing more than a puppet
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When is a TV reporter not a TV reporter but a mouthpiece?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question facing viewers in the wake of the brouhaha
over Peter Arnett's role in the creation of CNN's retracted story
on Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett has said theTailwind story, which had alleged U.S. use of
nerve gas in Laos, was ``a producer driven show,'' that he was
basically ``the presentation correspondent,'' and that his role was
limited to reading scripts and conducting three on-camera
interviews with questions prepared by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to lend my byline to the story,'' Arnett said.
That idea of Arnett as mere persona is in sharp contrast to how
many CNN viewers remember him: as the gutsy, independent reporter
smack in the middle of Baghdad _ alone _ on television screens
during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter, pointed out that he
has ``always taken responsibilty for my field-action reporting''
and that the situation will not happen again. ``This is a lesson
I've learned the hard way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Peter Arnett wishes he had done the job he normally
has done as journalist,'' says Robert Lichter, director of the
Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. ``But it's
getting harder and harder to do that on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in the number of shows, ``the real journalist
is being reduced to being a talking head. The old school really
does reporting as opposed to lip synching.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual in TV newsmagazines for off-camera producers to
do much of the reporting, or for on-camera reporters to ``parachute
in'' when the story is virtually done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reveals the dirty little secret of newsmagazines,'' says
Lichter. ``The producers do work and the correspondents take the
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was business as usual,`` he added. ``There are so many
newmagazine shows trying to fill so much airtime that there is a
distribution of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsmagazines are profit centers, he said. ``They've expanded
beyond the capacity of staff to do serious reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of reporter as marketing tool prompted different
responses from those in the industry in wake of Arnett's reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times interview, Christiane Amanpour, CNN's chief
international correspondent, vehemently denied that she narrates
reports developed by others when reporting for a newsmagazine
program like ``Impact.'' ``I believe ... that a network
correspondent should be reponsible for what he or she says on the
air,'' she said. ``We have our face, our name, our voices and our
credibility, and threfore we should be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wald, senior vice president for editorial quality at ABC
News, echoed that belief. In ABC's system, ``if it's your face on
the story, you're responsible for it,'' he told the Associated
Press. ``The idea that a correspondent who sits there and tells you
something (but) in fact didn't know that before, doesn't really
know it and is just reading something is not a happy idea for
people in the news business and people who watch.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that while most ABC correspondents are
deeply involved in the stories, there are cases where reporters
read scripts written by others.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt, executive producer of CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' told the
AP that each on-air correspondent is assigned a team of four
producers and they all work together to develop stories. ``No story
goes on the air unless it has been signed off by a correspondent
who is satisfied that this is the story that he or she wants to
tell,'' Hewitt says.
</P>
<P>
   The old school of journalism dictates a more hands-on approach,
even in an era when competition from other media increases deadline
pressures. Marvin Kalb, a Harvard University professor who was a TV
correspondent for 30 years, remembers working with Edward R. Murrow
at CBS in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went to Murrow, for example, with a story that was not
sufficiently checked out, sourced and clearly written, he would
just give it back to me,'' Kalb told the Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel. ``And I would be humiliated.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he asks, where are the Murrows? ``It's easy to find
people very, very well paid. Celebrities, people who get sets in
restaurants and on airplanes. But that doesn't mean they're great
journalists; it just means they're very well-known journalists.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Lose yourself in a good book (such as war stories)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former neighbor, seeking to enliven my convalescence from a
recent hospital trip, called to ask if I read romance fiction. I
hated to tell her, but love stories usually embarrass me. It's not
that I'm opposed to love. I value it in people and in dogs _ but
seldom in books. I prefer war and murder and suspense. How do you
tell a kind, romantic-minded lady that?
</P>
<P>
   We chatted about recent novels and autobiographies where, I
admitted, a modicum of love is acceptable. But I don't think she
saw any reason for my turning down 28 love stories she has. I
finally said I would accept them for the firehouse library we have
at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, while I was visiting my son, I lucked into a copy of a
1964 Reader's Digest collection called ``Secrets and Spies'' of
World War II. My son and I were attracted to this book (we each
found a copy at the Habitat for Humanity thrift store in Marianna,
Fla.) because it has a short piece about a German sea raider with a
connection with our family. A German sea captain we knew named
Robert Rogge painted the ship picture my son has over his mantel.
My parents knew him.
</P>
<P>
   He had an American wife, an old friend of my mother's from
Florala, Ala., and everybody was puzzled when he disappeared at the
beginning of World War II. There were rumors he had rejoined the
German Navy, and even reports from people who claimed to have seen
him with a group from a submarine which allegedly made a stop in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhard Rogge in ``Secrets and Spies'' may or may not have been
our friend, but we liked reading about his strange deceptions and
exploits on the high seas during the war. He could make his heavily
armed ship look like a Norwegian or Chinese merchantman, and he was
famous for rescuing the officers and crews of the ships he sank.
There are a lot of good World War II stories in this book, some old
and rereadable, like Cornelius Ryan's ``The Longest Day,'' some
personal tales by people who were in the war.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorites is about the effort of the Germans to train
civilian German sympathizers to infiltrate the Allies armies,
wearing the uniforms from dead or captured American soldiers and
peppering their talk with expressions like, ``Okay, butch!'' The
would-be spies were not particularly competent, it turned out, and
they were surprisingly easy to detect. One of the tests they
flunked had these questions: ``Who is the brown bomber? What is the
Windy City? Who is `The Voice?' Who are `dem bums'?''
</P>
<P>
   I tried these questions on my children, and they passed, but I
was in doubt about the Windy City, and I wonder if today's
teenagers could answer the questions at all.
</P>
<P>
   There are many stories in the book that might be new to them. Do
they know who Rudolph Hess was? The strange death of the Germans'
field marshal Erwin Rommel engrossed me far more than any love
story. I guess I had long known he was a suspect in the plot to
assassinate Hitler, but I didn't remember that he was actually
murdered. And such a hero to the Germans, admired for his military
genius by even his enemies, and at home during the Normandy
invasion because it happened to be his wife's birthday. Now you
know that's a good story.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old book. My son says it often shows up in secondhand
stores. But if I'm ever again stranded somewhere with nothing to
read, I hope it's at hand instead of 28 romances.

 &HT;    Low-budget `Smoke Signals' is flying high
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's said that John Wayne once walked up to an Indian extra on
the set of one of his westerns and asked, ``Say, didn't I kill you
12 movies ago?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' winner of two awards at this year's Sundance
Film Festival, gets the Duke back with its own barrage of ``Injun''
jokes. This time, though, the Indians are telling them.
</P>
<P>
   Based on ``The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven,'' a
1993 best seller by Sherman Alexie, and directed by Chris Eyre, a
28-year-old Cheyenne-Arapaho Indian, ``Smoke Signals'' is a road
movie with an acid sense of humor and a heritage-ridden theme
that's as universal as it is specific.
</P>
<P>
   Low-budget and low-key, ``Smoke Signals'' offers a short
prologue. In 1976, a Fourth of July celebration on the dilapidated
Coeur d'Alene Reservation in the Northwest turns tragic when a
house burns, killing the adults inside. But their baby, Thomas, is
tossed out a window and lands in the arms of Arnold Joseph (Gary
Farmer).
</P>
<P>
   Skip to the present. Arnold, a philosophical, eccentric
alcoholic, has long since skipped town, abandoning his family. Now
word comes that he died in Arizona. His son, Victor (Adam Beach),
sets out to fetch the body. His unwanted but persistent traveling
companion is the now-grown Thomas (Evan Adams), who, thanks to his
miraculous rescue, regards Arnold as a spiritual father.
</P>
<P>
   The pair make Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau look like the Even
Couple. Victor is handsome, self-sufficient and reserved, with a
chip on his shoulder about his ethnicity and a smoldering
resentment toward the father who deserted him. Thomas is a
talkative nerd who worships Victor and ``entertains'' him with
nonstop tall tales.
</P>
<P>
   The trip provides a coming of age for both young men, who, in
their very different ways, make journeys of acceptance,
self-awareness and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar from such movies as ``Dead Man'' and ``Pow-Wow
Highway,'' Farmer has a small role but a solid, anchoring presence
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the film, though, is carried by the relatively
inexperienced Beach and Adams. Like their fledgling director, they
manage just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The picture has a honed casualness that's reminiscent of many
early-1970s flicks, with a fluidity bordering on sloppiness and a
rough-around-the-edges narrative that surrounds pointed insights.
It even invokes a catch phrase from 1970's ``Little Big Man,'' in
which Chief Dan George, an Oscar nominee, kept telling adopted son
Dustin Hoffman, ``It's a good day to die.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Smoke Signals,'' the phrase has a '90s spin: ``It's a good
day to be indigenous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Beach, Evan Adams and Gary Farmer. Directed by
Chris Eyre. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and alcohol abuse. 1
hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Rambling and rough around the edges, but definitely
worth a look.

 &HT;    Thoughtful programming offers entertainment and information
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--You can just sit and watch the movie ... but if you do,
you'll be missing out on the full experience of the National Black
Arts Festival's film and video programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give people experiences that are entertaining but
also interactive in some sense,'' says Cheryl Chisholm, who
co-curated the film/video portion of the NBAF with documentary
filmmaker Louis Massiah.
</P>
<P>
   So sure, you may be most interested in checking out ``Homage''
to see what four noted African-American filmmakers (including
Charles Burnett) came up with in short films commissioned
specifically by the NBAF. ``This is the first time we could
commission something,'' says Chisholm of films so new even she
hasn't seen them yet. ``It will be very exciting to see what these
filmmakers have come up with, shooting only one reel.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will also get the chance to see Vibe magazine critic
Harry Allen and Village Voice critic Greg Tate present separate
programs on the aesthetics of music video.
</P>
<P>
   Another new feature of the festival are three workshops about
the business of film, facilitated by three guys who know what
they're talking about. Paris Qualles (``Tuskegee Airmen'' and ``Law
&AMP; Order'') explores the art of writing for the screen. Actor
Charles S. Dutton will talk about making the switch from acting to
directing. And producer Monty Ross, who worked with Spike Lee on
Lee's first six movies, will deal with his area of the business.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a rare screening of Elois Gist's silent film
``Hellbound Train,'' shown with live accompaniment. Chisholm
explains, ``I wanted to bring some audience awareness to the
festival, in terms of the importance of black film preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you don't find something interesting in the
NBAF's film and video offerings, you're not paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is so huge when you talk about black film and
video,'' she adds. ``Lou and I wanted to give audiences a sense of
the full scope of what's going on. We may not have succeeded, but
almost.''

 &HT;    National Black Arts Festival: At the stroke of midnight, a
cultural spark will ignite a very different after-hours party
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--As much a social event as an aesthetic exercise, the
midnight jam sessions that begin tonight as part of the National
Black Arts Festival mark some rare opportunities. The loosely
structured, $10 programs, staged in the main ballroom of the
Renaissance Atlanta Hotel, are like big after-hours parties where
everyone unwinds _ or rewinds _ after a marathon day of readings,
performances and concerts. (For more information, call
404-817-8700.)
</P>
<P>
   The jams are more than a chance to rub shoulders with visiting
culturati, likely to be hoisting cocktails and catching up with
friends and colleagues they last saw in Berlin or San Francisco or
at the last NBAF gathering. The jams are the festival's informal
forum for the kind of free-flowing cross talk that really defines a
culture and a cultural moment.
</P>
<P>
   That cultural moment might take awhile to announce itself.
Though a diverse mix of musicians are scheduled to perform on each
of eight themed evenings, previous festivals have seen complete
ensembles spontaneously materialize well after 2 a.m. It happened
the last time tenor saxophonist David Murray played the fest,
fronting a ragged yet spirited set that was unexpectedly bum-rushed
by Amiri Baraka. The poet (last seen, in an urban noir nod to
Shakespeare, as a homeless ghost in ``Bulworth'') took on the band
with a verbal barrage that mimicked and one-upped Murray's
blustery, low-down horn lines.
</P>
<P>
   It was an extravagant display of personality, the right move to
snatch the attention of a dwindling, last-call crowd that could
head into the next day's festivities with a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   But even in a city as starved for such scenes as Atlanta, not
everyone wants to lose a night's sleep in their pursuit. So
curators Alexa Birdsong and Joe Jennings have packaged the jam
sessions as themed events. Tonight's launching is billed as a New
Orleans Brass Band Blowout, with performances by the Pinstripe
Brass Band and the Furious Five Social Aid and Pleasure Club, two
Crescent City outfits that honor and extend the century-long parade
band tradition. The rest of the series touches on various aspects
of black music, from blues to hip-hop, with such featured
performers as Atlanta guitarists Theodis Ealey (Blues Monday Jam)
and Jacques Lesure (Jazz Jam, Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Other sessions will be devoted to vintage rhythm and blues
(Rhythm Review Party Jam, Saturday) and the vocal tradition
(Singers Unlimited Jam, July 17), while a Tuesday Hip-Hop Jam will
deal with new directions in urban sounds. Both a Late Nite Jam
(July 18) and a Mixed Bag Jam (Wednesday) imply anything-goes
concepts: potluck listening for those with energy to burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an environment within the festival which is more
varied,'' says Jennings, a jazz and R&AMP;B saxophonist who has long
been part of the Atlanta music scene. ``You might have some
drummers there, people from all over the diaspora. You might have
anything happening at any given moment.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite the heavy talent likely to be crowding the room,
Jennings adds that musicians are welcome to sit in at the
appropriate moments: ``We try to make it clear that it is a jam
session.''

 &HT;    It's a wide world of women, gays and politics
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Theater and performance art have been among the
strongest disciplines at the National Black Arts Festival over the
past decade. This year, a lineup of fascinating variety _ from the
distinguished drama of August Wilson to the fiery musical work of
the Freddie Hendricks Youth Ensemble of Atlanta _ promises to carry
on the tradition. Following are highlights for the first few days
of the fest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's ``Jitney'' (opening Sunday at the Alliance Theatre),
produced by Crossroads Theatre of New Brunswick, N.J., is his
affectionate profile of self-employed gypsy or jitney cabdrivers in
his native Pittsburgh. He wrote it in 1979, five years before he
gained Broadway fame with ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' and began
the prolific streak of playwriting that has yielded two Pulitzer
Prizes and several of the Alliance Theatre's most powerful
productions. ``Jitney'' remains the least-known of Wilson's works,
but the current version, recently revised, is on a tour of regional
theaters, headed _ Wilson hopes _ for Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Writing it, he says, was a labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was inspired by the way these guys made something out of
nothing, built a cab service out of an empty storefront and a pay
phone and their own resources, created their own joy,'' the
playwright, 52, says from his Seattle office. ``White cabbies
wouldn't pick up blacks in those days, so this service changed
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Black Woman Speaks'' (4 p.m. Saturday and 8 p.m. Monday at
the 14th Street Playhouse) is a one-woman show by distinguished
thespian Beah Richards _ nominated for an Oscar opposite Sidney
Poitier in ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?'' and for a Tony Award
in James Baldwin's ``The Amen Corner.'' In the patented, irreverent
style she calls motherwit, Richards will offer provocative views on
race and womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   Another opinionated take on contemporary life will come from
Adodi Muse: A Black Gay Ensemble (8 and 10 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday, 14th Street Playhouse). It's not every troupe that can
perform one year under the auspices of the Atlanta Gay and Lesbian
Arts Festival and return the next year for the NBAF. Described by
fest organizers as ``intensely honest,'' Adodi explores black gay
men's changing place and struggle for a toehold in American
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Contract'' (2 p.m. Sunday, 8 p.m. Wednesday), written by
Nathan Ross Freeman and featuring actress-comedian Phyllis Yvonne
Stickney, is an in-your-face work of performance art about the
relationship between the human and the divine.
</P>
<P>
   The pride of inner-city Atlanta, the Freddie Hendricks Youth
Ensemble, will bring back its most popular piece, 1991's ``Soweto!
Soweto! Soweto! A Township Is Calling,'' for a one-night reprise (8
p.m. Monday at the 14th Street Playhouse). It's an open-hearted
response to South Africa's suffering in the ensemble's inimitable
style: raw, tender, honest, electrifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend asked me to write a piece about apartheid, and my
first reaction was, `That's across the water, not my problem,'''
said Hendricks, 42, who formed the ensemble from urban
actor-singer-dancers in their teens and early 20s and is preparing
a new work about teenage pregnancy, suggested by Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I found out, the more I realized how wrong I was,''
Hendricks says. ``In the Soweto student uprising of 1976, there
were incredible stories: children dying, mothers crying. It's
history that our young people absolutely need to know.''

 &HT;    The world watches and wonders what is next at CNN
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm watching you, CNN,'' says director Quentin Tarantino.
Jazzman Wynton Marsalis says the same thing, as does actress
Kirsten Dunst.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's promotional mini-spots, in which celebrities and regular
viewers simply say that they're watching CNN, resonate with an
unintended double meaning these days. People are watching CNN more
closely, the institution if not the cable signal itself (ratings
haven't budged much one way or the other), as it tries to pull out
of the darkest two weeks in its 18-year history.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Operation Tailwind fiasco _ the story
alleging U.S. use of nerve gas, the independent investigation that
shredded the report's journalism, the on-air retraction and
apology, the wounded pride of workers inside CNN Center _ the
network now faces a future in which it must overcome its immediate
past.
</P>
<P>
   As upset as some viewers and outside critics are, many who work
at CNN are outraged. In meetings at CNN Center this week, they have
publicly questioned their leaders' handling of Tailwind with
comments that, in a different context, might have gotten them
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised _ and continue to be _ over whether
correspondent Peter Arnett should have been fired for his on-camera
reporting of the Tailwind story, and whether senior management
should have been more skeptical about a report that, in retrospect,
had serious flaws.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a growing number within CNN, burned out on day
after day of doubts, finger-pointing and self-criticism, who wish
for nothing more than a whopping big news story (preferably with no
loss of life, they qualify), the kind that not only gives CNN one
of its periodic ratings spikes but makes people realize that on
certain types of stories, nobody can touch CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody could have outdone CNN on the extent of its own mea
culpa. In addition to on-air retractions and apologies, CNN posted
on its website the entire 54-page independent report outlining its
own corner-cutting. CNN chairman Tom Johnson personally called the
military personnel involved to apologize, and CNN-US president
Richard Kaplan went on CNN's ``Reliable Sources'' to face a
grilling from critics over why he didn't apply the brakes before
Tailwind aired.
</P>
<P>
   Still, CNN let its own standards down, and let viewers down.
Does that mean it can no longer be believed?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Before it embarrassed itself with Tailwind, CNN
was one of the most respected news organizations in the world. It
may not be right at this moment, but in the long run, that won't
change. ``Dateline NBC'' admitted it rigged pickup trucks to
explode, and has expanded its audience; CNN certainly deserves more
chances than ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, CNN will now be more careful than ever when
producers say they're working on a story that will re-write
history, insisting that every fact and interview be triple-riveted.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen just how Rick Davis, the CNN lifer who's
been named the new executive vice president of editorial standards
and practices, will prevent any more Tailwinds, which is
essentially what he's been charged with doing. Davis could be a
superhero and what would still really matter is whether the
hundreds of people who put on the news can do it right, every time.
</P>
<P>
   Their track record, Tailwind notwithstanding, is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we're watching you, CNN.

 &HT;    `High Art' helps reshape Sheedy
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What comes to mind when you hear the name Ally Sheedy? The Brat
Pack? ``The Breakfast Club''? Judd Nelson?
</P>
<P>
   Well, think again. Those teen-queen roles in the 1980s didn't
let Sheedy use one-tenth of her talent. But ``High Art,'' a
Sundance Film Festival hit, lets her loose, and her work is a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Whippet lean and as angular as a Picasso sketch, Sheedy plays
Lucy Berliner, a gifted photographer who, a decade ago, went from
``hot young thing'' to ``whatever happened to ... '' at the height
of her career. She simply dropped out. By choice, true, but also
out of some instinctive sense of self-preservatIon.
</P>
<P>
   However, all that's ancient history by the time she meets Syd
(Radha Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious, baby-faced editorial assistant at a chichi
Manhattan magazine, Syd lives with her nice-guy boyfriend (Gabriel
Mann) in the apartment below the one Lucy shares with her longtime
lover, Greta (Patricia Clarkson), a heroin addict.
</P>
<P>
   When Syd sees Lucy's work, she's too young to know she's in the
presence of a famous has-been.
</P>
<P>
   But she knows the work is excellent and launches into a
breathless litany of praise before breaking off, embarrassed by her
own loquaciousness. ``That's OK,'' Lucy says with languid humor.
``It's a long time since I've been deconstructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Lisa Cholodenko deconstructs the New York art
world with a deft touch. She shows us seductions of all sorts _
sexual, careerist, simply being part of The Scene.
</P>
<P>
   Where the filmmaker and her characters run into trouble is in
the collision between the inherently toxic art establishment and
the self-destructive artist, which leads to a somewhat predictable
denouement.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's Sheedy, all wired irony and wary intensity in
the film's pivotal role. Her growing attraction for Syd is
presented both credibly and with a canny balance between power trip
and genuine desire.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, best known for the Aussie hit ``Love and Other
Catastrophes,'' is also very good. She's a natural-born but
unwitting user, whose naivete is almost a weapon. And Clarkson is
as hilarious as she is pathetic, wandering around in her heroin
haze, making pronouncements in a guttural Dietrich-like drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``High Art'' is about the seduction of the innocent.
The question we're left to ponder by this challenging film is, who
is the innocent?
</P>
<P>
   ``High Art''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Directed by Lisa
Cholodenko. Rated R for language,
</P>
<P>
   drug use, nudity and passionate kissing.
</P>
<P>
   At Tara. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Former Brat Packer Ally Sheedy gives us some
lessons in the high art of acting.

 &HT;    Danny and Mel back on the mean streets
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend of mine worried about watching ``Lethal Weapon 4,''
because he hadn't seen the first three flicks.
</P>
<P>
   That's a laugh. Director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up movies aren't exactly the ``Star Wars'' trilogy. The
franchise is closer in spirit to the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby
rambles on the ``Road to'' wherever ... only with exploding tanker
trucks instead of musical interludes. And instead of Dorothy Lamour
in a sarong, we get Rene Russo with a pregnant belly and runty Joe
Pesci ranting with his toxic vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   The main event is the re-pairing of Mel Gibson's hothead cop
Riggs and Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. No. 4
sets up their dynamic nicely as they quibble in their car like an
old couple, facing an armored lunatic wielding a flame thrower. And
wondering why he's there. (Riggs' guess: ``Spokesman for the NRA,
maybe?'')
</P>
<P>
   Shaggy and amiable, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' hardly bothers to get
its real plot going for its first hour. That's just as well. What
we get is a tired, borderline offensive tale of a Los Angeles-based
Chinese mafia, importing illegal immigrants to work as slaves in
payment for their passage to America.
</P>
<P>
   The movie tries to balance the bad Chinese dudes with a nice
immigrant family Murtaugh takes under his wing. But that doesn't
keep some of Riggs' ``flied lice'' taunts from having a racist
reek.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Weapon'' rattles along so entertainingly, you won't mind
its plot holes and messy construction. More than ever, the film is
just an excuse to give its crack supporting cast a series of comic
riffs. Each successive movie has brought a new actor on board. This
time it's Chris Rock, playing a cop whose cheery compliments make
Murtaugh nervous. Rock turns out to be a stiff actor, but makes up
for it with his patented comic outrage. Recalling what it was like
having to stay close to the floor, growing up in a trigger-happy
'hood, he says, ``I didn't learn how to walk till I was 10 years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Pesci returns in full sputtering fury. Russo, as the Internal
Affairs officer carrying Riggs' child, gets relegated to the back
seat, but still gets to kick some butt. And Hong Kong action star
Jet Li makes a strong Hollywood debut as the meanest of the Chinese
guys. He's mesmerizing in his feline stillness, and even more
impressive in martial-arts action, a switchblade whirl of spinning
legs and deadly accurate fists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the hyped-up, incoherently staged ``Armageddon,''
``Lethal Weapon 4'' serves up action scenes that are cheerfully
outrageous, yet filmed with a logistical clarity that lets you
suspend your disbelief. And unlike that asteroid movie, it has a
huge saving grace: It's completely free of self-importance. It
knows it's just a dumb movie. But a dumb movie made with this sort
of skill and humor can be one of the best treats of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 4''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover. Directed by Richard Donner.
Rated R for violence and full-blown profanity. 2 hours, 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A worthy, funny continuation of the
guns-and-guffaws formula.

 &HT;    `Madeline' one lovable orphan
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madeline can do anything.
</P>
<P>
   So she is reminded by her beloved teacher-guardian just before
an emergency appendectomy. So she tells herself just before foiling
a band of kidnappers. So she ... well, you get the idea. Anything
can and usually does happen to Madeline, namesake star of this
charming film about a pint-sized, precocious orphan living quite
happily (if a bit precariously) in Paris in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   That she eventually ends up with just about everything a child
could want _ close friends, a loving home, even a loyal, scruffy
dog _ is hardly accidental. ``Madeline'' demonstrates in its own
heartwarming, whimsical way that good things can happen if only
you're willing to work hard and believe in them enough.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Madeline'' is a kids' movie _ and what, exactly, is wrong
with that? In a cine-summer crammed full of rampaging reptiles and
out-of-control asteroids, ``Madeline'' stands out mostly for the
way it makes sleeping 12 to a room and marching and dressing in
lock step seem like so much fun. (Indeed, I haven't so wanted to be
an orphan since I was 6 and my brothers all discovered that I was
afraid of worms.)
</P>
<P>
   As such, the filmmakers were only being faithful to
writer-illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans' beloved creation. Introduced
in 1939's ``Madeline,'' the plucky redhead was ``the smallest'' of
12 little girls living ``in an old house in Paris that was covered
with vines,'' under the watchful eye of Miss Clavel (Frances
McDormand in this version), a kindly nun.
</P>
<P>
   Several generations of little girls have fallen in love with
Madeline, whose misadventures span six books. ``Madeline'' the
movie brings together incidents and characters from four of them.
Then it's all superimposed on a
we're-never-really-very-worried-about-it-happening subplot
concerning an old meanie (Nigel Hawthorne) who's trying to turn the
girls out of their home.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is fast-paced enough to please today's vid-kids, yet
remarkably faithful to the look and feel of the books. Very small
children might need their hands held during several of the movie's
scarier moments. But because everything always ends very happily
and amusingly (find me a recent ``grown-up'' film with a better, or
better setup, line than a kidnapper's frantically uttered ``Forget
the nun, don't kill the idiots!''), it's doubtful that any
long-term damage will result.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Madeline'' makes refreshingly few concessions to the
in-your-face '90s. No drinking, no swearing and only veiled
allusions to what a foul wheel of cheese really smells like.
</P>
<P>
   The acting, meanwhile, smells just right. Oscar winner McDormand
avoids all the overly saintly or silly stereotypes and comes off as
a nice, competent person who also happens to be a nun. Madeline's
housemates seem like real little girls, not a bunch of would-be
dinner-theater Annies.
</P>
<P>
   But the real star _ with the exception of Paris itself, where
the entire movie was gloriously filmed _ is 9-year-old Hatty Jones
as the indomitable Madeline. At first, and even second, glance, the
ginger-haired Londoner appears to be all round cheeks and button
nose. But get a look at the way she sticks out her little chin
whenever the going gets tough, and you quickly come to understand
what she can do.
</P>
<P>
   Anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeline''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frances McDormand, Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Daisy
von Scherler Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: To paraphrase Miss Clavel, something is just right.

 &HT;    `Soldiers' falls short except in violence
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Action figures come alive, start warring with each other (and
any human who gets in their way) and destroy an idyllic small-town
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The setup of ``Small Soldiers'' borrows liberally from other
movies: ``Toy Story,'' ``Indian in the Cupboard,'' even that old
Karen Black TV flick ``Trilogy of Terror,'' the one with the little
devil doll and the big butcher knife. But what the new movie most
resembles, nearly to the point of being a remake, is ``Gremlins.''
That 1984 flick was also directed by Joe Dante, but I guess he
can't sue himself.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy on computer-generated effects and mayhem, but woefully
light on plot twists or interesting characters (either
flesh-and-blood or plastic), the movie's high concept is this: What
if top-secret military weaponry chips were implanted in a new line
of plastic action figures? And an early shipment got loose and
followed their circuits' imperative, to launch war games?
</P>
<P>
   The toys are divided into two groups. There's the Commando
Elite, resembling G.I. Joes on steroids, led by Chip Hazard
(wittily voiced by Tommy Lee Jones). Their enemy: the Gorgonites,
mutant creatures programmed either to submit or to hide. Frank
Langella lends his voice to their mournful leader, Archer. His
passivity is meant to be noble but winds up being annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Getting caught in the two groups' crossfire is young Alan
(Gregory Smith), one of Hollywood's standard-issue, misunderstood
teenagers, who secretly loves his neighbor Christy (Kirsten Dunst)
and believes that his parents don't have any faith in him. As you
might guess, these problems get sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you can guess most of what the movie has in store, due
to a predictable script. The emphasis here is on the design and
computer animation of the toys. They're impressive, but they're not
interesting. Each soldier is designed with distinct physical (and
vocal) differences, but the movie never takes time to individualize
them.
</P>
<P>
   In scenes that rip off the mutant-toy bits from ``Toy Story,''
we also get a band of Barbie-style ``Gwendy'' dolls (voices:
Christina Ricci, Sarah Michelle Gellar). They've been reprogrammed
by the Commando Elite to be a swarming troop of war babes. Besides
being even more implausible than the main premise, this
transformation seems to be there mainly to let Dante pay homage to
``Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the problems with ``Small Soldiers.'' It can wear
you out with its game of name-that-movie, as it parodies everything
from ``Patton'' and ``Apocalypse Now'' to ``The Hunchback of Notre
Dame'' and even ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the violence. Or, as Denis Leary says in the movie,
playing the head of the toy company responsible for the carnage,
``Don't call it violence, call it action.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe parents can tell that to themselves if they're surprised
by the film's high assault level. Toys wield flamethrowers, knives,
nail guns, chain saws and any sort of workshop-meets-kitchen device
they can turn into a weapon. (The PG-13 rating is mainly for the
violence; people do get attacked by the toys, though there's no
human bloodshed or gore.)
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the flick, surveying the impressive damage the
toys have caused, Leary says, ``This could've made a hell of a
commercial.'' Too true. ``Small Soldiers'' feels like a very long
trailer for the movie it might have been. It doesn't have the
inspiration, magic or wit to be memorable (except for one decent
joke about the Spice Girls). Like the dolls that populate it, it's
just the latest product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Soldiers''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Denis Leary and Phil
Hartman. Directed by Joe Dante. Rated PG-13 for mini war game
violence, household destruction, mild profanity. At metro theaters.
1 hour, 49 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: So many toys, so little fun.

 &HT;    Bishop Jakes in Atlanta for religion conference
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready with T.D. Jakes.
</P>
<P>
   That's the title of Bishop Jakes' television show, but it could
also serve as his personal anthem _ a message that is expected to
draw 40,000 people to Atlanta today.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, head of The Potter's House in Dallas, one of the
fastest-growing megachurches in the country, is in Atlanta today
and Saturday to lead a conference focusing on God, women and
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have church,'' Jakes said of this weekend's
event. ``We're going to have an exuberant, joyful service, but we
want to take on tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, it wasn't issues the Texas pastor was dealing with
however. It was his growing popularity, the media, celebritties and
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of his popularity have been popping up everywhere in
recent years _ nine best-selling books, two cable television shows,
speaking tours across the nation _ and he now appears ready to
become America's next preaching superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes is just finishing up a 10-city book tour to promote his
latest book,The Lady, Her Lover and Her Lord'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons,
$19.95). Wednesday night, about 400 fans jammed into a Barnes &AMP;
Noble Bookseller's store in Marietta to greet him. Tuesday, Jakes
signed books on Wall Street and preached at a Harlem churchy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 700 Club, CBS News, and a host of radio and television
station are asking for his time.
</P>
<P>
   I felt funny going to sleep this morning,'' he tells his
advisors. ``I woke up three to four times thinking, ``I don't have
to be anywhere. .''
</P>
<P>
   One of his aides places a schedule in front of Jakes to remind
him that that feeling would not last to long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now who do I have to talk to,?'' Jakes said before sitting on
his hotel bed to do an interview with a radio show.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the celebrities and politicians to deal with,
among them Texas Gov. Georgia Bush and Dallas Cowboy star Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord brought the Bishop in my life,'' Sanders said
Thursday. ``To use a basketball analogy, some basketball players
can shoot but they can't play defense. But the bishop has a
complete game. He's a leader. He's a daddy. He's a theologian . . .
He's complete.''
</P>
<P>
   To be with Jakes Thursday, was to see a man in control, smiling
and working the crowd, knowing his time has come.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, Jakes hustled over to The Industry, a Buckhead
restaurant, to meet with city dignitaries. The Rev. Bernice King,
the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., delivered an electrifying
prayer, calling Jakes a ``spiritual giant.'' Atlanta City
Councilman Michael Bond told the lunchone guests that they were in
the presence of ``God's messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes took pictures with dignitaries and then paused when he saw
his wife, Serita.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get my girlfriend in here,'' he said, pulling her over and
draping his long arms around her.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was back to business. Jakes told the crowd that he
will talk about sensitive subjects at this weekend's conference:
sexual abuse, HIV rates in the black community, hurting single
women.
</P>
<P>
   We are going to have church,'' Jakes said. ``We're going to have
an exuberant, joyful service, but we want to take on tough
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes gazed at the well-heeled crowd and said he was so excited
about the reception to the conference that he was ``about to pop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around long enough to know that you keep your
remarks at a luncheon brief,'' he said. ``All of you are smiling,
but I know you're looking at your salad and saying, 'Lord, how
long?' ``
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly, are the crowds. They demonstrate Jakes'
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   It's a message people are ready to here, at least if it's T.D.
Jakes who's doing the talking.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, seven hours before the doors would open for the first
night of the conference, lines of women _ white and black _ were
assembling outside the Georgia Dome. According to organizers, women
had traveled from Japan and Hawaii to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in the closet. He doesn't have a hidden agenda. He
says, 'I went though this, too.' `` said Lisa Simmons , 35, who
traveled from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't no joke. It's real,'' said her friend, Anita Gore,
38. `` He helped me deal with rejection. People flock to him
because they're hurting.''

   BIRTHRATE-DECLINE (Stockholm, Sweden) _ Driven largely by
prosperity and freedom, millions of women _ here and throughout the
developed world _ are having fewer children than ever before. As a
result, birth rates in many countries are now in a rapid, sustained
decline. Never before _ except in times of plague, war and deep
economic depression _ have birth rates fallen so low, for so long.
What was once regarded universally as a cherished goal _ incredibly
low birth rates _ have in the industrial world at least suddenly
become a cause for alarm. With life expectancy rising at the same
time that fertility drops, most developed countries may soon find
themselves with lopsided societies that will be nearly impossible
to sustain: a large number of elderly and not enough young people
working to support them. By Michael Specter. Special Report, 3,000

stacked in the offices of the National Labor Relations Board are
evidence of what happened instead, producing one of the longest,
most heavily litigated unionization fights in the board's history.
At a time when labor unions nationwide are stepping up efforts to
organize millions of workers, labor leaders and even some
government officials point to the Avondale battle as proof that the
nation's labor laws are cumbersome and replete with loopholes. By

PRINCE WILLIAM'S MEETINGS WITH FATHER'S MISTRESS MAKE HEADLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a get-together that wasn't supposed to happen this
soon, if ever, Prince William has unexpectedly met Camilla Parker
Bowles, the mistress of his father, Prince Charles, and the woman
his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, held responsible for the
breakup of her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Prince Charles confirmed the news and said she
had no objection to its publication, fueling speculation that a
move to gain public acceptance of Mrs. Parker Bowles as consort to
the heir to the throne was resuming. That campaign ended abruptly _
some thought permanently _ last Aug. 31 after Diana was killed in a
car crash in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman said she felt publication did not violate the
agreement by the press to safeguard the privacy of the 16-year-old
Prince, but added that she hoped ``the fact of William's meeting
does not spill over into acres of intrusive, speculative gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, Britain's largest daily tabloid, was the paper that
turned up evidence of the meeting, and it devoted five full pages
of ``World Exclusive'' coverage to details of the encounter in
Thursday's issue. The paper said it had held off publication for 24
hours at Prince Charles' request so he could tell his son that the
matter was about to become public.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Sun and other published accounts Thursday,
William came into London from his school at Eton, near Windsor, on
Friday evening, June 12, to go to the movies with friends. He made
an unplanned stop to change his clothes at his newly decorated
apartment in his father's quarters at St. James' Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker Bowles, a frequent overnight guest, was there, and
his father told him the mix-up was an inevitable ``clash of
diaries.'' He gave his son the choice of greeting her or avoiding
her, and William said he was willing to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   With his father present, William and Mrs. Parker Bowles talked
for 30 minutes, sipping soft drinks and keeping the conversation
light, the press accounts said. Mrs. Parker Bowles was said to be
``trembling'' with nervousness while William maintained the
self-assurance that has gained him much favorable comment in the
tumultuous past year, which has forced him into a public role long
before anyone intended.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, and its chief competitor, The Mirror, in its own
``World Exclusive'' account, both reported that on emerging from
the meeting she asked for a vodka tonic.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the two have met twice more, once for tea and the
second time at a lunch the prince organized. The London press
speculated widely Thursday that William's younger brother, Prince
Harry, 13, would soon be offered the chance to chat with her, if he
had no objection.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Wakeham, head of the Press Complaints Commission, which
monitors the press's compliance with the code of conduct for
reporting on the young princes, said Thursday: ``I recognize that
certain stories have a public interest. The palace thought this one
had, it was justified, and in the circumstances I think it's been
handled very responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, which the British press has largely
complied with, the boys are to be left alone to pursue their
studies and their private lives and can be photographed only at
carefully rationed arranged occasions, usually with their father.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On William's 16th birthday, on June 21, aides to Charles sought
to balance public curiosity about the young prince with his right
to privacy by publishing a mass of details about his adolescence
culled from official records and a series of brief answers he gave
to written questions from The Press Association, Britain's domestic
news agency, about his teen-age likes and dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail has surpassed all other British papers in
printing supplements and promotions connected to the memory of
Diana, and its court reporter, Richard Kay, the late princess's
best friend in the press, reported Thursday that friends of hers
found the decision to let William meet Mrs. Parker Bowles
``astonishingly insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay reported that an unidentified friend said, ``In view of the
wretched history of the triangle, which caused Diana so much
misery, it seems incredible that such a meeting should happen
before the first anniversary of the princess's death.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker Bowles' relationship with Prince Charles has gone on
continually since they met in 1972, but she became a particular
liability for him after Diana told a BBC interviewer in 1996 that
``there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit
crowded.'' It also emerged that the princess's nickname for Mrs.
Parker Bowles was ``the Rottweiler.'' Charles had admitted his
adultery in a television interview a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Mrs. Parker Bowles began to win grudging acceptance
as Charles' loyal companion, and last July he gave her a showy 50th
birthday party at his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, allowing
photographers to snap her as she arrived looking
uncharacteristically radiant in a ball gown.
</P>
<P>
   She took on the chairmanship of a high society charity ball to
be held last September, and speculation was high that the couple
would make their first public joint appearance there. The event was
canceled because of national mourning for Diana.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of Diana and the mass outpouring of grief, Mrs.
Parker Bowles disappeared from public view, but began to reappear
discreetly in recent months. Notably she was Charles' official
partner at a country weekend party he held for a dozen well-known
Britons, including Peter Mandelson, Prime Minister Tony Blair's
chief political strategist, at the queen's Sandringham estate in
Norfolk. Still, she was always kept at a distance when Charles was
with his sons.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Church of England has made it clear it has no
enthusiasm for a wedding between Charles and Mrs. Parker Bowles,
there appear to be no constitutional or official rules barring it.
Acting on Thursday's news, London's bookies slashed the odds on an
eventual marriage from 7 to 1 to 3 to 1. &QL;

TROUBLE OVER TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican congressional leaders are gleeful about
a hot new issue with which to badger President Clinton _ his
declaration during his China trip that the United States does not
support and will not recognize a sovereign Taiwan independent of
the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. Are these folks desperate for political fodder or
what? As a domestic campaign issue, Taiwan's future is not
something that many people under the age of 50 are likely to give a
fig about.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives still reliving the Cold War era, when Taiwan was
the good guy and ``Red'' China a terrifying enemy, are outraged at
what they see as the president's betrayal of an old friend and
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   But getting voters for whom Mao Zedong is but a dim, distant
historical figure all exercised about standing up for Taiwan?
Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all Clinton did was clarify a politically realistic
U.S. policy that had previously been deliberately ambiguous. Since
normalizing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of
China in 1979, we have not questioned China's insistence on
claiming Taiwan as its own.
</P>
<P>
   We recognize the mainland as the only China that exists. Our
position is that Taiwan's future should be determined in peaceful
bilateral negotiations aimed at leading to unification between
Taipei and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's timing was awkward, and Taiwan is miffed. So
Taiwan's backers on Capitol Hill are rushing to reassure the island
that we will still provide a protective shield of some kind against
any Chinese military aggression and will continue to be helpful in
bolstering its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans frustrated by the overall success of the president's
China visit are delighted to single out the Taiwan issue as an
exception. Turning this into a political hot potato for campaign
purposes, however, is quite a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Taiwan has maintained a vast lobbying operation in
the nation's capital that exerts considerable influence on
Congress. But the island means nothing to most American voters.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than 50 years since the pro-American
Nationalist Chinese government led by Chiang Kai-shek fled to
Taiwan to escape the Communist takeover led by Mao Zedong. In the
emotional aftermath of the revolution, the western world rallied
around the Nationalists as the sole legitimate government of China,
in theory merely waiting until the Communists collapsed and they
could return to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived in the nation's capital during the Eisenhower
administration, a powerful ``China lobby'' dictated U.S. policy
toward Asia behind the scenes. Because the mainland's shelling of
its off-shore islands of Quemoy and Matsu was seen as a threat to
Taiwan, the subject dominated the second presidential debate in
1960 between Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy's election, however, quiet diplomacy and the
limited dispatch of U.S. arms calmed the crisis. No voter has been
known to think about Quemoy and Matsu since.
</P>
<P>
   The myth that the government in Taiwan would some day return to
Beijing died in 1972, when President Nixon decided it was time to
deal with the Chinese again.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese and the Soviets were no longer allies and capable of
sweeping all of Southeast Asia into the Communist net. And while
trading with Taiwan has been lucrative, its market of more than 21
million consumers for U.S. goods paled beside the more than 1
billion potential buyers in the crowded mainland.
</P>
<P>
   To open that China door Nixon, a Republican, agreed to
officially drop the notion that Taiwan was a sovereign state and
the one true China. During the Carter administration, Congress
followed through by repudiating an outdated mutual-defense treaty
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Taiwan has been increasingly a historical appendix,
still existing but not of much practical use beyond its strategic
location in the South China Sea. Taiwan is touted as a democracy
compared with China's dictatorial ways, but in fact it was long
dominated by Chiang's heirs and held its first direct election for
a head of state only two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When congressional leaders talk about defending Taiwan's
integrity, it is important to know what vital American interests
they think need protecting, and how. Are they talking about going
into battle against China and shedding American blood? Did we not
learn our lesson in Vietnam about the perils of ground wars in
Asia?
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich came close to promising military
action in 1996. He vowed on a visit to Taiwan that the United
States would use ``all necessary means'' to prevent Beijing from
pressuring Taiwan to capitulate ``by force or intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   We have in fact ordered military maneuvers as a warning when
China has seemed to threaten Taiwan, although no shots have ever
been fired. Clinton, for instance, dispatched Navy ships to Taiwan
in 1996 as a signal that we were displeased with China's war games
near the island at that time.
</P>
<P>
   But what if China calls our bluff? Just how far are we really
prepared to go to carry out the GOP's tough talk about protecting
Taiwan?
</P>
<P>
   Congress is reluctant to authorize the use of military power
without some overwhelming necessity. On Jan. 12, 1991, the Senate
agreed to President George Bush's plan to attack Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait only by a margin of 5 votes. The House went
along with a 67-vote margin. The debate was heated despite the fact
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was a certifiable devil and
everyone knew the vital interest involved: oil.

   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ students throughout Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Artley couldn't escape the legacy of Dick and Jane. In
later years, as he continued his work on the lecture circuit,
Artley composed a little response to the frequent question,
``Whatever happened to Dick, Jane and Sally?''
</P>
<P>
   Artley would tell audiences that Dick became a politician. His
slogan? ``Run, Dick, run.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane married and became an ardent advocate for women's rights:
``Help Jane win equal rights for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally became a primary teacher with a room full of admiring
children. She frequently said to them, ``Jump, children, jump. Jump
high in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Artley considered his work with Dick and Jane secondary to his
calling as a professor, but he became attached to the characters he
spent so much time with, Toalson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These little characters just took on a life of their own,''
she said.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ a GOP revolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being honest with people helps,'' he said about the book.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich ended his Kansas City visit the same way he began it _
by raising money. At a breakfast at a hotel, Gingrich generated
bucks for the Monday Morning political action committee, which aids
Republican candidates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, he was at a hotel in Overland Park, Kan., helping
Rep. Vince Snowbarger of Kansas in his re-election effort against
Democrat Dennis Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Before a crowd estimated at 200, Gingrich urged his listeners to
send a Republican team back to Washington next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Returning Vince will mean a more conservative, smaller
government with lower taxes,'' Gingrich said. ``This is the right
direction and the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Gingrich raised $30,000 at a Snowbarger
fund-raiser before the Republican won his first term. Heading into
Wednesday's event, the Snowbarger campaign already had more than
$100,000 in sponsorships for the event at $1,000 and $500 a person.

   UNDATED: to their testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said when he first read the opinion, he thought, ``What
have I done? How are things ever going to be as usual?'' But he and
other lawyers said plea bargains now must focus on cooperation
before a trial rather than testimony at trial.
</P>
<P>
   John P. O'Connor, a defense attorney and former Jackson County,
Mo., assistant prosecutor, said the ruling could be ``worse for
defendants. Now the plea agreement will say, `You're getting
nothing for your testimony,' which'll make (cooperating witnesses)
better witnesses in front of the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, courts have instructed prosecutors to disclose
their promises to defense attorneys. When a witness with a plea
bargain takes the stand, defense lawyers are free to cross-examine
the witness about the deal, trying to attack the witness's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   For lawyers who represent defendants seeking to cooperate, life
just got more complicated. ``I don't know what to do right now,''
said Carl Cornwell, a Kansas defense lawyer. He said deals with
prosecutors will now involve ``the wink of an eye, `You take care
of me, I'll take care of you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor said he'll tell his clients, ``the people who
testify will get the better deals. As a practical matter, that's
the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Paul Bradshaw, a defense lawyer and former U.S. attorney
for western Missouri, said the ruling, though based on logical
reasoning, ``seems to be so contrary to the plea-bargaining process
that has been used for hundreds of years. It seems to me to be one
of those things that can't end up standing.''

STRESS IS ON A RAMPAGE IN AMERICA'S WORKPLACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: I am fascinated by our fascination with stress.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not doubting its existence or its deleterious physical and
emotional effects. But I'm intrigued by the apparent stress
epiphany among so many workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious stress always has visited the workplace, whether it
was a drought-ravaged farm field, an orchestra in performance, a
military command center or a scientific research laboratory. Now,
though, virtually everyone cites stress on the job as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians approach me at parties to tell me to write about all
the cases of stress-related illnesses they're seeing, particularly
among white-collar professionals at Fortune 500-type companies.
</P>
<P>
   Books regularly land on my desk, replete with suggestions on how
to reduce stress at work.
</P>
<P>
   A survey shows that more than two-thirds of employees say their
heavy workloads are their leading cause of stress.
</P>
<P>
   This finding came from a poll commissioned by the Kensington
Technology Group, which also found that six out of 10 American
workers say they have eye, back, neck, shoulder or wrist pain
associated with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   These two stresses _ the existence of stress and the physical
pains that may be associated with it _ are closely followed by the
stress of trying to balance work and private lives, the same survey
reveals.
</P>
<P>
   Have we all become a bunch of delicate whiners? Or are our work
lives really that awful?
</P>
<P>
   I understand the adrenalin rush (call it stress, if you will) of
racing to meet deadlines. I understand the stress of dealing with
disparate personalities and temperaments in close quarters. I
understand the stress of between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place management
positions.
</P>
<P>
   I also understand that some people thrive on such strains while
others collapse. These collapsed workers are inundating the offices
of physicians and mental health counselors. They are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kensington poll asked workers to define the cause of
their stress, about two-thirds said they were being asked to do too
much work within assigned deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   What can the typical American worker do about that? Obviously,
not much.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing levels are set by complex interactions and expectations
of investors, owners and top management. The average worker isn't
going to get a position added to his or her department because he
or she feels overworked.
</P>
<P>
   If, indeed, overwork is causing this stress explosion, then the
typical worker has limited tools to fight it. There's always the
possibility of changing jobs _ ``downscaling'' in the popular
vernacular _ to reduce hours and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Downscaling, of course, usually means accepting less income.
There is a growing willingness to do that, but certainly not a
wholesale rush.
</P>
<P>
   What's left for the typical worker to fight stress are such
things as getting professional counseling, joining support groups,
meditating, exercising regularly, maintaining good nutrition,
getting enough sleep, using ergonomically correct equipment on the
job and taking breaks when the tension gets too tight to continue
to function.
</P>
<P>
   Any or all of these may not be enough. Maybe today's work world
really is too ferocious for many workers to cope. If so, where does
the responsibility lie for fixing it?

YOUTHFUL IMAGINATION IS WORTH NURTURING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: A figure of immense power and promise came hurtling
down the sidewalk of our block a moment ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a boy of about 3 or 4 years, riding a tricycle and
wearing a cape made from, I would guess, a part of a bedsheet. He
leaned a bit forward, pedaling furiously, hair blowing in the wind,
that magnificent cape billowing out behind.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever mythic character he imagined himself to be, he had
become that personage completely _ at least for as long as the
tricycle remained upright and the cape stayed fastened at his
throat.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered, then, a dream of my own at that age. It was the
dream of flight.
</P>
<P>
   I built my plane from the saved parts of wooden vegetable crates
_ a boxlike compartment to sit in, two flimsy boards for wings, two
more for a tail, the whole contraption mounted on a pair of roller
skates.
</P>
<P>
   Our house perched on a steep terrace above the street. If
launched from the brow of that, it seemed I might attain a velocity
that would let me break gravity's shackles and soar free.
</P>
<P>
   So I positioned my plane at the edge, climbed in the box, and
commanded a little friend, a neighbor boy, to shove me over.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was not a happy one. I walked away from the crash
with only a skinned elbow and chipped tooth, but my plane and my
hope of flying were wrecked beyond saving. It's how childish
enterprises often end up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in spite of such risks, I have wondered why so much of
education's effort is devoted to training the young in various
specific skills, and so little simply to nurturing their capacity
for dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   It was much the same in my own school years, though the tendency
seems more pronounced today.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is because the journey of a life has gotten more
rigorous, more fiercely competitive, with less margin for the
heresies and troubling notions that dreamers are apt to bring to
the table.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is those very ones _ able to set themselves apart by
the power of their imagining _ who shape humanity's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   I saw in the paper the other day where computer whiz Bill Gates
had added a few billions more to his stash, consolidating his
position as the wealthiest human being on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has played a major role in the evolution and popular
acceptance of computer technology. And that's really big money
we're talking about _ certainly nothing to be sniffed at. When
all's said, though, he really is nothing more than a
well-compensated technician, engaged in building a better
mousetrap.
</P>
<P>
   Mohandas Gandhi, by contrast, was among the poorest of men in
material things. But his dream not only propelled India to
independence; it helped light a fire of freedom that would sweep
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the dreamers govern, the technicians serve.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it was so wonderful just now to see that little boy
speeding down the block with his cape aflutter, unencumbered a bit
longer by practicality.
</P>
<P>
   Time and the world may have their way with him, as with us all.
But it hasn't happened yet.

LAST AUTHOR OF DICK AND JANE BOOKS DIES AT 91 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Like millions of other American children,
Judy Toalson and Jan Goldman grew up with Dick and Jane.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters remember they liked the stories about the children
and their younger sister, Sally. And at the beginning of each
school year, when they opened their reading primers, the girls saw
a familiar name on the title page: A. Sterl Artley, their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd say, `Oh, my goodness. There he is again,' '' Goldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Artley, a professor of education at the University of
Missouri-Columbia for 30 years, died Tuesday at an Overland Park
nursing home, where he had lived since 1996. He was 91. His health
had been failing for two years, said Toalson, of Mission Hills,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Artley was the last remaining author of the popular Dick and
Jane reading primers, which were used in schools from the 1930s to
the 1970s. Nationally recognized as a leader in reading
methodology, Artley was hired by Scott, Foresman and Co. in the
late 1940s to revise the ``Fun with Dick and Jane'' reading series.
</P>
<P>
   Along with William S. Grey of the University of Chicago and May
Hill Arbuthnot of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland,
Artley crafted the curriculum used by most schools to teach
children to read. He wrote the teaching manuals that accompanied
the series, which focused on three children who lived in a typical
house in a typical neighborhood in post-war America.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of the series' popularity, about 80 percent of
American schoolchildren read about Dick, Jane and Sally, said
Robert Ravis, manager of copyright and permissions for Scott
Foresman Addison Wesley publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen words were used in the first primer. In the second
book, those words were repeated and 21 others added. No page
introduced more than one word, and no story introduced more than
three words. The first five uses of the word were ``bunched'' _
``go, go, go'' _ to make sure children got the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The simple stories revolved around home, neighborhood and
school. Father had an office job; Mother was a homemaker. They had
a cat and a dog, and the short stories had beginnings, middles and
ends.
</P>
<P>
   The stories enchanted children because they could relate to the
characters, said Marjorie Kaplan, superintendent of the Shawnee
Mission School District in Kansas and a former elementary
schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children always love to read about other children,'' Kaplan
said. ``I can just see myself, sitting there in the reading circle,
reading those books. Those of us who learned to read that way have
an affection for those characters.''
</P>
<P>
   That affection was apparent last summer, when the Johnson County
Museum of History presented ``Dick and Jane: Illustrations of an
American Education,'' a two-month exhibit featuring original art
from the books. Record crowds flocked to the museum during the
exhibit, said Kathy Stump, curator of history.
</P>
<P>
   Retired teachers came to gaze upon the memorabilia. So did baby
boomers who remembered learning to read about Spot, the family dog.
Many visitors recorded their memories in a book at the exhibit's
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also grew up with Dick and Jane and have very fond
memories,'' one visitor from Kansas City, Mo., wrote. ``I was so
excited that I could read `See Dick...See Dick Run.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In another entry, a teacher who learned to read using the series
longed for a similar series to use with her first-grade students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories brought much joy to me as a youngster,'' she
wrote. ``I still love to read.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrific nostalgia trip for people,'' Stump said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the Dick and Jane series came under fire for
reinforcing sexist stereotypes and presenting a lifestyle that was
too ``white'' for much of America. The writers introduced three
black children _ Mike and twins Penny and Pam _ who became Dick and
Jane's playmates.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dick and Jane series really went out of vogue because
other methods of teaching reading achieved success with a greater
number of students, Kaplan said. The strict, controlled vocabulary
of the Scott, Foresman series was replaced in the 1970s with the
whole-language method, which advocates immersing children in
language in all forms _ reading, writing, speaking and listening.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, whole language has come under fire. Proponents
of phonics _ the method of breaking down words into sounds and
teaching children to recognize what symbol goes with what sound _
claim whole language has haphazard results.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Artley endorsed whole language, although he
continued to favor the structured method of the Dick and Jane
series, said Richard Robinson, a professor of curriculum and
instruction at the University of Missouri-Columbia School of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who described Artley as a ``major figure'' in the
field of reading, came to MU in the early 1970s for the chance to
work with Artley, who at one time was president of the
International Reading Association.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired in the 1970s, Artley periodically dropped by
the MU education school. But in recent years, fewer faculty members
recognized the man who helped write the books that taught them to
read.
</P>
<P>
   And that was all right with Artley, Robinson said. He shirked
the limelight, preferring to be known as a pre-eminent teacher of
teachers, a man who personally directed the studies of 46 doctoral
students and 289 master's students.
</P>
<P>
   Toalson and Goldman, of Durango, Colo., agreed with that
assessment. Their father also was proud of the work accomplished
through the MU Child Study Clinic, which he founded. For more than
30 years, the clinic gave graduate students the chance to diagnose
learning disabilities and provided testing services for hundreds of
students throughout Missouri. MORE

JAPANESE BANKS ARE PULLING OUT OF U.S. MARKET 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Overcome by bad loans in their home country,
Japanese banks and other financial institutions are in a broad
retreat from the U.S. market, closing offices and cutting back on
their lending to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   The situation represents a sharp reversal from the late 1980s
and the early 1990s, when Japanese banks were expanding rapidly in
California and elsewhere in the United States, gaining market share
by aggressive lending at low rates and even raising some concern
that the Japanese would dominate banking as they did consumer
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Japanese banks are wary about making new loans or renewing
old ones. ``Basically they're gone, on the sidelines,'' said an
executive at an American bank in charge of making syndicated loans
to corporations who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks accounted for less than 10 percent of the
syndicated loans provided to U.S. companies with investment-grade
credit ratings in the first quarter of 1998, down from 26 percent
in the comparable quarter a year earlier, according to Loan Pricing
Corp., a market research firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks either are pulling out of the United States
altogether or are consolidating operations in New York. The number
of Japanese banks with offices in New York has fallen to 55 from 70
in the last few years, according to a compilation made in February
by Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper. The number with offices
in Los Angeles has dropped to 17 from 25, and in Chicago to 16 from
21.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese banks are also selling part of their U.S.
operations. Fuji Bank raised about $1 billion by selling a minority
stake in Heller Financial Inc., a finance company in Chicago, in an
initial public offering at the end of April. In March, Sumitomo
Bank sold Sumitomo Bank of California to Zions Bancorp of Utah for
$546 million. It also sold off pieces and shut down the rest of its
operation that made loans to small and medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese banking crisis is also accelerating the sale of
Japanese-owned hotels, office buildings and golf courses in the
United States, many of which were bought at exorbitant prices in
the late 1980s. Nikko Securities, for instance, just agreed to sell
the Watergate Hotel in Washington to the Blackstone Group for $39
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fire sale,'' said Shuhei Okuda, president of
Mitsui Fudosan USA, the U.S. arm of a Japanese real estate company.
``They have to sell, especially when the bank presses the borrowers
who own the property to sell and repay the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp retreat from lending by Japanese banks has contributed
to a modest increase in interest rates paid by U.S. corporate
borrowers, bankers and analysts said. Some big financings have
taken longer to arrange. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Trust took
longer than expected to arrange more than $7 billion in loans to
finance its acquisition of ITT Corp., in part because Japanese
banks, which in the past would have provided a big chunk of that
money, declined to participate. The delay in financing even
prompted speculation that the takeover might fall through.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, the retreat from the U.S. market by the
Japanese banks has had little effect on the U.S. economy because
there are many other sources of credit for companies. This
contrasts sharply to the situation in Japan and in other parts of
Asia, where cutbacks in lending by Japanese banks have contributed
to a credit crunch that has driven some companies into bankruptcy
and worsened economic downturns.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the pullback from lending by Japanese
banks has been counterbalanced by financial deregulation in Japan,
which has made it easier for Japanese to invest overseas. With the
dollar strong and interest rates higher in the United States than
in Japan, Japanese money has moved into U.S. stocks, bonds and
banks, helping keep interests rates low and stocks high.
</P>
<P>
   One big fear has not materialized: that the crisis would force
Japanese government and financial institutions to sell off their
U.S. Treasury bonds, causing U.S. interest rates to rise and
slowing the economy. A hint of such a sale by Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto caused the U.S. stock markets to plunge
one day last year. But Treasury bonds are proving attractive to
Japanese and other foreign investors because they pay higher
interest rates compared with similar securities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The most important effect of the Japanese banking crisis on the
United States is likely to come not from cutbacks by Japanese banks
in the United States but more indirectly. The banking crisis is
plunging Japan into recession, which hurts U.S. exports and also is
making it difficult for the rest of ailing Asia to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the most obvious effect in the United States is less
lending by Japanese banks. Beset by at least $600 billion in
problem loans, mainly on Japanese real estate, Japanese banks are
struggling to maintain capital levels equal to 8 percent of assets,
a requirement for international banks. With their capital eroding
from loan losses and the weak Japanese stock market, the banks are
having to reduce assets, which generally means loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their capital base is so eroded they have to reduce assets any
way they can,'' said Richard Koo, chief economist for Nomura
Research Institute in Tokyo.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, assets held by Japanese-owned bank
branches dropped to $347 billion at the end of 1997 from $404
billion at the end of 1994, according to the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Without a big base of dollar-denominated deposits, Japanese
banks and other finance companies generally borrow from other banks
to obtain the money they then lend out in the United States. But
because of fears about the health of the Japanese banking system,
Japanese banks have had to pay higher rates for this borrowed money
than U.S. or European banks do. The banks can no longer profitably
pursue their old strategy of lending at low interest rates to gain
market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're priced out of the market for U.S. companies,'' said
Edward W. Bjelke, executive vice president of Sanwa Bank in New
York. The bank's outstanding loans in the United States have fallen
to about $40 billion from $72 billion a few years ago, he said.
This week, Sanwa said it would liquidate Sanwa Securities (USA)
Co., which has been a dealer of U.S. Treasury securities, and
refocus its investment banking activities on the more profitable
derivatives business.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsui Leasing Capital Corp., a leasing and finance company in
New York that is part of Mitsui Group, recently laid off four of
its six American professionals and is sending four Japanese staff
members back home as it reduces its loans and leases and sells real
estate in Hawaii and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been booking new business,'' said Jeff Fishman, a
vice president who was laid off nine days ago. ``We're in a holding
pattern right now.'' Masato Utsumi, the president, said Mitsui
Leasing was shifting to higher-risk loans and leasings with
potentially better returns because its borrowing costs are now
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Japanese leasing companies, Ryoshin Leasing, which is
part of the Mitsubishi Group, and Crown Leasing, owned by the
troubled Nippon Credit Bank, have shut their U.S. offices entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese banks pulling out of the U.S. market so far have
been mainly smaller, regional banks. The giant nationwide
commercial banks are retrenching as well, though they generally are
not leaving the United States entirely. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank
recently closed its San Francisco office. Sanwa Bank is shutting
offices in Boston, Cleveland and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Los Angeles office of a big Japanese bank said
that with fewer loans being made, decision-making was being
concentrated in New York. ``In the past, I enjoyed the freedom to
develop the business on my own in the 14 Western states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The beachhead of Japanese banking in the United States has been
California, where the Japanese opened retail banking branch
networks, not just corporate banking offices like those in New
York. By the late 1980s, Japanese banks owned four of the 10
largest banks in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese banks by and large have performed more poorly
than competitors, and fears of Japanese dominance have subsided.
The merger of two of the Japanese-owned California banks and the
sale of Sumitomo Bank of California leave only two big
Japanese-owned banks in the state, both of which are now the focus
of speculation that they might be sold.
</P>
<P>
   One is Unionbancal Corp., which has about $30 billion in assets
and is the third-largest commercial bank in the state, behind
BankAmerica and Wells Fargo. With both of those big banks having
recently agreed to mergers, Union, which is controlled by Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, has become the biggest potential takeover
candidate for an out-of-state bank looking to expand in California.
The other bank is Sanwa Bank California, the state's fourth-largest
commercial bank, with assets of $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks deny they are for sale, and both have been performing
better than Sumitomo. Tamio Takakura, president of Sanwa Bank
California, said that with the deregulation of financial markets in
Japan, the expertise his unit had from operating in the ferociously
competitive U.S. market was more valuable than ever to the parent.
The California unit, for instance, is helping to manage mutual
funds offered to Japanese consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are increasingly becoming a strategic unit for them,'' said
Takakura, whose 50th-floor office atop one of the fanciest
skyscrapers in Los Angeles symbolizes the ambitions Japanese banks
once had in the United States. ``They're expecting a lot from us,
not just earnings.''

GINGRICH FEEDS ELEPHANTS AT ZOO, SIGNS BOOKS, RAISES MONEY FOR
GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Newt Gingrich threw apples to the elephants
at the Kansas City Zoo. He tossed brickbats at President Clinton
for his trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   He raised money for Republicans at the first meal of the day and
at the last. And between it all, he tried raising money for himself
by signing copies of his new book Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the speaker's frantic day in the Kansas City
area?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like selling books, but the zoo is a big deal,'' Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   So there he was, the speaker of the House, the man third in line
of succession to the presidency, standing on a rocky ledge _ in
near 90-degree heat _ happily lobbing apples at six female African
elephants at the zoo's Okauango Elephant Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker has had a lifelong passion for zoos. At age 10, he
fought in vain to persuade city leaders in his hometown of
Harrisburg, Pa., to build one.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had visited the Kansas City Zoo before, but not since
its $71 million renovation was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Republican, I'm perfectly happy to be posed in front of
elephants,'' Gingrich said to a throng of television cameras,
before going off on a private tour.
</P>
<P>
   The elephants seemed perfectly happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   He was more serious but equally relaxed earlier at a meeting
with The Kansas City Star's editorial board. In a wide-ranging
session, the speaker whipped out answers with practiced efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 55, saved his harshest rhetoric for Clinton's recent
visit to China and specifically the president's comments about
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's criticism Tuesday,
Gingrich lambasted the president for what he said were harmful
remarks that suggested the United States' commitment to Taiwan and
its healthy democracy was waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very dangerous mistake and very typical of this
administration,'' Gingrich said. ``I can't for the life of me
imagine why he would say it in China.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said the president's comments represented no
change in U.S.-Taiwanese relations.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich was undeterred, saying Clinton had sent a signal to
other countries that the United States was unreliable. The
president should have been clear, Gingrich said, by saying that the
United States would not tolerate any military activity by the
Chinese against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's creating an ambiguity that is very dangerous,'' Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that China gained everything and the United
States nothing from the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time (the leader of) a democracy visits a dictatorship,
it's the dictatorship that gains,'' the speaker said. ``If you
haven't gotten a concession in advance, why would you go?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the editorial board meeting about the legacy of the
so-called 1994 Revolution, when the Republicans captured Congress,
Gingrich didn't blink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It succeeded,'' he said. ``We reformed welfare, balanced the
budget, cut taxes, saved Medicare without a tax increase and just
passed reform of the IRS (Internal Revenue Service). By any
reasonable standard of the summer of 1994, that's a pretty amazing
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP will increase its 11-seat edge in the House by 10 to 40
in November, Gingrich predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the historical tendency for the party controlling the
White House to lose seats in midterm elections, Gingrich said, the
GOP's pledge of lowering taxes will resonate with working
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mathematical odds against Democrats gaining seats are
enormous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Gingrich:
</P>
<P>
   - Suggested the country should begin paying off the national
debt by $10 billion to $20 billion a year, eventually resulting in
lower interest rates by as much as 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   - Pledged again that the House would vote on a campaign reform
bill this year, adding that he supported unlimited individual
contributions, as long as they were reported immediately on the
Internet, but also a ban on corporate and union ``soft money''
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   - Insisted that he didn't know whether he would run for
president in 2000 and wouldn't decide until Labor Day 1999.
</P>
<P>
   - Said Clinton, as the nation's chief law enforcement officer,
should make sure the White House staff cooperates with independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is, we ought to relax and let Judge Starr get
done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Clinton continued to rank high in popularity polls
while the speaker floundered, Gingrich admitted that he was ``too
professorial, too direct'' to be a national leader. He also
suggested the media were biased against him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meantime, succeeds because he steals GOP ideas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's noontime stop for a book-signing event may have been
another reminder of public disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 persons stood waiting for autographs. Other
luminaries, such as Jimmy Carter and Walter Cronkite, drew hundreds
more in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dismal,'' said Roger Doeren of Rainy Day Books in
Fairway, Kan., which sponsored the event.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the heat and the lack of street parking for the poor
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich completed most of his work in 20 minutes, far quicker
than the hour allotted for the task. The book, ``Lessons Learned
the Hard Way: A Personal Report,'' recently was discounted 50
percent by its publisher in an effort to sell more copies. The
account is full of mea culpas for Gingrich's first years as
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old Georgian recounts in sometimes painful detail
his handling of the government shutdown in 1995 and his allegations
of shoddy treatment aboard Air Force One. He writes about his own
ethics violation and about how he almost was dumped from the
speakership in a GOP revolt. MORE

COMMENTARY: IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six weeks we spent in a house containing a 13-year-old girl. It
was exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang every five minutes. It was almost always
another 13-year-old girl trying to reach our 13-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Ours had her own private telephone in her room, but it was
always busy, so her friends had to phone us so we could tell her to
interrupt her other conversation and come talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   After a while one wanted to scream. So did two, which is how
many of us were there on phone-answering duty.
</P>
<P>
   Our 13-year-old's private line was justified as a tool to let
her use her computer's Internet hookup without shutting down the
general house phone.
</P>
<P>
   What she did on the Internet was a mystery. If we entered the
room in which she was toiling over it, she would, at the sound of
our footsteps, throw her body around the screen to block our view.
</P>
<P>
   She was probably talking to astronauts aboard some space
station, or breaking into the Pentagon's master computer system.
Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she was studying the offerings from the thousands of
pornographers said to infest the Internet. We would not have been
surprised. We were once 13 ourselves, and have been embarrassed
about it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   She also had her own private TV set. Such luxuries America
lavishes on its luckier young! This is why her private telephone
line was always busy even when the Internet was closed down.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old girls have this habit:
</P>
<P>
   Two 13-year-old girls in different parts of town turn on the
same TV show. ``Baywatch,'' we learned, is a favorite. Then they
get on the phone to each other and keep the lines open discussing
the show as it progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the general household phone would fall silent for two
or three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With its amazing power to sense an opportunity to harass a
victim, the telemarketing pestilence would ring in and, speaking
through a wheezing electronic voice, order us to hold on briefly
for ``a very important message.''
</P>
<P>
   We never hold on even ever so briefly for anything, human or
inanimate, having learned years ago that nobody respects people
willing to hold on for something or somebody important.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes five or six other 13-year-old girls came to the house.
After ravaging pantry and refrigerator, they conferred with
alarming silence behind closed door in the room containing the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward we would find spoons under the carpet,
ice-cream-stained bowls in the fireplace, watermelon seeds under
the sofa cushions.
</P>
<P>
   The oaths with which we complained were always mild and seemly,
never roaring and unseemly, for the six of them _ ``the gang of
six,'' we called them _ reminded us of Proust. Those lovely summer
girls of his at the seaside in Balbec.
</P>
<P>
   Ah well, that's another tale, for those lovely Proustian girls
did not have three cats, as our 13-year-old had. One of them slept
under her bed and went outside only when swept along vigorously
with a broom.
</P>
<P>
   The other two roamed the premises with proprietary arrogance,
licking the butter dish when they thought they were unobserved,
killing the birds and committing nuisances of a vengeful feline
nature against the two of us.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the chinchilla?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she had a chinchilla caged in her room. It was a large
chinchilla and lived in a cage big enough to rent for $8,000 a
month in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, if uncaged for a romp, the chinchilla would chew
on some electrical wires and blow a fuse, leaving us with a
rewiring job on a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   On soft early summer evenings, school over at last, a
13-year-old girl's mind must turn to memories of Leonardo DiCaprio.
He had long since left town with his doomed steamship, but his
ghost, still lingering in the movie house, lured the gang again and
again to sit through some terrible turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun sank slowly in the west, we said sad farewells to
cats, chinchillas, telephones, Internet, spoons under the carpet
and the pain and the beauty of being 13. We'll go back again, but a
little of youth's beauty will be gone.

ANTI-BRIBERY LAW QUASHES FEDERAL PLEA BARGAINS, JUDGES RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM JACKMAN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Federal prosecutors cannot cut deals with witnesses in
exchange for testimony, a federal appeals court in Denver has ruled
in a case that could dramatically affect how the government
prosecutes criminals nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A drug-conspiracy case in Wichita, Kan., provided the basis for
the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling. A co-defendant
testified against Sonya E. Singleton in exchange for a lighter
sentence, using a plea agreement that lawyers described as
boilerplate language for virtually all federal prosecutions around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Singleton's lawyer, John V. Wachtel of Wichita, argued that
a federal law prohibiting bribery of witnesses should apply to
prosecutors as well as defendants. A three-judge panel, featuring
two judges who also will hear the appeal of Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy McVeigh, unanimously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If justice is perverted when a criminal defendant seeks to buy
testimony from a witness,'' Circuit Judge Paul J. Kelly wrote, ``it
is no less perverted when the government does so.'' Offering a
reduced prison sentence is the same as paying money to a witness,
the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The panel ruled that the co-defendant's testimony should be
disallowed because of the government's illegal promises. The
appeals court ordered Singleton to be retried without the tainted
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most revolutionary case since Gideon, if it
stands,'' said defense lawyer James Wyrsch, referring to the 1963
Supreme Court ruling that every criminal defendant was entitled to
a lawyer. ``It could affect state court prosecutions as well as
federal prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some defense attorneys worried that the ruling will make
negotiating plea bargains more difficult, because prosecutors can't
explicitly promise leniency in exchange for testimony. And
witnesses who have struck deals without such explicit promises will
be tougher to attack on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie N. Williams, the U.S. attorney for Kansas, declined to
comment on the ruling or on what his office's next step would be.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, lawyers would ask the entire 10th Circuit to review a
three-judge panel's ruling. If they fail with the circuit, lawyers
may then appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Brandenburg, a spokesman for the Justice Department in
Washington, said, ``We obviously disagreed with it (the ruling).
The question is what to do now.'' He said Justice Department
lawyers were meeting to determine how to handle the case.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the ruling strictly applies only to the 10th
Circuit, which encompasses Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Utah, New
Mexico and Wyoming, though judges in other circuits could adopt the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see a flood of motions to suppress or motions
to strike'' witnesses who have cut deals with the government, said
Daniel E. Monnat, a Wichita lawyer who's also a director of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Monnat also predicted that lawyers involved in cases already on
appeal will file supplemental briefs citing the Singleton case. He
did not know whether the ruling would affect such cases as
McVeigh's, in which key witness Michael Fortier received a reduced
sentence in exchange for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals on new issues are rarely accepted if the issue wasn't
originally raised during the trial, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the Singleton case noted that it is
practically identical to thousands of criminal cases prosecuted
across the country each year. After Singleton and six others were
indicted in 1996, one of the defendants decided to plead guilty and
testify against the others.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Napoleon Douglas' cooperation, prosecutors in
Wichita promised to ask the judge to reduce Douglas' sentence, not
charge Douglas with any other crimes related to the case, and to
inform both the judge and Douglas' parole board of his cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Singleton's trial in January 1997, her lawyer,
Wachtel, read an article in a criminal-justice journal entitled:
``Paying the Witness _ Why Is It OK for the Prosecution, but Not
the Defense?''
</P>
<P>
   The article was written by an Oakland, Calif., lawyer named J.
Richard Johnston who was familiar with the federal bribery statute,
which reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever directly or indirectly gives, offers, or promises
anything of value to any person, for or because of the testimony
under oath...to be given by such person as a witness (at)
trial...shall be fined...or imprisoned for not more than two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's article concluded by suggesting to defense lawyers
that when prosecutors have promised anything of value in return for
testimony, ``the defense might at least ask the court to inform the
jury that this is an apparent violation of (the bribery statute).''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said he called Johnston and discussed it. Inside his
firm, Wachtel said, ``Everyone said, `You can't win.' '' He asked
U.S. District Judge Frank G. Theis to suppress Douglas' testimony,
and Theis refused.
</P>
<P>
   But in arguments before the 10th Circuit in Denver in January,
Wachtel said, the judges ``were very concerned that the federal
government might be violating the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the 25-page ruling was issued July 1. It concluded that
the government is as subject to the law as anyone else. ``We can
find no policy by which prosecutors may be excused from statutes
regulating testimony presented to the federal courts,'' Kelly
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promising something of value to secure truthful testimony is
as much prohibited as buying perjured testimony,'' the opinion
continued. ``The government may still make deals with accomplices
for their assistance other than testimony, and it may still put
accomplices on the stand; it simply may not attach any promise,
offer, or gift to their testimony.'' MORE

ART THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN 2 WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in `f' and `e' category.) 
(mk) 
 By JIM McCRAW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the art community may look upon ``The Art of
the Motorcycle'' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum as 114 pieces
of 19th- and 20th-century kinetic sculpture from around the world,
the hordes of motorcyclists who will see the show this summer are
likely to view it as a long-overdue celebration of the sport, the
machines and the pioneers they love.
</P>
<P>
   And the exhibition is altogether timely, since 1998 marks the
50th anniversary of Honda motorcycles, the 75th anniversary of BMW
motorcycles (the show's sponsor) and the 95th anniversary of
Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Some 54 museums and private collections around the world
contributed machinery for display on the Guggenheim's spiral
walkways, clad for the summer in stainless steel by the architect
Frank Gehry, who was responsible for the installation.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition starts on the main floor with the world's first
motorcycle, the steam-powered Micheaux-Perreaux of 1868, and a 1998
MV Agusta F4, a 175-mile-an-hour superbike from Italy (on loan from
King Juan Carlos of Spain) raised on a platform, the alpha and
omega of motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry has put the earliest machinery in a single room, including
the first gasoline motorcycle, the 1886 Daimler that marked the
beginning of Daimler-Benz, and several gorgeous three-wheelers.
This way, observers can see the humble beginnings of a worldwide
industry. Upstairs, on the fifth and seventh levels, motorcycles of
the '50s and '90s stand in dimly lit side rooms, wavy ribbons of
highway under their tires.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside that gallery is the first series-produced
motorcycle, the 1894 Hildebrand &AMP; Wolfmuller from Germany, with its
monster 1,500-cubic-centimeter engine and 30-mile-an-hour top
speed. It provided the first hint that these early, utilitarian
machines _ replacements for the horse _ could be beautiful,
exciting and very fast.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few feet from the Hildebrand &AMP; Wolfmuller is one of the
more audacious machines in the show, the 1907 Curtiss, built by
Glenn Curtiss, an aviation pioneer and all-around daredevil.
Powered by an air-cooled V8 engine, this one-of-a-kind machine went
136.36 miles an hour at Ormond Beach, Fla., in 1907, setting a land
speed record that would stand for four years, and a motorcycle
speed record that would not be broken for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Between the record-breaking Curtiss on the Guggenheim's first
level and a delicious silver, Italian-built 1997 Morbidelli V8 _
the world's only production V8 motorcycle _ on the seventh, there
are more than 100 bikes that enthusiasts will find historically
significant, beautiful and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   All the great bikes of the 20th century are represented. There
are several Harley-Davidson street bikes and racing bikes. Among
these is a 1957 Sportster, the machine that pulled Americans back
from their fling with British motorcycles, and that is still
produced 41 years later. Defunct American brands like Indian,
Henderson and Crocker are here, too.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sterling Triumph Bonneville, the bike of choice in
the 1950s for its combination of style, speed and sound; it was a
later version of the Triumph that Marlon Brando rode in ``The Wild
One.'' There is a Vincent Black Shadow, the fastest bike of its
time, with the biggest engine of its day (1,000cc) and a design
that used the engine itself as part of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   A personal favorite is the Ariel Square Four, with an engine
unlike any before or since. Whereas the Triumph is a ``vertical
twin,'' with one piston going up while the other goes down, the
Ariel Square Four has two vertical twins in one engine block, with
two crankshafts joined together. It was an idea that did not
endure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A gleaming Matchless G50 stands here, a single-cylinder 500cc
machine that raced successfully for years, unlike today's
one-season wonders. There is a Norton Manx, a monster that made its
name in races on the Isle of Man. Several BMWs are included _ from
the R32 of 1923, a wonderful melding of Art Deco and Bauhaus
design, to the 1998 R1200C cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is well represented by a handful of Moto Guzzis, with
distinctive sideways V-twin engines and shaft drive. Exotic racing
and street Ducatis, the epitome of Italian industrial design, are
here in force, as are MV Agustas, significant for their world
championships and gorgeous aluminum castings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the Honda Super Cub of 1958, every Japanese brand
is accounted for. Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki are each
significant for their mechanical one-upmanship, their quality and
their broad appeal. It is no accident that Japanese companies are
the world's most successful motorcycle makers.
</P>
<P>
   There are bikes that gave a kick-start to car companies, that
grew up from scooters and bicycles, that came from arms makers,
aircraft manufacturers and international conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Are some bikes missing? Sure. There is, for instance, no Suzuki
RE5, the first bike with a Wankel rotary engine, which was followed
later by a Norton rotary. Both succumbed to anti-smog regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a Honda CBX, an in-line six-cylinder that far
outsold the Benelli Sei six-cylinder from Italy that is
represented. There are no late-model turbo-charged bikes from
Japan. No Yamaha R1, the quickest bike in the world, zooming a
quarter-mile in less than 10 seconds. No Honda CBR1100XX, which is
the world's fastest street bike, capable of reaching 180 mph.
</P>
<P>
   And there is not a single police cycle on display. That is
astonishing, considering police bikes' importance to law
enforcement, their continual use in movies and their continued
production in the thousands every year. There are a couple of very
nice World War II military bikes, a German Zundapp and a U.S. Navy
Harley.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is light on sidecars, too, but the Bohmerland
that is here is red, yellow and wonderful. The Bohmerland
motorcycle and wood-trimmed sidecar could haul up to six people and
had a special low-range transmission for traversing mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation is simple, straightforward and uncluttered.
There are no rails, cables or cordons between the viewer and the
motorcycles. Each bike is held up on its tires, not by its
kickstand or center stand, but by tiny nonintrusive cables and
wedges of clear plastic, to give the impression that each bike
stands on its own. The information about each is printed directly
on the floor. The walls are stark white, and bare, with the
exception of a historic-placement blurb at the start of each
section, and there is plenty of light on the subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry and his colleagues could have slathered the walls with
film stills, advertising and poster art, but they didn't, and the
exhibition is better for it. These are elsewhere, mounted in
display cases along the rails of the walkways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of The Motorcycle'' is impressive in its depth,
breadth and purpose, worth several visits for avid motorcyclists.
No major museum will show this many motorcycles again for a long
time, and no other museum may ever do it this well.

   NEW YORK _ While the art community may look upon ``The Art of
the Motorcycle'' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum as 114 pieces
of 19th- and 20th-century kinetic sculpture from around the world,
the hordes of motorcyclists who will see the show this summer are
likely to view it as a long-overdue celebration of the sport, the
machines and the pioneers they love.
</P>
<P>
   And the exhibition is altogether timely, since 1998 marks the
50th anniversary of Honda motorcycles, the 75th anniversary of BMW
motorcycles (the show's sponsor) and the 95th anniversary of
Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Some 54 museums and private collections around the world
contributed machinery for display on the Guggenheim's spiral
walkways, clad for the summer in stainless steel by the architect
Frank Gehry, who was responsible for the installation.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition starts on the main floor with the world's first
motorcycle, the steam-powered Micheaux-Perreaux of 1868, and a 1998
MV Agusta F4, a 175-mile-an-hour superbike from Italy (on loan from
King Juan Carlos of Spain) raised on a platform, the alpha and
omega of motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry has put the earliest machinery in a single room, including
the first gasoline motorcycle, the 1886 Daimler that marked the
beginning of Daimler-Benz, and several gorgeous three-wheelers.
This way, observers can see the humble beginnings of a worldwide
industry. Upstairs, on the fifth and seventh levels, motorcycles of
the '50s and '90s stand in dimly lit side rooms, wavy ribbons of
highway under their tires.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside that gallery is the first series-produced
motorcycle, the 1894 Hildebrand &AMP; Wolfmuller from Germany, with its
monster 1,500-cubic-centimeter engine and 30-mile-an-hour top
speed. It provided the first hint that these early, utilitarian
machines _ replacements for the horse _ could be beautiful,
exciting and very fast.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few feet from the Hildebrand &AMP; Wolfmuller is one of the
more audacious machines in the show, the 1907 Curtiss, built by
Glenn Curtiss, an aviation pioneer and all-around daredevil.
Powered by an air-cooled V8 engine, this one-of-a-kind machine went
136.36 miles an hour at Ormond Beach, Fla., in 1907, setting a land
speed record that would stand for four years, and a motorcycle
speed record that would not be broken for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Between the record-breaking Curtiss on the Guggenheim's first
level and a delicious silver, Italian-built 1997 Morbidelli V8 _
the world's only production V8 motorcycle _ on the seventh, there
are more than 100 bikes that enthusiasts will find historically
significant, beautiful and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   All the great bikes of the 20th century are represented. There
are several Harley-Davidson street bikes and racing bikes. Among
these is a 1957 Sportster, the machine that pulled Americans back
from their fling with British motorcycles, and that is still
produced 41 years later. Defunct American brands like Indian,
Henderson and Crocker are here, too.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sterling Triumph Bonneville, the bike of choice in
the 1950s for its combination of style, speed and sound; it was a
later version of the Triumph that Marlon Brando rode in ``The Wild
One.'' There is a Vincent Black Shadow, the fastest bike of its
time, with the biggest engine of its day (1,000cc) and a design
that used the engine itself as part of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   A personal favorite is the Ariel Square Four, with an engine
unlike any before or since. Whereas the Triumph is a ``vertical
twin,'' with one piston going up while the other goes down, the
Ariel Square Four has two vertical twins in one engine block, with
two crankshafts joined together. It was an idea that did not
endure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A gleaming Matchless G50 stands here, a single-cylinder 500cc
machine that raced successfully for years, unlike today's
one-season wonders. There is a Norton Manx, a monster that made its
name in races on the Isle of Man. Several BMWs are included _ from
the R32 of 1923, a wonderful melding of Art Deco and Bauhaus
design, to the 1998 R1200C cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is well represented by a handful of Moto Guzzis, with
distinctive sideways V-twin engines and shaft drive. Exotic racing
and street Ducatis, the epitome of Italian industrial design, are
here in force, as are MV Agustas, significant for their world
championships and gorgeous aluminum castings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the Honda Super Cub of 1958, every Japanese brand
is accounted for. Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki are each
significant for their mechanical one-upmanship, their quality and
their broad appeal. It is no accident that Japanese companies are
the world's most successful motorcycle makers.
</P>
<P>
   There are bikes that gave a kick-start to car companies, that
grew up from scooters and bicycles, that came from arms makers,
aircraft manufacturers and international conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Are some bikes missing? Sure. There is, for instance, no Suzuki
RE5, the first bike with a Wankel rotary engine, which was followed
later by a Norton rotary. Both succumbed to anti-smog regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a Honda CBX, an in-line six-cylinder that far
outsold the Benelli Sei six-cylinder from Italy that is
represented. There are no late-model turbo-charged bikes from
Japan. No Yamaha R1, the quickest bike in the world, zooming a
quarter-mile in less than 10 seconds. No Honda CBR1100XX, which is
the world's fastest street bike, capable of reaching 180 mph.
</P>
<P>
   And there is not a single police cycle on display. That is
astonishing, considering police bikes' importance to law
enforcement, their continual use in movies and their continued
production in the thousands every year. There are a couple of very
nice World War II military bikes, a German Zundapp and a U.S. Navy
Harley.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ Mia Hulton is a true woman of the late 20th
century. Soft-spoken, well-educated and thoughtful, she sings
Renaissance music in a choral group, lives quietly with the man she
loves and works like a demon seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, she is in full pursuit of an academic career. And despite
the fact that she lives in Sweden _ which provides more support for
women who want families than any other country _ Ms. Hulton doesn't
see how she can possibly make room in her life for babies. Someday
maybe, but certainly not soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I think perhaps I will be missing
something important if I don't have a child,'' she said slowly,
trying to put her complicated desires into simple words. ``But
today women finally have so many chances to have the life they
want. To travel and work and learn. It's exciting and demanding. I
just find it hard to see where the children would fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hulton would never consider herself a radical, but she has
become a cadre in one of the fundamental social revolutions of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Driven largely by prosperity and freedom, millions of women
throughout the developed world are having fewer children than ever
before. They stay in school longer, put more emphasis on work and
marry later. As a result, birth rates in many countries are now in
a rapid, sustained decline.
</P>
<P>
   Never before _ except in times of plague, war and deep economic
depression _ have birth rates fallen so low, for so long.
</P>
<P>
   What was once regarded universally as a cherished goal _
incredibly low birth rates _ have in the industrial world at least
suddenly become a cause for alarm. With life expectancy rising at
the same time that fertility drops, most developed countries may
soon find themselves with lopsided societies that will be nearly
impossible to sustain: a large number of elderly and not enough
young people working to support them. The change will affect every
program _ from health care and education to pension plans and
military spending _ that requires public funds.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer a single country in Europe where people are
having enough children to replace themselves when they die. Italy
recently became the first nation in history where there are more
people over the age of 60 than there are under the age of 20. This
year Germany, Greece and Spain will probably all cross the same
eerie divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at this in a philosophical way,'' said
Jean-Claude Chesnais, director of research at France's National
Institute for the Study of Demography. No country has worried more,
or more publicly, about the implications of a low birth rate. Like
so many other European nations, uneasy officials there see in
current trends a world where populations of color _ from Africa,
India, Asia _ are still growing, while their own is struggling to
keep from shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is old and rigid,'' Chesnais said. ``So it is fading.
You can see that as the natural cycle of civilization, perhaps
something inevitable. And in many ways, low population growth is
wonderful. Certainly to control fertility in China, Bangladesh,
much of Africa _ that is an absolute triumph. Yet we must look
beyond simple numbers. And here I think Europe may be in the
vanguard of a very profound trend. Because you cannot have a
successful world without children in it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE OUTLOOK: Worldwide Drop Confounds Experts
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the shift will resonate far beyond Europe. Last
year Japan's fertility rate _ the number of children born to the
average woman in a lifetime _ fell to 1.39, the lowest level it has
ever reached. In the United States, where a large pool of new
immigrants helps keep the birth rate higher than in any other
prosperous country, the figure is still slightly below an average
of 2.1 children per woman _ the magic number needed to keep the
population from starting to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the developing world, where overcrowding remains a major
cause of desperation and disease, the pace of growth has slowed
almost everywhere. Since 1965, according to United Nations
population data, the birth rate in the Third World has been cut in
half _ from 6 children per woman to 3. In the last decade alone,
for example, the figure in Bangladesh has fallen from 6.2 children
per woman to 3.4. That's a bigger drop than in the previous two
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than 25 years have passed since a famous set of
computer studies sponsored by the Club of Rome, the global think
tank, showed that population pressures would devastate the world by
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of the kind has come to pass. The authors of that dire
forecast could not have foreseen 30 years ago that women in
countries like Italy would by now be producing an average of fewer
than 1.2 children, the lowest figure ever recorded among humans. Or
that the Berlin Wall would disappear, creating economic
uncertainties that have frozen the birth rate from the Black Forest
to Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where women work more than ever before and
contraception remains readily available, it is hard to find
somebody who believes that someday soon large families will make a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking of having children in the future, perhaps two,''
said Roberta Lenzi, 27, who is single and studies political science
in Bologna, Italy, the city with the lowest birthrate in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an only child and if I could, I'd have more than one
child. But most couples I know wait until their 30s to have
children. People want to have their own life, they want to have a
successful career. When you see life in these terms, children are
an impediment. At most you'll have one, more are rare.''
</P>
<P>
   There has long been an assumption that low birth rates were
better than high birth rates. Fewer people put less strain on the
resources of the planet. And anyway, as a country becomes richer
its people always have fewer children. If more people are needed,
immigration can be a solution _ and in many places, specialists now
think it's the only one left. But Europe, unlike the United States,
has been resistant to immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening now has simply never happened before in the
history of the world,'' said Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer
based at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ``This is
terra incognita. If these trends continue, in a generation or two
there may be countries where most people's only blood relatives
will be their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it be a lonelier and sadder world?'' he continued.
``Yes, I think it would. But that might simply be the limits of my
own imagination. Frankly, it's just impossible to really conceive
of what this world will be like in 50 years. But when you come to
the end of one era it's almost always impossible to see your way
into the next.''

<P>
   THE WATERSHED: Birth Incentives No Longer Work
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no country has tried harder to change the future than
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, with its birth rate dwindling, Sweden decided to
support family life with a public generosity found nowhere else.
Couples who both work and have small children enjoy cash payments,
tax incentives and job leaves combined with incredible flexibility
to work part time for as many as eight years after a child's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden spends 10 times as much as Italy or Spain on programs
intended to support families. It spends nearly three times as much
per person on such programs as the United States. So there should
be no surprise that Sweden, despite its wealth, had the highest
birth rate in Europe by 1991.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 million mostly middle-class people, Sweden may have
little in common with any other. But its experience clearly
suggested that if countries wanted more babies they would have to
pay for them, through tax incentives, parental leave programs and
family support. At least that's what nearly all the experts thought
it showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a model for the world,'' said Marten Lagergren, under
secretary in the Ministry of Social Health and Welfare, and the man
responsible for figuring out what is happening with Sweden's birth
rate. ``They all came to examine us. People thought we had some
secret. Unfortunately, it seems that we do not.''

   Sometime after 1990, the bottom dropped out of Sweden's baby
boom. Between then and 1995, the birth rate fell sharply, from 2.12
to 1.6. Most people blamed the economy, which had turned sour and
forced politicians to trim _ ever so slightly _ the country's
benefit program. It is normal for people to put off having children
when the future looks doubtful, so the change made sense.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the economy got better and the birth rate fell faster
and farther than ever. By March of this year the figure for Sweden
was the almost same as that in Japan _ 1.42. And though it's too
soon to say, officials here think it might be falling still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody on earth can tell you what is going on here,'' said Mac
Murray, a philosopher trained in statistics who is in charge of
strategic planning for the nation's school system. ``Sometimes I
think it must be just a blip _ we've had them before _ and
everything will turn out the way we expect it to. But I guess I
don't really believe that. I believe we are seeing a fundamental
shift in human behavior. We have lived for 200 years on the idea of
progress. That the future will be better than the past. It's a
universal belief _ not just in our little country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think those days have ended now. I have no data to
support my views. But young people now seem to have a sense that
living for today is about the best they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Murray's job to plan for the material implications of
these changes. But it's not going to be easy. Sweden has 6,000
schools serving children from the ages of 6 to 18. This year there
are more than 130,000 8-year-olds in the system _ 1990 was a boom
year for births. They need classrooms and teachers and all the
support that goes with them.
</P>
<P>
   But in just three years the 8-year-old population will shrink
drastically, to 75,000. ``So what are we doing?'' Murray asked
rhetorically. ``We are recruiting more teachers now than ever
before and giving them raises that nobody else can hope to have.
Have you ever tried to tell a politician to plan for something
that's 20 years away?'' It is a problem felt across Europe as the
elderly supplant the young.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be many more young people than old people in the
world. Right now there are roughly equal numbers. But by 2050,
according to data supplied by the European Union, there will be
nearly twice as many old people as young people. Yet most
governments programs still encourage people to retire early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole system is backward,'' said Massimo Livi-Bacci,
professor of demography at the University of Florence. ``In Italy
we are paying people to retire at an earlier age than ever before
even though we know they are now going to live longer than ever
before. We have the best pension system in Europe and the worst
system for family support. Rich old people supported by the labor
of poor young people. No wonder nobody wants to have a family.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PERCEPTION: The Good Life Is Top Priority
</P>
<P>
   Ask dozens of people, and few of them even realize that the
birth rate is dropping all across Europe. When they do think about
it, most people see it as somebody else's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am supposed to have an extra child to help the system?''
said Jan Delaror, a recently married marketing expert for Erikkson
AB, the Swedish telephone giant. Delaror says he has no children
but expects to ``if and when it makes sense, not because the
government thinks it's a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaror was standing in the middle of the Sture Gallery, one of
Stockholm's many exclusive malls. He was trying to decide whether
to buy a box of Havana cigars, for several hundred dollars, or to
wait until he traveled to London in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as easy to have children these days as it once was,''
he said, voicing a commonly held belief. ``The sacrifices are not
always acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In surveys, young couples almost always report that they want
two children _ but many also mention the future and their concerns
for maintaining a good life. It doesn't seem to matter that
materially at least _ people in the developed world live better now
than they ever have. There is a perception _ shared even in vastly
different countries like Sweden and Italy _ that what was possible
for previous generations is not possible for this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a child but my work situation is unstable,''
said Francesca Casotti, 29, a lawyer in Rome who has been married
nine months. ``I'm at the office all day and it is difficult to
think about having a child. People my age want their freedom. They
see children as a burden, as an inconvenience. I'd like to have a
stable job and I'd like to have more than one child. But there is
the economic question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children cost more than they used to,'' she continued. ``Today
you have to bring them to the pool and you need to get a nanny, and
they have to learn a foreign language. Children have more needs.
Parents just didn't think of all these things before.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees, of course, that the need for pool
memberships or foreign language tuition is responsible for such a
remarkable drop in birth rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become so selfish, so greedy,'' said Ninni Lundblad,
31, a biologist who works in Stockholm. Ms. Lundblad has no
children but hopes that will soon change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did your parents sit down with a spreadsheet and figure out
whether they could afford to have two or three children?'' she
said, her bright eyes widening at the absurdity of her own
statement. No, of course not. Did this ever happen before anywhere?
No, of course not. We live in the richest place and at the best
time, and everyone is worrying whether they can afford to take
their next vacation or buy a boat. It's kind of sickening,
really.''

<P>
   THE EPICENTER: Bologna Focuses Help on Elderly
</P>
<P>
   If there were a ground zero in the epidemic of low fertility it
would have to be in the northern Italian city of Bologna, where
women give birth to an average of fewer than one child (in 1997,
the number was 0.8). The city has more highly educated women than
any other in the country. Incomes average more than $16,500 a year.
Produce is rich and cheap, food is wonderful and living is
generally easy.
</P>
<P>
   The local population has dropped steadily for two decades, but
1,500 people turn 75 every year. Fewer children and more elderly
mean a greater need for health care programs and specialized
housing and transportation. But that does nothing to help or
encourage young couples to have families.
</P>
<P>
   This year the budgets for retirees and children are roughly the
same in Bologna, a city of 375,000. Next year 5 percent will be
shifted from the young to the old. And that will happen every year
for the next decade as the city becomes filled with elderly and
starved for children.
</P>
<P>
   How did Italy, a largely Roman Catholic country that has always
been seen as the stereotypical land of big, close-knit families,
became the place with the world's lowest level of fertility?
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosperity has strangled us,'' said Dr. Pierpaolo Donati,
professor of sociology at the University of Bologna and a leading
Catholic intellectual. ``Comfort is now the only thing anybody
believes in,'' he said. ``The ethic of sacrifice for a family _ one
of the basic ideas of human societies _ has become a historical
notion. It is astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Donati sees selfishness, however, others see women who
have been placed under monumental stress. To some minds, the women
of Italy _ and of other southern European countries like Spain and
Portugal _ have the worst of both worlds. They now work for a
living in record numbers, but tremendous obstacles remain for
balancing work and family life.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than in places like Sweden, France, or even the United
States, the Italian man still seeks a wife who will make his dinner
every night and who takes complete charge of the family. Women have
responded by realizing that with only 24 hours in each day
something has to give. Children seem to have become that something.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the changes, and what they will mean, are
difficult to ignore. In 20 years, at present birth rates, for every
child under the age of 5 in Bologna there will be 25 people over
the age of 50 _ and 10 of them will be older than 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to have a human society built like this,''
Donati said. ``Something simply has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Vitali agrees. The mayor of the longtime leftish town _
its nickname Red Bologna still stands _ Vitali is a former
Communist who likes to invoke the name of the city's cardinal when
talking about population figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal says our lack of interest in families symbolizes
our loss of faith in ourselves,'' he said. ``It's sort of hard to
disagree with that. Let's face it, something is going on here that
is very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   But exactly how troubling is it? And for whom? The birth rate is
dropping, but there are still plenty of people on the earth. As a
result, the world's total population is still growing rapidly, and
that won't stop for at least another generation _ when more than
two thirds of all countries are at or below the replacement level.
The fertility rate of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where
population growth is viewed as weapon of war against Israel, has
soared to 8.8 children per woman. The 45 nations of East, West and
Middle Africa average more than six births per woman.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the populations of Europe (including Russia) and
Africa are about the same. If trends continue as they are now, by
2050 Africans will outnumber Europeans three to one. Between now
and then, India will add more people to its labor force than
currently live in all of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And in that same year, half of all residents of Italy will be
over the age of 50. Half of the residents of Iraq will be under 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is there doesn't have to be a demographic
catastrophe,'' said Lalla Golfarelli, the head of family planning
in Bologna. ``Look at a map. Look at Europe on that map. We are all
only two to four hours away by boat or plane away from many
countries with many people. Open the gates. Immigration can solve
this problem. If people would just open their minds they would
realize there are enough people on this earth to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, either the developed world adapts _ and that
probably means large waves of immigration _ or it gets pushed
aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is hardly about to disappear,'' said Jan Hoem, head
of the demographics faculty at the University of Stockholm. ``It's
just becoming a very different place.''

FILIBUSTER KILLS BILL TO LIMIT DAMAGES IN PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., W.Va., Wash., Miss., S.D., S.C.)  (th) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supporters of a measure to set nationwide standards
for court-awarded damages for injuries caused by faulty products
failed Thursday to win a crucial vote, leaving the issue consigned
once again to the legislative wilderness, perhaps for years.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-47 vote to proceed on the bill was nine short of the 60
votes needed to end a filibuster by its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's finished for the year,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The development was a deep disappointment for Sen. Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who had
worked over the last two years to forge a compromise that would win
enough votes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton vetoed an earlier version of the
bill, saying it tilted the playing field too much in favor of
business interests against consumers. But Rockefeller and Gorton
thought they were finally within sight of victory when the White
House recently agreed to the latest version of the legislation
provided there were no significant changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the events of the last few days showed just how fragile the
situation was for the bill's supporters as they tried to navigate
against strong political head winds.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats were searching for a way to have the Senate
consider a variety of other issues like health care along with the
products bill. They were angered that Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., blocked them from amending the products liability
bill to include legislation providing a so-called patients' bill of
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the
Senate, said the final blow to the bill's chances came with the
disclosure that Lott, the Republican leader, had quietly inserted
an amendment to benefit a company in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that nobody saw it,'' Daschle said about the
Lott amendment. Democrats were already upset at Lott's efforts to
prevent them from introducing their amendments when they learned of
his special provision for Baxter Healthcare Corp., one of
Mississippi's largest employers. Daschle said that the Lott action
upset ``a very delicate compromise worked out over many, many
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rockefeller felt obliged to vote with fellow Democrats
against moving ahead with the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott protested that Democrats were using the issue of his
amendment for Baxter as an excuse to scuttle the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The duplicity that is going on here is staggering,'' he fumed
to reporters. He said that he hoped to reintroduce similar
legislation in the next Congress, an acknowledgment that with a
dwindling number of days remaining in this short congressional
session it would be virtually impossible to resurrect the issue
this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the roll call in the Senate dealt a slow end to the measure,
lobbyists for the consumer groups and trial lawyers who had opposed
it held an impromptu celebration in the east reception room off the
Senate floor. They cheered loudly when Sen. Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C., who was the bill's chief opponent, walked into their midst.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the bill extended its greatest protections only to
small businesses, those with fewer than 25 employees or with less
than $5 million in annual sales. As a result, trade organizations
representing the nation's largest corporations no longer supported
the bill, leaving groups representing small businesses to carry the
burden.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the nation should regulate damages in court cases has
been hotly debated for years.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure argued that legislation is needed to
put a cap on multimillion-dollar jury awards that are out of
control and inhibit manufacturers and add to consumer costs.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, like Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a
consumer group in Washington, have argued that by limiting awards
for punitive damages, which are typically given to express anger at
reckless or outrageously negligent actions, there is little
incentive for manufacturers to stop making unsafe products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the merits of the argument, the debate was fought
with millions of dollars in campaign donations and lobbying fees.
It involved two of the most generous sources of political
donations, the Association of American Trial Lawyers, who generally
support Democrats, and manufacturers and businesses, who generally
support Republicans. &QL;

FEINSTEIN SAYS SHE WILL SUPPORT FLAG AMENDMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein detoured from the Democratic
leadership Thursday, vowing to vote this fall for a Republican-led
constitutional amendment that would empower Congress to ban flag
desecration.
</P>
<P>
   California's senior senator said she has believed since
childhood that the American flag is a ``unique representation of
our Democratic union'' and ``much more than a piece of cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   She likened the flag to the Constitution, and said burning and
desecrating it goes well beyond the free speech protections
provided in the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that isn't speech _ it's conduct,'' she said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the form of shorts or a T-shirt, it's a piece of cloth,''
Feinstein said. ``But in the form of the flag, it's very special
... There are two things that unify us, language and our flag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The flag is the overwhelming symbol of our nation,'' Feinstein
said. ``People die for it ... The American flag holds a unique
position in our society as the most important and widely recognized
representation of our freedom and unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, 65, said she recalls seeing a newspaper photo of
Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima in the final months of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most graphic images I have ever seen,''
Feinstein said. ``At the same time that those soldiers raised the
flag, they raised the hopes and the spirits of the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans groups have lobbied for the amendment this year and in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big issue for them,'' Feinstein said, adding
that many soldiers ``carried the flag into battle and died for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag amendment has wide support from Republicans, including
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., whose support is
crucial for moving the issue to the floor for a vote. Spearheading
the amendment is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's position runs counter to that of many Democrats,
including Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., who has
said the flag is important, ``but freedom of speech is more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Other foes of the amendment say flag burnings or other methods
of flag desecration are extremely rare and don't warrant altering
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Flag Alliance, a group pushing the amendment, says
it can count 64 senators for the amendment, which needs 67 votes or
two-thirds of the senators present to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment, which would carve out an exception to
the First Amendment by giving Congress the power to enact laws
against flag desecration, has already won House approval. If it
passes the Senate, the amendment would require ratification by
three-fourths of the states.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate a majority of voters favor the flag amendment and
49 states have passed resolutions asking Congress to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The flag amendment would overturn U.S. Supreme Court rulings in
1989 and 1990 that struck down state and federal flag desecration
laws as unconstitutional violations of freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, the House voted 310-114 House vote in favor of the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a flag amendment passed the House by a 312-120 vote,
but it fell three votes short in the Senate. That amendment would
have allowed state legislatures as well as Congress to enact
flag-protection laws.

SPASMODIC DYSPHONIA TREATMENTS MORE THAN JUST TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - The Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., is one of
about half a dozen medical centers in the country conducting
research on the vocal disorder spasmodic dysphonia.
</P>
<P>
   Spasmodic dysphonia is a rare condition often mistaken for voice
strain or emotional illness. Although stress may exacerbate the
condition, it is a neurological disorder caused by faulty nerve
signals traveling from the basal ganglia area of the brain _ where
muscle movement is controlled _ to the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of spasmodic dysphonia. In the adductor
type, the vocal cords are squeezed shut, producing strangled,
strained speech. In the less common abductor type, the cords remain
open, producing intermittent breathiness.
</P>
<P>
   No cause is known, but in some patients there appears to be a
genetic component.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment for the ailment includes surgery in which a portion of
the laryngeal nerve is removed. For some patients, this proves to
be an effective long-term remedy. For others, it may provide only
temporary relief or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, injections of botulinum toxin, or botox,
have proved a safe, effective, non-surgical treatment. The botox
temporarily weakens the vocal cords, leaving the voice soft or
breathy, depending on the amount of toxin given. As the toxin wears
off, the voice becomes stronger, producing a normal voice that can
last from three to six months or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Injections then must be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment of patients with the adductor type of spasmodic
dysphonia is more successful than for those who suffer the abductor
type.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors are still unfamiliar with the condition, and
patients may flounder before finding a proper diagnosis. But word
is spreading in the medical community, says Dr. Stephen Bansberg,
an otolaryngologist who treats about 200 spasmodic dysphonia
patients at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more now that know it and recognize it so they
can get them (patients) to us faster, so we can treat it,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis takes a practiced ear. No blood test exists to detect
the disorder; no scanning device can find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diagnosis is basically listening to the voice,'' Bansberg
says.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients come for treatment every three to four months.
Thursday is botox day at Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   Bansberg has seen dramatic recoveries in his patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a personal standpoint, it has become a significant part
of my practice,'' he says. Thursday ``has been one of my most
enjoyable days, my most fun thing to do. It's professionally
gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime sufferers are most grateful for the treatment. After
struggling for years to improve their speech, they revel in the
botox therapy.

   Younger patients who have yet to experience the worst of the
disorder are dismayed at the prospect of life-long treatment.
</P>
<P>
   They may have to wait some time for a cure, Mayo neurologist Dr.
Charles Adler says.
</P>
<P>
   Adler, who works in the field of movement disorders, says cures
for such neurological illnesses as Parkinson's disease and Lou
Gehrig's disease are more imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Until a cure is found, surgery and botox injections are the
patient's best hope. But that's pretty good, Bansberg says.
</P>
<P>
   Though spasmodic dysphonia is a rare condition, it is a
significant impairment. Some patients have voices so weak and so
strained ``it brings you to tears,'' Bansberg says.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that without treatment, they would fear losing their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone, the power of speech is an essential part of human
existence, Bansberg says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice is part of their being. It defines them as a
person.'' &QL;

   A book about hiking the Appalachian Trail? Spare me.
</P>
<P>
   I could imagine it: We walked. We saw trees. We went up. We went
down.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me while I watch some paint dry, or curl up with a good
phone directory.
</P>
<P>
   So why, on a sunny, crisp day, did I drive three hours to walk a
few miles of that trail with the book's author?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Because the author is Bill Bryson, whose ``Notes From a
Small Island'' is a decidedly untouristy, nonlinear trek around
England, where he lived for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   And ``A Walk in the Woods,'' published by Broadway Books and on
The New York Times best-seller list for the fifth week July 12,
turned out to be far more than a walk on the Appalachian Trail. His
comically out-of-shape hiking partner, Stephen Katz (``he brought
to mind Orson Welles after a very bad night''), announces at the
outset that he cannot go an hour without a doughnut. And trail
banter is not the high-minded soul-searching of, say, Meriwether
Lewis, but: ``These college kids are willing to trade Pop Tarts for
Snickers. What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   And why did he tackle the trail? No furrowed-brow, Everest-size
rationale _ no ``because it's THERE'' _ for Bryson. No, it was so
that the sight of the ``guys in camouflage pants and hunting hats''
at the local diner wouldn't make him ``feel like such a cupcake.''
</P>
<P>
   Splitting the difference between New York City and his home in
Hanover, N.H., we met in Williamstown, Mass.; the Appalachian
Trail, bouncing along the Berkshires, passes near here.
Appropriately, considering the junk-food theme that meanders so
defiantly through the book, we met at a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   What was I in for? Bryson, on the page, seems like a cross
between boisterous stand-up comic and jovial misanthrope, skewering
practically everyone in his, well, path. Was I turning myself into
comic fodder?
</P>
<P>
   Probably. But when Bryson stepped out of his minivan, trademark
pipe in mouth, I didn't see a boisterous comic. I encountered a
gentle man, with a reddish beard, a National Geographic cap and
probably a bit more bulk than he had when he was in hiking trim.
</P>
<P>
   He and I headed off on our quest, which, befitting the book's
loony tone, nearly evolved into ``Searching for the Appalachian
Trail With Bill Bryson.'' He'd said in his book that often the
hardest part was getting onto the trail, and, sure enough, back and
forth we drove: ``Right past here.'' ``No, couldn't be this far.''
``I remember after coming out of the woods, sitting and having a
smoke just there.'' Even though he is an Iowa native, he has
acquired a hint of a British accent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after asking a couple of neighbors, we tracked it down:
a skinny parting of the woods, a single white blaze painted on a
tree set back from the road.
</P>
<P>
   And it was through this inauspicious gateway that we stepped
onto the great trail. When one hears of the Appalachian Trail
marching grandly from Georgia to Maine, the Holy Grail of thousands
of hikers, it is easy to imagine some glittering promenade,
something out of ``The Wizard of Oz'' perhaps. Or, at the very
least, a wide, formidable path.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is often more like what we encountered: dense,
rocky woods, sometimes with something resembling a path, sometimes
just a scramble. The hiker is essentially alone in the vast forest
that covers much of the Eastern United States, following, like
Hansel or Gretel with backpack, the white rectangles of paint that
the kindly trail-blazers have sprinkled in their wake. These
blazes, depending on the terrain, might appear on trees, standing
or fallen, or on a rock outcropping.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 100 yards into the woods, whose leaves were just gearing
up for their coming-out party, the shy Appalachian Trail finally
announced itself, with a sign assuring us that, ahead, lay Mount
Greylock and points south. Perhaps in understatement, perhaps not
to dispirit ``through hikers,'' it did not give the distance to
Georgia, which is perhaps 1,500-plus miles.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson walked ahead of me, clearly in his element out on this
trail, but seemingly exerting himself more than a seasoned hiker
would be expected to, even though he was not burdened by a hefty
backpacker's pack. In fact, to my surprise, he had no pack at all,
and turned down several offers of water from my daypack.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed a swampy area, where logs split lengthwise had been
inserted as a bridge, then headed up Mount Greylock, a solitary
peak that dominates the landscape here. As we did, the comic in
Bryson poked softly through as he related the unusual way he was
catapulted into full-time writing, something he had long pined to
do.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, while he was an editor at The Times of London, he and
his family were vacationing in Yorkshire. He ``was moaning more
than usual'' about escaping to some such place and focusing on his
writing. A few days after returning to work, his wife, Cynthia,
called and said: ``I've put the house on the market. If you're
going to do it, do it.'' (He recounted this with a laugh, but when
I asked his wife about it later, she said, ``He was furious.'')
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the house was sold, they moved to the country
and the rest is history, or at least Bryson's particular brand of
travel writing.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he'd written with reverence that the trail ``is
said to be the largest volunteer-run undertaking on the planet.''
On his walk, he'd seen various volunteers doing trail maintenance,
and his reverence was intact now. ``Look,'' he said, pointing to a
fallen sawn-off log. ``Someone came up here with a chain saw _ FOR
US.'' A pause, then a childlike, heartfelt, ``Bless them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whoops. We suddenly realized that the trail, and the white
blazes, had vanished. There is always a danger in the woods,
especially if you get lost in conversation or in reverie, that the
trail can zig when the instinct of your feet tells you to zag. We
retraced our steps, found the missed turn _ sure enough, it had
been marked by a log laid across the trail-not-to-be-taken, but we
had stepped right over it _ and headed steeply uphill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get lost on the trail,'' Bryson said as we huffed
upward, ``but once you do, it's easy to compound it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he tells of being accidentally separated overnight
from Katz deep in the Maine woods. It ended well, on a typically
comic note (``Lost, no water _ and you with the chocolate chip
cookies,'' Katz whined), but Bryson said now with true emotion,
``I've never been so happy to see another person.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz is a butt of so many jokes _ he balked at leaving a motel
to return to the trail because ``The X-Files'' was on and he'd just
stocked up on cream soda _ that I'd marveled that he didn't mind
the ridicule. ``It's a pseudonym,'' Bryson said. ``Katz was the
name of a Des Moines drugstore.'' Was ``Katz'' exaggerated?
``Plenty!'' he shot back with a grin. ``But is that what the trip
was like? Exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   On their 1996 trip, Bryson and ``Katz'' did not finish the
trail; they did a long stretch here, little bits there, for a total
of 870 miles out of more than 2,100. ``I plan to do the whole
thing,'' Bryson insisted now. But his writing is so giddy, so
loopy, that completeness would somehow seem a sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only part I feel guilty about,'' he said, ``is not
finishing the 100-mile wilderness in Maine,'' a weeklong trek that
completes the trail with a triumphant ascent of Mount Katahdin.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson, who is 46 (``but I have a body that's much older''), had
lamented how quickly he had gotten out of shape. And at one
particularly rugged spot, with the trail rising dramatically
through a stand of evergreens, the views starting to open up
through the trees, he said, ``If this gets much steeper, this'll
have to be a memorial article: the end of Bill Bryson.''
</P>
<P>
   He does walk most places: ``I have to because I've written about
it so much.'' In the book, he comes up with the startling statistic
that an average American walks just 350 yards a day, a state of
affairs he calls ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   We hiked an hour or so to a windy clearing that delivered a
stunning vista of Williamstown and the Vermont hills beyond. After
coming north through New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, the
trail from here skims the spine of Vermont's Green Mountains, then
crosses into New Hampshire at Hanover, where, since 1995, Bryson
has lived with his wife and four children, aged 7 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   From a spot like this, I could easily imagine the lure of the
Appalachian Trail, the lure of being pulled along over those
mountains. The trail, from here, seemed like an idyllic stroll over
modest mountains, though in fact it ranges from the literally
pedestrian _ walking along roads or across the Bear Mountain Bridge
in New York _ to the grueling, like the steep, rocky, wind-blasted
ascent of Mount Washington in New Hampshire's White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Even knowing that, the pull was strong, but reality intruded.
Time was scarce. We would have to turn around here.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference is
celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Appalachian Trail this
year, dating to the 1923 completion of a section in Harriman State
Park. Bryson, in giving the history of the trail, notes that work
began in earnest in 1930 and the trail was completed in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   I offered some trail mix, but he turned it down. ``I can't eat
things like that anymore,'' he said. ``I ate so much of it.'' But
he eyed my particular mix with scientific interest, clearly having
become a connoisseur. Then, with a cold wind blowing and the
sweeping vista as a backdrop, he huddled under his jacket to light
his pipe. On his hike, he said, he got bored at his campsite at
night, so he picked up a pipe when he first dropped in on
civilization. But ``I plan to quit on the book tour,'' he vowed.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson glanced longingly at the sign that said three miles or so
to the top of Greylock, pointing to another inauspicious parting of
the woods, and said, ``I wish we had time to go the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   He was about to take a break for a trip to England, ``to get
away from my publicist,'' he said with a laugh. ``No, it's to plan
a TV series _ a sort of `Notes From a Small Island' on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   And his next book? ``It will be about Australia,'' he said.
``I'd always thought of Australia as `Baywatch' with cricket, but
after going there I know there's a lot more to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This hike, he said as we reluctantly headed down, ``was one of
my favorite days on the trail.'' Then he paused and added with a
slight sigh: ``I could DO this. If someone said, `I'd give you a
living wage to go out and walk every day,' I'd do it.''

CLINTON SAYS HE WILL SIGN IRS OVERHAUL MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acting on an election-year crowd-pleaser, the
Senate Thursday adopted and sent to President Clinton legislation
that will change the rules of the game for the nation's most hated
government bureaucrat _ the tax collector.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday that he will sign into law the most
comprehensive overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service in 46 years.
The bill will extend rights and protections to taxpayers subjected
to audits every year, as well as shorten the time needed to take
advantage of a cut in the capital-gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of politically explosive congressional hearings
featuring taxpayers' tales of abuse by the IRS, Congress designed
the legislation to accelerate the transformation of the IRS from a
feared and aggressive tax collector to a customer-friendly agency
focused on the 98 percent of taxpayers whose returns are never
audited.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break provision, which critics contend primarily
benefits wealthy stock speculators, will reduce the time
investments must be held to qualify for lower 20 percent capital
gains tax to 12 months from 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 96-2 to adopt the bill, while the House two
weeks earlier approved it 402-8. Senators opposing the measure were
Democrats Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and John D. Rockefeller IV of
West Virginia. GOP Senators Jon Kyl of Arizona and Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the Senate has finally passed bipartisan
legislation to reform the IRS and strengthen taxpayer rights,''
Clinton said in a statement. ``This reform will help my effort to
create an IRS that respects American taxpayers and respects their
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate majority leader Trent Lott congratulated Clinton for
``finally coming around to our side on IRS reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the White House said we didn't need significant IRS
reform,'' said Lott. ``They supported weak reforms and opposed
creating an oversight board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration acknowledged that IRS abuses took
place, but insisted they were uncommon and not experienced by the
vast majority of taxpayers. A compromise in the measure will allow
a new oversight board to provide strategic direction for the IRS,
but leave day-to-day operational decisions in the hands of
government workers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will cost an estimated $12.9 billion over 10
years as a result of less-aggressive tax collections. To offset
part of that cost, the law will allow some wealthy, elderly
taxpayers to convert their individual retirement accounts into Roth
IRAs, which should raise an estimated $8 billion in the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek said the legislation will help Tax
Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti reorganize and modernize the
agency that collects $1.6 trillion in taxes every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to provide us with the kind of tools we need to
provide the kind of services we want to offer,'' said Pyrek.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will shift the burden of proof in many cases
from the taxpayer to the IRS, a change that brings tax prosecution
more in line with other criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``For far too long, the Internal Revenue Service has been
allowed to consolidate power without the counterbalance of
accountability,'' said Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ``This is the bipartisan
conference agreement on a plan that will effectively change the way
the Internal Revenue Service does business.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will create a nine-member oversight board, which
will include six members from the private sector, to help develop a
strategic plan for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, a former Virginia high-technology executive appointed
by Clinton to take over the beleaguered agency last November, will
get new powers over personnel intended to speed up the
reorganization into a more businesslike operation.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will require the IRS to fire an employee who lies,
falsifies, or detroys documents to hide mistakes or deliberately
fas to obtain approval signatures on documents authorizing the
seizure of a taxpayers' home, personal belongings or business
assets. The bill will create a new Treasury Department inspector
general for tax administration to oversee wrongdoing by IRS
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also will protect innocent spouses from tax bills
incurred by their divorced or separated partners and make it more
difficult for the IRS to seize residences to satisfy unpaid tax
bills. It also will restrict the agency's ability to charge
interest and levy penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will prohibit the IRS from seizing a home to cover
the cost of tax bills amounting to less than $5,000 and will
require the agency to first obtain a court order.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping measure was a priority for Republican lawmakers who
view it as part of their tax-cut philosophy. The reorganization
attracted Democratic and White House support after a series of
congressional hearings featured wronged taxpayers last fall and
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders consider the IRS bill as the first step
toward eliminating the entire tax code. The House earlier this year
voted narrowly to abolish the tax code, but that bill is not
expected to pass the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the legislation, requested by Las Vegas
gambling interests who provide free meals to their workers, will
allow the meals to be tax free for the employees and be a tax
deduction for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will also replace the trade law term ``most
favored nation'' with ``normal trade relations.'' Granting ``most
favored nation'' status to a country, such as China, has become a
contentious issue in recent years, and many lawmakers were
uncomfortable with the term because it suggested a preferential
status.

</P>
<P>
   Katz is a butt of so many jokes _ he balked at leaving a motel
to return to the trail because ``The X-Files'' was on and he'd just
stocked up on cream soda _ that I'd marveled that he didn't mind
the ridicule. ``It's a pseudonym,'' Bryson said. ``Katz was the
name of a Des Moines drugstore.'' Was ``Katz'' exaggerated?
``Plenty!'' he shot back with a grin. ``But is that what the trip
was like? Exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   On their 1996 trip, Bryson and ``Katz'' did not finish the
trail; they did a long stretch here, little bits there, for a total
of 870 miles out of more than 2,100. ``I plan to do the whole
thing,'' Bryson insisted now. But his writing is so giddy, so
loopy, that completeness would somehow seem a sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only part I feel guilty about,'' he said, ``is not
finishing the 100-mile wilderness in Maine,'' a weeklong trek that
completes the trail with a triumphant ascent of Mount Katahdin.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson, who is 46 (``but I have a body that's much older''), had
lamented how quickly he had gotten out of shape. And at one
particularly rugged spot, with the trail rising dramatically
through a stand of evergreens, the views starting to open up
through the trees, he said, ``If this gets much steeper, this'll
have to be a memorial article: the end of Bill Bryson.''
</P>
<P>
   He does walk most places: ``I have to because I've written about
it so much.'' In the book, he comes up with the startling statistic
that an average American walks just 350 yards a day, a state of
affairs he calls ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   We hiked an hour or so to a windy clearing that delivered a
stunning vista of Williamstown and the Vermont hills beyond. After
coming north through New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, the
trail from here skims the spine of Vermont's Green Mountains, then
crosses into New Hampshire at Hanover, where, since 1995, Bryson
has lived with his wife and four children, aged 7 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   From a spot like this, I could easily imagine the lure of the
Appalachian Trail, the lure of being pulled along over those
mountains. The trail, from here, seemed like an idyllic stroll over
modest mountains, though in fact it ranges from the literally
pedestrian _ walking along roads or across the Bear Mountain Bridge
in New York _ to the grueling, like the steep, rocky, wind-blasted
ascent of Mount Washington in New Hampshire's White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Even knowing that, the pull was strong, but reality intruded.
Time was scarce. We would have to turn around here.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference is
celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Appalachian Trail this
year, dating to the 1923 completion of a section in Harriman State
Park. Bryson, in giving the history of the trail, notes that work
began in earnest in 1930 and the trail was completed in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   I offered some trail mix, but he turned it down. ``I can't eat
things like that anymore,'' he said. ``I ate so much of it.'' But
he eyed my particular mix with scientific interest, clearly having
become a connoisseur. Then, with a cold wind blowing and the
sweeping vista as a backdrop, he huddled under his jacket to light
his pipe. On his hike, he said, he got bored at his campsite at
night, so he picked up a pipe when he first dropped in on
civilization. But ``I plan to quit on the book tour,'' he vowed.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson glanced longingly at the sign that said three miles or so
to the top of Greylock, pointing to another inauspicious parting of
the woods, and said, ``I wish we had time to go the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   He was about to take a break for a trip to England, ``to get
away from my publicist,'' he said with a laugh. ``No, it's to plan
a TV series _ a sort of `Notes From a Small Island' on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   And his next book? ``It will be about Australia,'' he said.
``I'd always thought of Australia as `Baywatch' with cricket, but
after going there I know there's a lot more to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This hike, he said as we reluctantly headed down, ``was one of
my favorite days on the trail.'' Then he paused and added with a
slight sigh: ``I could DO this. If someone said, `I'd give you a
living wage to go out and walk every day,' I'd do it.''

   FILM-LOVETT-TEX (Undated) _ Two Texans are having breakfast with
screenwriter-director Don Roos when Roos asks them to explain the
difference between Dallas and Fort Worth. One of the Texans is Lyle
Lovett, so it seems best to defer to him. Lovett, having just
polished off a plate of ``huevos rancheros,'' gives the standard

then, Lovett waxes nostalgic. By Robert Philpot.
</P>
<P>
   CELEBS-BULLOCK-COX _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Actress Sandra Bullock may
be best known for her roles as an Internet whiz and a damsel in

serving in the same division as a first lieutenant named Harry
Truman. Fought at Verdun and in the Argonne, returned home, found
that his fiancee was dead of the flu. He became a steelworker and
outlived two wives. An unremarkable life, except for this: When he

Hollingsworth.

Alexie, the nationally known Indian writer and Seattle resident who
turns to film now with the indie production of ``Smoke Signals,'' a
film festival hit which opens nationally and in Seattle on July 3.
Just what makes this 32-year-old phenom run? And is he is danger of
spreading himself too thin, what with his poems, short stories,
novels and films, plus a relentless schedule of public appearances.

<P>
   ROY-ROGERS-APPRECIATION-HNS (Undated) _ Roy Rogers was really a
guy named Leonard Slye who was born in Cincinnati but grew up in
Marietta, Ohio. The fact that he was a fellow Ohioan was not lost
on me. Even as a 6-year-old member-in-good-standing of the Roy
Rogers Club, Columbus chapter, I felt we had a special bond. By
Cynthia Robins.
</P>
<P>
   MOXLEY-MURDER-BOS (Greenwich, Conn.) _ Twenty-three years after
the bloody murder of Martha Moxley, investigators are reopening the
case, probably hoping DNA typing can finally identify the killers.
By Ellen O'Brien. (2 takes)
</P>
<P>
   ALLENDE-COOKING-NYT (Undated) _ The morning sun that flooded
Isabel Allende's kitchen was as innocent and unblemished as a
perfect egg yolk. It slid across the hand-painted ceramic tile
counter, warmed her back and made her dangling silver earrings
sparkle. But the 56-year-old Chilean novelist was, for the moment,
immune to the poetry and the pleasure of the spring sun. Bent in
her own shadow, calibrating the flame under the omelet pan on her
stove, Ms. Allende, had surrendered to an atavistic ritual of the
kind that might have made a scene in one of her novels. By Molly
O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   HANNAH-HOME (Oxford, Miss.) _ It's not easy to imagine what sort
of house Barry Hannah might live in. His characters, who saunter
and stumble and soliloquize through his heavily autobiographical
fiction seem to have no home: they are drunk at the controls of a
jet or bargaining with God atop a horse or roaring down the road in
a Lincoln with beer cans rattling around the floorboard. So it is
strange to step out of Hannah's Jeep Cherokee, with a basket of
bright new tennis balls in the back seat, and onto the driveway of
his modest, Eisenhower-era house in this pretty, antebellum town.
By Randy Kennedy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein detoured from the Democratic
leadership Thursday, vowing to vote this fall for a Republican-led
constitutional amendment that would empower Congress to ban flag
desecration.
</P>
<P>
   California's senior senator said she has believed since
childhood that the American flag is a ``unique representation of
our Democratic union'' and ``much more than a piece of cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Feinstein joined 49 Republicans and 13 other Democrats
in voting for a flag-protection amendment, but it fell three votes
short of the necessary two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   She likened the flag to the Constitution, and said burning and
desecrating it goes well beyond the free speech protections
provided in the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that isn't speech _ it's conduct,'' she said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the form of shorts or a T-shirt, it's a piece of cloth,''
Feinstein said. ``But in the form of the flag, it's very special
... There are two things that unify us, language and our flag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The flag is the overwhelming symbol of our nation,'' Feinstein
said. ``People die for it ... The American flag holds a unique
position in our society as the most important and widely recognized
representation of our freedom and unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, 65, said she recalls seeing a newspaper photo of
Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima in the final months of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most graphic images I have ever seen,''
Feinstein said. ``At the same time that those soldiers raised the
flag, they raised the hopes and the spirits of the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans groups have lobbied for the amendment this year and in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big issue for them,'' Feinstein said, adding
that many soldiers ``carried the flag into battle and died for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag amendment has wide support from Republicans, including
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., whose support is
crucial for moving the issue to the floor for a vote. Spearheading
the amendment is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's position runs counter to that of many Democrats,
including Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., who has
said the flag is important, ``but freedom of speech is more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Other foes of the amendment say flag burnings or other methods
of flag desecration are extremely rare and don't warrant altering
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Flag Alliance, a group pushing the amendment, says
it can count 64 senators for the amendment, which needs 67 votes or
two-thirds of the senators present to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment, which would carve out an exception to
the First Amendment by giving Congress the power to enact laws
against flag desecration, has already won House approval. If it
passes the Senate, the amendment would require ratification by
three-fourths of the states.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate a majority of voters favor the flag amendment and
49 states have passed resolutions asking Congress to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The flag amendment would overturn U.S. Supreme Court rulings in
1989 and 1990 that struck down state and federal flag desecration
laws as unconstitutional violations of freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, the House voted 310-114 House vote in favor of the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 flag amendment passed the House by a 312-120 vote
before failing in the Senate. That amendment would have allowed
state legislatures as well as Congress to enact flag-protection
laws.

Brazil's coach stands alone
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ Brazil coach Mario Zagallo stood there alone,
pandemonium breaking out around him, an ear-splitting din spreading
across the Stade Velodrome and Brazil celebrating a berth in the
World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   Players and assistant coaches sprinted onto the field to
celebrate the stirring penalty-kick shootout win over the
Netherlands on Tuesday. Drum beats and blinding colors filled the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo tried to rejoice, but after a few steps onto the field,
he stopped, slumped his shoulders and burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   He walked in a small circle and looked around the stadium, as if
searching for someone to hug. He took off his glasses and lowered
his head, as his chest trembled from the emotion and tears streamed
down his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known the yellow jerseys a long time,'' Zagallo said.
``I was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have been the most appropriate picture of them all
Tuesday night, as Brazil moved toward Sunday's World Cup showdown
with France.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo, 66, the ``Gray Wolf,'' a man whose every move has been
scrutinized and often criticized for most of the past four years,
celebrated the moment by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Always, Zagallo has by himself had to withstand the pressure of
coaching the world's greatest soccer team under the world's
greatest collective microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are involved in Brazilian football, you are expected
to be a dominating team,'' Zagallo said. ``I know this.''
</P>
<P>
   And when even the slightest imperfection shows itself, of which
there were several in the months before Tuesday night's victory,
Brazilians traditionally skewer the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the coach is Zagallo, who has been involved with the
Brazilian monster practically since birth and in most countries
would be a legend, it does not seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even moments before Tuesday's wild celebration, when Zagallo
made the bold move of picking Emerson as one of his five choices in
the penalty shootout, gasps of surprise could be heard inside the
stadium as Emerson walked toward the penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
   Before that critical moment, Emerson had appeared in only two
games throughout the tournament and had just five national-team
appearances total. But Zagallo went with a hunch.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Brazilian media _ you think American journalists
are critical? _ literally were yelling at Zagallo from the media
stands, calling him an old fool.
</P>
<P>
   But Emerson easily whipped in the shot. Brazil won.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I saw in training I knew he was a penalty-taker,''
Zagallo said of Emerson. ``He has good nerve. And he took his
penalty just as he did in training.''
</P>
<P>
   By himself, Zagallo took the chance on the young Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Barely more than a week earlier, when Brazil lost a meaningless
first-round game to Norway after clinching first place in Group A,
Zagallo again was in the middle of the fire, with calls for him to
be fired even as the team moved on.
</P>
<P>
   He was called ``a second-rate coach'' by legendary Brazilian
star Carlos Alberto. It was pointed out over and over again in the
media that only one team ever had lost a first-round game and went
on to win the World Cup (Germany, in 1990).
</P>
<P>
   Others criticized Zagallo for sticking to a game style that was
40 years old, as Brazilian newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo called it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the incomparable Pel, a longtime friend of Zagallo's, said
the Brazilian team looked slow and badly prepared in first-round
games.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo's response: ``The World Cup doesn't begin until after
group play. Without a shadow of a doubt, we will respond. The
players know what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil responded with a 4-1 thrashing of highly regarded Chile
in the round of 16 and has not stopped steaming toward a fifth
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just one match to go,'' Zagallo said. ``We will get
there. We will get the fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo has been a part of all four of Brazil's titles.
</P>
<P>
   He was a teammate of a teen-age Pel in 1958, when Brazil blasted
Sweden 5-2 in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later in Chile, he was the veteran captain and
acknowledged heart of a Brazilian team that topped Czechoslovakia
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he was head coach and helped assemble perhaps the
greatest soccer team in history, with the likes of Pel, Jairzinho
and Carlos Alberto cruising through the tournament and overwhelming
Italy 4-1 for the championship at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   And four years ago the Brazilian federation named Zagallo team
supervisor, a sort of coach behind the coach, as Carlos Alberto
Parreira took Brazil to a shootout victory over Italy.
</P>
<P>
   No one in soccer can match Zagallo's run of success.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he was Tuesday night, weeping all alone as if it was
his first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people do not realize how difficult it is to win in
the World Cup,'' Zagallo said. ``That was a very difficult game we
had. We easily could have been the losers. I appreciate every game
we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo's players support him. Dunga, 35, the veteran and
captain whom many believe will succeed Zagallo as head coach in
four years, bristles when asked about the criticism Zagallo has
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``His job is tougher than anyone's,'' Dunga said.
</P>
<P>
   In a game where it takes a lot of ego to be among the best _ and
Brazilian players admit they might lead the world in egos, too _
some have criticized Zagallo's cautious style and selection of
starters.
</P>
<P>
   When he named Bebeto to replace the injured Romario before the
World Cup and Bebeto proceeded to look tired and old in early
games, Denilson, 21, begged for playing time and the nation seemed
to agree.
</P>
<P>
   But Zagallo stayed with his choice and in victories over Denmark
and the Netherlands, Bebeto had his best games. In both games,
Denilson came in late and offered a boost of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo says he will stay with Bebeto for Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot bear the thought of not winning, just like everyone
else in Brazil cannot,'' Zagallo said. ``I have to do the things
that I believe will help us win. If people say we are playing an
ugly game, I'd rather play an ugly game and win than pretty
football and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brazil barrels toward another crown, he stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one game left,'' Zagallo said. ``Our mission is
almost complete. It hasn't been very easy, but now we have no
doubt. We are saving our best game for the last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how it will be when everyone plays their best game. It
will be beautiful. We will win, I have no doubt.''

The Suns fly on the oldest plane in the America West fleet, a 1969
737-100. It's had its share of problems, including an incident last
spring when a pilot walked off the plane with Suns players aboard,
concerned that it wasn't safe to fly. After being reassured that
the plane was flight worthy even though it was missing its yaw
damper, he returned and flew without incident. Checking with
America Westt to see if they've repaired the part, which is subject

RETRO (Phoenix) - For Amy Bowling, there's nothing interesting in
the '90s. Flashback three decades and Bowling is right at home,
basking in the comfort of a Charles Eames lounge chair and ottoman.
In her time-warp world, she wears vintage clothes, decorates her
apartment in '60s modern furniture and frequents the kind of
lounges that never bothered to update the furnishings. Bowling is
part of an ever-growing subculture that collects and craves all
things vintage. These people spend most of their waking hours

60,000 SUBSCRIBERS TO SHARE $8 MILLION IN BC-BS SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts has agreed
to pay $8 million in refunds to about 60,000 &UR;  &LR; subscribers to settle
a lawsuit alleging that it had failed to pass along hospital
discounts to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which awaits approval from federal and state
courts, concludes a lawsuit filed in 1995 by Health Care For All, a
Boston consumer group. Blue Cross, the state's largest health
insurer, denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement reached May 26
but disclosed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit covers consumers who purchased traditional indemnity
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous victory for consumers,'' said Robert
Restuccia of Health Care For All. ``We applaud the management of
Blue Cross for recognizing a problem and working with us to solve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement calls for Blue Cross to pay $8 million to 60,000
subscribers, plus about $1.25 million in lawyers fees, $175,000 to
the Caring for Children Foundation, and $50,000 to Health Care For
All, the lead plaintiff in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case is one of about a dozen similar lawsuits filed against
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country, including
those in New Hampshire, Vermont, Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the lawsuits allege that the health plans deceived
their subscribers, who can wind up paying more than their fair
share of the bill. The practice works this way: A Blue Cross member
undergoes surgery at a hospital. The charge is $10,000. Under a
contract that requires patients to be responsible for 20 percent of
the charge, the subscriber pays $2,000. But insurers frequently get
discounts from hospitals. If the discount is 50 percent, the actual
bill is just $5,000. The subscriber's $2,000 payment then amounts
to 40 percent of the actual bill. Meanwhile the insurer pays
$3,000, or 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Blue Cross of Massachusetts in the past argued that it passed
along the savings to its policyholders in the form of lower
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, a Superior Court judge last week allowed a
lawsuit against Blue Cross to obtain class-action status. The
lawsuit, filed by Thomas Prive of Merrimack, N.H., alleges that
Blue Cross of New Hampshire failed to share hospital discounts with
its policyholders. The insurer has denied those charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts lawsuit alleged that Blue Cross engaged in the
practice between Jan. 1, 1990, to Dec. 31, 1995. Only subscribers
of traditional indemnity policies who paid coinsurance for hospital
care during that period would be eligible for a refund, according
to Stephen Rosenfeld, the lead attorney in the case. Rosenfeld said
he expects subscribers to be notified ``within several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross discontinued the practice on Jan. 1, 1996. At the
time, the insurer said the move was unrelated to the lawsuit filed
by Health Care For All or the furor raised by consumer groups in
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   If judges in Suffolk Superior Court and US District Court in
Boston grant their preliminary approval, the insurer will send out
notices to subscribers eligible for refunds, which would range from
$25 to thousands of dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the settlment is significant for Blue Cross, which
made just $12.7 million in 1997, after a $97 million loss in
1996. &UR;  &LR; Insurance companies, however, typically set aside money in
their budgets to cover lawsuit settlements or adverse legal
judgments.

INDIAN SENSE OF HUMOR DELIGHTFULLY SHOWCASED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BETTY REID  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - The stoic Indian, silent and proud, has long been a
stereotype of American film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' a new movie written and directed by and
starring Native Americans, demonstrates that humor is very much a
part of reservation life.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie is often hilarious, it also deals with serious
issues common in Indian life _ alcoholism and fatherless families
struggling through cultural and economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in Idaho.
Victor (Adam Beach) sets off on a journey to Phoenix to recover the
ashes of his father, who has died years after abandoning his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Victor is accompanied by chatterbox Thomas (Evan Adams), who
lost his own father as a baby. Thomas is kind of a lovable nerd,
who talks endlessly as he tries to work out the meaning of being
Indian in 1990s America.
</P>
<P>
   Some Phoenix area Indians were treated to advance screenings in
April and June.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Curley, who grew up on the Navajo Reservation, was
delighted by the movie's portrayal of the funny side of Indian
life. He especially enjoyed the scene that showed Thomas'
transformation into an Indian Superman at a roadside cafe during
the trip to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In the scene, Thomas, sporting two braids and a pinstripe suit,
walks into the bathroom. But when he comes out, his jet-black hair
is flying in the breeze and he's wearing a Superman T-shirt
emblazoned with ``Frybread Power.'' At first, he glares like a
fierce Indian warrior, the image that he thinks the world expects.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Victor sizes him up, he puts on a silly grin that shows
he's aware of the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas could not hold it in,'' Curley said. ``I think he
grinned because that wasn't him. After that scene, he reverts back
to himself toward the end of the movie because the braids return.''
</P>
<P>
   But even these Indian movie buffs find Indian humor hard to
define. Many struggled to describe it, then simply said, ``You
know, it's what happens on the `rez' or among a group of Indian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Harmon, a Hunkpati Lakota Sioux who lives in Tempe, Ariz.,
with her two sons, said simple rez expressions such as the teasing
``aaayy'' can unleash laughter among the Sioux. On the Navajo Rez,
``chish'' can produce the same result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to understand Indian humor, and ``Smoke Signals''
did a real good job,'' Harmon said. ``Indian humor is like when a
tribal member gets a new hairdo or dresses up. To the mainstream
audience, someone will say, `You look nice.' To Indians, its,
`Aaayy, what a nice haircut' or, `Who are you? Going to a funeral?'
''
</P>
<P>
   To Harmon, Thomas' transformation scene at the cafe is all about
Indian men and their egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian guys are as vain as Indian women because they like the
long-hair look, it gives them that warrior look,'' Harmon said. ``A
non-Indian woman might say, `Look at that manly Indian.' Indian
women will say, `Aaayy, get over yourself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with local Native Americans show that Indian humor
draws heavily on teasing, puns in both English and Indian
languages, efforts to take the sting out of serious events, and
enjoying the foibles of non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' tackles stereotypes about buffaloes, warriors
and the reserved Indian through satire. Images of fry bread,
``Indian cars,'' vast rolling landscapes and extended relatives do
not escape Indian humor.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Knox, a teenage Hopi-Pima and Maricopa, enjoyed references
to that delectable fry bread. In one of Thomas' stories, Victor's
mother is caught in a fry-bread-shortage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There are only so many round fry breads available to feed a
large army of relatives. The solution, as told by Thomas, is to cut
the yummy bread in half so more people are fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a lot of food when there are Hopi ceremonies,'' Knox
said. ``We make enough, but sometimes there is a shortfall. We just
cut it in half.''
</P>
<P>
   The teenager, a resident of Maryvale, Ariz., said her only
disappointment was that the movie lacked urban Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' carried the attitude and fashion of
reservation guys, Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to see Indians in sports clothes, Adidas or
Nikes in the movies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodie Manuel, a Phoenix area resident who is Shuswap from
British Columbia, said the movie captures glimpses of Indian life
that could exist just about anywhere on the reservation. She
particularly loved the way Thomas chattered and launched into
stories about fry bread, relatives and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel said she laughed each time Thomas, portrayed at times as
a pain in the neck to Victor, pronounced ``Victor'' in a sing-song
manner. That meant a story was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Real reservation men sometimes come across as reserved. Thomas
bucks that trend by being a friendly deep thinker and a nerdy kind
of Indian gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Thomas. What could have been a real serious movie, he
lightened it up by chattering and making up stories,'' Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Deenise Becenti, a Navajo journalist based in Window Rock,
Ariz., said the movie offers a glimpse of Indian life rarely
captured on movie screens.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, viewers are treated to a scene of young Indian
women driving an old car in reverse. To a non-Indian person, it
doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian cars come in different shapes and sizes,'' Becenti
said. ``That car only runs in reverse. Whereas the rest of America
would say, `Why would you drive a car like that?' To the Indian, it
runs and it will get them somewhere.'' &QL;

BRUINS FIRE TOP COACHES AT FARM TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Bruins assembled the roster of their top farm
club in Providence, R.I. last season, management believed it had a
talented, competitive contender in the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   However, for reasons no one can quite understand, the Providence
Bruins finished with a last-place 19-54-7 recond. Thursday
Providence owner Ed Anderson and Boston management announced that
head coach Tom McVie and assistant coach Rod Langway were relieved
of their duties. No successors were named, though word out of
Providence was that the positions could be filled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in four years the Bruins have fired
McVie. The first was when he was an assistant under Brian Sutter
and both were let go after the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
   McVie, who has two years remaining on his contract, and Langway,
who has one year left, could be retained in other positions.
Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said he talked to McVie
about a scouting position where he would assess prospects or
perhaps track the progress of players the Bruins were interested
in. Another option would be working with some of the Bruins'
younger players in a developmental role. O'Connell said he would
get back to McVie in the next couple of days but McVie said he's
definitely interested in something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think negative thoughts anymore,'' said McVie, reached
by telephone at his home in Washington. ``I'm a positive thinker.
As a player, I was traded five times and as a coach I have been
fired seven times. The amazing thing wasn't that I was fired seven
times, it was that I kept getting hired.''
</P>
<P>
   McVie, who has a joke for every occasion, said it was difficult
to keep his sense of humor last season as the losing continued to
feed off itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried everything I could,'' he said. ``It wasn't fun. It's
like when Holyfield keeps knocking you down. You want to go sit in
the corner for a while. I think some veteran guys had the I-95
disease. They were (upset) by the time they got to the Foxborough
exit. There were some young players who felt overwhelmed by the
league. What went wrong? A lot of things. I feel bad not being able
to go back there. But I'm not going to shoot myself or anything. I
think I can do a good job developing players. There's not much I
haven't done in 43 years.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he talked to Anderson, who felt a change was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed brought it to our attention two or three weeks ago,'' said
O'Connell. ``I talked to Tom over the weekend and informed him of
the decision we made. We're going to have a lot of the same players
back in Providence next year who were there last year and we felt
(the same coaching staff) probably wouldn't be the best thing. If
you've coached, you understand how difficult it is. It's a
24-hour-a-day job during the season. When you're losing, those 24
hours seem like 36.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has been close friends with McVie for years, said
it was an agonizing decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was the perfect fit for the team we had,'' said
Anderson. ``For the first six weeks, it looked like we all knew
what we were talking about. Then it all disintegrated. There were
17 games when we were either leading or tied going into the third
period and we won one. We made the decision as a result of not
wanting to expose ourselves to the potential for another season
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said things are starting to heat up on the free agent
front with regard to increasing the team's depth but nothing was
imminent ... The Bruins have opened preliminary discussions with
goalie Rob Tallas, a restricted free agent. O'Connell said he is
awaiting a proposal from Tallas's agent, Jay Fee.

SENATE PASSES IRS OVERHAUL ON 96-2 VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., W.Va., Minn., Del.)  (th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate gave final approval Thursday to
legislation overhauling the Internal Revenue Service, voting 96-2
to impose the most sweeping shakeup in decades on the
tax-collection agency's management and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed the House 402-8 late last month, now
goes to President Clinton, who said he would sign it quickly into
law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill gives new rights and protections to the relatively
small numbers of taxpayers who get into serious disputes with the
IRS. Instead of forcing taxpayers to prove their innocence in civil
tax-court cases, as under current law, the new law shifts the
burden of proof in many cases to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The tax agency will face new limits in imposing interest charges
and penalties, and will be restricted in its ability to seize a
home during collection proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's more ambitious if less easily legislated goal is
to reshape the culture of an agency that critics contend is too
focused on striking fear in the hearts of taxpayers and not enough
on helping citizens comply with a tax code of ever-increasing
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   It establishes an outside board with broad authority to oversee
the IRS' management and policies, and strengthens the role of the
taxpayer advocate, an internal ombudsman who can take up complaints
from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It provides the IRS with more flexibility to hire managers from
private industry to help sort out problems like its outdated
computer system. And it calls for the agency to scrap an
organizational structure that divided it into geographical units
and replace it with one based on serving three main constituencies:
individual filers, small businesses and big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contains a tax cut of sorts, a capital gains
provision inserted during House-Senate negotiations last month that
affects those who sell stocks. It reduces to 12 months from 18
months the period that investors must hold stocks or other assets
to qualify for the lowest capital gains tax rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is ``intended to cause the IRS to function more like a
financial services organization and less like a law enforcement
agency _ one that emphasizes customer service and efficiency, in
addition to the prevention of waste, fraud and abuse,'' said Phil
Brand, the director of IRS policies and procedures for KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accounting and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration had opposed the bill in its early
stages last year, the measure built up unstoppable momentum after a
series of hearings in the Senate Finance Committee laid out horror
stories from taxpayers who had been harassed, intimidated or
otherwise mistreated by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate opened debate Wednesday on the bill's final
version, some Democrats objected to the inclusion of the capital
gains tax provision. Democrats were also concerned that Republicans
were bashing the IRS to build a case for abolition of the entire
progressive income tax system and its replacement with a
single-rate flat tax or a national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But with an eye toward the mid-term congressional elections in
November, most members of both parties and administration officials
were eager to support the bill and claim some credit for it. In the
end, the only two no votes on final passage Thursday came from Sen.
Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Sen. Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota, both Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance
Committee, said the legislation ``is not only good for the American
taxpayer, but for the agency as well.'' Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.,
said that the IRS ``will now work for the American taxpayers and
not the other way around.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
Charles Rossotti, the IRS commissioner, said passage of the bill
``represents one more step in our continuing efforts to insure that
each and every taxpayer is treated fairly and that the IRS collects
our nation's revenue efficiently and effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, a former computer-industry executive who took over at
the IRS last year, has won high marks from Republicans in Congress
for working with them to change the way the agency operates.
</P>
<P>
   And former IRS officials said the establishment of an outside
board will create ongoing pressure for the agency's leadership to
root out problems, punish employees who mistreat taxpayers and
become more responsive to public concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But some tax experts said the new taxpayer protections will open
the door to more tax cheating, a growing problem in a system that
relies largely on voluntary compliance.
</P>
<P>
   They said there will always be tension between the desire of
members of Congress to help constituents who have tax problems and
the need of the IRS to enforce a tax code that Congress complicates
with constant tinkering. And it remains unclear how
enthusiastically the IRS' workforce of 102,000 will embrace the new
approach, especially after serving as a political punching bag for
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll definitely see an improvement in the IRS, and we firmly
believe taxpayers will face fewer problems in coming years,'' said
John Berthoud, president of the National Taxpayers Union, a
grassroots organization that is pushing for an overhaul of the
entire tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not going to be possible with the current tax system
to get a non-intrusive IRS,'' he said. ``You're still going to have
people frustrated by complexity. And you're still going to have
people lodging complaints that the IRS is not friendly or is
focused too much on bringing in the money or is not respectful of
their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important changes brought about by the bill is
the creation of a nine-member oversight board, made up of six
private citizens, the Treasury secretary, the IRS commissioner and
a representative of IRS employees.
</P>
<P>
   The board would have no role in setting tax policy, but would
have broad authority to develop the agency's basic strategy and to
review operational and management performance.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that some of the IRS' problems stem from the
complexity of the tax laws passed by Congress, the bill would
require Congress to do a complexity analysis of any proposed
changes to the tax code, and give the IRS an opportunity to assess
the costs of collecting projected new revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes included in the bill are new protections for
divorced or separated people who face tax liabilities run up
unknown to them by their former spouses, and an extension to tax
accountants of the same kind of confidentiality privilege enjoyed
by lawyers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sweeping nature of the changes the bill will impose on
the IRS _ and the potential for internal confusion and upheaval in
the tax agency along the way _ the full payoff in terms of better
service and higher voluntary compliance rates may not come for six
years or so, said Kerrey, who served on a congressional commission
that came up with many of the provisions in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have to count on the benefits occurring beyond your
political life,'' Kerrey said. &QL;

   (UNDATED) - Few movies that deal with Native Americans rise
above Hollywood stereotypes. Perhaps that's because none of them
was made by Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Until ``Smoke Signals.''
</P>
<P>
   This drama about two young Indian men coming to terms with their
past is written by, directed by, produced by and stars Native
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all that focused talent is a movie that's strong
on authenticity and identity, but not as strong on drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' has fine moments, while potential peeks out of
all the cracks in its rough surface.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation, where the
traffic reports run this way: ``Yep, a truck went by, about an hour
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor (Adam Beach) leaves the ``rez'' on a journey to Phoenix
when his father dies, years after leaving his family. Victor
harbors much rage against his father, who was guilty of both abuse
and abandonment, yet loved his son.
</P>
<P>
   Victor is accompanied by the bothersome Thomas (Evan Adams), who
lost his own father as a baby. Thomas is the kind of pest who won't
stop talking and usually says just the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   Along the journey, the two young men struggle to come to terms
with each other and with their memories of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' has several strong points, including touches
of ironic humor, strong feelings for the ties that bind fathers and
sons, and some lively irreverence, including a funny song about
John Wayne's teeth and a discussion of the relationship between
Jesus and fry bread.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``Smoke Signals'' doesn't have a strong story or a
vital sense of being about something important.
</P>
<P>
   Victor and Thomas encounter racial bigotry, but nothing comes
from the confrontation. This may be realistic, but it's not
particularly dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the humorous commentary about Indian problems seems
forced, or perhaps the delivery by the stars is just too stilted.
</P>
<P>
   Their self-awareness of being Native Americans assumes a
self-consciousness that stalls the story. They constantly remind
themselves _ and us _ that they're Indians. Point taken early, now
move on and do something with it.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also suggests that Native American problems with
poverty and alcoholism might all be solved if European descendents
would simply return to London, Rome and Moscow. True enough, and
the Valley's traffic problems would be solved if everyone simply
would move back to LA.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Smoke Signals'' is one of those small films that fits
into the category of: may not be a great one, but it's great that
we got one at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13, ``Smoke Signals'' contains minor profanity and
violence, but no sex or nudity. 3 stars. &QL;

TREASURY PRICES GAIN IN LIGHT TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices made modest gains Thursday, bolstered
by a strong dollar. But trading was light, with many investors
waiting for new economic data before making any significant
committments.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's plan for tax cuts has disappointed currency traders with
its lack of details, and the dollar rose Thursday against the yen
and other leading currencies. Also helping the dollar has been
concerns that China may devalue its currency. A strong dollar makes
dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities an
attractive investment to foreign investors because of the potential
gains from currency translation.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, to 107 15/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, fell to 5.60 percent, from 5.62 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices were held down by competing debt from new
corporate and agency issues. Fannie Mae priced for sale $2 billion
of 10-year notes yielding 37.5 basis points more than a Treasury
security with a similar maturity. (A basis point is one-hundredth
of a percentage point.)
</P>
<P>
   With rates now at historic lows, companies and municipalities
are taking advantage to raise cash or refinance existing debt to
reduce debt service payments. The added supply of debt to the
market can often pressure yields to move higher until the glut is
absorbed by investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the municipal market, the state of New York priced $563.2
million of general obligation refunding bonds Thursday through
underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. The bonds were initially
priced to yield a maximum 5.23 percent for bonds maturing in 2021,
with shorter maturities priced to yield from 4 percent in 2000 to
5.20 percent in 2018.
</P>
<P>
   While trading was considered quiet, the talk was that Friday's
report on June producer prices might break the market's inertia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow's PPI release is projected to show that goods
inflation remained quite benign in June, aided in a large measure
by depressed energy prices and the turmoil in Asia,'' said Donald
Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, referring to
the Producer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Fine expects next week's consumer price report to be subdued and
nonthreatening. And that the General Motors strike may be clouding
near-term consumption patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things considered, economic statistics seem to be
suggesting that the economy slowed substantially during the second
quarter,'' he said. ``And while sustainability of this slackening
is still uncertain, there is little hint of any sharp rebound in
the third quarter.''

TRASH TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
  By CULLEN MURPHY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, the rulers of two of the world's most populous
countries were compelled to relinquish their hold on power:
Indonesia's Suharto left office amid mounting violence, and
Nigeria's Gen. Sani Abacha fell afoul of a fatal heart attack--one
key element, apparently, in his nation's constitutional system of
checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
   Both Suharto and Abacha, of course, were despicable tyrants,
with records of venality and bloody oppression. Their
successors--B.J. Habibie in Indonesia and Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
in Nigeria--did not quite concede as much in the first public
statements they made, but they did use language that seemed to
indicate an awareness of the value of human rights and democratic
procedures. Habibie committed himself to running ``a clean
government, free from corruption, collusion, and nepotism.''
Abubakar declared himself ``fully committed'' to a
``social-political transition program'' leading to an elected
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, observers quoted on BBC radio described the two new
leaders as ``making all the right noises.''
</P>
<P>
   Making all the right noises: The phrase has proliferated over a
period of little more than two decades--perhaps in part because it
itself makes all the right noises. It signals that the noisemaker
under discussion may be no more than a golden-tongued hypocrite,
even as it suggests that a reporter, having seen it all, could not
possibly be taken in by the noisemaker's blandishments. It also
leaves open the unlikely possibility that the actions will indeed
live up to the noises.
</P>
<P>
   Making all the right noises, carrying the connotation just
described, seems to have surfaced mainly in British publications in
the late 1970s and early 1980s. It surely evolved from earlier use
in more literal, straightforward contexts (for instance, to
describe the sound of an automobile engine or a musical
performance) and ultimately from the long-established and
nonjudgmental phrase to make noises (that is, to express oneself
about something), a construction that happily accommodates all
manner of adjectival prefixes.
</P>
<P>
   All the right noises, with its stance of jaded cynicism, quickly
spread from British organs (the Economist, the Guardian, the
Financial Times) into most parts of the far-flung Anglophone
circulatory system. Today it is applied in a wide range of
circumstances, especially when the noises being talked of invite a
presumption of hollowness, sanctimony, or hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is New York's Newsday earlier this year, analyzing the
economic situation in South Korea: ``Kim Jong Pil, in line to
become Kim Dae Jung's prime minister, may make all the right noises
about economic reform, but his own ties to the chaebol (industrial
conglomerates) may be too tight to break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London, writing about the British prime minister:
``Tony Blair must do something. And a making-all-the-right-noises
kind of Valentine message is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald, assigning blame for the failure of campaign
finance reform: ``In his presidency so far, Clinton has made all
the right noises, but has done nothing while playing the same old
games to raise vast sums.''
</P>
<P>
   Given some of the tendencies of Scripture translation in recent
decades, it would hardly be surprising to see Matthew 26:33-35--the
passage in which Peter promises to remain a loyal disciple scant
hours before turning disloyal--rewritten and embellished to render
the response from Jesus as follows: ``Truly you make all the right
noises. But this night you will deny me three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Aong the reasons why an expression such as making all the right
noises achieves wide usage quickly is this simple one: The
phenomenon of empty talk is so prevalent that new ways of
describing it--especially ones that possess a modest elegance and
formality--are always welcome. As it happens, many wonderful terms
for empty or hypocritical talk are by now quaint and archaic
(humbuggery, Pharisaism, Tartuffery), and some of the most common
terms are simply vulgar (bull****).
</P>
<P>
   Lip service, as in the phrase to pay lip service--from the act
of raising one's voice publicly in prayer or song while inwardly
harboring contrary convictions--is probably the most widespread and
durable formulation. (Thus, the New York Democrats currently vying
for the nomination to run for the Senate this fall recently accused
the Republican incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato, of ``paying lip service
to gay issues.'') Similarly, lip salve is insincere flattery,
though it may be enjoyed by the recipient nonetheless as a form of
ear candy.
</P>
<P>
   Lip, with its satisfying mouthfeel (to use the jargon of the
food-service industry) and its still-obvious link to an elemental
root (the Indo-European leb, with the connotation ``hanging
loosely''), has formed numerous slang combinations whose meanings
touch all the compass points of verbal intention. To shoot from the
lip is to speak rashly. To zip your lip is to shut up. To invite
someone to read your lips is to emphasize your sincerity. To
lip-sync is to move one's lips in synchronization with a
prerecorded sound--and, metaphorically, to mouth someone else's
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Like paying lip service, making all the right noises possesses
just enough color to be memorable and yet not so much color as to
cloy. It may be in for a long run. In contrast, one has to wonder
about the longevity of its main rival in the linguistic marketplace
right now: talking the talk, but not walking the walk--a vivid
expression from black English that seems lately to have become a
mandatory part of the repertoire of white politicians, corporate
executives, consultants, motivational speakers, newscasters and
sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   A person who talks the talk and walks the walk is one who acts
naturally and stylishly, whose words and behavior are of a piece; a
person who talks the talk without walking the walk, therefore, is
one who is dissembling, ineffectual, or insincere. The
incorporation of walk the walk and talk the talk into white-bread
English, often by people whose jus' folks colloquialism is a pose,
may not bode well. One need only remember how the appropriation of
the verbs dig, rap, and groove by grown-ups during the late 1960s
and early 1970s proved to be a kiss of death.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the expression has found favor was brought
home a few weeks ago when Archbishop Harry Flynn of St. Paul and
Minneapolis traveled to Rome to ordain a Minnesota-bound candidate
for the priesthood. There, in a chapel at the North American
College on the slopes of the Janiculum Hill, during a service
otherwise conducted entirely in Latin, Flynn delivered a sermon
that included this injunction to the young man: ``When you teach,
be sure you receive the word into your heart before the word forms
on your lips. Walk the walk and talk the talk. Don't preach one
thing and turn around and do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   One can assume that the new priest, in response, made all the
right noises.

ANYONE CAN WHISTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this point, saying that U.S. investors are whistling past the
graveyard does seem a little bit like saying ``This television
thing is just a gimmick. It'll never take off,'' but what can I
say? U.S. investors are whistling past the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly irresistible flow of money into mutual funds, the
exaltation of large-cap stocks into supposedly risk-free
investments, and the now almost laughable discounting of present
troubles in favor of a brighter future that's purportedly just
around the corner have combined to create a growth in stock prices
that is out of all proportion to the growth in actual earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the bull market have been, of course,
well-rehearsed by this point. Low inflation, low interest rates
(though hardly historically low), globalization, the spread of
information technology and so on. In general terms, at least, the
case for continued bullishness is not dissimilar from the case for
the so-called New Economy. Just as we've enjoyed steady economic
growth and low inflation with low unemployment for a surprisingly
long time now, so too we're supposed to continue to enjoy an
ever-rising spiral of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The case for a real New Economy should, of course, be regarded
with serious skepticism, but there are clearly things--global
domination by capitalism, remarkable dedication to low inflation on
the part of central bankers, capital's increasingly disciplinary
role (at least everywhere but in the U.S.)--that do make a real
difference in the business climate. And it would be plausible that
companies should deserve higher multiples than they've received in
the past if their prospects for perpetual growth were so good that
buying stocks was like buying a U.S. bond.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with this scenario is, unfortunately, rather
glaring: U.S. corporations are not turning that blissful business
climate into profits.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings growth for the S&AMP;P in the first quarter was somewhere
between 0 percent and 4 percent (depending on how you account for
write-offs, one-time sales, etc.), and earnings growth for this
quarter is now estimated to be somewhere around 2.5 percent.
Needless to say, the S&AMP;P is up considerably more than 6 percent
this year, even as the Nasdaq--which is laden with companies that
have been hard-hit by the crisis in Asia--has now hit an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls argue that investors are now looking ahead, and seeing
stronger earnings growth in the next few quarters. But surely that
means that investors five or six months ago were dramatically
overpricing stocks, since they weren't anticipating stagnant
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, the Street is proving remarkably
tolerant of floundering companies. Take Nike, which last week
reported its first quarterly loss in 10 years, and which even with
a major restructuring charge earned just four cents a share, down
from 52 cents a year ago. Nike also said that a turnaround in its
business was still a year away, and that conditions in Asia had not
improved at all.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Three brokerage houses raised their
recommendations on Nike to ``strong buy,'' and the stock jumped 3
1/2 points. One analyst actually cut her estimates on how much Nike
would earn in the coming year and still boosted the stock to a
``strong buy,'' saying she expected something called ``an
uptrend.'' Now that's wonderful whistling.

 TINA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD  
 By JONATHAN MAHLER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The queen is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Come Aug. 1, New Yorker editor Tina Brown will depart and make
room for the magazine's fifth--but not yet announced--editor. The
bomb was dropped at a hastily convened meeting at 10:30 Wednesday
morning. Indeed, many of the magazine's staffers were still sipping
their first cup of coffee when word went out that Tina wanted to
address ``the staff.'' And so they gathered in what is known as
``the piazza,'' an open space adjacent to the corridor where the
magazine's senior editors sit.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a simple blue suit, her hair streaked with just the
right amount of blond, Tina walked into the piazza and started
speaking while stragglers were still making their way up the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   This was, she said, a very difficult thing to do, but she had
been presented with an opportunity that she simply couldn't refuse.
After uttering the usual platitudes about how The New Yorker is the
best magazine in the business, Tina became farklempt as she
pronounced, ``I love you all.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, came the hugs--along with tears from the
members of Tina's inner-circle who are surely wondering what all of
this means for them.
</P>
<P>
   And what does it mean for Tina's devotees? Slate can only
speculate. Tina is certainly responsible for bringing in most of
the magazine's hottest writers, and here we're referring to people
like the unrivaled David Remnick and Malcolm Gladwell, both of whom
cut their teeth at the Washington Post. Some will probably follow
Tina to her next stop, a new media venture formed by Miramax that
will publish a monthly magazine and books, as well as produce films
and television shows. (She will be the chairwoman and a part owner
of the new company.)
</P>
<P>
   But what will become of The New Yorker? During Tina's tenure,
the magazine's editors were always talking about ``the mix''--the
never-ending struggle to strike the right balance between the
slashy and the serious. The charge that Tina was too fond of the
former is by now a cliche. It is also probably the last thing on
the mind of billionaire Si Newhouse, who suddenly seems concerned
with turning a profit at the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame him? After all, as Fortune put it recently,
the president and CEO of Conde Nast, Steven Florio, ``turned a
mildly profitable property into one of the greatest money pits in
American magazine history.'' Under the Florio brothers, Steve and
Tom, The New Yorker has lost a whopping $175 million. It's no
surprise, then, that Newhouse has decided to merge the magazine
into his Conde Nast empire. Next year, the The New Yorker's
sinecured staffers will move into Conde
</P>
<P>
   Nast's new headquarters and will fight for phone lines and desk
space with the rest of Si's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   As for who will preside over this dark day in New Yorker
history, we can only report what we have gleaned from the rumor
mill over on 43rd Street. The most obvious candidate seems to be
Graydon Carter, the celebrity (if not celebrated) editor of Vanity
Fair who has perfected the formula for the profile that
simultaneously glamorizes and eviscerates its subject.
</P>
<P>
   It seems less likely that Newhouse will go with an inside The
New Yorker candidate, though if he does, the best choice might be
James Stewart, a respected newspaperman who did a tour as Page One
editor of the Wall Street Journal in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Dark horses inside the magazine include Remnick and Kurt
Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   To this mix, Culturebox would like to add a candidate of its
own: Chip McGrath, the editor of the New York Times Book Review. A
former staff member at The New Yorker, McGrath was passed over when
Robert Gottlieb acceded to power, but over the past few years he
has done a bang-up job at the Book Review, giving it all of the
heft of the New York Review of Books with none of the intellectual
snobbery. All the while, he has been writing nifty pop culture
pieces for the New York Times Magazine, so he seems to have that
ingredient of ``the mix'' covered as well.
</P>
<P>
   Place your bets.

A NEW BIMMER FOR THE SUMMER

<P>
   A lot of convertibles shake, rattle and roll. They leak and
squeak, and, without the integral bracing of solid tops, they flex
like sponges when you wring them out on bouncy roads. Outside the
Sun Belt, they require six to 10 months of compromise for two to
six months of wind-blown freedom.
</P>
<P>
   This accepted wisdom is fast becoming out of date. The Chrysler
Sebring, for instance, is solid and comfortable for year-round
service. The Volvo C70 has a durable top that looks as if it would
hold up to winters in Lapland. And both cars, by convertible
standards, have generous back seats.
</P>
<P>
   But few cars shatter ragtop myths quite as thoroughly as the
3-Series BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The rigid structure that makes solid-top Bimmers so riveting
serves the convertibles well, too. The soft-top 323 is stable and
responsive, comparing favorably with the coupe. It does weigh 200
pounds more, and it feels even heavier. It moves a little slower
and skips a bit on rippled pavement. But the body stubbornly
refuses to shudder.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was free of squeaks and rattles, and the slight
rear wind noise was unobjectionable. Because I drove it during a
weekend of continuous rain, the roof never came down. While that
made it impossible to experience the 323's summertime pleasures, it
was easy to judge the car as it is more often used, as a top-up,
year-round transportation device.
</P>
<P>
   In hours of high-speed late-night Interstate driving, through
wind-driven rain and thundering tractor-trailer traffic, the car
felt completely stable, safe and in control. While the ride was
firm and a little bouncy, it was not unpleasant. The seats were
comfortable and the driver-oriented controls, functional and
minimal, felt just right.
</P>
<P>
   While the 323 coupe is a nice addition, with the smaller, less
expensive six-cylinder engine, the convertible is a masterstroke.
Previously, someone shopping for a four-seat BMW soft-top had to
choose between the anemic four-cylinder 318i, which has been
discontinued, or the lovely but expensive 328i. At $35,270, the 323
isn't cheap, but it is within reach of more people than its $42,070
sibling, and it performs nearly as well.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people have already calculated that the 323 is a good
deal, and supplies of the convertible are tight. After visiting
several dealerships, a friend, who had hoped to present a
convertible as a birthday gift to his mother, despaired of finding
a car equipped as he wanted. Mom ended up with a more practical
328i sedan instead.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ When President George Bush dropped in on Steeltech
Manufacturing Inc. here in 1992, he told reporters following him on
the campaign trail that the newly minted, minority-owned
metal-processing company was proof that ``the American dream can
still come true.''
</P>
<P>
   There is impressive evidence today that his faith was justified.
Steeltech has moved into a cavernous new manufacturing plant in one
of this city's poorest, toughest neighborhoods. Customers praise
the quality of its welding and its painting equipment, which can
electrically coat larger pieces of steel than any other independent
plant in the country. Steeltech has grown to more than 200
employees, many of whom are thrilled to have left behind dead-end
minimum-wage jobs or the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has given people around here hope,'' said Kim Jordan, 42,
a single mother of three who has done everything from welding to
helping out in research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the privately held Steeltech is no dream come true
for its investors or for customers who had to provide cash and
other concessions to keep it afloat. Even though it has finally
begun to generate some operating profits, Steeltech has not made
payments on more than $30 million in federal, state, local and
private loans since 1996. Milwaukee taxpayers are shelling out
$50,000 a month to bondholders to forestall foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Still worse, two contracts that have accounted for more than 80
percent of Steeltech's revenue are about to end. Rumors of imminent
bankruptcy were swirling until the company recently won a contract
to work on the steel roof of Miller Park, the Milwaukee Brewers'
new baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been constant firefighting,'' said Charles Wallace, 52,
the company's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson? So far, Steeltech is stark proof that the goal of
returning skilled, industrial jobs to blighted inner cities remains
a daunting one, even when the economy is booming and many companies
are frantically scavenging the nation for skilled _ or simply
trainable _ labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could never sustain an economy on this basis,'' conceded
James Scherer, the administrator following Steeltech's struggles
for Milwaukee's Economic Development Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The city is not giving up, though. The shuttering of urban
factories over the last two or three decades has been cited by
sociologists like William Julius Wilson as the single largest
factor in worsening the poverty, crime and drug use that grip many
inner-city neighborhoods and strangle once-thriving retail
districts. While no one expects these jobs to return on a broad
scale, smaller manufacturing companies like Steeltech are seen as
important adjuncts to rebuilding a more service-oriented urban
economy that can profit from a central location and the labor
available in inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steeltech's wages are at the low end of the industrial
scale here, they still offer a better prospect of upward mobility
than most entry-level service jobs, such as those at the Walgreen's
drugstore that recently opened across the street where clerks start
at $6 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about Steeltech's value might be clearer if it were
simple to measure its costs and benefits, but that can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good for Milwaukee and it's met its social goals,''
maintained Paul Hollowell, executive vice president of Oshkosh
Truck Corp., which ended up as both Steeltech's major customer and
a source of working cash. Did Oshkosh benefit? ``It's like W.C.
Fields said about being tarred and feathered,'' Hollowell said,
pointing out that Oshkosh wrote off $3.2 million in loans extended
to Steeltech. ``But for the honor, we'd probably rather not have
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dempsey, director of the Campaign for a Sustainable
Milwaukee, a coalition of community and labor groups, argues that
Oshkosh clearly benefited because Steeltech helped it maintain its
standing as a leading truck supplier to the military. Other
Milwaukee businesses made money selling Steeltech goods and
services. ``The jury is still out,'' he said, ``on whether the
Steeltech jobs justify the heavy public investment to create
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steeltech's story has unfolded in a era when the number of
minority-owned businesses nationwide has been growing. The most
recent U.S. census figures showed a 60 percent increase in such
businesses, to 2.15 million, from 1987 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And Harriet Michel, executive director of the National Minority
Supplier Development Council, a New York City-based nonprofit group
dedicated to linking major corporations and government purchasing
groups with minority-owned companies, says the growth is
continuing. ``But most of them are professional service
companies,'' she said, ``because the start-up costs are cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to setting up new businesses in the poorest urban
areas, most of the action is in the commercial and service sectors,
said Elisabeth Reynolds, vice president of the Initiative for a
Competitive Inner City, a Boston-based group working to identify
urban business opportunities. Where manufacturing does succeed, it
tends to be small and closely integrated with existing activities.
Auto company suppliers in Detroit and garment makers in New York
are frequently cited examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``To create a business out of thin air,'' she said, ``is more
risky than building on something that's there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Steeltech's singular journey began with a broad public-private
partnership and a torrent of publicity. The prime mover was Super
Steel Products Corp. chairman Fred Luber, who saw a chance to help
Oshkosh, one of his major customers, fulfill the Pentagon
requirement to set aside a certain amount of business for minority
subcontractors to qualify for a $1.4 billion contract to build
cargo transport vehicles for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Steeltech's job, Luber figured, would be to paint and assemble a
newly designed cargo platform to go with the trucks, known as the
flat-rack. Although the first order was for just 8,000 flatracks,
the Army was expected to need 100,000 eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The well-connected Luber won the backing of figures like the
popular Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist,and cajoled numerous public
and private groups into going along because of the project's
potential social benefits. He and his lawyer were able to recruit
black and Hispanic investors to hold a majority of Steeltech's
stock by arranging for the company to lend them the money to
acquire their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But Steeltech was nearly strangled at birth by its Pentagon
contract, which was based on a wildly optimistic guess about the
company's overhead. The profit outlook did not begin to improve
until 1995, when Steeltech landed a second flatrack contract and a
contract to paint Dodge Ram truck frames for the nearby auto
components subsidiary of A.O. Smith Corp. (Smith sold the business
last year to Tower Automotive Inc., based in Minneapolis).
</P>
<P>
   Each step forward has been clouded with developments that have
made the company a local business soap opera. Relations with Luber
became strained over how costs and equipment were allocated during
the first two years that Steeltech operated out of the Super Steel
factory. Management turnover _ Wallace is the fourth chief
executive _ and labor tensions became routine. The labor unrest
gave the United Electrical Workers the opening it needed to
organize the plant after a contentious struggle that hurt
Steeltech's local reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Steeltech also lost money in ill-fated efforts to diversify into
making jail cells and modules for fast-food restaurants. Part of
the problem was that the Oshkosh and Tower contracts occupied too
much of its capacity for it to pursue other businesses that might
have been more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Steeltech has also paid a price for pursuing its social mission.
</P>
<P>
   Its founders envisioned stories like that of Shafi Roemel
Brooks, who was 40 when he was hired and trained as a painter in
1995, a month after returning home to Milwaukee from five years in
a federal prison in Texas on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold drugs from the time I was 14, and if it hadn't been for
Steeltech I would probably have gone back to the streets,'' said
Brooks, who earns $11 an hour and is now married. He says Steeltech
made it possible for him to acquire both his first home and a 1997
Chevy Blazer.
</P>
<P>
   Often, though, the results have been disappointing. Absenteeism
rates were astronomical in the early years, as workers unused to
the discipline of factory life were given multiple chances to shape
up. Background checks were perfunctory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were attracted thinking they'd get cut slack
because it was minority-owned,'' Ms. Jordan said. Union officials
cite one case in which the company allowed an employee who was late
17 times during the 30-day probationary period to become a
full-time employee.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has tightened standards for reviewing the 2,000 job
applicants coming through Steeltech's doors annually. But he still
faces high turnover. Many workers tire of the factory's rigors, and
others leverage their training into higher-paying jobs at Tower and
other local employers. Two-thirds of the hourly work force has been
at Steeltech less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, skilled workers have been leaving out of fear about
Steeltech's prospects. Steeltech lost the flatrack contract to a
San Diego-based subsidiary of Korea's Hyundai, which will build its
version of the cargo carrier with Mexican labor in Tijuana, and to
Summa Technology Inc. of Huntsville, Ala., which is owned by E.C.
Lee, an Asian-American. Summa, which won the part of the contract
set aside for minority-owned businesses, plans to make its units
with just 85 workers in a new automated factory in Coleman, Ala.
Steeltech will make the last of its 16,000 flatracks in the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, Tower is installing its own
high-technology paint line. It has given Steeltech notice that it
will quit sending Dodge truck frames by early next year. Tower said
Chrysler Corp. had required it to install the new paint line to be
eligible to make frames for the new Dodge Ram scheduled for 2002.
Tower figures that making the inevitable switch now could save $1.5
million that is currently eaten up trucking frames to Steeltech and
repairing the nicks and dents that come with such transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're protecting 700 jobs at our plant,'' said James Lozelle,
who oversees Tower's Milwaukee operations.
</P>
<P>
   Steeltech got a crucial lift, though, when it won a $2 million
subcontract from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America to build the
roof of the new baseball park. Now, Wallace said, Steeltech has
more than a year's breathing room and a good shot at further work
on other contracts with Mitsubishi. Several other irons are in the
fire as well, including a potential deal with Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of more new contracts could seal the one thing
Steeltech really needs: some kind of agreement from its many
creditors to refinance or forgive more than $30 million in debt.
Wallace, who owns the biggest chunk of the 60 percent stake held by
minority investors, hopes to complete a package that forgives $3
million in debt and refinances the rest.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot come too soon for Hubert Nelson, his head of
marketing. ``This can be a profitable $100 million company in five
years, but the thing that comes up over and over again with
potential clients is, `Your financial condition scares me,''' said
Nelson, whose marketing resume ranges from Exxon to Miller Brewing.
``It's a tough nut to crack.''

MADELINE' A NOSTALGIC DELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Ludwig Bemelmans, the eccentric writer and artist
who created Madeline, has delighted families for generations with
his sing-song stories and charming drawings of the 12 little girls
of Paris who live in two straight lines and their Dear Miss Clavel,
who cherishes and protects them.
</P>
<P>
   How can you turn such a delicate treasure into a movie? With
delicate attention to detail and whimsy, it turns out, in
``Madeline,'' a family treat for young children and nostalgic
parents.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite obvious that director Daisy von Scherler Mayer and
her writing crew loved Bemelmans' books as much as parents who have
read them over and over again to their children through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer (``Party Girl``) captures the whimsical look and mood of
Bemelmans' Paris of the 1930s and even develops many of the books'
wispy story lines:
</P>
<P>
   - The finely tuned ability of Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand) to
tell when something is not right with her girls.
</P>
<P>
   - The spunky, mischievous and forthright attitude of Madeline
(Hatty Jones), the smallest of the girls at the boarding school,
who, as an orphan and a ward of the church, depends on the
redoubtable Miss Clavel while pushing her to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   The movie develops three plots:
</P>
<P>
   - Madeline's various emergencies, including a trip to the
hospital, then her rescue by a brave dog.
</P>
<P>
   - The efforts by the girls to save their school from closure by
the stuffy Lord Covington (or Lord Cucuface, as the girls dub him),
who has a distinct distaste for brats.
</P>
<P>
   - Madeline's running battles with the boy next door, who
torments the girls and ultimately must depend on them for rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie will reward and please children and parents
who love the books, it may not win many new converts. The humor is
muted and subtle, in competition with the '90s approach toward
crude slapstick as evidenced by most of children's TV, in which
bathroom humor predominates.
</P>
<P>
   It's to the director's credit that she maintains the books'
lighter touch toward humor. However, she comes up short trying to
infuse the movie with energy.
</P>
<P>
   Bemelmans' breezy, brief approach worked so well in the books,
when parents could turn the pages any time their children started
to drift during readings. The movie's pages turn more slowly, and
kids may get restless
</P>
<P>
   Still, the books remain the books, and the movie is a noble
effort to offer families entertainment that does not rely on the
incessant dog-butt humor of the standard-issue ``Dr. Dolittles'' of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   McDormand (``Fargo'') makes an endearing Miss Clavel; kids will
wish they had her for a teacher. Newcomer Jones assumes the
Madeline persona without any fuss, and the other girls are neatly
cast to take us back to a more pleasant time.
</P>
<P>
   On a note of personal synchronicity, I had just finished reading
one of Bemelmans' adult books, ``The Hotel Splendide,'' and
recommend it highly to anyone who can find it.
</P>
<P>
   For parents of children under age 10, I'd recommend ``Mulan''
first, then ``Madeline,'' then ``Dr. Dolittle,'' if the kids insist
on seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG, ``Madeline'' contains a couple of references to
personal hygiene that the strictest of parents might find
objectionable. 3 stars. &QL;

   HADERA, Israel _ Last year, at the age of 62, Zypora Frank
learned a terrible truth: Her family had owned part of the land on
which the Auschwitz death camp stood, and where most of her
mother's family perished. In fact, she held the deed to that land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horror _ to suddenly be connected to this place!''
she exclaimed. ``My blood pressure soared, I got a bloody nose, I
thought I was going to die.'' Her grandfather, whose tile factory
once stood there, was among those who lost his life there.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery concluded a quest to learn exactly what the
properties were that her parents told her about only 10 years
earlier, and also to try to understand why her mother was so
withdrawn through all the decades after World War II, why the whole
subject of the Holocaust was taboo in her parents' home until their
deaths six years ago, three months apart.
</P>
<P>
   They broke their silence only in 1987, when Mrs. Frank, a
schoolteacher, was invited to join a special 10-day tour of
Holocaust sites. Her parents tried everything to keep her from
going, and finally showed her the deeds to properties in Brzezinka,
a town adjacent to Auschwitz that the Germans called Birkenau, and
where they set up a large camp that came to be known as ``Auschwitz
II.'' There, her maternal grandfather, Joseph Melzer, had owned a
large tile works, with large ovens and railroad tracks leading in.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery horrified Mrs. Frank, but it did not dissuade her
from going. However terrible Birkenau was, the name did not have
the symbolic connotation of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   On her return, her parents returned to their silence. ``It was
as if my parents decided to wipe out all memories,'' Mrs. Frank
said. ``They wanted us to believe we were the same as children all
around, that we had a normal childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Frank remembered enough to know otherwise. Her lifelong
fears of railroad cars, of police, of anyone in uniform; her need
to always hold a valid ticket out of wherever she was, even the
Israel she loved; the doll collection she began as an adult instead
of the dolls she never had as a girl _ all this, she knew,
testified to a childhood of horrors.
</P>
<P>
   When the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, she said, her father,
Shmuel Jacoby, was in the Polish army, and her mother, Rivka,
decided to flee. She took her children _ Zypora and her younger
brother Shaul, who now lives in Jericho, Long Island _ and fled to
Lvov, in the Soviet Union. The father soon deserted from the army
and somehow rejoined his family.
</P>
<P>
   From Lvov they were shipped to Siberia in a cattle car, from
Siberia to Tajikistan, and from there, in 1946, they headed back to
Poland _ again in a cattle car.
</P>
<P>
   The horrors were not over. At the border, they ran into a mob of
rioting Poles. ``It was May 23, 1946, I remember because it was my
birthday, and I was wearing a nice dress,'' Mrs. Frank recalled.
``They threw stones, they were yelling, `You take our coal and give
us the Jews,' and somebody threw a grenade.'' Two people were
killed, one right next to the 11-year-old girl, spattering her
birthday dress with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Another pogrom followed in July, and Mrs. Frank's parents made a
fateful decision, to try to send their children to Palestine as
orphans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided that the Poles will finish what the Germans
started,'' Mrs. Frank said. ``My mother turned us over to a woman.
`This is your mother now,' she said. We cried.''
</P>
<P>
   For a year, the children stayed in an Orthodox orphanage in
Strasbourg, until another miracle brought their parents out and
reunited the family, and eventually brought them to Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   But during that year they were apart, Mrs. Frank said, her
mother changed _ she returned reserved, quiet, formal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always protected her, as if she was very fragile,''
Mrs. Frank said. In her last years, as her mother succumbed to
Alzheimer's disease, Mrs. Frank said, the woman returned to some
long-suppressed hell, constantly asking, in Polish, for forgiveness
of a long-dead sister.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mrs. Frank's husband died of cancer. His partner, an
Englishman, then persuaded Mrs. Frank to tell her story. She
agreed: ``I think people are forgetting,'' she said. ``All the time
we're talking numbers _ six million killed, one and a half million
children killed _ the mind can't grasp this. So I thought if I tell
the media my personal story, maybe I can influence others to
understand. So we made contact with a British television company.''
</P>
<P>
   With a television crew, Mrs. Frank returned again to Poland last
year. In the archives of Birkenau, a lawyer tried to find documents
to confirm what Mrs. Frank's parents had told her in 1987. But to
her initial relief, there was nothing to show that a Joseph Melzer
had owned any property there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very ambivalent feelings _ on one hand, it was a great
relief, to know that we were not connected to this place,'' Mrs.
Frank said. ``On the other hand, it was as if my mother had wasted
half her life feeling guilty for owning this land, for being
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next day, Nov. 24, 1997, the crew and Mrs. Frank went to
visit Auschwitz. And there, in the records of the village that the
Poles called Oswiecim, she found her grandfather's property _ now
hers and her brother's. Fifteen square miles of what became the
Auschwitz death camp had been his tile factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horror! Suddenly to be connected to `Auschwitz,' to the
word that is connected with the most horrific thing ever built! I
can't even myself understand what I felt,'' Mrs. Frank said.
``Suddenly it was there, it was written: `Auschwitz.' I was crying.
It was as if God had made a bad joke, about Jewish people owning
this place.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``I realized that the Germans had built the munitions
plant on the site of my grandfather's factory, and when I started
reading I learned that 2,000 women and children had worked there,
that some of the munitions were tested on them.''
</P>
<P>
   That connection, Mrs. Frank came to believe, was the revelation
that drove her mother to silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when she went home to Brzezinka she saw the Auschwitz
camp. It was not like it is now, a museum, it was still horrible,
and I think now that she realized that it stood on her father's
factory,'' Mrs. Frank said. ``She realized that her father and all
her family were killed on their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelation also changed something in Mrs. Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that moment something snapped in me,'' she said. ``All my
life I said I wanted to know the truth, that the truth would make
me whole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not true,'' she went on. ``It's not true. I'm in
parts. I can't talk about it without feeling so emotional. It's not
guilt. But there's a connection there, something I can't help,
can't understand. I'm fighting against it, but I feel so fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand I feel I have to talk about it. I see so
many children who visit Auschwitz.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I hope this will help the world understand. The
Holocaust is still going on _ look at Kosovo, Algeria, Nigeria. I
can't keep silent.''

DIVER'S BODY RECOVERED FROM ANDREA DORIA 
</HEADLINE>

   A veteran diver was found dead Thursday, floating face down 200
feet below the surface in the first-class bar lounge of the rotting
Andrea Doria, a luxury liner that continues to lure people to death
42 years after she sank off the coast of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Roost, 46, of Ann Arbor, Mich., a sheriff's department
diver who has been searching the depths of the ocean for more than
20 years, is the latest victim to die searching the 697-foot
Italian luxury liner.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, Craig Sicola of New Jersey died shortly after
resurfacing from a dive. The cause of death: too much nitrogen in
his system. In July 1993, Robert Santulli of Long Island died
searching the wreckage. In July, 1992, a Florida diver, Mathew
Jared Lawrence, died inside the Andrea Doria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This incident is another tragic example of the dangers
associated with recreational deep water diving,'' said Rear Admiral
Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Roost had chartered The Seeker, a commerical diving boat out of
Montauk, Long Island. From the boat, Roost dove into the shimmering
waters just before noon Wednesday _ a challenging dive Roost wanted
to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   At about 200 feet the water is darker than night. When Roost
failed to return to decompress from being under heavy water
pressure, about two hours later, the crew of the Seeker became
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only stay in the water, at that depth, about 20
minutes,'' said Lt. Junior Grade Craig Jaramillo, assistant
operations officer of the Coast Guard Group at Woods Hole. Swimming
to the surface of the water would take Andrea Doria explorers about
an hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard searched the area with Jayhawk helicopters
Wednesday night and Thursday morning, hoping he was alive, floating
on the choppy waters. When they didn't find him, it became clear
that Roost had died.
</P>
<P>
   Seeker diving crews found Roost on their seventh dive search at
about 1:30 p.m. Thursday, and headed to Montauk, to bring his body
to a Long Island medical examiner for an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo said the cause of death is unclear. Roost had not
gotten tangled or trapped inside the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Roost had wanted for some time to conquer the shipwreck, said
Mike Graczyk, general manager of the Divers Inc. store in Novi,
Mich. Roost had owned that store and another, Divers Inc. in Ann
Arbor, for the last 16 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of his goal dives. That's the dive that he wanted
to do,'' Graczyk said in a telephone interview.

CONFIDENT OF VICTORY, BRAZIL COACH ALSO ADMITS NERVOUSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SOC-WORLDCUP-VECSEY, SOC-WORLDCUP-FRANCE) 
(JT)

<P>
   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France _ Never has he been more confident of
victory, Mario Zagallo, the much-criticized Brazil coach, said
Thursday as Sunday's World Cup final against France approached. And
never has he been more nervous. The dependability of Ronaldo's
scoring and Taffarel's goalkeeping have not been enough to calm
him, he said. So he has resorted to tranquilizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the most emotional moments ever since the Denmark
game,'' Zagallo said, referring to the tense 3-2 victory last
Friday in the quarterfinals. ``But I've never been so sure I'm
going to win a title, given the way the team has grown and the
toughness they've shown.''
</P>
<P>
   At 66, he is known as the Little Ant for his emphasis on hard
work. He favors sweatsuits over coats and ties and wears a cap over
his graying hair. He seems to be the Walter Brennan of the soccer
set, but he gives as much as he takes with the frenzied Brazilian
news media. And he has made all the right moves to get his team
into Sunday's championship game where Brazil will be seeking an
unprecedented fifth World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo is the cornerstone of Brazilian football. Pele is more
famous than his former teammate, but Zagallo is the one person who
has been around for all four of Brazil's triumphs in the World Cup.
He was a left wing on the teams in 1958 and 1962; he even scored in
the 1958 final. It was Zagallo who coached the 1970 team, which is
considered the greatest of all time, and he was an assistant to
Carlos Alberto Parreira as Brazil prevailed again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he has not fully convinced all of Brazil that he knows what
he is doing. There are 160 million citizens and 160 million coaches
in Brazil. Zagallo was loudly booed in May when Brazil suffered an
unacceptable loss to Argentina in Rio's Maracana Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But because he has already made his career, he can ignore the
media criticism and the phone calls from Pele telling him to play
three forwards instead of two. And he can tolerate the placing of
Zico, another former star, on the team to look over his shoulder as
an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo has done things his way and has produced an unfailingly
entertaining team, one that makes mistakes but one that accepts
these misdemeanors in the taking of great, mesmerizing risks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the penalty-kick victory over the Netherlands in the
semifinals, someone suggested to Zagallo that he had abandoned the
``beautiful game'' that Brazil demands for a hybrid of European and
South American football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't imitate anybody,'' he snarled. ``We are our own men
with our own footballing culture, which has allowed us to lift four
World Cups.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Zagallo scared the purists when he said: ``I would
rather win playing ugly football than lose playing attractive
football. Efficiency in football is based on victories. Everyone
wants to win, and I'm no different.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was Zagallo who also coached the one Brazilian
team that lost in the semifinals, the 1974 team that finished
fourth with a style that was uncomfortably defensive and European
for many followers of `jogo bonito,' the beautiful game. That team
tied both Scotland and Yugoslavia, 0-0, and many were concerned
that the 1998 team was too old and slow and would also crawl into a
defensive shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they criticize me; I understand that,'' Zagallo said.
``Football is passion. I've lived this way for 50 years as an
athlete and coach. This is my happiest moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough that the fans and media were finding fault
with Zagallo. But another coach, Egil Olsen of Norway, said that he
could do much better with Brazil's talent than Zagallo could. That
stung, and what hurt even worse was that Norway defeated Brazil,
2-1, in a first-round matchup after Brazil had already won its
group and its placing in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of slowing his team under a caution flag, though,
Zagallo kept the green light lit. With Rivaldo, this Brazil team is
more talented in midfield than the 1994 team, and it has continued
to attack from all directions, with the great Ronaldo churning like
a fullback toward the goal, with the defenders Cafu and Roberto
Carlos storming down the wings, with a balance that forces defenses
to play with scattered concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has surrendered seven goals in this World Cup, compared
with three in 1994, but for Zagallo that seems an acceptable
exchange for allowing his players great freedom and creativity. He
has said that he did not mind winning ugly, but those were only
words. This team is as attractive as it is talented. It leads the
tournament with 14 goals scored. Zagallo was so overcome by
Wednesday's penalty-kick victory over the Netherlands that he wept
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the favorites and we will win,'' Zagallo promised. ``On
Sunday, 80,000 will be cheering for France, but that is not a
problem. Because, in the hearts of Brazilians, the players will
have 160 million people cheering for them. Brazil has always won
abroad. We are used to beating the home team. And we will do it
again.'' &QL;

AFGHAN REGIME MOVES TO BAN TV AND RADIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Islamic Taliban movement, which rules most
of Afghanistan, has given the people 15 days to get rid of their
television sets or see them smashed by the religious police.
</P>
<P>
   Videocassette recorders, videotapes and satellite dishes were
also ordered to disappear by Afghanistan's minister for the
prevention of vice and the promotion of virtue, who reports to the
Ministry of Religion. The minister, Mohammed Qalamuddin, called
television and video ``the cause of corruption in this society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, a movement led by radical Islamic scholars in
command of ranks of unsophisticated former students from austere
religious schools, has been trying to isolate the population from
television since it began capturing cities in 1996. The movement
also banned audiotapes, films and most other forms of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of Kabul, the capital, to the Taliban in
September 1996, the national television center was closed. But the
Taliban did not follow through on threats to confiscate videotapes
or satellite dishes. Not many Afghans can afford satellite dishes,
and there seems to be no information on how many still exist. Video
players are more common, though still limited largely to the urban
elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban is killing urban communication,'' said Leonard
Sussman, senior scholar in international communications at Freedom
House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sussman, whose organization compiles an annual study of press
freedom worldwide, says he classifies 19 of 186 countries as
repressive in their control of information.
</P>
<P>
   The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, wedged between India and China,
also bans satellite dishes, on the ground that its distinctive
culture could be quickly diluted. But the country plans to create
its own television service and, in the meantime, allows video
players. Video shops proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries, including India and Vietnam, try to control
access to the airwaves, but with dwindling zeal, since satellite
television can be stopped, an Indian entrepreneur once said, ``only
by shooting down satellites.''
</P>
<P>
   Sussman said the Taliban's new rules appeared to be the harshest
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a reversion to a primitive life style,'' he said.
``This is about the worst of the worst for one special reason: the
others demand absolute control of the content of broadcasting. But
no other country wipes out the delivery system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sussman said other countries that oppress the media strictly
``are also going after the Internet for the very same reason,
because it's so difficult to control.'' The Taliban movement has
yet to pronounce on that means of communication, which is almost
nonexistent in Afghanistan outside the offices of international
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and private relief organizations have
satellite television and satellite telephone systems, but these
have not been disturbed. Foreigners are also permitted to keep
alcoholic beverages in their walled compounds.
</P>
<P>
   But outside in the streets, the Taliban's rules apply, including
dress codes, and although foreign women are not required to cover
their faces as Afghan women are, they are expected to cover their
heads, as they are in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Taliban edict on television was announced Wednesday
by the Shariat radio, an official network devoted largely to
religion and moral education. The broadcast added that violators of
the new ban on television would be punished in accordance with
Islamic law, although punishments were not spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement said the religious police, bearded zealots who
cruise the streets in jeeps or pickups armed with automatic
weapons, would begin conducting spot raids when the 15-day warning
period elapsed. All television sets found will be smashed, the
radio said.

INDONESIA'S RULING PARTY MEETS TO PICK NEW LEADER, MAKE REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The ruling Golkar Party opened a special
congress Thursday to choose a new leader and refashion the
organization so that it can respond to calls for political and
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golkar is not only facing competition from the already
established parties, but also from the new parties that continue to
multiply,'' President B.J. Habibie told an audience of nearly 1,000
delegates in his opening remarks of the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Although nearly 30 new parties have been created since the
resignation of President Suharto in May, Golkar officials say the
real challenge comes from within the party, which has dominated
Indonesian politics for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now Golkar has depended on Suharto as a groove of
unity,'' said Bambang Suharto, one of those who is expected to
compete for the party leadership. ``But after Suharto stepped down,
there is no more groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Bambang is not related to the former President.
</P>
<P>
   Growing social protests and a deepening economic crisis may have
helped force Suharto, 77, to resign, but his shadow looms over the
party. Two of his children are on the powerful advisory board of
the party, and the former president remains chairman of the party
board of patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate believed to have Suharto's backing for the
leadership, Edi Sudrajat, also has the support of the party's
remaining Suharto loyalists and the military, a critical core of
support, because 21 of the 27 provincial leaders are from the armed
forces, known as ABRI.
</P>
<P>
   Those leaders plus one from the party executive board and
another from the board of patrons are to choose the next chairman
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Edi's leading rival, State Secretary Akbar Tandjung, warned
that Suharto's influence and his organization of the party would
have to be eliminated if the party were to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to separate ourselves from the bureaucratic influence,
whether it is civilian or ABRI,'' said Akbar, who is believed to
have Habibie's support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finished with him,'' he said of Suharto. ``We have to
look to the future.''

NO JOKE: `LETHAL WEAPON' REHASH TOO VIOLENT TO BE FUNNY

<P>
   (UNDATED) - Take a few dozen shootings, a couple of garrotings,
a little eye gouging. Mix them up with a guy punching out a
pregnant woman, the odd larynx crushing, a bloody impalement and
enough sonic explosions to shake the people in the theater next
door _ and what do you have? A comedy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' the name of the game is how many lame
comic routines can our heroes lurch through while they dispatch the
bad guys in several grotesque ways? The effect is to make the
slayings as funny as the gags _ which isn't that tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 4'' reels around the same rut as the first three
installments, distinguishing itself only by jacking up the violence
and the soundtrack. Hollywood remains convinced that if the
explosions are loud enough, people won't notice that they're
watching a lot more of the same old thing.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth movie in the series seems like the 40th.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return as Riggs and Murtaugh, LA's
craziest cops, who break more laws than the people they arrest.
Actually, they never arrest anyone. They either lose 'em or kill
'em.
</P>
<P>
   The story this time around is even more unimportant than the
story last time around. It has something to do with Chinese
gangsters, although not much.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Riggs and Murtaugh stumble around from chase to beating
to shooting to explosion while they chatter endlessly about cell
phones, aging and fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs and Lorna (Rene Russo) are about to have a baby, if they
can find the time between her having to kick-box bad guys and his
having to wreck half of LA while trying to ask a guy a simple
question.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pesci returns as Leo, the professional butt of short-guy
jokes. To pump up the humor, there's Chris Rock as a cop who wants
to be just like his heroes. To juice up the action, toss in Chinese
kung fu star Jet Li.
</P>
<P>
   Li, making his Hollywood debut after a long Hong Kong career,
actually adds vitality to the nonsensical fight scenes. He could
become a crossover action star, given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and Glover wheeze through the action and mutter through
the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson can still deliver a wacky gag or two, and that's about
all the scriptwriters could come up with.
</P>
<P>
   Glover should have retired from the series after No. 3, if not
No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, who enlivened the last one with her comic pizazz, is a
cipher here.
</P>
<P>
   Rock, who has great comic potential that Hollywood has yet to
tap, is funnier in the previews than he is in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Rock has the unfortunate tendency to deliver the straight lines
in exactly the same hyper fashion as the punch lines, so you can't
tell which is which.
</P>
<P>
   Director Richard Donner, who directed the first three ``Lethal
Weapons,'' seems as weary of the whole thing as everyone else
connected with the project.
</P>
<P>
   Must tire them out, hauling all that money to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a way for them to make even more money off ``Lethal
Weapon 5'' without risking millionaire's fatigue syndrome: Don't
shoot a new film. Just cobble one together from outtakes of the
first four. No one would know the difference.
</P>
<P>
   If you were thinking of sending the kids, ``Lethal Weapon 4'' is
rated R for heavy profanity and graphic violence. 2 stars. &QL;

VAUGHN SAYS HE EXPECTS `FAIR MARKET' OFFER FROM SOME TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Mo Vaughn, who may be down to his last three months
as a member of the Red Sox, said Thursday he is confident that some
team will sign him to a contract that will give him ``fair market
value.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Red Sox' latest proposal _ a guaranteed four-year deal
for $37 million _ doesn't come close to what Vaughn believes will
be the market for a free agent of his stature this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we're going to get a market deal in 1998,
what fair market value is,'' Vaughn said Thursday before taking the
field for the first time since June 26, when he pulled his right
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn would not hazard an opinion on what he believes that
number is, but a fair guess would be $12 million a year for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't personal, this is big business. I'm going to get
market value in 1998, period. There are a lot of things that
(factor) into that, but there will be no hometown discount.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that he had once pledged to take less money if
convinced the Red Sox were making a commitment to winning, Vaughn
said, ``I said that a year and a half ago, the middle of last year.
A lot of other things have happened since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market changes every day. The stock market changes every
day. People's attitude change every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Pedro Martinez's six-year, $75 million deal, which pays
the Sox pitcher an average of $12.5 million a year, had helped to
set the market for this winter's batch of free agents, Vaughn shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro's deal was last year,'' he said. ``This is a new year.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn pledged that he would not talk about his contract
situation again until after the season, and repeated that his first
preference is to play in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But it was equally apparent that Vaughn is certain, and has
received private assurances, that he would be able to land the deal
he is seeking from another club. Among the teams expected to be in
the market for a first baseman next season are Baltimore, Toronto
and Texas. The Rangers have a new deep-pockets owner, Tom Hicks, a
Dallas-based media mogul who also owns hockey's Dallas Stars and
took that team from the third-lowest payroll to third-highest
payroll in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark, the Rangers' current first baseman, is a free agent
and unlikely to be re-signed. With Texas, Vaughn would be able to
bat third, which remains his preference, with RBI king Juan
Gonzalez batting behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's feelings for the Red Sox almost certainly have waned
because of his battles with the front office over the years. Those
battles came to a head last spring, when the team offered him only
a two-year deal when he refused to enter the team's employee
assistance program in the wake of his arrest on drunk driving
charges. He was subsequently acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn implied that he still has doubts whether the Red Sox
really want to sign him. It's equally apparent that he is stung
that the club does not treat him the same way it does Martinez and
Nomar Garciaparra, both of whom received precedent-setting deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said we could get a deal done in a telephone
booth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about recent television reports that the club has had him
tailed by private investigators, Vaughn smiled and said he had no
knowledge whether that's the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' he said. ``If anybody wants to know
anything about me, just ask me, If they want to take a probe, dig
through my house, just come and ask me. I'll open my door. I got
nothing to hide. If that's the case, there will be nothing to be
found.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he will not allow his contract status to be a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only control what happens out here,'' he said. ``I'm
ready to play. The most important thing is to go out and do
whatever I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we said no to an offer at the All-Star break
doesn't mean the situation is impossible. I'm not angry, I'm not
upset ... Really, I'll let my bat talk.''

SALE OF RUSSIA'S STATE OIL COMPANY POSTPONED AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's faltering economy and plunging world oil
prices prompted the government of President Boris Yeltsin Thursday
to postpone the sale of its state oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said Thursday night that the auction of the
company, Rosneft, would be delayed until September or October. It
is the second time that the government has put off the sale because
of a lack of bids.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosneft auction is important to Russia as a source of
desperately needed revenue. The government hopes to sell a
controlling interest in the company for at least $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become a very visible symbol of the nation's
economic distress.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to head off another embarrassing failure, Sergei
Generalov, the Russian minister of fuel and energy, said Thursday
night that the government planned to extend the deadline for the
auction for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that moment oil prices will reach an acceptable level,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His calculation is that export limits by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will strengthen oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said several Russian companies had asked that
the deadline be extended. But it is not clear if they will be in a
position to bid in several months' time.
</P>
<P>
   When the government announced the terms of the Rosneft auction
earlier this year, it seemed like a golden opportunity to snatch up
a piece of the Russian oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The government took measures to encourage a high bid. It spurred
competition by removing restrictions against bids from foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
   It announced it was auctioning 75 percent of the company plus
one share. This meant that the winner of the auction would win
solid control of the company and would have the right to
restructure it.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting its confidence in the sale, the government demanded a
starting price of $2.1 billion. It also insisted that the buyer
invest at least $400 million in the company.
</P>
<P>
   At first it seemed as if the strategy was working. The auction
attracted interest from major Western companies, including the
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which formed a bidding coalition with
Gazprom, Russia's natural-gas monopoly, and Lukoil Holding, the
Russian oil company. Meanwhile, British Petroleum teamed up with
Russia's Uneximbank.
</P>
<P>
   But the fall of world oil prices took a heavy toll, as did the
growing anxiety over emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   When the auction was held in May, no one bid. Seeking to salvage
the auction, the government lowered the sales price by $500 million
and reduced the requirement to invest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Even that did not work, however. In recent weeks, Royal
Dutch/Shell and British Petroleum made clear they would not
participate in the auction, which was due to expire on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gazprom developed its own cash-flow problems when the
Yeltsin government demanded that it pay billions of rubles in back
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to put off the Rosneft auction again adds to the
enormous pressure to come up with revenue from other sources.
Tonight, a senior Russian official said the government would sell
up to 5 percent of Gazprom this year as well as government shares
in the government telecommunications company, Svyazinvest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Rosneft decision also adds to the nation's dark mood.
Russian stocks and bonds rose slightly Thursday, reflecting
expectations that the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank will soon complete their negotiations with Russia for a
multibillion-dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said it needs $10 billion to $15 billion in
assistance. The IMF has signaled that it is willing to provide some
funds but maybe as little as $5.6 in additional financing, forcing
the Russians to turn to other sources, including commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Odling-Smee, a senior IMF official, is coming to Moscow
to try to wrap up the talks.
</P>
<P>
   But the slight upturn in the market was overshadowed by the
drumbeat of dissatisfaction here.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Russian Coal Miners Union demanded that Yeltsin
resign. The Central Bank reported that its reserves to prop up the
ruble had fallen from $16 billion two weeks ago to $15 billion as
of last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin insisted that his government would defend the ruble and
that devaluation could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability,'' he said. ``We have a plan of
action.''

BMW 323 IS LAST HURRAH FOR A STAR PERFORMER

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tempus fugit, technology advances. My laptop computer, obsolete
soon after I first booted it up two and a half years ago, is a
virtual antique. Auto cassette decks have given way to CD changers,
CD-ROM navigation devices and mini-disk audio. Every four years,
like clockwork, Honda trots out an all-new Accord.
</P>
<P>
   So in car years, the current BMW 3-Series, which arrived in 1991
as a '92 model, is positively geriatric _ indeed, three generations
of Accords have been sold in that period. But retirement looms; the
current 3-Series sedans get their gold watches and fond farewells
next month with the arrival of four-door models that are slightly
larger, roomier and plusher. New coupes and convertibles come next
year. Until then, BMW is trying to maintain interest in the current
design with a new engine and a new name.
</P>
<P>
   A feisty terrier in a dog-eat-dog business, BMW knows something
about survival of the fittest. Its ever-mutating 3-Series, which
accounts for 44 percent of overall sales, has become a genus with
31 species sold around the world. In the United States, choices
range from the $22,000 318ti hatchback, which is what that magna
cum laude student was really hoping to get for graduation (not that
the fountain pen wasn't appreciated) to the $55,000 fully loaded M3
convertible, the latest iteration of the ``M'' line of racing-tuned
cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the low end, the 318ti and the 318i sedan share a 16-valve
four-cylinder engine (it actually displaces 1.9 liters, despite the
name). Higher up the ladder are the 328 coupe, sedan and
convertible. These used to be known as 325s _ in the '80s, they
were the Ultimate Striving Machines of the archtypical yuppie _ and
they share a smooth and powerful 2.8-liter in-line six.
</P>
<P>
   The new 323s fall in between, replacing the old 318 coupe and
convertible and offering two more cylinders. But the 323 name is
misleading, too, since the engine actually displaces 2.5 liters.
BMW says it uses the 323 name to avoid confusion (ha!) with its
previous 325s, which had an engine more closely related to the
328s.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? No matter, the upshot is that soon, the only
four-cylinder BMWs sold here will be the hatchback and the plainest
Z3 two-seater. The next-generation 3-Series sedan will have the
same engines as the coupe and convertible: in-line sixes of 2.5,
2.8 or (in the M3) 3.2 liters.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Americans who want a six-cylinder BMW can have
one for less than $30,000, for the first time in five years. The
$29,270 323is coupe is not quite as fast as the $33,770 328is _
going from a stop to 60 miles per hour in 7.1 seconds, compared
with 6.6 _ but it handles with the gusto of its more powerful
sibling, whipping tight corners into submission at speeds that may
astonish drivers accustomed to Camrys and Luminas. And unless your
friends spot the badge on the trunk lid, they'll never suspect you
saved $4,400.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the smaller engine, the differences are few: the 323
has fewer standard features and less in the way of options.
</P>
<P>
   Since most 323s and 328s fall in the $30,000 to $40,000 range,
they are often compared with cars like the Lexus ES 300, the
Infiniti I30 and the Cadillac Catera. While those are quite
competent cars decked out like junior limousines, the 3-Series is
smaller and sportier, with less _ for now _ in the way of frills.
Compared with the wood trim, gathered leather and electronic gizmos
of $30,000 Japanese cars, the basic appointments of the 323
underscore the age of the design. It comes with manual seats (power
adjustments are offered on the 328) in plain leatherette (real
leather is a $1,450 option, or part of a $2,125 ``premium'' package
that includes a front armrest, power sunroof and remote locking).
Fog lights, standard on the 328, are $260 extra. The steering wheel
cannot be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   A sport package, with 16-inch alloy wheels, high-performance
tires, fog lights and sport suspension, is a bargain at $990. All
323s have an automatic traction/stability control and some of the
best anti-lock brakes around.
</P>
<P>
   The car underwhelms at first. There is a lot of hard plastic.
Some of the switches and levers _ the map light toggles, the seat
levers _ feel as if they were fabricated in Detroit instead of
Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But even a spin around the block is likely to win you over, for
like its rich relatives the 323 is a joy to drive. Each time you
fire up the engine, or downshift cleanly into second gear, or take
a familiar curve faster than you dared before, you appreciate the
engineering a little more. Cut a tight corner, and the fat tires
grip like Velcro. Crunch the brake pedal, and the car stops right
now. Punch the accelerator and the 323 scats without the usual
rear-drive twitch or front-drive monkey business. No matter the
maneuver, there is no muss, no fuss _ just a direct, immediate
response.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the engine is not the world-beater of the 328, it is a
serious power plant in its own right, with twin overhead cams, four
valves per cylinder and variable valve timing. The five-speed
manual gearbox _ if you choose an automatic, you'll miss half the
fun _ brings out the engine's best. Horsepower is 168 (compared
with 138 for the 318 and 190 for the 328) and peak torque is 181
foot-pounds (versus 133 for the 318, 206 for the 328). Because the
torque, or pulling power, is strongest around 4,000 rpm, a driver
who wants extra oomph may need to downshift, revving the engine,
but with this slick gearbox, playing the gears adds to the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Worthy as it is, the engine is only part of the equation, for
the car's greatness begins with its exquisite balance. The weight
is distributed nearly perfectly, half over the front wheels and
half over the rear, thanks to a rear-drive layout and tricks like
sticking the battery under the trunk floor. The body structure
feels as solid as a skyscraper I-beam. Matched with a supple
suspension, it pays benefits: The handling doesn't come unglued
unless the car is pushed awfully hard, and the ride stays firm but
absorbent. The noise level is tolerable if not hushed, and the
exhaust rumble is pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see even now, seven years after the current
3-Series landed on these shores, what a benchmark it has been. Even
as the coupe nears its final year of production, it feels fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The car shows its age mainly on the inside. Only when seated in
the cozy cabin do you fully grasp the 323s compactness _ it is 20
inches shorter than a Catera. There is adequate space for four
people, though the cabin is narrow and rear headroom is tight for
6-footers.
</P>
<P>
   If the interior seems spare, remember that it has changed little
since 1992, a period when sybaritic luxuries became common in the
competition. And while the test car's lovely ``Avus blue'' paint
($475 extra) was lustrous and the body panels matched perfectly,
interior pieces fitted together less well. Gaps around the glove
box and center instruments were not uniform. Interior colors seemed
mismatched, and the side air bags wore vinyl tags that looked like
the labels on bargain-basement luggage. Modular inserts between the
front seats allow one to customize the placement of the cup
holders, ashtray and coin holder, but the plastic bits look cheap
and feel wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Criticisms of the 3-Series have included high insurance and
service costs. Computer-coded keys have cut the high theft rate _
though 1995-97 models remain on the Highway Loss Data Institute's
list of 10-most-stolen cars _ and premiums have begun to decline.
To hold down service expenses, BMW is providing free oil changes
and maintenance for three years or 36,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Even with old bones, this new Bimmer runs circles around most
$30,000 cars. It handily makes my short list of drivers' machines
that don't require a trust fund, with the likes of the delightful
Honda Prelude, the no-nonsense Ford SVT Contour and the all-smiles
Mazda Miata. And even though the 323s replacement is around the
corner, a year is a long time to put off having fun.

CLINTON PRAISES HEROIC FIREFIGHTERS, CONSOLES RESIDENTS IN FLORIDA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ With the fires along the Florida coast
finally waning, President Clinton on Thursday dropped by this
beachfront city to congratulate fatigued firefighters and console
residents whose homes had gone up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiching the sympathy visit between an anti-drug event in
Atlanta and a Democratic fund-raiser at the home of actor Sylvester
Stallone in Miami, Clinton used the occasion to announce more
federal emergency aid to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The state will receive a $1 million grant to create 200
temporary jobs to assist in cleanup and restoration in areas
affected by the fires. Also, 29 counties will be eligible for more
direct federal disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the presidential visit was the Daytona Speedway, the
popular race car track, where the parking lot had been converted
into a staging area for emergency workers and headquarters for
media covering the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The speedway made national news recently when it had to cancel
its popular Pepsi 400 race because of poor visibility attributed to
the raging fires.
</P>
<P>
   However, the skies were relatively clear when Clinton made his
grand entrance with his extended motorcade, which did a slow
half-lap around the banked race track usually reserved for cars
that exceed speeds of 75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a crowd of firefighters and volunteers in an
air-conditioned tent outside the track, Clinton said, ``I'm here
because I think it's important that every American knows that this
summer, notwithstanding the great movies, the real American heroes
are not up in space fighting asteroids, they're in Florida fighting
fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the president met with 10 families who had lost almost
everything they owned to the fires. Most were living in hotels and
many were renters and had no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listened sympathetically as Todd and Robin Banks talked
about looking for a new residence after finding out Monday that
their home in Palm Coast had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all ash,'' said Robin Todd. ``There was nothing you
could distinguish.'' The Todds, who have two young children, said
they had no renters' insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Several firefighters came to hear Clinton speak about their
ordeal of waging war against the wildfires in sweltering heat
without proper equipment and without much sleep or food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like it. The fire wasn't doing what
it was supposed to do,'' said Jim Novakowksi, a 47-year old Florida
Ranger from Stuart, who spent 14 days on the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Novakowski said he didn't mind the duty. ``I'm a
firefighter. I enjoy fire.''
</P>
<P>
   While Novakowski said Clinton's visit was a ``morale booster,''
another firefighter wondered why the president showed up after the
worst was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have been here a week and a half ago when the whole
community was going up in a ball of flames,'' said Don Mullen, a
39-year old firefighter from Boca Raton, Fla. Clinton was in China
when the fires were at their peak and dispatched Vice President Al
Gore to Florida in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen said that the ``only reason he (Clinton) is here today is
this is a stopover on the way to a fund-raiser This is a kind of
dog and pony show.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Mullen pulled out his camera and snapped a picture of the
president as he addressed the crowd. Afterward, Mullen said he
liked the president's comments, particularly his warnings that
local communities have to better prepare for fires as the Earth's
climate becomes warmer.

   Since May 25, at least 2,126 wildfires have charred more than
484,623 acres in 67 counties along a 120-mile stretch of the coast.
At least 355 homes and other structures have been damaged or
destroyed, and 8,300 people have spent some time at shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have estimated that the fires caused more than 100
injuries. Three elderly people died when they were being evacuated
from their nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of fighting the fires has been estimated at $104
million and the damage has been estimated at $276 million.

   Earlier in the day in Atlanta, Clinton announced the launching
of a nationwide anti-drug media campaign, an advertising effort
that has already been tested in a dozen cities. The $1 billion ad
campaign over five years _ the largest ever _ will target youths
between the ages of 9 and 18, particularly middle-school children.
It includes spots on television, radio, magazines, billboards,
newspapers and web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a crowd of students, Clinton urged them and their
parents to watch the ads, which were to be aired simultaneously on
the major networks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing in the world to do is to get people to
change their habits, especially if what you're doing feels good in
the moment,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., joined the president
in announcing the new program, Republicans have been extremely
critical of the administration's drug efforts. They claim that the
president has not put nearly as much energy into targeting teen
drug use as it has teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also attended two fund-raisers on the daylong trip. In
Atlanta, he attended a lunch for Senate candidate and cookie
magnate Michael Coles who is opposing GOP incumbent Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, he flew to Miami for a Democratic congressional
fund-raiser at the home of Stallone, the star of a number of action
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami fund-raiser was projected to raise $800,000 while the
Georgia event was expected to net $ 1 million. &QL;

<P>
   American retailers reported their June sales Thursday, and the
results were reliably perplexing. Following two months of stellar
sales for the entire industry, companies were all over the map in
June, demonstrating that when shoppers tighten their purse strings
even slightly, retail wheat and chaff quickly become separated.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap Inc., for example, continued its hot run, reporting that
sales in stores open at least one year rose 15 percent, while the
Limited Inc. said sales gained only 1 percent after two months of
better-than-usual sales. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. boomed ahead with a 9
percent sales gain, while Kmart Corp. said sales rose only 1.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a month unlike other months,'' said Richard Baum, an
analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Usually things like luxury or
discounters are all good, but in June, you had a lot of
polarization. Among department stores, there were some good
performances, but then there were disappointments with J.C. Penney
and Sears.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goldman, Sachs retail composite index rose 4.4 percent in
June from June 1997, a slightly stronger gain than the 4 percent
increase reported for the comparable period a year earlier. But the
gain was not as strong as the 7.1 percent rise in May of this year,
or the 10.2 percent gain in April, the industry's biggest increase
in nearly a decade. Sales in stores open at least one year, or
same-store sales, are considered to be the best measure of a
retailer's health.
</P>
<P>
   Sales by general merchandise retailers have lagged behind the
rest of the strong economic indicators in recent years as shoppers
have held off on purchases of clothes in favor of cars, services
and other goods. But the spring gave new life to retailers, pushing
up retail stocks, which have outperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index this year. The S&AMP;P retail index is up 54.8 percent
so far this year, compared with a 19.39 percent gain in the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of consistency tends to vex investors and analysts
alike. How do you choose which luxury name to play, for example,
when you see Investcorp's Saks Fifth Avenue chain report sales
gains of 8 percent, while its rival, Neiman Marcus, a Harcourt
General Inc. unit that serves almost an identical customer,
reported a gain of only 1.9 percent _ especially when those two
retailers were in the exact reverse position in May?
</P>
<P>
   And how big a bet do you place on the specialty retailers when
Ann Taylor Stores Corp. suddenly reports a gain of 9 percent for
June after losses in many recent months, and when the same can be
said of the rest of the specialty retailing group?
</P>
<P>
   ``You live and die with these things,'' lamented Jeffrey Feiner,
an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc. ``You have to look at it in a
company-specific way. To make a group call with retailers has
always been very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that surprised on the downside, and were punished for
it, were those catering to the middle- to lower-middle-income
shoppers. J.C. Penney &AMP; Co., for example, announced that its sales
fell 2.1 percent and that its second-quarter earnings would be
lower than expected as a result. Wall Street sent the stock
tumbling $5.8125, or 8.1 percent, to close at $65.625.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. also reported a weak month. Sales at the
retailing giant rose a mere three-tenths of 1 percent, and its
stock also took a hit, closing at $59.3125, down $2.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores, which have posted inconsistent results all
year, were again all over the map in June. Dayton Hudson Corp.
reported a 7.1 percent sales jump, largely bolstered by its Target
division, where sales rose 4.9 percent. Sales at Dillard's Inc.
department stores were flat, and Federated Department Stores Inc.
reported a 3.4 percent gain. May Department Stores Co. said sales
rose 4.5 percent, and Kohls Corp. reported gains of 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Retail analysts expect that second-quarter earnings should still
be strong among retailers, because of the solid sales in the
spring, which left little inventory to mark down. ``We think the
bottom line is that second-quarter earnings will be very good,''
Baum said. ``But July sales may not be so great, because there may
be nothing left in the stores to sell.''

FEAR OF VIOLENCE HOVERS OVER BELFAST'S PARADE STANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ David Trimble, the new first
minister of Northern Ireland and head of the Protestant Ulster
Unionist Party, said Thursday that this British province ``faces a
quite awesome prospect'' if no compromise is reached soon over the
government's decision to ban a Protestant parade through a Roman
Catholic community in Portadown, west of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running out,'' he said at a news conference Thursday
afternoon, ``and this society faces a quite awesome prospect if
between now and the weekend we do not find a satisfactory way out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who was chosen nine days ago as head of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly, spent the day trying to arrange a
compromise between Orange Order Protestants and Catholics who
resent Orange parades in their neighborhoods. Talks in London
between Orange Order leaders and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
also failed to produce progress toward compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble spoke as sporadic violence by Protestants continued
across Northern Ireland and leaders of the Orange Order disagreed
with each other on how to deal with the government's ban.
</P>
<P>
   Public anxiety grew as some Orange officials threatened to bring
ordinary life here to a standstill, as other Protestants did in
1974. Others indicated they were still willing to agree to a small,
token parade without the military fife-and-drum music that
Catholics find offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued to try to persuade the Catholics to accept a
token march. But the Catholics insist on direct talks with the
Orangemen, which they need to save face and to gain Orange
recognition before they make a deal. The Orangemen, also needing to
save face, refuse to talk to Catholic leader Breandan MacCionnaith,
who served time in a British prison for his role in the Irish
Republican Army's bombing of a Protestant meeting hall in Portadown
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for an end to the crisis were not improved when four
Orange Order leaders, who met in London for 90 minutes with Blair,
were told that the ban on the parade must be enforced, but that the
prime minister would be talking to them in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Political and security officials fear that if there is no
compromise the violence _ attacks on the police, blocked roads,
attacks on Catholic schools and churches _ will increase this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The parades celebrate the victory at the Battle of the Boyne on
July 12, 1690, of the Protestant William of Orange over his
Catholic father-in-law, King James II.
</P>
<P>
   The violence Thursday included the first attempt by Protestants
to break through the security cordon erected by Royal Ulster
Constabulary officers and British troops around Drumcree, along the
Garvaghy Road. The cordon includes four-foot-high coils of barbed
wire to prevent Protestants from descending Drumcree Hill to the
Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning several Protestant men felled a tree and used
the trunk as a bridge across the wire. Police responded by firing
plastic bullets. The protesters retreated, but responded with their
own missiles, a shower of firework rockets.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries, but the scenes, repeated on television
all day, raised fears that the violence, which began Sunday when
the parade was blocked, would increase. The violence threatens the
viability of the peace agreement, approved in the spring, which is
supposed to end sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   At Portadown, where several hundred Orangemen have been camping
overnight, David McNarry, the head of the order's strategy
committee, said: ``If Her Majesty's government is quite prepared to
say those people who are suffering at Drumcree, who are staying out
at night, who are there because they firmly believe in their civil
and religious liberties, if they are to be treated so scantly, then
I've got to say that we can, if we wish, put our minds to paralyze
this country in a matter of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the Orangemen who met with Blair, the Rev. William
Bingham, said:, ``We are deeply concerned that any kind of violence
totally undermines the Orange position. Threats of violence are not
a fair reflection of what Orangeism is about. No road is worth a
life and no one has the right to destroy property. We want only
peaceful protest.''

 &HT;    Affidavit: Anderson admits to trafficking
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ Greg ``Cadillac'' Anderson, who played backup
center for the Atlanta Hawks last season, has confessed to his
involvement in a four-person cocaine transportation and
distribution operation, according to an FBI affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson ``knowingly and willfully'' possessed as much as a
kilogram of cocaine, conspired with at least three others in making
deals for the controlled substance and carried the drugs across
state lines, from Houston to Biloxi, Miss., according to a federal
indictment filed June 25 in U.S. District Court in Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was detained, but not arrested, on May 20 at the Grand
Casino Bayview Hotel during an FBI sting operation, according to
the FBI affidavit attached to the indictment. An informant was
present when Anderson was paid $26,000 for the drug, according to
the affidavit. Howard Hill, who was working with Anderson, then
sold approximately three ounces of cocaine to the FBI informant,
according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was charged with one count of conspiracy to possess
with intent to distribute a controlled substance, two counts of
possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance and
three counts of interstate travel in aid of unlawful activity.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson confessed to his involvement and cooperated with the
FBI during their investigation, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Federal drug charges bring strict sentences without the
possibility of parole, but defendants who cooperate with
authorities often get more lenient treatment when they are
sentenced. FBI Special Agent Matthew Campbell _ who headed the
investigation of Anderson and co-defendants Kenneth ``K.B.''
Blackmon of Houston, Howard ``Nikki'' Hill of Jackson, Miss., and
Kevin Porter of Biloxi, Miss. _ said Thursday that Anderson's
arrest should come ``soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we catch somebody doing something wrong, it
doesn't mean we'll arrest them right away when there is no risk of
flight,'' Campbell said. ``When he makes his appearance to answer
the indictment, then he'll be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmon was arrested on May 29 and is free on $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 34, is a 10-year NBA veteran who played for six teams.
He earned the NBA minimum salary with the Hawks last season,
approximately $242,000. However, Anderson made $6 million for two
seasons in the Italian League, 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was contacted by The Journal and Constitution on
Wednesday and Thursday, but he refused to comment or to reveal the
name of his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But last week in Houston, Anderson said, ``I just got my name
caught up in something. . . . I'll get through it.'' He carried on
with his daily summer activities -- playing ball during the day at
a Houston high school, participating in a pro-am summer league and
lounging with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Anderson's friends expressed shock at the news of the
indictment. Yet the indictment states that Anderson was involved in
drug business from early 1998, during the Atlanta Hawks season,
until late May.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet, according to the document, performed ``the unlawful
activity being a business enterprise involving the distribution of
. . . cocaine, and thereafter did perform acts to promote, manage,
establish, carry on and facilitate . . . unlawful activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavit, Special Agent Campbell described this series
of events:
</P>
<P>
   On May 16, Hill and Porter were stopped in Biloxi by FBI agents.
A search of Porter's vehicle uncovered ``approximately one kilogram
of powdered cocaine,'' stashed in the engine compartment of the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Porter and Hill said the cocaine had been picked up at
Blackmon's home in Houston. Hill said Blackmon ``fronted'' him the
cocaine but that Hill left a 1996 Impala at Anderson's residence as
collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said Anderson brokered the deal between him and Blackmon
for a $1,000 fee. The cocaine was transported from Blackmon's home
to Anderson's, where it was placed in the engine compartment of
Porter's truck. Porter drove the drugs to Hill, who had flown into
Gulfport, Miss., from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Also on that day, Hill cooperated with the FBI by making several
monitored calls to Anderson. Hill was paged by Anderson, who
instructed Hill to return on that same date. ``Come back and do the
same thing,'' Anderson said. He also told Hill to split the
remaining cocaine, about one quarter of a kilo.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, Hill told Anderson in a telephone conversation that
he'd sold $26,000 worth of cocaine and that Anderson should come to
Biloxi to retrieve the money and forward it to Blackmon. Two days
later, Anderson flew to the Gulfport/Biloxi Regional Airport and
was driven by Hill to the Grand Casino Bayview Hotel. There, Hill
gave Anderson $26,000 in cash and showed Anderson about three
ounces of unsold cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Hill then sold the remaining cocaine to an FBI undercover agent,
with Anderson present. As the undercover agent left Room 870, FBI
agents entered the room and detained Anderson. During questioning,
Anderson admitted to being involved in the cocaine deal, saying
that Blackmon secured the kilo of drugs that Hill and Porter had
when they were stopped on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, trying to cooperate with the FBI on May 22, made
monitored phone calls to Blackmon, who wondered why Hill had not
returned to Houston with cash. ``(Hill) has it sewn up down
there,'' Anderson told Blackmon. Anderson also told Blackmon that
Hill wanted two more ``shoes,'' as in two kilograms of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmon answered, ``OK,'' and gave his pager number. Hill then
called Blackmon, who said, ``You have me worried down here, man.''
Hill assured him everything was fine by saying he'd already sold
one kilo and had broken down another to sell.
</P>
<P>
   A premature announcement in Washington, D.C., by an FBI
official, Tom Kneir, that ``a Hawks player'' was indicted
apparently triggered the unsealing of the indictment. As a courtesy
to the Hawks, U.S. Attorney Brad Pigott in Mississippi successfully
asked a judge to unseal the indictment on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   In cases of cooperation by indicted parties, and with a minimal
risk of flight, the indictments often are sealed until an arrest.

 &HT;    Spivey says he decided to transfer
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Georgia Tech basketball player Travis Spivey plans to
transfer, but the point guard said Thursday that it is his own
decision and coach Bobby Cremins did not force him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' Spivey said, sounding surprised that his
departure had attracted so much attention. ``I don't have a problem
with coach Cremins.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivey's high school coach, Joel Hopkins of Mount Zion Christian
Academy in Durham, N.C., has denounced Cremins and his program,
saying he would never send another player to Tech.Spivey is the
fifth player to leave the basketball program in three years, and a
sixth, Pablo Machado, is considering a transfer. ``It was my
decision (to leave),'' Spivey said. ``Coach Cremins called me in
and we talked. He told me I could come back or I could transfer. He
said he wanted me to do whatever I felt was best. I felt it was in
my best interest if I transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spivey said he ``was never comfortable'' at Tech. ``I came to
Tech for basketball reasons and because of (the city of) Atlanta,''
he said. ``I wasn't that comfortable (in the classroom). Deep down,
Georgia Tech was never the right situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Spivey was thought to be in academic trouble, he never
was given probation or an official warning. However, he was two
hours short of the required number needed to be eligible to play
next season without attending summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, (Cremins) did bring in another point guard,'' Spivey
said. ``I'm not saying (Tony Akins of Berkmar High) would've come
in and taken my place, but I felt we would have split playing
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivey is enrolled in summer school at North Carolina Central
University and will decide in the next few weeks where to play next
season. He would have to sit out a year and will be eligible forthe
1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm visiting Minnesota Monday and then probably Nebraska,'' he
said. ``There are a couple more I may talk to, but I won't decide
until after this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones, an assistant at Minnesota, confirmed that the
Gophers have an interest in Spivey. ``We've requested a
transcript,'' Jones said, ``and we want to talk to him and find out
exactly why he decided to leave. We're interested, but we want to
be sure why he's not returning.''

Cleveland's where it all began for Rahal
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CLEVELAND _ In 1982 as a 29-year-old rookie, Bobby Rahal won his
first Indy-car race just a few miles away from where he grew up in
northern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, with three CART championships and 24
victories behind him, Rahal returns to the Burke Lakeshore Airport
runway course for the final time in the Medic Drug Grand Prix of
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It has been six years since Rahal won a race, and he would love
to get his last victory at the place where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland is a place that holds special significance for me,''
Rahal said. ``I have a lot of local backing here, and that's keeps
me up for this race. Everybody is cheering for me. I have great
memories here, and it would be great to finish my career here the
same way I started it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal grew up in Medina, Ohio, only 35 miles south of downtown
Cleveland. He now lives in New Albany, Ohio, with his wife Debi and
their four children. Rahal decided before the year began that the
1998 season would be his last as a driver.
</P>
<P>
   Being a driver is only part of Rahal's job these days. When his
Indy-car career began, Rahal just wanted to prove he could be a
competitive driver. Now he is the co-owner (with David Letterman)
of a two-driver team, along with being on the board of directors
for CART.
</P>
<P>
   Team Rahal consists of Rahal's Miller Lite Reynard Ford and
Bryan Herta's Shell Reynard Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will be Rahal's 255th start in the Indy-car series. He is
the only driver who has competed in all 16 previous events at
Cleveland, a place that brought him plenty of success over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal has nine top-five finishes on the airport course,
including three seconds and two thirds during a five-year stretch
from 1987-91.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland is one of the best road circuits we have,'' Rahal
said. ``I really enjoy driving this course, and it has always been
very kind to me. I've had a fair amount of success here and the
fans always have warmly welcomed me here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artistically speaking, it's not the most beautiful track in
the world, but every driver I know loves racing here because it's
so wide. It's very racy, and it produces a lot of action.''
</P>
<P>
   The course also has a hairpin-type curve on the first turn past
the start-finish line, where the cars may be three- and four-wide
as the drivers try to squeeze into the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hairiest starting corner in motor sports,'' Rahal
said. ``It looks like the Oklahoma Land Rush going in there for the
first lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said a lot of things will be running through his mind when
he hops into his car to make his final start in a city close to his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to spend my summers up here with my grandparents,''
Rahal said. ``But it was different then, and it was different when
CART first came here. The downtown area was called `The Mistake By
The Lake.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But you compare that to the way it is today, with The Flats,
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jacobs Field and Gund Arena, and
it's a much different atmosphere. All the drivers want to come here
now.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of young drivers have been coming to Rahal lately to make
their pitch as the next driver of the Miller Lite Ford. Rahal has
interviewed several potential replacements to take over his seat,
but he isn't close to making a selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to some guys from Formula One and some other CART
drivers,'' Rahal said. ``But we've also talked to Formula 3000 guys
and Indy Lights drivers. No one from the IRL has contacted me about
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the talk about people not getting opportunities, 99
percent of my calls come from drivers in Europe and South America.
A lot of guys from Brazil are dying to get a ride. The person we
choose doesn't have to be an American. We want someone who is
capable of running up front, but for me, it's going to come down to
desire and the guy that really wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Rahal approached his career when he finally got his
chance on the CART circuit and won at Cleveland in only his fourth
race, defeating Indy-car legends like A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti,
Rick Mears and Al Unser.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of 1998, Rahal will try to keep running up front
and maybe get one more victory before he hangs up his helmet. He
ranks 12th in the FedEx points standings, but he would like to
finish in the top 10. He is only two points behind Al Unser Jr.,
who holds down the 10th spot.
</P>
<P>
   A victory at his home track would be a great way to move up in
the points chase, but more importantly, it would a magical way for
Rahal to close out an outstanding career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't enter my last year to coast around the tracks and get
accolades from the fans,'' Rahal said. ``I still want to win races,
and I have a few more chances before I have to move over for the
kids.''

 &HT;    A. Jones' flight lands in Cox's doghouse
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI -- Andruw Jones is in the doghouse again.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves center fielder, as well as rookie first baseman
Randall Simon, were late reporting back to the club after travel
delays from their native Curacao Thursday. Jones was scratched from
the lineup early in the afternoon, leaving manager Bobby Cox in
personnel bind and not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on planes and weather,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the pair faced disciplinary measures, the manager
replied, ``Oh, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, traveling with his father, and Simon had a 9 a.m. flight
out of Curacao that would have arrived in Miami at noon. But Jones
called to say the flight had been cancelled and, while they were
able to book an afternoon flight, it would not put them into Miami
International Airport until 5:30 p.m. They then faced U.S. Customs
and a long ride up the coast through rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   What irked Cox most was the Braves are already playing a man
short, with left fielder Ryan Klesko out at least until Saturday
while he recovers from his appendectomy. That left Cox with a
22-man roster and he started a Danny Bautista-Gerald
Williams-Michael Tucker outfield for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Simon expected to arrive at Pro Player Stadium just
before gametime and were available for pinch-hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live and learn,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Klesko attempted taking batting practice for the
first time since his June 29th emergency surgery and, depending on
how things go in the batting cage tonight, could be back in action
Saturday after missing just eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did some light jogging (Wednesday) and there's still a lot
of pain in there, just running,'' Klesko said. `` The doctor said
the pain from the scar tissue is going to be there for up to four
to six weeks. Swinging right now, opening up my hips and putting a
lot of pressure down there, it's just not doing it. I tried it a
couple times (Wednesday) and basically fell over.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss rests
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was a good opportunity to start Ozzie Guillen, who had
gone 12 days without seeing action. But the move was actually a
chance for Walt Weiss to catch his breath after what seemed an
endless All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a free moment,'' said Weiss. ``As crazy as it
was, it was still a highlight for me and my family. But it's not
something you'd want to do more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers itinerary
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wohlers was scheduled to pitch Thursday night in Class AAA
Richmond's game in Columbus, accompany the R-Braves to their next
series in Toledo this weekend and then ponder the next move. A
chance exists he could return to Atlanta, but Cox was noncommittal
until management could evaluate the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Lonely fifth starter
</P>
<P>
   With an off-day falling Monday, Kevin Millwood will miss his
turn in the rotation again, meaning the Braves 10-4 fifth starter
will be making just three starts in a 29-day period. Millwood, who
shut out the New York Mets for eight innings his last time out July
4, will next work July 18 against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're skipping him, unless someone wants an extra
day,'' Cox said. ``That puts (Tom) Glavine and (Greg) Maddux on
seven days rest. Everyone is rooting for Kevin but you can't (push
the rotation back).

 &HT;    On deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/ radio: TBS, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (9-6, 3.41; 4-4,
2.89 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. LHP Jesus Sanchez (3-6, 4.67; 0-1,
6.75 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Neagle appears to be back on track after his 1-5 June
swoon. In his last two starts, he beat Tampa Bay and allowed the
Mets just two runs in a game that the Braves won in extra innings
on Sunday. In the two starts, Neagle gave up four runs on 10 hits
while striking out 11, a departure from the June stretch in which
he gave up four or more runs four times in six starts. He recorded
his second shutout of the season June 16 against Florida (7-0) on a
four-hitter. But he has had trouble on the road this season,
standing 3-4 in eight starts. Sanchez pitched well against the
Braves for five innings June 17 before giving up four runs in the
sixth in a 6-2 Braves victory. The 23-year-old struck out nine of
the first 17 men he faced that night. He replaced Rafael Medina in
the rotation after Medina's shoulder acted up in mid-April and has
been effective in spurts. After a 3-1 start, Sanchez is winless in
his last eight appearances and has been hit hard in his last two
starts, giving up a combined 12 runs on 19 hits to Boston and
Montreal.

 &HT;    Falcons have cash to spend under cap
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Atlanta remains about $1.6 million under the salary
cap after signing its nine-member draft class of 1998. That puts
them in slightly better-than-average shape relative to the league.
</P>
<P>
   The number could increase, depending on the situation with
backup quarterback Mark Rypien. Rypien, who probably won't
participate in training camp while his son and wife battle serious
illnesses, could retire. He could be waived. He could join the team
once the season has begun.
</P>
<P>
   If Rypien does not play, the team could end up with $2 million
or so left under the cap. It is conceivable the extra money will
afford the opportunity to pick up a quality player if one is
released from another training camp.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Harold Richardson and head coach Dan Reeves
aren't ready to commit the money in any one direction. They say
they want to extend the contract of quarterback Chris Chandler
(which won't occur sooner than a couple weeks before the regular
season, when the final roster is taking shape).
</P>
<P>
   Two-minute drill
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' minicamp ended Thursday, but a voluntary passing
camp will be held today. It is the last formal gathering of the
entire team before training camp begins July 23. ... Injury update:
WR Kevin Thornal (quad bruise) and LB Cornelius Bennett (Achilles)
were dinged, neither seriously. Fullback Bob Christian's knee
continues to bother him. The only other fullback on the roster is
rookie free agent Darren Fisk of Colorado. ... Chandler, who would
have been the favorite in the Dan Reeves Golf Tournament on
Thursday afternoon at Chateau Elan, didn't play. Reeves said
Chandler committed months ago to play in the Isuzu Celebrity Golf
Challenge in Lake Tahoe, before dates were set for minicamp. He
therefore was excused. ... With Chandler gone, Steve DeBerg got
more reps. The highlight: a 55-yard pass down the right sideline,
that Keith Crawford caught for a touchdown. The ball was just over
the fingertips of the defender. ... Veterans were measured and
weighed Tuesday, and 28-year-old defensive end Chuck Smith hit
6-foot-2 1/2. Last year, he was 6-2. ``I want to pick up another
half by the time I retire,'' he said. ... Smith and left tackle Bob
Whitfield each have hosted the ``Sports Unlimited'' show on Media
One. Whitfield has less experience at this kind of thing, but said,
``At least I'm better than Magic,'' a reference to Magic Johnson's
much-maligned new show on Fox/Channel 5.

 &HT;    Mining for prospects passed over in draft
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- There aren't many Jessie Tuggles out there, but the
Atlanta Falcons _ like every NFL team _ are looking for them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle made the team as an undrafted free agent from Valdosta
State in 1987, when there were 12 rounds in the draft rather than
the current seven. He started four games at middle linebacker as a
rookie, has led the team in tackles nine straight years and has
been to four Pro Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   After the draft every spring, NFL teams continue mining for
talent, signing college players who slipped through the cracks.
Atlanta signed 12, waiving three since.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to handicap the prospects of these players since
they won't play in pads until July 23. But some arrived with bigger
reputations, and wallets, than others. The Falcons gave five
signing bonuses of $10,000 or more to undrafted rookies. By
contrast, the Chiefs gave one bonus that big, and none more than
$6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Jose Portilla (6 feet 6, 320 pounds) of Arizona and
left tackle Michael Edwards (6-6, 290) of Nevada got two of the
large bonuses. Both said coaches haven't given them any special
insight about their chances to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't said what their plans are,'' Portilla said. ``I'm
just working on adjusting to all the humidity, and getting used to
the playbook.''
</P>
<P>
   The other rookie free agents are Darren Fisk, a 6-1, 230-pound
fullback from Colorado; defensive end Ben Huff (6-4, 275) of
Michigan; wide receivers Corey Allen (6-1, 199) of Georgia and
Octavus Barnes (6-2, 200) of North Carolina; quarterback Brian
Brennan (6-5, 225) of Idaho, linebacker Schad Freeman (6-3, 235) of
Valdosta State and safety Brad Trout (6-2, 209) of Valdosta State.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle's path was unusual. It's more likely a few rookie free
agents will make the five-man practice squad. Robbie Tobeck made
the practice squad in 1993 and played sparingly in '94 before
starting all 47 of 48 games since. He has moved from left guard to
center this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, receiver Kevin Thornal of SMU, defensive end Barry
Mitchell of Idaho and tackle Jeremy Akers of Notre Dame made the
practice squad despite not being drafted. Each will be in training
camp this year.

 &HT;    It's official and unanimous: Selig voted commissioner
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Bud Selig had the word ``acting'' dropped from his
commissioner's title Thursday and pledged to ``ensure that baseball
remains as important and as attractive to every child as it was to
me when I was growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has doubts about Selig's heart being in the right place
for baseball. And the owners on Thursday gave the 63-year-old a
unanimous vote of approval by naming him the ninth commissioner of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Selig has served as interim commissioner since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people recognized the job that was being done,'' Mets
owner Fred Wilpon said. ``There was a great turnaround in baseball,
and Bud should get the credit. It happened on his watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners praised Selig for reinvigorating the game with
interleague play and wild-card playoff races.
</P>
<P>
   Selig will continue to rule by consensus. ``A commissioner is
not a czar sitting above the law,'' he said. ``Yes, a commissioner
has a lot of power, but it must be confined to certain areas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he does not expect sweeping changes, although the
major-league office probably will be overhauled _ except for Paul
Beeston, the chief operating officer, who will continue to deal
mostly with the players union. One of Selig's biggest challenges
will be to try to correct the huge disparity between the
small-market and big-market teams. Right now, almost every division
and wild-card race is led by a team with a big payroll. But first
and foremost, Selig said he will make sure there are no more work
stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the average fan is unhappy about,'' he said. ``He
or she doesn't want to hear anymore about what I said, (about) what
Don Fehr said. The more we focus on the field, the better off we'll
all be.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig has resigned from his positions as president and CEO of
the Milwaukee Brewers, the team he owns.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, will take over those duties
officially. She has been handling the day-to-day business
operations of the club. Her recent focus has been on the club's new
park.
</P>
<P>
   Selig owns about 35 percent of the club, and his share will be
put into a blind trust. Bob Dupuy, Selig's personal lawyer, is
drafting the terms of a trust, in which the Brewers will be placed
into to remove any potential conflicts. Selig will have to name a
trustee who will vote on his ownerships interest when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Selig-Prieb insists she will not compromise her job and ask her
father for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (will) have no involvement,'' she said. ``Like everyone
else, he'll have to read it in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig said: ``I hear most people say, 'He's an owner, and he's
one of them.' First and foremost, for those who know me, I am a
fan. There is no one who could love this game more than I do.

AN INNOVATOR BATTLING DEMONS OF SOCIETY AND HER MIND
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Japanese-born Yayoi Kusama, 69, is a legend in
postwar art, and an elusive one. Her innovative work had high
visibility in the 1960s, when she was living in New York and
traveling frequently to Europe. After her return to Japan in the
'70s, she faded from the international stage. Only in the '90s has
she come back into view, and her art has never made more sense than
it does now.
</P>
<P>
   Her sculptures of 30 years ago, domestic objects bristling with
phallic protrusions, seem uncannily prescient of the
body-and-gender-centered art of the present decade. Her abstract
paintings composed of netlike skeins of pigment and fields of polka
dots could be prototypes for the hands-on, minutely incremental,
intensely personal work of many artists today.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when the idea of ``outsider'' has cachet, she
seems, at least at first glance, to fill the bill. Virtually
self-taught, she pursued a career, despite family disapproval, in
an overwhelmingly male-dominated field. And since childhood she has
been dogged by mental illness, which she says is the source of her
art but which finally prompted her to take up permanent residence
in a psychiatric hospital in Tokyo two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   New York has seen little of Ms. Kusama since then, but she is
everywhere in the city at the moment. A retrospective of her work
has just opened at the Museum of Modern Art. A gorgeous show of
early paintings on paper can be savored at Peter Blum Gallery in
SoHo. New work is on view at Robert Miller; and individual pieces
are cropping up here and there in gallery group shows, notably at
Pat Hearn and Derek Eller in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, it is a sizable serving to deal with, though it
doesn't really feel that way. Ms. Kusama has been prodigiously
inventive, but within a narrow range. Hers is an art of repetition
and inflection, of variations on a few set themes. And the
countless versions of each of her signature motifs tend to blur
together in the mind, leaving the impression of an oeuvre that is
at once stimulating and monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern show, titled ``Love Forever: Yayoi Kusama,
1958-1968'' and organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
and the Japan Foundation, does everything possible to suggest the
variety of Ms. Kusama's output. The curators, Laura Hoptman and
Lynn Zelevansky, have wisely concentrated on the most innovative
decade of her work and have streamlined an already-modest-size show
for its New York appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The selection actually includes material from the early 1950s,
when Ms. Kusama was still in Japan and was peripherally aligned
with that country's dynamic postwar avant-garde. Already, the
forces that shaped her work were in place: social pressures, a
shrewd eye for nascent cultural trends and the obsessive-compulsive
psychological disorders that, the artist reports, produced
suffocating hallucinations of patterns and colors.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Ms. Kusama used art as a means of exercising
control over such debilitating visions. She translated them into
small gouache, watercolor and ink paintings of biomorphic forms
that resemble mutating cells, psychedelically palpitating flowers
and extraterrestrial orbs set against dark and empty space.
</P>
<P>
   These jewel-like paintings are, as a group, among Ms. Kusama's
most persuasive works. (She is said to have destroyed thousands of
them before leaving Japan in a fit of anger at her dominating
mother.) And the superb selection at Peter Blum Gallery forms an
essential and revelatory supplement to the Modern retrospective.
Similar examples at the Modern itself, like the little gouache
titled ``Seed'' (1953-circa 1963), with its crochetlike net of red
strokes floating over a blue and mustard ground, are also striking,
though they were repainted after the artist's arrival in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the city, her art changed format. Perhaps under the
lingering spell of Abstract Expressionism, she scaled up her
``infinity nets,'' as she called her designs, to wall-sized
paintings of lacy allover patterns that pulse and shift over darker
or lighter grounds. These proto-Minimalist works were an instant
critical success when first exhibited in 1959. (Donald Judd wrote
glowingly about them and bought a few pieces for his own
collection.)
</P>
<P>
   The artist's drive toward cumulative pattern-making assumed
other forms as well. She composed abstract collages from air-mail
stickers, packaging labels and photographs of her own paintings.
And in 1961, she began to create the distinctive soft sculptures
that are probably her most familiar works.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them take the form of pieces of everyday furniture _
chairs, beds, ironing boards _ which she covered with stuffed and
sewn shapes resembling both phalluses and proliferating tumorous
growths. By Ms. Kusama's account, these works were yet another
exercise in psychic damage control, an attempt to confront
deep-seated sexual fears by giving them physical embodiment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the artist's explanation of her work as neurotically
generated and therapeutic can be taken entirely at face value has
been questioned by some observers, who suggest that her declaration
of mental illness is primarily an exoticizing bid for attention.
And whatever the truth, there is no question that a hunger for
publicity has fueled Ms. Kusama's career from the start.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It may have been one of the factors that prompted her to expand
her sights beyond individual paintings and sculptures to her more
spectacular room-filling installations, in which she often had
herself photographed in the nude. (Three such environments,
including `Infinity Mirror Room,'' a witty but spooky reflective
enclosure filled with tumescent polka-dotted forms, have been
reconstructed for the Modern show.) And from these she proceeded to
the politically pointed public performances that capped her New
York career.
</P>
<P>
   The only sense one can get of this Happening-inspired work now,
of course, is through incidental materials and documentation. To
this end, the exhibition includes a pulsating, orgiastic 1967 film
in which the artist intently dabs paint on nude bodies to the beat
on an acid-rock soundtrack. Also on hand is a blowup of a 1969 New
York Daily News front page carrying a photograph of a nude
guerrilla-style performance that Ms. Kusama had orchestrated in the
Modern's sculpture garden. (At the time she referred to the museum
as the ``Mausoleum of Modern Art.'')
</P>
<P>
   It is crucial to view Ms. Kusama's work, which also included
disruptive performances on Wall Street and antiwar demonstrations,
within the framework of the volatile and still-under-studied
countercultural era. She was certainly part of its full-frontal,
exhibitionistic energy and, as a savvy art-world insider, she
shared the stage as an equal with artists like Andy Warhol and
Robert Rauschenberg in New York and Piero Manzoni and Yves Klein in
Europe, all of whom in one way or another caught the spirit of that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it any less important to consider her within the context
of postwar Japan, which in the early '60s saw the emergence of a
socially anarchic, sexually obsessional art produced by figures
like Kudo Tetsumi, Miki Tomio and the great performance artist
Hijikata Tatsumi.
</P>
<P>
   Without these perspectives on where Ms. Kusama came from, in
fact, much of her work, particularly the sculpture, loses some of
its punch.
</P>
<P>
   One feels this in the cluster of sculptures at the end of the
Modern show, and in the selection of recent work at Robert Miller.
There, the ubiquitous phalluses, coated with neo-Baroque gold
paint, look decorative and whimsical, devoid of any inkling of the
social and psychological stresses that once fired them up. Whimsy
always has a short shelf life; the new work adds bulk but not
weight to the artist's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a reputation to be valued. Ms. Kusama's best work _
especially the unforgettable early paintings done in Japan and New
York _ have an expressive pressure and energy that is entirely
original and hard-won.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their sources, they cut straight across cultures,
always a signal accomplishment. It is a measure of her
accomplishment that the number of younger artists of the 1990s who
show affinities with her work are almost beyond count and are
growing in number, giving her art of repetition and accumulation a
historical dimension that is entirely apt.

ROOSEVELT TO JOIN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION STAFF

   WASHINGTON _ More than 50 years after his grandfather created
Social Security as part of the New Deal, James Roosevelt is joining
the Social Security Administration to help prepare the retirement
program for the demands of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth S. Apfel, the Social Security Administration
commissioner, announced Thursday that Roosevelt, a longtime
Democratic activist and Cambridge, Mass. lawyer, has been named an
associate commissioner for retirement policy. Roosevelt will begin
work later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased Jim is joining us as a member of our
executive team,'' said Apfel. ``He will bring a wealth of knowledge
and expertise on retirement policy to Social Security as we discuss
and debate the challenges facing Social Security in the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt is a member of the Democratic National Committee and
legal counsel to the Massachusetts Democratic Party. He made an
unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for Congress in
Massachusetts' 8th district in 1986, the year that Representative
Joseph P. Kennedy II won the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt joins the Social Security Administration at a critical
point in the debate over the future of Social Security. Congress
has been reluctant to make changes because of fear of political
repercussions. But the popular retirement program faces a major
challenge in the next century when the enormous Baby Boom
generation reaches retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has urged Congress to hold back on spending
the projected budget surplus until the Social Security issue has
been resolved. Agency officials said Roosevelt will be based in
Washington.

Cleveland's where it all began for Rahal
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CLEVELAND _ In 1982 as a 29-year-old rookie, Bobby Rahal won his
first Indy-car race just a few miles away from where he grew up in
northern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, with three CART championships and 24
victories behind him, Rahal returns to the Burke Lakeshore Airport
runway course for the final time in the Medic Drug Grand Prix of
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It has been six years since Rahal won a race, and he would love
to get his last victory at the place where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland is a place that holds special significance for me,''
Rahal said. ``I have a lot of local backing here, and that's keeps
me up for this race. Everybody is cheering for me. I have great
memories here, and it would be great to finish my career here the
same way I started it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal grew up in Medina, Ohio, only 35 miles south of downtown
Cleveland. He now lives in New Albany, Ohio, with his wife Debi and
their four children. Rahal decided before the year began that the
1998 season would be his last as a driver.
</P>
<P>
   Being a driver is only part of Rahal's job these days. When his
Indy-car career began, Rahal just wanted to prove he could be a
competitive driver. Now he is the co-owner (with David Letterman)
of a two-driver team, along with being on the board of directors
for CART.
</P>
<P>
   Team Rahal consists of Rahal's Miller Lite Reynard Ford and
Bryan Herta's Shell Reynard Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will be Rahal's 255th start in the Indy-car series. He is
the only driver who has competed in all 16 previous events at
Cleveland, a place that brought him plenty of success over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal has nine top-five finishes on the airport course,
including three seconds and two thirds during a five-year stretch
from 1987-91.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland is one of the best road circuits we have,'' Rahal
said. ``I really enjoy driving this course, and it has always been
very kind to me. I've had a fair amount of success here and the
fans always have warmly welcomed me here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artistically speaking, it's not the most beautiful track in
the world, but every driver I know loves racing here because it's
so wide. It's very racy, and it produces a lot of action.''
</P>
<P>
   The course also has a hairpin-type curve on the first turn past
the start-finish line, where the cars may be three- and four-wide
as the drivers try to squeeze into the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hairiest starting corner in motor sports,'' Rahal
said. ``It looks like the Oklahoma Land Rush going in there for the
first lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said a lot of things will be running through his mind when
he hops into his car to make his final start in a city close to his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to spend my summers up here with my grandparents,''
Rahal said. ``But it was different then, and it was different when
CART first came here. The downtown area was called `The Mistake By
The Lake.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But you compare that to the way it is today, with The Flats,
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jacobs Field and Gund Arena, and
it's a much different atmosphere. All the drivers want to come here
now.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of young drivers have been coming to Rahal lately to make
their pitch as the next driver of the Miller Lite Ford. Rahal has
interviewed several potential replacements to take over his seat,
but he isn't close to making a selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to some guys from Formula One and some other CART
drivers,'' Rahal said. ``But we've also talked to Formula 3000 guys
and Indy Lights drivers. No one from the IRL has contacted me about
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the talk about people not getting opportunities, 99
percent of my calls come from drivers in Europe and South America.
A lot of guys from Brazil are dying to get a ride. The person we
choose doesn't have to be an American. We want someone who is
capable of running up front, but for me, it's going to come down to
desire and the guy that really wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Rahal approached his career when he finally got his
chance on the CART circuit and won at Cleveland in only his fourth
race, defeating Indy-car legends like A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti,
Rick Mears and Al Unser.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of 1998, Rahal will try to keep running up front
and maybe get one more victory before he hangs up his helmet. He
ranks 12th in the FedEx points standings, but he would like to
finish in the top 10. He is only two points behind Al Unser Jr.,
who holds down the 10th spot.
</P>
<P>
   A victory at his home track would be a great way to move up in
the points chase, but more importantly, it would a magical way for
Rahal to close out an outstanding career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't enter my last year to coast around the tracks and get
accolades from the fans,'' Rahal said. ``I still want to win races,
and I have a few more chances before I have to move over for the
kids.''

NEW WELFARE RULES WOULD RAISE ELIGIBILITY STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With nearly 10,000 families slated to have their
welfare cash benefits cut off Dec. 1 under Massachusetts' new
two-year time limit, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci's administration
will propose narrow circumstances Friday under which they might be
granted a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed regulations developed by welfare officials,
the welfare commissioner could grant an extension to a family in
which a parent works full time but earns less than what the family
gets in cash aid.
</P>
<P>
   That sets a high bar, which most families would not be able to
clear. For example, a person who works full time at minimum wage
would earn $854 a month, the amount a family of eight receives in
welfare benefits. The average welfare family has three members _ a
mother and two children _ and obtains $565 a month.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are other extenuating circumstances under which
families could qualify for an extension. The commissioner, for
instance, could also consider whether a parent has been offered a
job but couldn't accept it because she was unable to obtain child
care; whether a parent has made a sincere effort to find a job but
could not get one; and whether the family has been complying with a
host of state welfare rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor denounced the proposal for making it too
difficult for truly needy families to stay on welfare. They also
criticized the plan for giving the commissioner too much power to
decide on extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates contend the state should create standards under which
waivers would be automatically granted and take into consideration
other factors such as whether there are obstacles standing in the
way of a person's ability to get and hold a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other states say that if you play by the rules, we will give
you an extension,'' said Deborah Harris, an attorney specializing
in welfare issues at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. ``This
state says that if you play by the rules, we will consider giving
you an extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple fairness requires that people should know what the
rules are and know whether they will be able to feed and house
their children if they follow the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But in what some advocates consider a promising development, if
the commissioner denies a waiver request, the case could be
appealed through an administrative process and ultimately to the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Ross, coordinator of the Women's Alliance, a
Framingham-based grass-roots advocacy group for low-income women,
noted that one-third of the cases closed under Massachusetts' new
welfare system have been due to procedural problems. ``If the
implementation of the time limit is fraught with as many
problems,'' she said, ``it is going to be really crucial that we
have the ability to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the aim is to nudge as many people into work and off the
welfare rolls as possible, administration officials acknowledge
they were trying to create as few circumstances as possible in
which waivers would be granted .
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation all along is two years should be time enough
for the vast bulk of individuals on welfare to be able to
transition off,'' said one high-ranking administration official who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of the 10,000 families subject to the Dec. 1
cutoff do not currently have to work because they have preschool
children. But administration sources said a new intensive program
will be started this summer through the Department of Employment
and Training and state-contracted career centers to help these
families get jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The time limit applies to families with able-bodied parents and
children at least 2 years of age who have been on the welfare rolls
for 24 months in a five-year cycle. The commissioner would be able
to grant extensions for up to six months an unlimited number of
times.
</P>
<P>
   Administration sources said discussions are currently underway
to have a state agency monitor the well-being of families who are
not granted waivers to the time limits and to make sure they are
aware they would remain eligible for other programs such as food
stamps and Medicaid.

THESE TV MOMENTS TRULY RANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We've hit a speed bump in our overzealous,
here-comes-the-millennium need to ``rank 'n' roll,'' the fallout
which could cause a great many of us to simply stop, drop and roll.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is no one has figured out how to define a defining
moment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the current issue of TV Guide attempts to construct
TV's 50 greatest sports moments. It appears the editors did so by
throwing suggestions into a hat and pulling them out with greased
salad tongs. The great moments seem to be there, but their
illogical order leaves the reader to wonder what, if any, criteria
was considered.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, anytime the Miracle On Ice is confused with Torville
and Dean's perfect 6.0 at the '84 Olympics, the filters in coffee
machines at TV Guide need to be scanned.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide, of course, admits it wants this list to ignite debate.
The only debate is whether to simply incinerate or roll into a
giant torch and burn TV Guide's building to the ground with it.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to some insight into the socio-cultural
ramifications with these kinds of exercises? TV Guide, in all its
triviality, manages to do neither.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to this: The bottom line is, everyone's a sucker for
lists. And if you're going to determine, and not undermind, the
most important sports moments in TV history (we know, TV Guide's
guideline was just ``the greatest,'' but we suggest taking it a
step further), a starting point could look something closer to
this:
</P>
<P>
   1972: ABC's coverage of the hostages at the Munich Olympics. For
reminding the world that sports isn't just fun and games and that a
so-called sportscaster (Jim McKay) can cover a news event if
properly trained.
</P>
<P>
   1939: NBC beams the Princeton-Columbia baseball game to a
handful of homes in the New York. For the birth of televised sport.
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   By our definition _ and here's the distinction _ TV can't be
taken that seriously. It lost that right long ago. It's definitely
an entertainment medium with journalism-by-mistake mentality, and
only if it creates ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when we were inspired to feed this ``list-monster,''
we've decided a ranking of the defining moments in sports TV should
look more like this (with a slant toward how it impacted Los
Angeles):
</P>
<P>
   1. Vin Scully's attempt at entertainment television. From spring
1969 to summer of 1970, Scully hosted a game show for NBC called
``It Takes Two.'' From January to March 1973, he tried hosting a
weekday afternoon talk show for CBS called ``The Vin Scully Show.''
The former was replaced by ``Dinah's Place,'' the latter by ``The
Secret Storm.'' And sports fans in L.A. didn't have to fret about
Scully pulling a Dick Enberg and leaving us for the network riches.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Munsters,'' first season, episode 29 called ``Herman
the Rookie,'' airdate April 8, 1965. Leo Durocher appears as
himself _ as the Dodgers manager. For a kid growing up in L.A., it
left a scarring effect. Was Walter Alston the Dodgers' skipper, or
was it really Durocher?
</P>
<P>
   TV was wrong. So TV was bad.
</P>
<P>
   Durocher also delivered maybe the best line in sports TV history
for that decade. After watching Herman Munster during a tryout,
Durocher exclaims: ``I don't know whether to sign him with the
Dodgers or send him to Vietnam!''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Leave It To Beaver'' episode called ``Long-Distance Call,''
airdate June 16, 1962. Beaver Cleaver, on a dare from pal Whitey,
calls the Dodgers locker room and asks for Don Drysdale. When
Drysdale comes to the phone, they have a conversation that any kid
would love to have with a big-leaguer. A local newspaperman hears
about it, writes a story, Beav gets in trouble ... but that's
another story.
</P>
<P>
   This episode inspired kids everywhere to reach out and bond with
their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   (Writer's note: Don't try this with Bill Grabarkewitz,
especially after an 0-for-5 day).
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Who's The Boss'' episode from 1990 called ``Take Me Back to
the Ballgame.'' Tommy Lasorda appears as himself. It explains this
warped relationship with Tony Danza.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``The Bold and the Beautiful,'' episode from 1993. Mike
Piazza appears as himself. He also appears to take the ``bold'' and
``beautiful'' parts to heart. Leaves L.A. five years later.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``The Brady Bunch,'' fifth season, second episode called
``Mail Order Hero,'' airdate Sept. 21, 1973. Joe Namath appears as
himself. This marks the end of Namath's NFL career (see L.A. Rams,
benchwarmer), and the beginning of the end of his acting career
(see ``The Waverly Wonders'').
</P>
<P>
   7. ``The Brady Bunch,'' first season, episode 18 called ``The
Undergraduate,'' airdate Jan. 16, 1970. Wes Parker appears as
himself. Greg Brady has a crush on his teacher, Miss O'Hara, whose
boyfriend happens to be the Dodgers first baseman, who promises
Brady Dodger tickets if his grades improve.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Parker's acting career stalled, but surprisingly, Fes Parker
started getting more TV work.

<P>
   8. ``Gilligan's Island,'' episodes called ``Topsy-Turvy''
(airdate Nov. 14, 1966) and ``High Man on the Totem Pole'' (airdate
Feb. 27, 1967). Roman Gabriel, Al Ferrara and Jim Lefebvre appear
not as themselves, but as natives. It helped set a bad precedent.
Ten years later, Jim Bouton starred in ``Ball Four,'' based on his
controversial tell-all book. The sitcom lasted one month before
Bouton was left on TV's deserted island.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``The Simpsons,'' episode 8F13 called ``Homer at the Bat,''
airdate Feb. 20, 1992. Darryl Strawberry appears as himself, in
cartoon form. The then-Dodgers controversial outfielder shows his
vulnerable side, crying when Bart and Lisa taunt him with
``Darr-yyylll.'' Turned out to foreshadow Strawberry's cry for
help.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Bowling For Dollars,'' hosted by Chick Hearn, circa 1970.
Chick interviewing the common folk. Simply put, it's the reason why
there are no bowling game shows on TV today. Ask anyone who saw it.

ROOSEVELT TO JOIN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION STAFF

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 50 years after his grandfather created
Social Security as part of the New Deal, James Roosevelt is joining
the Social Security Administration to help prepare the retirement
program for the demands of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth S. Apfel, the Social Security Administration
commissioner, announced Thursday that Roosevelt, a longtime
Democratic activist and Cambridge, Mass. lawyer, has been named an
associate commissioner for retirement policy. Roosevelt will begin
work later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased Jim is joining us as a member of our
executive team,'' said Apfel. ``He will bring a wealth of knowledge
and expertise on retirement policy to Social Security as we discuss
and debate the challenges facing Social Security in the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt is a member of the Democratic National Committee and
legal counsel to the Massachusetts Democratic Party. He made an
unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for Congress in
Massachusetts' 8th district in 1986, the year that Representative
Joseph P. Kennedy II won the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt joins the Social Security Administration at a critical
point in the debate over the future of Social Security. Congress
has been reluctant to make changes because of fear of political
repercussions. But the popular retirement program faces a major
challenge in the next century when the enormous Baby Boom
generation reaches retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has urged Congress to hold back on spending
the projected budget surplus until the Social Security issue has
been resolved. Agency officials said Roosevelt will be based in
Washington.

MUSEUM IS TESTAMENT TO ATTEMPTS TO CURE ETERNAL ILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It is odd to find the Museum of Questionable
Medical Devices here in the capital of Midwestern niceness.
</P>
<P>
   But just across the river from all the skyscrapers, in the
historic St. Anthony Main complex, is an array of bogus medical
devices spanning two centuries, a stunning testament to the myriad
ways people have tried to make money off the eternal ills of
humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Baldness, impotence and obesity seem to inspire the most
creations, including slimming soaps, ``sanitized tapeworms'' and a
remarkable hair-loss device _ the Crosly Xervac _ that creates a
vacuum to pull blood to the scalp and no doubt caused more hickeys
than hair growth.
</P>
<P>
   For more general health benefits, there were contraptions like
the MacGregor Rejuvenator, dating from 1932, a magenta
iron-lung-like machine in which a patient would lie, to be blasted
with magnetism, radio waves and infrared and ultraviolet light, in
hopes of reversing the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   The museum of quackery is tiny, out of the way, open mostly in
the evenings and is free. After 14 years, it is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing 750 people a week now,'' said Robert W. McCoy,
the 71-year-old retired salesman who founded it, ``and with the
books we sell and contributions, it's finally self-supporting.
Until this year, I was subsidizing it from Social Security, my
pension and my wife's salary.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy's wife, Margaret, a pediatrician who overcame an initial
fear of being spotted by a patient, helps out on busy weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's good at explaining things,'' McCoy said. ``But she won't
do phrenology readings.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrenology machines, the first devices he acquired, back in
1984, are McCoy's specialty, featuring a metal helmet that looks
like a torture device. The contraption spits out a personality
reading based on the shape of the user's head. After a series of
loud clanks, this visitor's $2 reading produced mixed results: very
superior in friendship, combativeness, veneration and amativeness;
average on agreeability, sympathy and suavity, but, alas, deficient
in faith, ideality, time and tune.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy's collection now includes 200-odd items, thanks to loans
from the Food and Drug Administration and the American Medical
Association, purchases, and donations from the growing ranks of
medical experts who have found the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a medical historian in the other day who was just agog
at what we have,'' McCoy said. ``People fall for things that are
really preposterous. Especially about sex.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pre-Viagra, attempts to restore ``sexual vitality'' involved
items like a 1918 prostate gland warmer, which was plugged into a
socket, then inserted into the rectum, or the Manhood Belt of the
same era, which created a burning sensation when activated by body
sweat because it was soaked in red pepper.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, those seeking an aphrodisiac might have turned to
Radithor, a concoction of distilled water laced with radium.
Radioactivity became the miracle cure for all kinds of things,
offered in suppository form for women, or in a jock strap for men.
``Weak Discouraged Men!'' trumpets one circular. ``Now Bubble Over
with Joyous Vitality Through the Use of GLANDS and RADIUM.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum also has an old fluoroscope, an X-ray machine used in
the 1950s to fit shoes: children would stick their feet in, then
look through the machine to see their green toe bones wriggling
around inside the shoe. McCoy's relic turned up in a West Virginia
department store in 1981, long after its use was generally banned.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the museum's displays were late-night television fodder,
like the foot-operated bosom enlarger, a pump with pink cups to be
placed over the breast. Or the dieters' glasses, tinted blue on one
lens, brown on the other, on the theory that tinted food would be
so unappetizing that the wearer would eat less.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy has blood-letting instruments, vision enhancers and one of
Wilhelm Reich's original orgone energy accumulator boxes,
metal-lined containers the doctor said would capture free-floating
orgone, or libidinal energy. After a fight with the Food and Drug
Administration, which in 1957 ordered him to stop shipping the
boxes, Reich was sentenced to two years in prison, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's additions are green Kangle Magnetic Balls from
Beijing, purporting to work wonders on, among other things,
headache, finger cramp, sore throats, fever, problems with
urination, and, with repeated use, to help the elderly maintain
``strong brains.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum highlights not only arcana of the past, but
contemporary products marketed for health purposes, from blue-green
algae to bogus cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the goofiness of the collection, the message adds up
to a salutary Midwestern sermon against snake oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just recently, there was a lady who said, `How dare you have
magnetic insoles in here, when they really work,' and got really
testy,'' McCoy said. ``It turns out she sells them. Most of the
time, when people come in and say how wonderful their copper
bracelets are, or whatever, I give them a copy of an old pamphlet,
`Of the Imagination as a Cause and Cure of Disorders in the Body.'
People don't seem to know that the scientific method is. It seems
to slip past them. We try to ask, in a gentle way, `How do you know
this thing works?'''

COMMENTARY: THE WEAPON CALLED VX 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Please pay close attention to the following chronology. It has
not been presented fully before, and means as much to the future as
to the past. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In the first week of May, U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq
informed the Saddam government that they were going to remove from
the country remnants of Iraqi war shells they had found in a
destruction pit. They wanted the shells examined in a weapons
laboratory in America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shells were discovered before Saddam Hussein had shut down
all inspection on Nov. 13, 1997. On Feb. 23, 1998, Saddam Hussein
and Secretary- General Kofi Annan signed a memorandum in which Iraq
promised full cooperation with the inspectors. No penalties were
imposed on Iraq for throwing inspectors out and creating months of
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   2. Iraq fought the removal. Through Russia and U.N. officials
around Annan it brought pressure against the inspection commission
headed by Richard Butler of Australia.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Toward the end of May, the inspectors succeeded in removing
the shell remnants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. On June 13, Butler, in Baghdad, let Iraq know that the
laboratory examinations had shown the presence of VX, a poison gas
that can kill in minutes with a few drops. For the seven years of
the U.N. hunt for Iraqi chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,
Iraq swore it had never had any VX or planned for any. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. On the morning of June 24, Butler reported the VX findings to
a closed meeting of the Security Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. That afternoon, Prakash Shah spoke to the Council. He is the
Indian that Annan appointed to the new post of his representative
in Baghdad. He praised Iraq's cooperation. His speech did not even
mention VX.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shah said that the Annan-Saddam memorandum meant that ``despite
the historical baggage of suspicion and mistrust, it is necessary
to look to the future'' and to avoid military force in the region _
``at all costs.'' He did not say that the U.N. is handling Iraq
under Article 42 of Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter. The article
allows U.N. military action to ``permit or restore'' international
peace and security.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. The same day, Annan said the U.N. was dealing with Iraq on
many issues. He hoped ``this particular development'' about VX
would not destroy the ``improved relations'' with Iraq. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. Since then the inspection team has told Iraq that its lack of
cooperation is blocking full weaponry information and verification,
on which the end of sanctions or inspection rests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9. Some top officials around Annan began supporting Iraqi
complaints against the inspectors and saying the time had come to
lift sanctions and inspections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington says it is against removing sanctions until
inspectors get total Iraqi cooperation and verification. But U.S.
influence about Iraq is at an all-time low. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans in Washington blame Bill Richardson, the U.S.
delegate _ particularly those who do not want him to be Al Gore's
vice presidential candidate. But public and private evidence is
against them. Butler for instance says Richardson has talked
straight and consistently worked to help the inspectors and their
mission.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But no delegate serving this administration could prevent U.S.
influence from sinking in the U.N. Security Council, given
Clinton's failure to act against Saddam for breaking the inspection
and massacring Iraqi dissidents and nullifying
congressional-ordered sanctions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 15-member Council are fed up with Clintonian
policy that means they lose Iraqi's trade while Saddam gains more
power. That includes three of the five permanent members endowed
with the veto _ China and Russia, Clinton's newest allies, and
France, America's oldest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., still backed by Britain, could veto lifting of
sanctions. Every diplomat knows that countries panting for Saddam's
contracts could defy an American veto without fear of important
consequences from Washington.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chronology reveals Iraq's intense determination to conceal
deadly poison-gas weapons. It also reveals the struggle within U.N.
officialdom for and against covering up for Saddam. It involves the
safety of all of Iraq's present and future targets _ military or
terrorist.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it shows that although the inspectors need the U.S., the
U.S. needs them even more.

US TO BEGIN TOUGH NEW ANTI-DRUG AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House is trading the frying egg that is
``your brain on drugs'' for the frying pan, with a set of new TV
ads that include a teenager smashing her kitchen with a skillet _ a
visual metaphor for the destruction caused by heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 billion advertising blitz, billed as the largest and most
ambitious effort ever to teach teenagers about drugs, is part of a
five-year, anti-drug media campaign announced Thursday in Atlanta
by President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the most expensive. The campaign marks the first time
the federal government is paying directly for media exposure. The
ads are bolder, brasher, and more hip, but will they work? The
president believes the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads were designed to knock America upside the head and
get America's attention and empower all of you who are trying to do
the right thing,'' Clinton told an Atlanta audience of mostly
children.
</P>
<P>
   Whether surfing the Internet, reading the newspaper or listening
to the radio, Americans will be bombarded with the ads, which began
running last night and reached an estimated 40 million people. The
campaign is targeted at both children and parents, and the ads are
tailored to the particular market in which they appear.
</P>
<P>
   Private donations, including donated media time, are expected to
cover half the cost of the campaign. So far, Congress has
appropriated $195 million to the first year, and Gringrich promised
he would fight to get the remaining funding from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to reach out to every young American and say,
`Don't do it,' '' said Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Drug surveys consistently have shown that drug use has risen
among 8th, 10th and 12th graders, at the same time the perception
that drugs were dangerous or harmful has dropped. Drug use among
youths, especially among middle-schoolers, has been rising steadily
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The White House-sponsored ads are intended to restore both the
stigma and the perception of harmfulness to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   However, sociologists and drug researchers have questioned the
efficacy of such campaigns in the past. They say it takes more than
a media blitz to addresss a social problem as large and complex as
drug abuse. Others raise the prospect that the government may be
throwing money at a serious problem without solid research to back
up the spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem is that there have been no evaluations of
the Partnership for a Drug-Free America ad campaigns in the past,''
said Scott Ehlers, a spokesperson for the Drug Policy Foundation,
which is dedicated to promoting drug-policy reforms and is partly
funded by George Soros, who supports the use of medical marijuana.
``We're embarking on this $1 billion campaign with taxpayers
dollars and we don't know the effectiveness of these ads.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said the White House already has seen positive
results from a 12-city pilot project of the media campaign that
began earlier this year. Calls to local and national drug hot lines
increased dramatically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One television add that will air features a teenage girl sitting
on her bed hugging a stuffed rabbit. Suddenly her room is deluged
with water pouring through the door. Swept up in the flood, she
fights to breathe as a voice says, ``There's this thing going
around called sniffing. You think you're getting high, but the
dizzy, fuzzy feeling is just what happens when your brain doesn't
get oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad features a teenager smashing an egg _ and then
destroying her kitchen _ with a frying pan. ``This is what happens
to your brain after snorting heroin,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads are different from commercials,'' explained a
staffer of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
``Ad agencies get instant feedback. They see Nikes moving off the
shelf, or not. We're trying to change attitudes, and the first step
is awareness, seeing the ads.''

GUNMAN WHO KILLED BORDER AGENTS, 2 OTHERS BURIED IN QUIET CEREMONY 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ Beneath spreading ebony trees, Ernest L.
Moore was buried Thursday morning in a quiet country cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   A hymn was sung and a prayer recited as family members and about
100 mourners gathered around Moore's steel casket. But when the
brief graveside service was over, there were still few answers for
why a young man from a well-respected law enforcement family would
resort to violence after his girlfriend left him. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``They are good people,'' Bill Elliot, a spokesman for Valley
Baptist Hospital in nearby Harlingen, said of Moore's family. ``You
just never can tell what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. George Morrison asked mourners, who included many
police officers, to show compassion to the Moore family, saying,
``Even when we don't understand it, even when we ask why, Jesus
says, `My peace I give you. Let not your heart be troubled.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 25, the son of a veteran Harlingen police detective and
brother of a San Benito police officer, had raced past the same
graveyard early Tuesday. He had just fled a home in nearby Rio
Hondo where he had killed two and left his romantic rival for dead,
after a botched attempt to abduct his former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He fell in a hail of bullets outside his parent's home a short
time later, but not before killing two U.S. Border Patrol agents
and wounding a deputy sheriff trying to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio said he could not confirm
published reports indicating Moore had cocaine and marijuana in his
system at the time of the killings. But the sheriff did say Moore's
friends told him they had been drinking with Moore within hours of
his early-morning rampage. A toxicology report had not yet been
received by his office, Lucio said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, will
attend services Friday morning in San Antonio for Border Patrol
agent trainee Ricardo Guillermo Salinas, 24, and then fly to
Harlingen for the funeral of Susan Lynn Rodriguez, 28, the first
female Border Patrol agent to be killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, funeral services for Margarita Flores, 53, and her
daughter, Delia Morin, 31, will be held in San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   The two women were killed when Moore entered their home shortly
after 5 a.m. Tuesday, looking for Julie Cox, his former girlfriend.
He also seriously wounded Dan Morin, 22, who had been dating Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who was staying at the Morin home at the time, was not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Morin, who was shot twice in the back during the incident,
remained in critical condition Thursday at Valley Baptist.
Sheriff's deputy Raul Rodriguez, who also was wounded, was awake
and talking Thursday, the hospital spokesman said.

lift sanctions and inspections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington says it is against removing sanctions until
inspectors get total Iraqi cooperation and verification. But U.S.
influence about Iraq is at an all-time low. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans in Washington blame Bill Richardson, the U.S.
delegate _ particularly those who do not want him to be Al Gore's
vice presidential candidate. But public and private evidence is
against them. Butler for instance says Richardson has talked
straight and consistently worked to help the inspectors and their
mission.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But no delegate serving this administration could prevent U.S.
influence from sinking in the U.N. Security Council, given
Clinton's failure to act against Saddam for breaking the inspection
and massacring Iraqi dissidents and nullifying
congressional-ordered sanctions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 15-member Council are fed up with Clintonian
policy that means they lose Iraqi's trade while Saddam gains more
power. That includes three of the five permanent members endowed
with the veto _ China and Russia, Clinton's newest allies, and
France, America's oldest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States, still backed by Britain, could veto lifting
of sanctions. Every diplomat knows that countries panting for
Saddam's contracts could defy an American veto without fear of
important consequences from Washington.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chronology reveals Iraq's intense determination to conceal
deadly poison-gas weapons. It also reveals the struggle within U.N.
officialdom for and against covering up for Saddam. It involves the
safety of all of Iraq's present and future targets _ military or
terrorist.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it shows that although the inspectors need the United
States, the United States needs them even more.

MINDING THE CHILDREN WHILE ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Minn., Iowa)   (For release Sunday, July 12)  
 (JT)  
 By JULIA LAWLOR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Rebecca Teiken left town on a four-day business
trip, her 5-year-old son, Spencer, was cared for by a sitter. Ms.
Teiken made sure Spencer had his favorite blanket and stuffed
animals, called him every night to chat and counted the hours until
she would see him again.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that didn't trouble her was the cost of Spencer's
overnight care. Her employer, Amoco, reimburses workers for
dependent care _ to a maximum of $1,500 a year _ when they travel
overnight on business and there is no other family member at home
to care for a child or, in some cases, an elderly relative. As a
single parent who travels often, Ms. Teiken says the policy allows
her to pursue a career she loves without sacrificing peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I travel, this is one less thing I have to worry about,''
said Ms. Teiken, 40, a project manager for Amoco in Des Moines,
Iowa. In her area of the country, Ms. Teiken pays about $50 a day
for overnight care. ``I know I can pay the caregiver well,'' she
said, ``and that reduces the stress on me, so I can focus on the
work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amoco is one of a relatively small number of companies offering
such benefits to employees who must travel as part of their jobs.
The Families and Work Institute, a research firm in New York, has
found that 6 percent of companies with 100 or more employees
reimburse child-care expenses when workers travel on business.
</P>
<P>
   In a global economy, travel has become a fact of life for more
and more workers. In 1996, the most recent data show, 42.9 million
Americans traveled on business, a 21 percent increase from 1991,
according to the Travel Industry Association of America. One in
five employees regularly takes overnight business trips, according
to a 1997 study by the Families and Work Institute. What's more,
the workplace is increasingly populated by single parents _ almost
one of every five employed parents is single, the study indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many companies that offer such a child-care benefit say
that relatively few workers take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't use it that often,'' said Bonnie Anderson, vice
president of employee relations for American Express Financial
Advisors in Minneapolis. Ms. Anderson, 49, a single mother who
travels once or twice a month for her job, usually arranges for her
parents or close friends to care for her daughter, Sashi, 10, when
she cannot be there.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally a backup plan can fall through, and she must
pay for overnight care. About a year and a half ago, just before a
trip to California, Ms. Anderson wound up hiring her daughter's
regular day-care provider to care for her for two nights, and the
$50 extra cost was reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a huge economic benefit for me, but what I like
about it is that the company wants to do the right thing,'' said
Ms. Anderson, who lives in Robbinsdale, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco, based in Chicago, began its program in 1993 as it started
to see an increase in employee travel. Roughly 160 people used the
benefit last year, out of a total of 28,000 employees in the United
States, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to help employees meet the balance between work and
their personal lives,'' said Patricia Massucci, Amoco's director of
corporate policies and work-life strategies. &QL;
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some employees, however, may question whether such a policy
helps employees lead a more satisfying personal life, or simply
keeps them on the job and away from home longer.
</P>
<P>
   Employers should consider ways to structure their work so that
travel is not always necessary, said Karol L. Rose, leader of the
work-life effectiveness practice for PwC HR Solutions, a benefits
consulting unit of Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLC, the accounting
giant. A sales call might be made just as easily through a video
conference, for instance, as through a face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This benefit is fine as far as it goes,'' Ms. Rose said. ``But
there should be lots of options. Having the company pay for your
dependent care when you're traveling is not the solution, but it
may come in handy.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One business that is rethinking its expectations for employee
travel is HR Solutions' parent. ``In general, we're looking at ways
of doing for travel what has been done for child care,'' said Iris
Goldfein, vice chairman of human resources at Pricewaterhouse
Coopers. ``We can't take travel out of our business, but we can
make it easier for people.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm is testing a program in its Philadelphia office to
reimburse workers for dependent-care costs incurred while
traveling. For the last year, a new policy in its management
consulting division dictates that employees do not travel on
Sundays. The firm is also considering whether to limit travel on
Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain and simple, we are trying to get people more time with
their families,'' Ms. Goldfein said. Reimbursing workers for
child-care costs, she said, is one way of recognizing ``that travel
is an additional burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance in
Boston and HBO, the premium cable division of Time Warner,
reimburse child-care expenses when employees are out of town only
if their jobs do not normally require travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not appropriate for a salesperson whose job is to
travel three days a week,'' said Shelley Fischel, vice president of
human resources and administration at HBO. ``If you have to go to a
conference once a year, you'd qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers also reimburse child-care costs if a worker's
business travel necessitates additional child care during evenings
or on weekends. Mark Majors, 34, a Chevron engineer in Pascagoula,
Miss., was reimbursed a total of $500 last year for evening child
care when he had to travel overnight and his wife, Kim, a
pharmacist, worked late hours.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Carter, 35, a lawyer for Dorsey &AMP; Whitney in Minneapolis,
is reimbursed between $500 and $700 a year when he travels to cover
the times he and his wife must hire a baby sitter, at $9 an hour,
to watch their four children, all under age 7. Though Carter's
wife, Dede, is a stay-at-home mom, she has volunteer commitments
that keep her away from home on nights and weekends; her husband is
often called out of town at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   In two of her last three jobs, Cynthia Ahart, 41, now a
marketing executive for a computer trade publication, has been
reimbursed for all or part of the child-care expenses incurred
because of her travel. A single mother of a 13-year-old daughter,
Alexandra, Ms. Ahart says she travels 30 percent of the time and
has spent as much as $150 a night for child care. One week-long
trip to a conference cost her $1,200, with less than half of it
reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to travel and being visible is critical,'' said Ms.
Ahart, a resident of Newton, Mass., who will soon be transferring
to her hometown of San Francisco. ``I hate leaving her alone, but
I've been able to triple my income in five years. Much of what I do
is sales-related. You have to be face-to-face with people.
Management has to have the impression you're willing to go the
extra mile for the client.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting one job, Ms. Ahart negotiated partial payment
of her child-care bills while on the road despite the fact that the
company did not have such a policy. Still, the strain of traveling
has made her want to cut back. After she moves to San Francisco,
Ms. Ahart plans to leave her daughter with her parents or
ex-husband when she has to travel _ and to be at home more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that she's a teen-ager, it's important for me to be
there,'' Ms. Ahart said. ``My next demand, instead of asking for
more money, will be to ask for less travel.''

FORMER AU PAIR DEFAULTS ON WRONGFUL DEATH DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former British au pair Louise Woodward has allowed the
deadline to pass for contesting the wrongful death suit filed
against her by the parents of eight-month-old Matthew Eappen, the
infant fatallly injured while in her care.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's failure to challenge the suit within 20 days of its
filing means that, under court rules, she has waived her right to a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodward does not seek a special dispensation for more time
to file a response, Judge William G. Young will declare her
responsible for the child's death and determine how much she should
pay the Eappens in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Legal specialists speculated Thursday that Woodward is not
contesting the suit either because she lacks funds for a lawyer,
believes a defense would be fruitless, or is confident that any
judgment against her would be uncollectable in England.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' lawyer, Fredric L. Ellis, said Woodward's lack of a
defense is tantamount to admitting responsibility for Matthew's
death. He said he is unsure how much money he will request in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Collins, a close friend of the Woodward family in England,
said Thursday that the 20-year-old former au pair continues to
disclaim any responsibility for the child's death, and views the
default as ``a purely legal technicality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just going to ride it out because she hasn't got enough
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins also said Woodward would not respond to the Eappens's
contention that her default is an admission of guilt, saying it was
merely a ``sensational'' statement on their lawyer's part.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward returned home to England last month after the Supreme
Judicial Court upheld her manslaughter conviction and 279-day
sentence in the Newton, Mass. boy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's English solicitor, Paul Barrow of Liverpool, also
said Woodward is abandoning her civil defense for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got no money,'' Barrow said. ``It's as simple as that.
There's no hidden agenda. There's no other reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Woodward would represent herself in future legal
proceedings, Barrow said: ``I can't discuss a client's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather that fight the case in the United States, Woodward may
decide to concentrate on opposing efforts to collect a judgment
from a US court in England, legal observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, the Eappens's attorney, Thursday insisted that ``there
was no clear answer'' to whether any award would be collectable in
England.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Miller, a member of Parliment from Woodward's
hometown of Elton, said, ``A judgment may be made against her but
it's unenforceable. She's not in the US and she's not under their
jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis is hopeful. He asked Young to schedule a hearing Oct.
5 to assess damages against Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ellis said, he will seek to determine the
extent of Woodward's assets, including whether she has signed any
book or movie deals.
</P>
<P>
   He said the purpose of the suit is to prevent Woodward from
profiting from Matthew's death. The Eappens have said that any
award that is recovered will be donated to a foundation they set up
to fight child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But getting information from Woodward in England may be
difficult. To do so, Ellis would have to seek her deposition
through a complicated procedure set out under The Hague convention
dealing with international law.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and her parents have long insisted that her story was
not for sale. She said she has turned down six-figure offers, and
proclaimed, ``I have no intention of profiting from this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But last month the Daily Mail, a British tabloid, admitted it
had paid Woodward's parents $60,000 for an interview last November.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to England, Woodward's most highly publicized
interview was with the BBC, for which she was not paid.
</P>
<P>
   Young has already frozen Woodward's assets in the United States
so that any money would be available to pay an award. He issued an
injunciton last month that prohibits her from spending any money
she gets for her story.

SENATE PASSES COMPROMISE BILL TO OVERHAUL IRS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a
compromise bill designed to implement sweeping changes at the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now moves to President Clinton, who is expected to sign
it into law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 96-2 Thursday to adopt an IRS restructuring
plan that lawmakers hope will provide taxpayers with greater
protections while reining in potential abuses at the nation's
tax-gathering agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, hailed passage of the bill, saying ``it's not only good
for the American taxpayer, but it's good for the agency itself and
it's good for the employees who work there.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth chaired two rounds of dramatic Senate hearings on alleged
IRS abuses, events that helped create a groundswell of support for
the IRS overhaul bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who has been working for the last three
years on an effort to restructure the much-despised agency, said
the legislation will ensure ``that every American taxpayer will be
able to file their taxes easier, will receive better service from
the IRS and will have legal recourse if they are mistreated or
wrongly confronted by the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote came less than two weeks after the House
approved the compromise plan by a vote of 402-8.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, whose administration initially resisted
lawmakers' efforts to revamp the agency, said Thursday: ``I am
pleased that the Senate has finally passed bipartisan legislation
to reform the IRS and strengthen taxpayer rights. ... I look
forward to signing it into law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton characterized the bill as a tool he will use in his own
program to improve the agency. ``This reform will help my effort to
create an IRS that respects American taxpayers and respects their
values,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Among a host of provisions aimed at arming taxpayers with
broader rights when in a dispute with the IRS, the bill would shift
the burden of proof from the individual to the government when an
individual's case lands in tax court. For his part, the taxpayer
would still have to demonstrate a willingness to provide the
necessary tax records to decide the case.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring plan, hammered out by House and Senate
negotiators during a conference committee last month, would create
a nine-member, independent oversight board to keep an eye on the
agency's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would provide new protections for an ``innocent
spouse,'' typically a divorced woman who finds herself the target
of an IRS action because of tax cheating by a now-missing, former
spouse.
</P>
<P>
   It would bar the IRS from assessing penalties and interest if
the agency failed to contact the taxpayer within 18 months after
filing a return. And it would extend a guarantee of confidentiality
similar to the attorney-client privilege to certified public
accountants and other tax preparers involved in non-criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic senators who voted against the compromise
plan, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota, both cited a provision that shaves benefits
for veterans _ not the IRS issues _ as the main reason for their
objections to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee and a leader of the IRS restructuring effort in the
House, said the overhaul bill is ``about our values and our
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about right and wrong,'' Archer said in a written
statement Thursday. ``It's about putting the taxpayer first and the
IRS second. It's about fundamental fairness and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides instituting changes at the IRS, the bill also includes a
$2 billion capital gains provision inserted by Archer, the House's
chief tax writer.
</P>
<P>
   That item would roll back from 18 months to a year the amount of
time an investor must hold onto a stock or other investment in
order to receive more favorable tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which had insisted on increasing the capital
gains holding time during negotiations on last year's tax cut plan,
has said it will not oppose the IRS bill because of that one issue.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS bill also includes a highly controversial provision that
grants a $200,000 tax credit to individuals inheriting estates
worth $17.2 million or more. Wealthy heirs received that hefty tax
break because of what numerous administration and congressional
sources described as a technical error in last year's tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Archer opposed administration efforts to revise that
provision, arguing that such a change now would amount to a tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the bill, which is expected to cost the government
$13 billion over 10 years, lawmakers have decided to change the
rules governing who can convert an individual retirement account
into the new, more flexible Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes will raise money to pay for the bill in the first
few years, since IRA holders must pay taxes when transferring their
funds to a Roth IRA. But critics complain that provision will end
up costing the government billions of dollars in the long run.

BOY KILLED, SISTER INJURED IN HOME INVASION

<P>
   A 7-year-old boy was killed and his 3-year-old sister injured
early Thursday by masked men who broke into their Windsor, Conn.,
home and held their mother hostage, according to the children's
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Police called to the home at 2:30 a.m. found Jarrell and Lindsey
Cuyler with their throats slashed.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was pronounced dead at the scene. The girl was listed in
stable condition at Hartford Hospital Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the attack did not appear to be random, but they
had no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor Police Captain Peter McDermott said the children's
mother, Tammi Cuyler, 30, spent about seven hours at the poilice
station Thursday and had been ``very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said the house and neighborhood were still being
searched for evidence late Thursday, but so far ``we really haven't
uncovered anything significant that leads us anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody at this point is a suspect,'' said McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they did not anticipate making any arrests last
night.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mother told her mother, Karen Armstrong of
Bloomfield, that she heard a noise at one of the doors in the house
and investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Two masked men then entered the home and, while one held Cuyler
down, the other went into the children's bedroom, said Armstrong,
the children's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyler heard her son Jarrell say, ``What are you doing?'' and
then she heard Lindsey scream, Armstrong said Cuyler told her.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyler said she then began to scream and stuggle with the man
holding her and the men left at that time, the grandmother said.
She also said her daughter told her she had ripped away a glove and
a watch from one of the attackers as he fled.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyler's 18-month-old nephew was also in the house, but he was
not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyler is a supervisor at the state Department of Children and
Families. Her husband and the father of Jarrell and Lindsey, Arnold
Cuyler of Bristol, is a banker. They are seperated.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuylers had lived at their Lovell Avenue home about a year,
said Jeannette Canuel, who lives next door to the Cuylers. Canuel
said she woke up to go to the bathroom about 2 a.m. Thursday, but
did not hear anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Although Canuel, 83, said she did not talk to Cuyler often, she
thought she was a good mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell she loved those kids,'' said Canuel. ``I would
never think anything wrong of her.''

UNION ORGANIZATION DRIVE EXPOSES FLAWS IN NATION'S LABOR LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.) (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Five years ago, the workers at Avondale shipyard
voted to join a union, with hundreds of them cheering wildly
outside the company's headquarters along the Mississippi when the
vote count was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is still no union at the shipyard. The 50,000 pages
of documents _ furious charges and countercharges _ stacked in the
offices of the National Labor Relations Board are evidence of what
took place instead: one of the longest, most heavily litigated
unionization fights in the board's history. At a time when labor
unions nationwide are stepping up efforts to organize millions of
workers, labor leaders and even some government officials point to
the Avondale battle as proof that the nation's labor laws are
cumbersome and replete with loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   National union leaders assert that the laws encourage Avondale
and other companies to dismiss union supporters and use other
illegal tactics to beat back organizing drives because it can take
five years or more before the courts order an employer to accept a
union. By that time, some organizing efforts have died.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, acknowledging the problem, say scores of
cases are caught up in this legal limbo, as companies file appeal
after appeal. These include Overnite Trucking, which is fighting a
Teamsters' organizing drive at its terminals nationwide, and the
Santa Fe Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, which has litigated for
five years against a hotel workers' election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many Avondale workers say they desperately need a union to raise
wages at the lowest-paying major shipyard in the nation and to end
Avondale's unusually high rate of fatal accidents. According to the
union, at least 29 workers have died in accidents since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   These unhappy factors, the workers say, explain why they voted
1,954 to 1,632 in June 1993 to join the New Orleans Metal Trades
Council, notwithstanding Avondale's intense anti-union campaign.
The labor board officially certified the Metal Trades Council as
the union for the Avondale workers, which would normally bring
negotiations for a labor contract. Instead, Avondale refused to
recognize the union or bargain with it and began its appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process to put a union in takes too long,'' said Harry Lee
Thompson, a pipefitter who began working at Avondale in 1969, after
returning from Vietnam. ``Five years is too much. It's a slap in
the face of the working man.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Feinstein, the labor board's general counsel, said the
Avondale case had exposed many weak links in the system. He
acknowledged that the mountain of papers and months of hearings had
taxed the board's staff to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to take issue with the notion that it's frustrating
that an election that took place five years ago still hasn't come
to conclusion,'' Feinstein said. ``It's something we're looking at
as an example of the process not being what it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Avondale case, a judge with the National Labor Relations
Board found that in the company's zeal to keep the union out, it
had violated the law more than 70 times, dismissing, for example,
28 workers because they supported the union. Even though those
workers were dismissed four or more years ago, none of them have
been reinstated because Avondale is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Defending its lengthy legal maneuvering, Avondale Industries,
the nation's largest nonunion shipbulder, asserts that the vote for
the union was tainted by fraud. Avondale, which beat back
organizing drives in decades past, insists that unionization would
hurt it by pushing up production costs and causing it to lose
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a new campaign to show that stubborn employers can
make a mockery out of the right to organize, the AFL-CIO is
pointing to Avondale as the nation's leading corporate outlaw for
the way it has kept unionization efforts at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avondale struggle is important because it's a group of
workers who have tried so hard for so long to form a union, and
they've had everything thrown in their way,'' said John Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO. ``We're seeing the rule of labor law
becoming the rule of hypocrisy _ corporations that pretend to be
upstanding citizens and live off taxpayer money violate fundamental
laws that are supposed to protect workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Avondale workers point to what they view as an unfortunate
contradiction. Officials from one federal agency _ the labor board
_ found Avondale guilty of ``egregious misconduct'' and ``an
outrageous and pervasive number'' of labor law violations. Yet
those at another federal department _ the Navy _ recently awarded
Avondale a $685 million contract to build amphibious assault craft,
with the possibility of $5 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Avondale workers often say they need a union to get fair wages
and fair treatment at the shipyard, which looks like a giant
erector set in the shadow of the Huey P. Long Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Wages range from $8 an hour for the least-skilled workers
($16,600 a year) to $13.50 an hour ($28,000 a year) for welders and
pipefitters, including those with 25 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ingalls shipyard in neighboring Mississippi, the top pay
rate is $2 an hour higher, while at the Bath Iron Works
shipbuilding concern in Maine, top pay is $3.50 more, or 26 percent
higher. Both are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale's pensions are also low. Retirees with 30 years'
experience often receive $300 a month. And many workers complain
that they cannot afford Avondale's family health insurance, which
costs them almost $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another big worry is safety. According to the most recent
federal statistics, 12 Avondale workers died in accidents from 1982
to 1994, often from falls or having large pieces of metal crash
down on them. That's twice the number at the shipyards with the
second largest number of deaths, Tampa Bay Ship Building, in
Florida, and National Steel and Shipbuilding, in San Diego. And
Avondale's death toll is more e than double the number at its
larger competitors, Ingalls and Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale officials say they have improved their record, noting
that there have been no deaths since 1994. In a statement,
Avondale, the largest private employer in the New Orleans region,
said it has ``an excellent safety record relative to the rest of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Pyburn Jr., an Avondale lawyer, maintained that the labor
board's tortoise-like pace, and not the shipbuilder, had caused the
years of delay. Repeated appeals are justified, he said, because
the company believes that the labor board failed to properly
oversee the election and that the unionization vote was fraudulent
for numerous reasons, including that some voters failed to show
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Many union supporters argue that the labor board needs to act
faster and that unions should be installed quickly after winning an
election, just as political candidates are. If the labor board or
courts overturn the election, national union officials say, then
the union should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   For many workers, the dispute is not about abstruse legal
issues, but bread-and-butter ones. Avondale, the home of the
shipyard, and other communities around the port are hardly
prosperous, with the area replete with dilapidated one-story houses
and aging pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Pyburn defended Avondale's wage levels, saying they are the
highest of any shipyard in the area. But many Avondale workers say
they have relatives at nearby shipyards who earn more than
Avondale's top rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sweatshop, with such low wages,'' said Mike Boudreaux,
a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a labor board judge found that Avondale intimidated
employees so systematically that he ordered an unusual remedy. In
addition to reinstating illegally dismissed workers, the judge,
David Evans, ordered Avondale's chairman, Albert L. Bossier Jr., to
read a statement _ or stand alongside a board official who read a
statement _ to the shipyard's 5,300 workers, cataloguing its labor
law violations and pledging to end such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Evans ruled that Avondale had sought to suppress the union by
punishing dozens of workers because they supported the union.
Federal labor law bars managers from retaliating against union
supporters. Evans found that Avondale had acted illegally in
discharging the 28 pro-union workers, suspending 5 others, issuing
18 warning notices, denying benefits to 8 employees and assigning
``onerous'' work to 8 others.
</P>
<P>
   Pyburn said the workers were disciplined for valid reasons, like
leaving work stations without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal labor law, administrative law judges make the
initial decisions in labor dispute, and those decisions can then be
appealed to the full labor board and after that to a U.S. Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the labor board rules against Avondale on its appeal
regarding the dismissals and discipline, the shipyard could appeal
to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where it has already
appealed the ruling upholding the election. The company can also
appeal to the Supreme Court. These appeals could take at least
another year, meaning that workers dismissed in 1993 might not have
a chance at reinstatement until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, union supporters nationwide say it is fruitless to
look to the labor board and courts for redress. Instead, many
Avondale workers are rallying behind a campaign that aims to
pressure Avondale to recognize the union. They are demonstrating
outside the shipyard, getting dozens of clergymen to denounce
Avondale and urging the Navy to take a tougher stance toward
Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the Vietnam War veteran, said: ``A foreman once said
to me, `Why are you passing out handbills for the union? You're one
of the top-paid people and you're going to retire soon.' I said,
`Maybe one day my son or relative will want to come out here. I
want them to get a fair shake on wages and benefits. I want them to
be treated better than I'm treated.' If someone doesn't stand up
for something, then where will we be?''

BURKETT, RANGERS DOWN ATHLETICS, 4-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Warren Spahn and Johnny Sain do not pitch for
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spahn and Sain and pray for rain'' might have been a snappy
slogan for the 1948 pennant-winning Boston Braves. But 50 years
later, the Rangers found out in the first half they won't win
anything with only Rick Helling and Aaron Sele pitching well.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need more. They need what John Burkett gave them
yesterday and they need to win games like they did yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett stopped the Oakland Athletics on one run through eight
innings before the Rangers broke through with three in the ninth
for a 4-1 victory yesterday at Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to win a low-scoring ballgame,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``We've won a lot of games when we scored a lot
of runs, but we haven't won too many where our pitcher pitched well
and the other pitcher pitched well. We need to win games like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who was 4-9 with a 5.95 earned-run average in the first
half, out-dueled Oakland starter Kenny Rogers, who also allowed
only one run _ a homer by Mike Simms _ through eight innings. The
Rangers scored three in the ninth against Oakland reliever Billy
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and Darren Oliver are a big part of our season,'' Oates
said. ``You hope Aaron Sele and Rick Helling keep pitching the way
they have, but they're going to need some help. John Burkett could
be one of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would prefer it be Burkett and Oliver, rather than
have general manager Doug Melvin give up valuable minor-league
prospects for Reds pitcher Pete Harnisch or somebody else. But
Burkett was 0-4 with a 5.14 ERA in his past five start before
yesterday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My location was really good today,'' Burkett said. ``I've had
a couple of good games lately, but today I was able to piece
together the best parts of my game. I used my fastball a lot, which
is a pretty good sign. When I'm able to establish my fastball and
get it low, that usually means I'm going to have a pretty good
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett got one break in the first inning after Rickey Henderson
led off with a single. Bip Roberts followed with a blistering line
drive, but right at first baseman Will Clark, who caught it and
stepped on the bag to double off Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett got another break in the sixth when Henderson, after a
run-scoring single, tried to steal third base with two outs and was
thrown out by catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to steal third with two outs usually goes against
baseball common sense, especially with an All-Star like Ben Grieve
at the plate. But Henderson said he believed he had the Rangers'
signs. He expected Burkett to throw a changeup, instead the Rangers
had changed the signs and Burkett threw a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready,'' Rodriguez said. ``You've got to pay attention
to the runners all of the time, and he's a good runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Burkett: ``With Pudge behind the plate, most of the time
I'm hoping they run. Rickey Henderson is no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Burkett was in control, holding the Athletics
to four hits. He did not walk a batter and struck out five. But the
effort was almost wasted until the ninth, when Tom Goodwin's
pinch-hit single led the way to a three-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely the way to start the second half,'' Clark
said. ``Get a well-pitched ballgame and find a way to win late in
the game.''

YOUNG PARENTS SENTENCED IN DEATH OF NEWBORN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Denouncing Amy Grossberg as an egocentric
indifferent to the value of the life of her newborn son, a Delaware
judge sentenced her Thursday to 30 months in prison for
contributing to the baby's death in November 1996. Minutes later,
Judge Henry duPont Ridgely issued a far gentler scolding to Miss
Grossberg's co-defendant and former high school sweetheart, Brian
Peterson, and gave him a two-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to receiving the longer sentence, Miss Grossberg was
depicted by two Delaware prosecutors as the principal culprit in
the death and portrayed in a far harsher light than Peterson during
an emotional three-hour court session in Delaware Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Grossberg sobbed as she pleaded for leniency, telling the
judge she accepted full blame for the death: ``I'll never be able
to forgive myself for what has happened. It's something I'll never
be able to forget.'' She cried again as guards led her away to
prison, a day before her 20th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson listened to Miss Grossberg's appeal in tears, but later
regained his composure in a 10-second statement to the judge. ``All
I can say is I'm sorry for what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Grossberg's lawyer, Robert Tanenbaum, renewed old arguments
that the baby was still-born and the fractures in his head did not
contribute to the death. The infant was found in a Dumpster behind
a motel in Newark, Del. Prosecutors argued insisted that the
fractures were a cause of death. But they conceded they could not
prove that the fractures had been deliberately inflicted, or who
had caused them.
</P>
<P>
   This helped explain why they retreated from their
headline-grabbing talk of late 1996 about seeking the death penalty
against the Wyckoff, N.J., couple and allowed them to plead guilty
to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the denunciations of Miss Grossberg for hiding her
pregnancy, the hearing included new disclosures about futile
appeals by Peterson to convince Miss Grossberg to get either
medical help or an abortion in the weeks before their fateful trip
to the motel near Miss Grossberg's dormitory on Nov. 12, 1996. In
addition, he urged her to go to a hospital instead of the motel,
his lawyer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Peter Letang called Miss Grossberg
cavalier and self-absorbed in her refusal to tell her parents or
friends about the pregnancy and her threats to commit suicide if
Peterson violated her secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy Grossberg sacrificed that baby to hide the truth,'' Letang
told Ridgely. ``Her secret was more important to her than the life
of that child. Grossberg did not want this baby.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his argument, Letang quoted in open court from
four letters Miss Grossberg wrote Peterson at the start of their
freshman years in college nearly two years ago. In one, the
prosecutor said, she wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is for it to go away.'' The ``it,'' Letang said,
referred to the fetus. Some of the letters carried what Letang
described as the salutation, ``Baby Dumps.''
</P>
<P>
   The other prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General Paul Wallace,
called her cold-hearted and cruel and said she feared disclosure of
the pregnancy would lead to loss of both her parents' respect and
her years of college at the University of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the threat she saw in her own son,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the prosecutors depicted Peterson, now 20
years old, as enraptured with his girlfriend and loyal to her and
her demand for silence. Letang characterized Peterson's attitude as
both chivalrous and stupid.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal to the judge to give Peterson a more lenient
sentence, partly for cooperating with investigators after pleading
guilty last March, Letang noted that Peterson had urged Miss
Grossberg to seek prenatal care or an abortion, and to go to a
hospital instead of the motel.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Letang said, Peterson acquiesced in Miss
Grossberg's insistence on keeping the pregnancy secret. Letang told
Ridgely he once asked Peterson why he did not tell her parents
about the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   He said Peterson told him he did not want to violate Miss
Grossberg's trust. He quoted the youth as saying, ``It's not my
body, it's her body.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanenbaum argued in court that Miss Grossberg suffered a seizure
during childbirth and thought the baby was born dead. He denounced
the prosecutors for ``unfairly attempting to demonize and
dehumanize her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanenbaum said his client had planned to inform her parents of
the pregnancy during the Thanksgiving recess. He insisted she did
not know she was pregnant until August 1996. Prosecutors said,
however, that Peterson knew in April or May. Tanenbaum did not
explain what Miss Grossberg planned to do after informing her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference after sentencing, Tanenbaum called the
case tragic and insisted again that his client had no intention of
ever harming the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she rejected Peterson's appeals to go to a hospital,
Tanenbaum said: ``The kids panicked. They made a mistake and that's
why she pleaded. She should have gone to a hospital. Isn't it nice
to have hindsight? Keep in mind, she was an 18-year-old and made a
mistake and she's paying the price for the rest of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Miss Grossberg's lawyers, John Malik, pointed out
that both teens were involved. ``They each had opportunities at
different times to stop this. They didn't exercise good judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Malik said she should have told her parents, a rabbi, a friend,
or a counselor about the pregnancy. Asked why she chose not to, he
said, ``She put a premium on being the perfect daughter and she
thought this would be a disappointment to her family.''
</P>
<P>
   In their defense of Peterson, his lawyers, Jack Litman and
Russell Gioiella said he broke the law by not seeking medical help
for the baby after the birth or getting independent verification of
his belief the child was born dead. They also said he exercised bad
judgment by not driving to a hospital instead of the motel before
the birth.
</P>
<P>
   Gioiella said his client ``succumbed to her desire to control,''
adding, ``His feeling for Amy overwhelmed his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgely was succinct in his sentencing rulings. He said both
came from exemplary families and had excellent backgrounds prior to
the birth.
</P>
<P>
   Of Miss Grossberg, the judge said, ``If there's a disturbing
aspect to your character, an unsettling trait as the time of
childbirth neared, it was an egocentricity that blinded you to the
need to seek help and to the intrinsic value of the life of the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he told Peterson he considered his remorse sincere and
praised him for urging Miss Grossberg to seek prenatal counseling.
But, he criticized Peterson for not revealing Miss Grossberg's
pregnancy. In addition, the judge said, ``As this child's father,
you should have protected him from an unassisted birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The two faced a maximum of 10 years each on their manslaughter
pleas.
</P>
<P>
   After sentencing Miss Grossberg to 30 months and Peterson to 24,
he gave her credit for 64 days already served in jail and him 61
days. He also imposed 5 years of probation on Miss Grossberg and 2
on Peterson. Both must also perform 300 hours of community service
after prison, including working in clinics for pregnant teen-agers
and counseling teens on parenthood.

U.S. CALLS FOR SHARP LIMITS ON WORLD CRIMINAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Canada, Germany)  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The United States set out new conditions Thursday for
taking part in an international criminal court, calling for sharp
limits on its scope and authority.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has long made clear its opposition to an independent
tribunal with broad powers to investigate war crimes suspects
across the globe. But for the first time since the 161-nation
conference began here on June 15, the United States specified where
it stood on the limits of the court's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The United States said it could agree to the court only if its
automatic jurisdiction were limited to genocide, which it views as
the worst outrage. And the American delegation insisted that the
court should have automatic jurisdiction only if the suspect's
country signed the treaty setting up the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Washington opposed automatic jurisdiction for crimes against
humanity or such war crimes as rape and torture. For these, under
the American proposal, the court could bring charges only in those
countries that grant jurisdiction, by opting to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statement underscored how strongly the United States
opposes the kind of court sought by human rights groups and many
democratic allies, and points out how the battle lines will be
drawn as the U.N. conference moves into its final and most
contentious week.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's primary objection is that American soldiers might
be vulnerable to politically motivated charges. The Pentagon
worries that American soldiers who unwittingly kill civilians
during a peacekeeping operation could find themselves facing
charges of crimes against humanity before a court packed with Iraqi
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statement made many delegates conclude that they may
end up designing a court that would be rejected by the world's
largest superpower. In explaining Washington's position, David
Scheffer, head of the American delegation, said: ``Automatic
jurisdiction over all of the core crimes might satisfy the most
optimistic requirements of theory. But it is a recipe for limited
participation in the court, and in the result, an ineffective
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We constantly have troops serving abroad on humanitarian
missions, rescue operations or missions to destroy weapons of mass
destruction. Someone out there isn't going to like it, but we are
the ones who do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups argue that by seeking 100 percent protection
of its citizens, the United States is granting immunity to some of
the world's most loathsome dictators and war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the American concern, but the loopholes it is
creating to protect American citizens are the same ones that would
allow rogue countries to shield themselves,'' said Jelena Pejic,
head of a delegation from the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights'
here.
</P>
<P>
   The American effort to limit the court's jurisdiction has
support from key partners in the U.N. Security Council, like France
and Russia, but it was deeply discouraging to many Western allies
who have been battling for a powerful and independent court.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 countries, including Britain, Canada and Germany,
oppose the U.S. position and insist that the court should have
broad powers to prosecute crimes against humanity and war crimes,
even against suspects whose countries have not signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much political prestige has been invested in creating a
truly independent court,'' a Western European delegate said. ``It
will be slim and weak without the United States, but I see no
further room for negotiation whatsoever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States, however, is gambling that as the conference
reaches its end on July 17, many countries will bend rather than
draft a treaty that the United States and other powerful nations
refuse to sign. ``They have a court within their grasp,'' Scheffer
said. ``But they must be reasonable about the limitations of this
court.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If they seek to extend the court's jurisdiction over
states that have not signed the treaty, they will generate an
enormous amount of conflict in international relations.''
</P>
<P>
   There already is an enormous amount of conflict at the
conference. The United States entered the negotiations arguing that
the U.N. Security Council should have primary responsibility for
initiating any investigation by the court's prosecutors. That would
be a permanent version of the Security Council-sponsored ad hoc
tribunals that are now trying accused war criminals from the
Balkans and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of nations vehemently oppose that position, arguing that
the prosecutor should have authority to bring cases without the
Security Council's consent. Many Third World countries, which see a
neocolonial bent at the Security Council, also oppose giving it so
prominent a role.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations lost that battle. In a discussion paper
earlier this week, the conference's organizing committee omitted
the American option of assigning the Security Council primary
responsibility for initiating cases. Instead, the document offered
a watered-down version preferred by a majority at the conference,
allowing the Security Council to intervene and postpone a trial for
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accepted that defeat, but moved to tighten the
conditions in which the court can operate. In most crimes, the
United States would require the court to secure the consent of a
suspected war criminal's country. Human rights groups argue that
state-consent provisions are tantamount to giving President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq a veto over his own trial, but the United States
says it is the only way to win widespread cooperation for such a
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   In the American proposal, if the court wanted to try a suspect
for genocide, and the suspect's state refused to cooperate, further
action would require that the Security Council override that
country's objections. But any permanent member could veto the
Security Council's intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also recommended that countries that sign the
treaty be allowed to choose whether they permit the court to
prosecute war crimes or crimes against humanity against one of
their citizens; this is known as an opt-in choice. Many Arab and
nonaligned states support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is more desirable in the early years of the
court to bring in as many states into its jurisdiction as
possible,'' Scheffer argued. ``Far too many countries would not
sign up unless there was such a provision.'' Others countries are
dismissive. ``The treaty is not a Chinese banquet,'' said Elizabeth
Wilmshurst, deputy leader of the British delegation. ``If you
become a party, then you must accept the court's jurisdiction in
all core crimes.''

DIVER'S BODY RECOVERED FROM ANDREA DORIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mich.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A veteran diver was found dead Thursday, floating face down 200
feet below the surface in the first-class bar lounge of the rotting
Andrea Doria, a luxury liner that continues to lure people to death
42 years after she sank off the coast of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Roost, 46, of Ann Arbor, Mich., a sheriff's department
diver who has been searching the depths of the ocean for more than
20 years, is the latest victim to die searching the 697-foot
Italian luxury liner.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, Craig Sicola of New Jersey died shortly after
resurfacing from a dive. The cause of death: too much nitrogen in
his system. In July 1993, Robert Santulli of Long Island died
searching the wreckage. In July, 1992, a Florida diver, Mathew
Jared Lawrence, died inside the Andrea Doria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This incident is another tragic example of the dangers
associated with recreational deep water diving,'' said Rear Admiral
Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Roost had chartered The Seeker, a commerical diving boat out of
Montauk, Long Island. From the boat, Roost dove into the shimmering
waters just before noon Wednesday _ a challenging dive Roost wanted
to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   At about 200 feet the water is darker than night. When Roost
failed to return to decompress from being under heavy water
pressure, about two hours later, the crew of the Seeker became
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only stay in the water, at that depth, about 20
minutes,'' said Lt. Junior Grade Craig Jaramillo, assistant
operations officer of the Coast Guard Group at Woods Hole. Swimming
to the surface of the water would take Andrea Doria explorers about
an hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard searched the area with Jayhawk helicopters
Wednesday night and Thursday morning, hoping he was alive, floating
on the choppy waters. When they didn't find him, it became clear
that Roost had died.
</P>
<P>
   Seeker diving crews found Roost on their seventh dive search at
about 1:30 p.m. Thursday, and headed to Montauk, to bring his body
to a Long Island medical examiner for an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo said the cause of death is unclear. Roost had not
gotten tangled or trapped inside the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Roost had wanted for some time to conquer the shipwreck, said
Mike Graczyk, general manager of the Divers Inc. store in Novi,
Mich. Roost had owned that store and another, Divers Inc. in Ann
Arbor, for the last 16 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of his goal dives. That's the dive that he wanted
to do,'' Graczyk said in a telephone interview.

FORMER AU PAIR DEFAULTS ON WRONGFUL DEATH DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former British au pair Louise Woodward has allowed the
deadline to pass for contesting the wrongful death suit filed
against her by the parents of eight-month-old Matthew Eappen, the
infant fatallly injured while in her care.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's failure to challenge the suit within 20 days of its
filing means that, under court rules, she has waived her right to a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodward does not seek a special dispensation for more time
to file a response, Judge William G. Young will declare her
responsible for the child's death and determine how much she should
pay the Eappens in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Legal specialists speculated Thursday that Woodward is not
contesting the suit either because she lacks funds for a lawyer,
believes a defense would be fruitless, or is confident that any
judgment against her would be uncollectable in England.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' lawyer, Fredric L. Ellis, said Woodward's lack of a
defense is tantamount to admitting responsibility for Matthew's
death. He said he is unsure how much money he will request in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Collins, a close friend of the Woodward family in England,
said Thursday that the 20-year-old former au pair continues to
disclaim any responsibility for the child's death, and views the
default as ``a purely legal technicality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just going to ride it out because she hasn't got enough
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins also said Woodward would not respond to the Eappens's
contention that her default is an admission of guilt, saying it was
merely a ``sensational'' statement on their lawyer's part.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward returned home to England last month after the Supreme
Judicial Court upheld her manslaughter conviction and 279-day
sentence in the Newton, Mass. boy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's English solicitor, Paul Barrow of Liverpool, also
said Woodward is abandoning her civil defense for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got no money,'' Barrow said. ``It's as simple as that.
There's no hidden agenda. There's no other reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Woodward would represent herself in future legal
proceedings, Barrow said: ``I can't discuss a client's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather that fight the case in the United States, Woodward may
decide to concentrate on opposing efforts to collect a judgment
from a US court in England, legal observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, the Eappens's attorney, Thursday insisted that ``there
was no clear answer'' to whether any award would be collectable in
England.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Miller, a member of Parliment from Woodward's
hometown of Elton, said, ``A judgment may be made against her but
it's unenforceable. She's not in the US and she's not under their
jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis is hopeful. He asked Young to schedule a hearing Oct.
5 to assess damages against Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ellis said, he will seek to determine the
extent of Woodward's assets, including whether she has signed any
book or movie deals.
</P>
<P>
   He said the purpose of the suit is to prevent Woodward from
profiting from Matthew's death. The Eappens have said that any
award that is recovered will be donated to a foundation they set up
to fight child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But getting information from Woodward in England may be
difficult. To do so, Ellis would have to seek her deposition
through a complicated procedure set out under The Hague convention
dealing with international law.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and her parents have long insisted that her story was
not for sale. She said she has turned down six-figure offers, and
proclaimed, ``I have no intention of profiting from this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But last month the Daily Mail, a British tabloid, admitted it
had paid Woodward's parents $60,000 for an interview last November.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to England, Woodward's most highly publicized
interview was with the BBC, for which she was not paid.
</P>
<P>
   Young has already frozen Woodward's assets in the United States
so that any money would be available to pay an award. He issued an
injunciton last month that prohibits her from spending any money
she gets for her story.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO APPEAL LENIENCY RULING IN CRIMINAL CASES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department will appeal a federal court
decision that outlaws in six states the long-standing practice of
U.S. prosecutors going easy on suspects who cooperate in criminal
investigations, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled July 1 that federal
prosecutors violate U.S. law when they promise criminals and
suspects leniency if they assist in the prosecution of a case. A
unanimous three-judge panel said a federal law barring prosecutors
from giving, offering or promising ``anything of value'' in return
for testimony includes pledges of lighter prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The department maintains the decision, which applies to the
Rocky Mountains region, runs counter to both what Congress intended
and what justice requires. A prosecutor, who must often turn to
convicts and suspects for their first-hand knowledge of criminal
activity, would have difficulty getting necessary testimony if
leniency could not be offered, the agency argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously concerned about the opinion,'' Holder said.
``It goes to the way in which prosecutors at the federal, state and
local levels have conducted themselves for a good number of years.
... If the decision is read very, very broadly, it could have a
very wide-ranging impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the department will ask all 12 judges on the 10th
Circuit to review the panel's decision. The Denver-based 10th
Circuit covers Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the court threw out the drug conspiracy and
money laundering convictions of Sonya Singleton, saying federal
prosecutors illegally offered leniency to conspirator Napoleon
Douglas in return for his testimony against Singleton. The
government promised Douglas it would not prosecute him for any
other violations of federal drug law and would urge the sentencing
judge and parole board to take his cooperation into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious purpose of the government's promised actions was
to reduce his jail time, and it is difficult to imagine anything
more valuable than personal physical freedom,'' Judge Paul J. Kelly
Jr. wrote for the three-member panel. ``The government may still
make deals with accomplices for their assistance other than
testimony, and it may still put accomplices on the stand; it simply
may not attach any promise, offer or gift to their testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other judges on the panel were David M. Ebel and
Stephanie K. Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   The court's controversial decision brings into question the
convictions of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and his fellow
conspirator Terry Nichols, verdicts that were reached in large part
due to the testimony of Michael Fortier.
</P>
<P>
   Fortier, who knew of the plan to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building but failed to tell authorities, testified only
after receiving promises of leniency from federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Fortier faced a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison for
failing to tell the police, lying to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, hiding evidence and trafficking in guns, but he was
sentenced to only 12 years due to his cooperation with prosecutors.
McVeigh was sentenced to death for the April 19, 1995, bombing,
which killed 168 people. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison
for conspiracy and manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th Circuit will hear the appeals of McVeigh and Nichols,
who were convicted in the U.S. District Court in Denver. Holder
said it is difficult to predict how the decision, if upheld on
appeal, would affect the bombing verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you look at the opinion and you can see some
problems that might crop up'' for prosecutors, he said. ``But any
opinion has to be looked at in light of the specific facts of the
case that you are considering. So it's hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the Justice Department will monitor any court
motions defense attorneys might bring on behalf of their clients in
light of the 10th Circuit's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kent Schaffer of Houston, president of the Texas
Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, hailed the 10th Circuit's
decision for bringing equity to criminal trials. The appeals court
said it is no more legal for prosecutors to reward witnesses with a
lighter prison sentence than it is for defense counsel to pay
people cash for their testimony, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one commodity more precious than money is liberty,''
Schaffer added. ``Liberty is a much stronger motivating force than
money for somebody in prison.''

STAMPEDE OF PROSPECTS FOR '98 TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Starting the second half of the year, racing wears
an uncommonly rosy, healthy glow. We're talking not about the
industry but about the horses.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of keeping star horses sound, active and
marketable has been chronicled ad nauseum, so when the best-known
runners in the country stick around for more than a few months, the
phenomenon deserves to be mentioned. That, knock on wood, is what's
happening, giving fans a familiar cast of characters to argue about
as the race for Horse of the Year and division championships hits
the far turn.
</P>
<P>
   Not only new faces such as Real Quiet, Victory Gallop and Fiji
are training for big summer races, but so are the stars of 1997,
the winners of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness (Silver Charm), the
Belmont Stakes (Touch Gold), the Breeders' Cup Classic (Skip Away)
and the Horse of the Year title (Favorite Trick).
</P>
<P>
   It's only the second time in the Breeders' Cup era that the
winners of all those races have been active this late in the
following year. The other time was 10 years ago, when Alysheba
(Derby and Preakness), Bet Twice (Belmont) and Ferdinand (Classic
and Horse of the Year) were still going, although Ferdinand was on
his way to a 0-for-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the '98 Horse of the Year contenders, with
estimated odds and a campaign strategy for each:
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away (6-5): Exhausted after the Hollywood Gold Cup victory
that solidified his No. 1 ranking, he'll pass up the Aug. 15
Pacific Classic at Del Mar to concentrate on the eastern races,
beginning with the Aug. 8 Whitney at Saratoga or the Aug. 30 Iselin
at Monmouth Park. If he holds form, he'll keep winning through the
Sept. 19 Woodward and Oct. 10 Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park,
and not even a loss in the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill Downs will dissuade the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm (3-1): He beat the world in Dubai, but he must
prove his connections aren't dodging Skip Away here at home. If
he'd run in the Gold Cup, he would have been the consensus third
choice and might well have finished fourth. He'll use the July 25
San Diego at Del Mar to prep for a Pacific Classic showdown with
Gentlemen for West Coast preeminence.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet (6-1): By the width of this column, he missed the
Triple Crown, which would have guaranteed him Horse of the Year.
Because of an unspecified training setback, he'll miss the July 19
Swaps at Hollywood Park to face Victory Gallop again in the Aug. 9
Haskell at Monmouth. But forget those 3-year-old races; he'll have
to step up and beat older horses to have a shot at the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop (8-1): Handicapper Jerry Brown, founder of the
Thoro-Graph sheets, notes that the Belmont winner shows the same
speed-figures progression that Skip Away had as a 3-year-old. Brown
has a lot of company in thinking Victory Gallop will accomplish
more than Real Quiet in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold (15-1): A late start to the season could be a curse
or a blessing. His allowance comebacker at Churchill set him up for
the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji (20-1): The 4-year-old is the only distaffer in our top 10,
and she could pick up the electoral pieces if the boys beat up on
each other. But the turf filly has nowhere to run in the Breeders'
Cup, so she'll have to keep dominating races the way she did at
Santa Anita. Trainer Neil Drysdale is aiming for the Aug. 1 Ramona
at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Any 2-year-old (40-1): Favorite Trick set a high standard: A
2-year-old has to go undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bearhart (50-1): The reigning turf champion looked great
winning the Manhattan on the Belmont undercard. He'll run in the
Bowling Green at Belmont on Saturday and shoot for a repeat in the
1{-mile Breeders' Cup Turf. A rarity: Six of the seven '97
Breeders' Cup winners are still active.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen (75-1): Californians' Horse of the Year pick last
year, third in the Gold Cup won by Skip Away, needs to win a
rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick (100-1): A 3-year-old who can't go 1\ miles races
a rocky road to Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: The return of Free House, in the Bel Air Handicap
at Hollywood Park on Saturday, adds to the list of familiar faces.
The '97 Santa Anita Derby winner, an in-the-money finisher in all
three Triple Crown races, hasn't raced since the Super Derby at
Louisiana Downs in September.
</P>
<P>
   He looked sensational in a paddock schooling session Thursday
and will be favored over Wild Wonder and four others in the 1
1/16-mile Bel Air. He'll carry 124 pounds, including Chris
McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot more kind (since resuming training),'' trainer Paco
Gonzalez said. ``He used to be very tough to gallop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Hollywood Oaks will test Manistique, who is 2 for 2
after earning a huge 110 Beyer speed figure in her debut. Gary
Stevens will ride the 3-year-old daughter of Unbridled against
Princess winner Sweet and Ready and third-place Visible Slew.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: The last major race of the Hollywood Park meet,
the Swaps Stakes a week from Sunday, won't have Real Quiet but will
have Grand Slam, D. Wayne Lukas' barn announced.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam, one of the top 2-year-olds of '97, came back from a
tendon injury to win the Peter Pan and will ship west next week.
Old Trieste, Old Topper, Shot of Gold and Lord Smith are the other
Swaps probables.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion box: Hollywood Park ought to drop the hoofbeats sound
effect from its replay shows in the interest of, oh, I don't know,
not looking like complete amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   The background noise adds nothing in the way of realism, since
hoofbeats can't ordinarily be heard from the grandstand, and
certainly not when the horses are a quarter-mile away on the
backstretch. Are viewers supposed to think there are little
microphones under the rail all the way around the track?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago some wires got crossed and the hoofbeats
went out over the track's PA system _ before the race started.

TRIPP ATTORNEY CLAIMS DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATORS IN MARYLAND URGED TAPE
INQUIRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of Linda Tripp's attorneys claimed Thursday a
Maryland prosecutor yielded to political pressure in launching an
inquiry into the tapes Tripp secretly made of conversations with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Anthony Zaccagnini said Maryland prosecutor Stephen
Montanarelli told Tripp's legal team that Democratic members of the
state Legislature had ``directly contacted'' him asking ``that
Linda be investigated and prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with NBC-TV, Zaccagnini said Montanarelli's
admission ``speaks of political motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Montanarelli's office denied the claim by
Zaccagnini. ``That's absolutely untrue,'' said Gavin Patashnick.
``This office is apolitical.''
</P>
<P>
   Patashnick said the prosecutor received ``no telephone calls or
letters urging us to investigate'' whether Tripp, a resident of
Columbia, Md., violated state law when she taped 20 hours of
Lewinsky's telephone conversations without her knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes _ in which Lewinsky reportedly discusses an 18-month
sexual affair with President Clinton and his urging her to lie
under oath about the relationship _ triggered a federal grand jury
investigation that began in January under the direction of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Tripp testified for a fourth day
before that grand jury Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Lewinsky have said under oath they did not
engage in sex. Clinton has publicly denied that his relationship
with Lewinsky was sexual and said he never urged her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli announced early this week that a Maryland grand
jury was investigating whether Tripp violated a state law making it
a felony to tape record a person's conversation without that
person's knowledge. Before Tripp could be convicted, Montanarelli
would have to prove Tripp knew the taping was illegal. If found
guilty of the anti-wiretapping law, Tripp would face five years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Tripp's spokesman Philip Coughter said she would
return to the federal grand jury in Washington next week. ``Despite
the events which have recently unfolded in Maryland, I continue to
focus on my testimony before the federal grand jury,'' Tripp said
in a statement read by Coughter.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating Montanarelli's inquiry in Maryland are two grants
of immunity given Tripp in return for her cooperation before
Starr's grand jury, which is investigating whether Clinton or any
of his associates obstructed justice by trying to cover-up his
alleged sexual misbehavior with Lewinsky or Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   One of Tripp's immunity deals was worked out with Starr. The
other was signed by a federal judge who relied on a law saying no
testimony or evidence received from a witness can be used against
that witness except in cases of lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever she says at the grand jury cannot be used against
her,'' said Robert Bloom, a law professor at Boston College of Law.
At the same time, Maryland prosecutors might be able to produce
other evidence through Tripp's conversations with her book agent,
longtime Clinton-hater Lucianne Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the hard piece of proof is whether Linda Tripp knew what
she was doing was illegal,'' Bloom said. ``And that's something the
agent might have discussed with her (Tripp), whether taping the
calls was illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg told The Associated Press on Thursday that she made her
own tapes of conversations with Tripp and notified her that she was
recording their calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come and get me, coppers!'' Goldberg said from her office in
New York. ``They don't want my tapes because if they get my tapes,
they have no case.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said she told Tripp in one tape that she ``checked it
out and you're OK in Maryland'' to engage in taping phone calls.
Goldberg said that Tripp's response on the tape is ``silence'' and
that Tripp then went on to a different subject of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., granted a
request from Clinton's lawyers to not release documents in Paula
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against the president. The sworn
statements by Clinton and Lewinsky denying an affair were made as
part of the Jones case and put under seal by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was dismissed April 1, alleges that Clinton,
while he was governor of Arkansas, summoned Jones, a state
employee, to a Little Rock hotel room in 1991 and asked her for
oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled that
the Jones' case file would be made public. Clinton's lawyers
objected and Wright on Thursday said the files would remain closed
until she decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was made in a lawsuit brought by various news
organizations and journalism groups to open the case files.

PENTAGON MAY LOOK BEYOND LOCKHEED FOR ANTI-MISSILE CONTRACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Defense Department said Thursday that it would
consider finding a competitor to Lockheed Martin Corp. as the prime
contractor on the Army's trouble-plagued $15 billion anti-missile
system, a project that had been seen as the forerunner of a much
larger program to shield the entire nation from missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it decided to consider a second contractor _
and possibly, an entirely new design _ after five consecutive test
failures, the most recent in May, when an anti-missile missile
failed to hit its target over the New Mexico desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously considering this as one of our potential
alternatives _ restructuring the program,'' said Lt. Gen. Lester
Lyles of the Air Force, the director of the Pentagon's Ballistic
Missile Defense Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A second source, depending on when you do it on a program, is
not necessarily a panacea,'' he said at a news conference,
referring to an alternate contractor. ``We're examining very
closely the costs for bringing on a second source, the time it
takes to bring on a second source, whether or not you ask the
second source to do a Chinese copy _ that is, build the same
missile to print _ or to have a competing design.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision to seek an alternate contractor or another design
could delay the anti-missile system for years and would raise new
doubts about the feasibility of so-called Star Wars technology to
protect the United States from missile attack through the use of
satellites, radar and anti-missile missiles. The Pentagon is now
committed to developing such a national missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Virnell Bruce, a spokeswoman for Lockheed, the Bethesda,
Md.-based defense contractor, said that the company understood the
Pentagon's need to ``answer all the questions that are put upon
them, to have a thorough look at the alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said that ``we've put every possible corporate
resource'' at the disposal of the Defense Department ``to insure
that this is a successful program _ we're really adamant about
that. We believe in the program, and we believe it will be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army program now under scrutiny is known as Theater
High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, and it is being developed to
protect troops in the field from attack by short- and medium-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   It is supposed to be an improvement on the Patriot missile
system, which gained fame when it was used in the Persian Gulf War
in 1991 as a defense against Scud missiles fired by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has already spent more than $3.2 billion on the
THAAD program. The project is about four years behind schedule, and
there is little hope in the Defense Department that it will meet
its deadline to have the weapons ready for use by the Army in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the string of test failures, the program has been
harshly criticized in Congress, with prominent lawmakers calling on
the Defense Department to consider an alternative to Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Lyles said that the Pentagon was
negotiating with Lockheed to require the company to pay for future
test failures.
</P>
<P>
   While he said there has been no decision on the exact fine that
might be imposed on the company for each failure, Lyles said that
``if we have subsequent failures, we want them to pay a significant
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired, if you will, Lockheed Martin as our prime contractor
to pull these things together and to help us address all these
types of things,'' Lyles said. ``So there is culpability on the
part of the contractor.'' He continued: ``They have volunteered
willingness to support some aspects of the costs associated with
the THAAD missile tests, if we continue to have more failures.''
</P>
<P>
   In the failure in May, Defense Department officials said, the
anti-missile missile spun out of control because of a defect in a
booster rocket and crashed two miles from the launch pad at the
White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The test was supposed to
determine if the missile could knock down another missile while
both traveled at speeds of 11,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Lyles suggested the level of frustration in the Defense
Department with the program when he noted that in each of the five
tests, a different component had failed _ proof that no one repair
or redesign would end the problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Pentagon had abandoned plans to stage another test
next month. ``After looking at where we are in the failure analysis
and looking at some of the questions that still need to be
answered, I don't think we're going to be able to make this
summer,'' he said. ``We are looking at the fall time frame.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Apple's new widens range of peripherals
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The iMac, Apple Computer Inc.'s ballyhooed economy
computer, represents a big step toward the mainstream of personal
computing for the company that prides itself on making computers
for an elite minority, industry experts said Thursday at the
Macworld Expo.
</P>
<P>
   That step is the connection for devices such as printers,
scanners and joysticks, which are known as peripherals. In using
just the Universal Serial Bus, the iMac will be able to connect to
a much wider range of peripherals than previous Macintosh models.
</P>
<P>
   By abandoning proprietary connections such as its Apple Desktop
Bus and Macintosh modem and printer ports, and switching to the USB
technology, Apple essentially allows iMac owners to buy
off-the-shelf peripherals that are made for machines from IBM, Dell
Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. The USB, technology is one
of three commonly used connections throughout the much larger
IBM-compatible industry. The others are parallel ports and serial
bus ports. USB also replaces Apple's proprietary connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``USB is an emerging industry standard,'' Apple's interim chief
executive Steve Jobs told an audience of about 3,000 Mac users
Wednesday at Macworld Expo in the Jacob Javits Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of peripherals will be available for the Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that in the future all Macs will accommodate
only the USB technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of software titles available for those PCs, the
peripherals do not readily work on the Macintosh operating system.
The system incompatability and Apple's tiny 4 percent share of the
computer market have drastically limited the choices of software
and hardware available to Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of the switch to USB connections, that hardware
incompatibility vanishes with a relatively simple software change
that allows the equipment and the Mac operating system to talk to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that accommodates a non-specific Mac interconnect is
an improvement for Mac users,'' said Steve Dube of Wasserstein &AMP;
Pirella in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dube also disagreed with a manager from one of Apple's key
peripheral suppliers, who said Thursday that Jobs' has taken a
major gamble by limiting iMac to only one type of connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think USB is not a wild bet for Apple,'' he said. ``That's
probably going to be a standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Apple depends on hardware companies to invest the money
on programming that will let their products work with Macintosh
machines. Mindful of that, Apple brought a dozen or so of them
together Thursday in the Jacob Javits Convention Center to talk
about their products.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few months warning about Apple's plans for USB,
Hewlett-Packard Co. rushed into production a chip-carrying adapter
so iMac customers can use any of five HP 670C- or 690C-series
Deskjet printers when the computer is shipped in the middle of
August.
</P>
<P>
   Those printers cost $199 to $249. The $79 adapter is a cable
connection between the iMac USB port and the printers' serial port,
but HP will put USB connections directly on future printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a transition product,'' said Hugh Amick of HP. ``We plan
to come up with a printer that provides out-of-the-box
connectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more talked about peripheral products at the
semi-annual Macintosh show is the SuperDisk from Imation.
</P>
<P>
   Built for the iMac and selling for $179, SuperDisk is a
floppy-disk drive with a USB connection. Imation, an Oakdale,
Minn., company that was spun off from 3M a few years ago, has high
hopes for the product because Apple's iMac has no floppy disk
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding it cut costs on the iMac, which at $1,299 already is
priced well above sub-$1,000 entry-level products from Compaq, HP
and others. Apple also justified the decision by noting that floppy
discs traditionally have been used to back up files and to transfer
work between computers.

 &HT;    Clinton thanks firefighters during visit
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Weary firefighters got a hearty thanks
Thursday from President Clinton, and another day of decent weather
further eased the drought-stricken state's wildfire crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important that every American knows with the
summer movies out that the real American heroes aren't up in space
fighting asteroids but are here in Florida fighting fires,''
Clinton said, drawing roaring applause from about 700 firefighters
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent the morning in Atlanta promoting a new
anti-drug campaign, was scheduled to attend a fund-raiser Thursday
night at the home of actor Sylvester Stallone in Miami before
returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even as fire officials heard the praise from Clinton, they
warned that the crisis hasn't ended. Although predicted brisk west
winds did not materialize Thursday to fan the flames and most of
the blazes in the hardest-hit counties are under control, only
sustained rains will end the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is still too dry,'' Gov. Lawton Chiles told the
gathering, which took place in a tent at Daytona International
Speedway, where the fires caused the July Fourth Pepsi 400 stock
car race to be postponed. ``Florida is better off than we were four
days ago, but we need to keep praying for rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Memorial Day, fires in all 67 Florida counties have burned
nearly 500,000 acres, destroying 350 homes and other structures and
doing $276 million in damage. Firefighting and other emergency
relief efforts have cost $104 million so far, according to Florida
Division of Emergency Management officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Volusia County one week after the crisis
peaked. Last Thursday, three major fires threatened to encircle
homes and businesses in most of Flagler County, prompting worried
officials to order an unprecedented evacuation of the entire county
_ some 45,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were not allowed back into their homes until Monday,
with hundreds of people packing shelters at high schools and
churches in surrounding counties while thousands stayed with
family, friends or at motels.
</P>
<P>
   The fires extinguished most fireworks across the state for July
4, with Chiles banning all personal use of the devices and most
cities and counties canceling their shows out of respect for the
beleaguered firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 firefighters have battled the blazes, many from other
states _ including the Atlanta metro area.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced by Palm Coast firefighter Randy Holmes,
who helped save the home of Karen Terry, who also spoke at the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very fast-moving fire,'' Holmes said. ``It created
very intense heat and very thick smoke. We went from house to
house, fighting each time like it was our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry's home survived, although flames charred her grass up to
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to thank you,'' she said. ``Our fence is down, our
shed is down, but our house is still standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who met with some people who lost homes before making
his speech, said he got daily briefings on the blazes during his
recent trip to China, and was even asked by Chinese officials about
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every report I got, someone told me that the greatest
concern was for the firefighters, who wouldn't eat and wouldn't
sleep because they were so obsessed with saving every home,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Chiles passed on a message that Daytona Beach
officials begged them to express: Much of the state, including
Volusia County, is now free of smoke and any other serious
immediate effects from the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona hoteliers and tourist businesses have lost millions due
to the postponement of the stock car race, which kept an estimated
250,000 free-spending tourists away during what would've been the
beach town's biggest summer weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling the White House and asking what they can
do,'' Clinton said. ``If you haven't taken your vacation yet, one
thing you can do is come down here and give these people an
economic boost. They've gotten the fires under control.''

 &HT;    Clinton launches anti-drug campaign
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton spent a busy half-day stop Thursday in
Atlanta, first kicking off a national anti-drug campaign and later
helping raise money for a Democratic Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke about drugs to a crowd of about 700, most of them
children from the metro area, at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   After the drug speech, Clinton appeared at a fund-raising
luncheon for Michael Coles, a Democrat who is challenging incumbent
U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   At the anti-drug event, Clinton related a story about how his
brother, Roger, ``nearly died from a cocaine habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ``There's somebody like my brother back at your
school. He's a good kid, just a little lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The $195 million ad campaign, which has been tested in Atlanta
and 11 other markets, debuted nationally Thursday night on the four
major television networks. Unlike previous anti-drug campaigns,
this one will have a budget for paid broadcast time and print
space.

   ``These ads are designed to knock Americans in the head and get
their attention and empower you to do the right thing,'' the
president told the children in the audience. ``America's mounting a
new and sweeping effort to change the attitude of an entire
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The debut ads ``will reach 40 million Americans, including
millions and millions of children,'' Clinton said. ``They get the
message across that drugs are wrong, illegal and can kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Clinton at the World Congress Center were Health
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala; Attorney General Janet
Reno; House Speaker Newt Gingrich; Gov. Zell Miller; and Atlanta
Mayor Bill Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before President Clinton, Gingrich related a story
about a 19-year-old acquaintance who had a ``synthetic drug''
slipped into her drink at a party. She was rushed to a hospital
where she lapsed into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just celebrated her 21st birthday,'' said Gingrich, ``and
she's still in a coma.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced by Kim Willis, a 13-year-old from Erie,
Pa., who's involved in drug-prevention at her school. She said, ``I
don't want to see my classmates ruin their lives through drugs.''
After leaving Atlanta, Clinton flew to Daytona Beach, Fla.,
Thursday where he thanked firefighters for saving homes from
wildfires burning across the state.

 &HT;    Delta unit adds flights in Orlando
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Delta Air Lines is expanding its Florida-based
low-fare unit for the second time this year by adding new routes
between Orlando and four cities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Delta's discount rival, AirTran, released sharply
improved ridership figures for June and said it expects
second-quarter earnings to exceed analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Atlanta-based Delta said the expansion of Delta
Express reflects the continued success of the unit, which was
launched in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Delta Express does not serve Atlanta, it is becoming an
important element in its strategy. Delta derives more than 20
percent of its revenue in Florida, and it created the Express unit
to offset low-fare competitors including AirTran, Southwest
Airlines and Metrojet, a similar unit begun by US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The new flights will connect Orlando with Albany, Buffalo,
Rochester and Syracuse, starting Oct. 1. Three of those routes are
being abandoned by AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   The latest additions will boost Delta Express' route system to
22 cities, up from 10 when the operation began.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Delta is ending service from Toledo, Ohio, and Fort
Wayne, Ind., this fall, continuing a withdrawal from smaller
markets that can be served by commuter affiliates so that large
jets can be used on longer routes. Other cities being cut from
Delta's route map include Idaho Falls, Idaho; Fresno, Calif.; and
Jackson Hole, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran's parent, Orlando-based AirTran Holdings, said June
traffic rose 43 percent from a year earlier, while capacity was up
32 percent. The company said its two airline units, Orlando-based
AirTran Airways and AirTran Airlines, which flies mainly from
Atlanta, filled 62.9 percent of their seats in the month, adding
that the Atlanta operation's load factor increased more than nine
points.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Holdings also said it expects second-quarter earnings to
exceed analysts' expectations of 10 cents per share. The results
would mark AirTran's first profitable quarter since its
predecessor, ValuJet, was temporarily grounded in 1996 after the
crash of Flight 592.

 &HT;    SunTrust Banks beats earnings expectations
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- SunTrust Banks, one of the first major Southeastern
institutions to report earnings, set the hurdle high, tallying a 12
percent gain in second-quarter net income. The earnings per share
gain was higher _ 14.3 percent _ because stock buybacks reduced the
number of shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another solid SunTrust quarter,'' said R. Harold
Schroeder of Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``SunTrust is a model of consistency,'' said Jefferson Harralson
of Robinson-Humphrey. The Atlanta banking company's earnings of 88
cents per share vs. 77 cents in the quarter ending June 30, 1997,
was a penny ahead of 19 analysts' consensus expectations, according
to the First Call service. Net income was $185 million, compared
with $165.4 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results were attributable to a $94.3 million, 13.3
percent, surge in revenue. The bulk of that stemmed from a $68.8
million increase _ or 30.2 percent _ in non-interest income.
</P>
<P>
   Net charge-offs in the quarter were $29.4 million, while the
provision for possible loan losses was $33.5 million. Schroeder
said slight increases in charge-offs and the loan loss provision
were in line with loan growth.
</P>
<P>
   Measures of profitability remain high, with return on assets
coming in at 1.32 percent and return on common equity at 21.88
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, it cost SunTrust Banks about 60.2 cents to bring in a
dollar's worth of revenue, a relatively high figure compared with
its peers, which have costs close to 55 cents per dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Also, non-interense increased 16.8 percent in the quarter
to $482.8 million. Much of the increase came from personnel
expenses, which rose from $235.3 million in last year's second
quarter to $279.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Banks spokesman James C. Armstrong ascribed the
increased non-interest expenses to ``commissions based on fee
income,'' but he added that ``we're replacing everyone's PC and
preparing for the year 2000.'' For the six months, net income was
$365.9 million, or $1.73 a share, vs. $326.5 million, or $1.51 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Total assets were $61.4 billion at quarter's end, up from $55.5
billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks generally were down, and SunTrust was no exception.

 &HT;    Tribute in stone: Britain honors King
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was honored Thursday
with a stone sculpture unveiled at London's Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   King was one of 10 Christian martyrs of the 20th century whose
limestone statues were chosen to fill niches above the Great West
Door to the 900-year-old church. The family of the slain civil
rights leader and Baptist preacher said Thursday the honor proves
his message of love and forgiveness has outlived his assassination
30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly honors his belief of serving humanity,'' said
King's younger son, Dexter Scott King. ``It shows that his message
and his legacy are still as powerful today because they're still
bestowing these honors on him and people are still gaining insight
into his message.''
</P>
<P>
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, was unable to attend because
of a scheduling conflict, her son said in Atlanta. Queen Elizabeth
II and Prince Philip joined Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey
for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The other nine Christian martyrs honored Thursday are:
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Romero, the Roman Catholic archbishop of El Salvador
assassinated in 1980; Grand Duchess Elizabeth of Russia, a saint of
the Orthodox Church killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918; Maximilian
Kolbe of Poland, a Franciscan friar and Catholic saint killed by
the Nazis in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor and theologian
killed in 1945 by the Nazis; Wang Zhiming, a Chinese pastor and
evangelist killed in 1972 during the Cultural Revolution; Esther
John, a Presbyterian evangelist in Pakistan, was killed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Anglicans honored were Manche Masemola, a 16-year-old convert in
South Africa killed by her parents in 1928; Lucian Tapiedi, killed
in 1942 during the Japanese invasion of Papua New Guinea; and
Janani Luwum, a Ugandan archbishop assassinated in 1977 during the
dictatorship of Idi Amin.

 &HT;    Atlanta has been increasingly hospitable to NAACP
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The last time the NAACP came to Atlanta, blacks were
not allowed in most of the city's hotels. Black patrons were turned
away from downtown restaurants. The Ku Klux Klan picketed against
the convention delegates. A different Atlanta awaits the NAACP as
it prepares to meet in the city beginning Saturday, said R.L.
White, president of the Atlanta NAACP branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as (segregation is) concerned, there's been a total
change,'' White said. ``We emphasize now that prejudice is more
subtle. You find it in corporations and boardrooms. Equal
opportunity is the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jordan, lawyer and former NAACP Georgia field director,
recalled that his major task in 1962 was finding housing for the
delegation because most hotels were not open to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2,000 delegates stayed at the Atlanta University
Center, and the Freedom Fund Dinner was held in the Morehouse
College gymnasium, he said. Nobel Prize-winner Ralph Bunche had to
stay at the home of Morehouse President Benjamin Mays because he
could not get a room in the city's hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still an exciting time,'' Jordan said. ``It was
negative that the downtown hotels were not open to us but that
didn't make it a negative experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the convention was ``spirited'' and that delegates
believed attitudes across the nation were changing. ``The civil
rights movement was in full swing and the smell of victory was in
the air,'' he said. ``The sense was that achievement was possible
and within reach. ``
</P>
<P>
   The city was more desegregated in 1962 than it had been when the
NAACP last met in Atlanta in 1951, when 1,700 delegates attended.
Hotels were segregated in 1951 and entertainer Josephine Baker
cancelled a benefit performance after she was refused
accommodations in three major hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were encouraged by keynote speaker Roy Wilkins, former
NAACP assistant executive secretary, to use their voting power to
eliminate segregation. Other speakers included Bunche, educator
Mary McLeod Bethune and Phillip Wilkie, an Indiana legislator. By
1962, most theaters, restaurants, high schools and parks had been
desegregated and Vernon Jordan said it was important to the NAACP
to host the convention in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was in the South, it was only logical that it be in
Atlanta,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Casper Jordan, no relation to Vernon, is a now-retired Clark
Atlanta University librarian. But as a student in 1962, he said, he
didn't feel the ``full brunt'' of the discrimination delegates
faced during the convention, but he appreciated the hospitality the
city's leaders showed the NAACP. Then Mayor Ivan Allen officially
welcomed the group, and the NAACP was able to use city facilities
during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were used to bad treatment, so any good treatment at all
made it nicer,'' said Casper Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Voter registration, employment discrimination, school
desegregation, housing and urban renewal and the role of direct
action through boycotts, sit-ins and picketing in the civil rights
movement were among the issues discussed at the 1962 convention. In
a speech to the group, the Rev.. Martin Luther King Jr., encouraged
the use of nonviolent direct action as a ``logical sister'' to
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of direct action as a topic of discussion
represented a significant change in the NAACP's strategy for
fighting discrimination, said Professor Charles E. Jones, chairman
of the Afro-American Studies program at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made the NAACP so dominant was that they decided to fight
racist institutions not through direct action, but through the
courts,'' Jones said, calling the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education
decision outlawing school segregation the organization's ``crowning
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the organization has been trying in recent years to
``redefine and recreate'' the influence it had at the height of the
civil rights movement. In the absence of blanket segregation, he
said the organization lacks a rallying cause. However, Jones said
he is encouraged by the NAACP's present direction and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   `` It is good that the organization is dealing with such '90s
issues as the plight of black farmers and tapping into the youth.''

 &HT;    It's worth a shot
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Christina Contreras has always hated shots. But since
she was diagnosed with diabetes in 1996, she's had to check her
insulin level with needles at least four times a day.
</P>
<P>
   It was a routine with which the 26-year-old Alpharetta resident
stoically lived until she got to participate in clinical studies of
a new technique, called ``micro-poration,'' that uses a laser to
pierce the top level of skin.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the process was painless. And Contreras became an avid
supporter of researchers' quest to develop ways to inject medicine
through the skin without the use of traditional needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' she said. ``I didn't mind doing the checks any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   From the development of ``micro-needles'' to a laser punch used
by Contreras, several techniques _ some pioneered in Georgia _ are
showing promise in making it easier for patients to get the drugs
they need with a lower risk of pain and infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a bit of interest in this right now,'' said Dr.
John Ansel, a dermatology professor at the Emory University School
of Medicine and chief of dermatology at the Atlanta Veterans
Administration Medical Center. ``A lot of drugs can't be given
orally, and this (the new developments) might be a way to
administer medication without patients writhing in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, doctors have used distractions and numbing creams to
ease the pain of shots. At Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center,
child life specialists are often called in to do play therapy with
children to turn their attention away from shots. And both Scottish
Rite and Egleston Children's Hospital use a cream called Emla to
numb children's skin.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, researchers are approaching the issue of pain from
a radical new perspective. Perhaps the needle could be discarded in
even more cases, replaced with lasers, ultrasound or electrical
currents.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, for
example, presented a prototype last month at a national symposium
that they say could accomplish the goals. The product, which looks
like a nicotine patch, is comprised of a strip of hundreds of
cone-shaped needles too small to see with the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like putting a piece of tape on your skin,'' said
Ansel, who recently tried the device at another presentation. ``It
didn't hurt at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating an effective, pain-free way to administer drugs would
be a boon to many patients _ especially those with chronic
diseases. Those suffering from diabetes, like Contreras, would no
longer have to take insulin shots, but instead could rely on a
strip to control their blood sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be very user-friendly,'' said Dr. Mark Prausnitz,
assistant professor in Georgia Tech's School of Chemical
Engineering. ``Instead of constantly having to inject themselves,
they could depend on something that's about the size of a square
inch.''
</P>
<P>
   The product could use a microprocessor to control a pump that
would allow the device to be programmed to deliver drugs at optimal
levels. The pump could be controlled by a doctor or a patient, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Prausnitz is the only researcher who has presented the
microneedles for review, he said he's aware that a handful of other
organizations are experimenting with similar needles.
</P>
<P>
   The field is also exploring a host of other techniques to
administer medication or draw fluids needed for standard tests.
Some companies, for example, are using electrical currents to drive
the drugs into the skin.
</P>
<P>
   And SpectRx, a Norcross company, specializes in the use of laser
technology to develop non-invasive tests. Already, it has marketed
a light test for infant jaundice overseas _ eliminating the painful
heel stick now used in hospitals. And it is conducting clinical
trials for a screening device for diabetics that involves shining a
blue light into the lens of the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It also is experimenting with microporation, which involves
shooting or ``punching'' a laser the diameter of a human hair into
the skin. Contreras was part of the group that participated in its
early research and development studies.
</P>
<P>
   The laser is powerful enough to extract fluids to gauge levels
of blood sugar and other substances, according to Bill Wells,
SpectRx's director of communications. And that means there's no
need for blood to be drawn in the traditional fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found a way to break the barrier without causing
pain,'' he said. ``We believe this might be a very good discovery
that not only allows non-invasive testing, but potentially could
enhance drug delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to why these new devices don't cause pain is because
they cross the outer layer of skin _ called the stratum corneum _
but don't strike nerve endings. In the case of the microneedles,
they act like little tunnels that go through the stratum corneum
and then release the drugs where they can be easily absorbed by
capillaries and carried into the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   But the stratum corneum is designed to keep out outside
elements, such as bacteria, and is resistent to such invasions. In
response, it could develop allergies or inflammation to deter
transdermal patches or other devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skin is designed to keep things out,'' Ansel said. ``And
the challenge researchers face is to get around this wonderful,
evolved wrapper we have.''
</P>
<P>
   There are technical and business issues as well.
</P>
<P>
   With the microneedles, researchers are still studying how to
design them so they don't break. Currently, they're being made out
of silicon _ the same material used for computer chips _ but
Prausnitz said he believes a different material should be used.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the university would not be marketing the device. Instead,
Prausnitz said, a drug company would have to become intrigued
enough with the product to run it through its regulatory paces and
market it. That could take a while or could stall the entire
project.
</P>
<P>
   And at SpectRx, microporation probably will not be available
until 2000, Wells said, because of the rigorous clinical trials
required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no matter what systems eventually make it to
doctors' offices in the new millineum, big, bad needles will
probably never disappear entirely. Sometimes, researchers say,
they're the only and best way to get the right drug to the right
part of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the conventional way is still the easiest and
safest way,'' said Prausnitz. ``But for us, the focus is (to) come
up with several good alternatives.''

 &HT;    WellPoint Health Networks acquires Georgia insurer, creating a
windfall
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For four years, Leonard Schaeffer of WellPoint Health
Networks has longed for a major stake in Georgia's health insurance
market. On Thursday, Schaeffer got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia and WellPoint announced a
deal under which WellPoint would acquire Georgia's largest health
insurer for about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic opportunity to become part of what's the
best, largest and fastest-growing HMO in the state,'' said
Schaeffer, WellPoint chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was attractive, he said, because of its booming economy,
good regulatory environment and growing appetite for managed care.
</P>
<P>
   And WellPoint, with a Blue Cross connection, was a perfect fit,
said Richard Shirk, Blue Cross of Georgia chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Shirk said the deal would provide capital to expand the
insurer's investment in information technology, increasing its
capacity to analyze medical data.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also would create big individual financial winners,
from some policyholders to a group of private investors. A number
of executives and employees will share a $28 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint already covers 100,000 Georgians through its preferred
provider organization, under the UniCare label. Solidly profitable
and fast growing, WellPoint is known for its innovative insurance
offerings, especially for individuals and small employers. It has
6.7 million managed-care members overall, most of them in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer also said WellPoint emphasizes consumer choice of
managed care plans. ``We don't believe that every American is going
to wind up in an HMO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the deal came one day after Blue Cross announced
a settlement of a lawsuit by consumer groups, which challenged the
company's 1996 conversion to a for-profit company. The settlement
clearly paved the way for the merger, which requires the approval
of regulators, Blue Cross shareholders and Georgia Insurance
Commissioner John Oxendine. The deal is expected to close in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Under the transaction, the companies said, Blue Cross will
continue to be headquartered in Atlanta and will keep marketing its
insurance products in Georgia under its current name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the second most-recognized brand (name) in Georgia,
behind Coca-Cola,'' Schaeffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Winners in the deal include the 70,000 Blue Cross policyholders
who received _ at no cost _ five shares of stock in Cerulean, Blue
Cross' parent company, at the time of the conversion. These
policyholders, who had bought Blue Cross insurance as individuals
or as part of groups that aren't self-insured, will get stock or
cash valued at about $4,000 per shareholder. They will get a
choice, subject to an aggregate limit, once the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   The charitable foundation Blue Cross created under the lawsuit
settlement would have an initial worth of about $80 million, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, several consumer groups filed suit in Fulton
County Superior Court over what they called an unconstitutional
transfer of Blue Cross' assets in the for-profit conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer groups have gotten something _ that's to their
credit,'' said Judith Bell of Consumers Union in California, who
tracks Blue Cross conversions nationally. Nevertheless, she said
the entire value of Blue Cross should have been transferred to the
public trust when the company switched to a for-profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislators and regulators had the responsibility and
power, and didn't exercise either,'' Bell said. ``The Georgia
public is still out $420 million. And that's not chump change.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the merger rewards the private investors who sunk
almost $50 million into Cerulean during the conversion. The
investors would get stock in WellPoint, a return that Shirk said
would amount to about 34 percent on annualized basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly an incredible deal for the (private) investors,''
Bell said. ``Anyone would take that return.''
</P>
<P>
   And 260 Blue Cross management and non-management employees will
share a total cash bonus of $28 million. The average payout is
$97,000. The highest, $3.8 million, goes to Shirk.
</P>
<P>
   The WellPoint-Blue Cross deal continued the sweeping
consolidation among health insurers, sparked by the growth of
managed care and its pressure to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``WellPoint and Blue Cross now will have more negotiating
ability with employers,'' said Brent Layton of Atlanta consulting
firm Layton &AMP; Associates. The merger, he said, ``probably
restructures health care from state line to state line.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross has 1.7 million policyholders in its medical plans.
It earned $4.4 million on revenues of $1.5 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under the transaction, Blue Cross will become an operating
company under WellPoint. Possible management changes, if any, would
come when the integration of the companies is complete.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint has spread out from California in the last two years,
having recently picked up the health care business of John Hancock
and Massachusetts Mutual. ``They have been very aggressively
expanding, trying to make themselves into a true national player,''
said Dave Norton of consulting firm Towers Perrin.
</P>
<P>
   But its Blue Cross roots stem from California, where its managed
care business is operated as Blue Cross of California. In 1996,
WellPoint and Blue Cross of California merged into a
stockholder-owned company. As a result, charitable foundations
worth $3.2 billion were created.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came before the stock market opened Thursday.
WellPoint shares closed at $71.06 1/4, up $1.43 3/4 in New York
Stock Exchange trading.

PANEL CITES RISKS OF INFECTIONS FROM FOOD ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Humans can contract antibiotic-resistant infections
from animals used for food, a National Academy of Science panel
said Thursday, but the public health risks of these transmissions
through eating meat or poultry or by being in contact with the
animals has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was charged with investigating the safety of a wide
variety of drugs in livestock. It returned with a report that both
presented possible problems with the use of drugs, but also
pointing out that many drugs help insure the safety of the food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   The number of documented cases of human illnesses traced to
antibiotic-resistant disease organisms from animals is very low,
the experts said, but the true risk is difficult to assess because
critical data are lacking on sources of human diseases and the
extent that food animals harbor resistant germs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Coffman, provost at Kansas State University in
Manhattan and chairman of the panel, said antibiotics used to
control and treat diseases in animals help provide healthier meat,
eggs and dairy products for consumers. ``But there have been a few
cases in which resistant bacteria have been passed to people,''
Coffman said. ``Extra vigilance is needed to prevent the spread of
bacteria that cannot be destroyed with currently available drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member panel _ which included health specialists, food
industry scientists, disease experts and consumer representatives _
reviewed the role of drugs in the food supply, the majority of
which are antibiotics. The committee included members of two units
of the National Academy of Sciences _ the National Research Council
and the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, in a 200-page report, recommended that the
federal government establish a permanent oversight panel to monitor
drug resistance and suggest the best ways for antibiotics to be
used in humans and animals. This panel should include members from
regulatory agencies, medical and veterinary groups, the food
industry and consumer groups, said the report, whose sponsors
included the departments of Agriculture and Health and Human
Services and the American Feed Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended establishing a national database on
antibiotic use and resistance trends in humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it called for more research to develop new classes
of antibiotics because bacteria that develop resistance to one
antibiotic tend to become immune to others in the same class.
Current monitoring systems to detect the levels of drugs in meat,
milk and other food products from animals are adequate, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 60 percent to 80 percent of all cattle, swine,
sheep, and poultry in the United States receive antibiotics at some
point. While some of these drugs are used to treat specific
diseases, it said, much of the estimated 19 million pounds of
antibiotics used annually in agriculture is added to food or water
to promote the growth of animals and to prevent disease
transmission among animals held in close quarters. This
``subtherapeutic'' use of antibiotics allows more animals to be
raised at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups have called for regulators to ban
antibiotic use in food animals for purposes other than to treat
specific diseases posing an immediate threat. The Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group
that has campaigned for restricted antibiotic use among both
animals and people to preserve the effectiveness of the drugs, said
the new report bolstered its call for banning subtherapeutic uses
in the food system.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new report estimated that such a ban in agriculture
would cost consumers between $1.2 billion and $2.5 billion a year
in higher prices for poultry, beef, pork, fish and other foodstuff.
In addition, the report said, animal diseases might become more
widespread, increasing public health risks, and lead to higher
demand for antibiotics for treating sick animals.
</P>
<P>
   The Animal Health Institute, representing makers of vaccines,
drugs, food additives and other animal health products, said
conclusions of the report were consistent with other studies
calling for prudent use of antibiotics in farm animals, better
monitoring and science-based regulations governing approval and use
of antibiotics. It praised the report for recognizing the benefits
of antibiotic use in improving the food supply.

America tarnishes basketball image
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ NBA players have proved their point by electing not to
compete for the United States in the World Championship of
Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   As NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik watched 28 fringe players
try to show they have what it takes to represent America, he
admitted as much _ the NBA, as well as basketball in the country in
which it was invented, will suffer because the NBA's stars will not
shine in Athens, Greece, when the World Championship begins this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of American basketball is taking a hit in this
thing,'' Granik said. ``USA Basketball takes a hit around the
world. But it's even bigger than that (for America's basketball
reputation).
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the world, they just can't understand it. People in our
(NBA) office have spoken to people in Greece and Italy and France _
places where we're going to play exhibitions _ and they're saying:
`We can't understand why Americans don't want to play for their
team. What does that have to do with the NBA?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think in that sense, it has hurt the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what NBA players wanted when they decided not to commit
to the U.S. national team. Originally, a dozen NBA players _ 11 of
them All-Stars at some point in their careers _ were on the U.S.
team. Those are the players fans and big-money sponsors expected to
see when the U.S. team arrived in Athens, as well as in four
exhibition games across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   One of those exhibitions, in Detroit, was canceled. The other
three _ two in Monte Carlo and one in Rome _ will have
substantially less marquee value than they would have if the United
States showed up with Gary Payton, Tim Duncan and Grant Hill
instead of players such as Jason Sasser, Acie Earl and Larry
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Those are good players, probably good enough to compete for a
medal in Athens. But they are borderline NBA talents, and none has
come close to being an NBA All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players technically are not boycotting the World
Championship. They merely refused to commit to play. That left USA
Basketball, the governing body for America's international play in
the sport, with no choice but to replace the original 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's disappointing that the NBA players aren't here,''
said Granik, who doubles as the president of USA Basketball. ``But
for USA Basketball, this is going to be perhaps a more interesting
adventure. I think we do have enough players to be competitive. And
certainly, the outcome is going to be a lot more in doubt than it
has been in the competitions when the NBA has participated. So it
makes it a little bit more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's the positive spin. But there is no denying the
NBA has been left dumbfounded by its players' actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I have not gotten a reasonable explanation for
why they aren't playing,'' Granik said. ``I told them that if they
wanted me to resign (as USAB president), I would. We wanted to do
whatever it took to field the best team we could. The NBA's not
losing any money in this deal, but USA Basketball is. And I think
that's another thing that NBA players don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But money is not the issue, at least not in regard to the NBA
players' absence from the U.S. team. What NBA players did was make
sure the image of the United States as basketball royalty would be
tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing the 28 players trying out for the U.S. team can
do about that. But coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who prefers to
concentrate on the positive aspects of leading Team USA rather than
the negatives caused by NBA players, believes the team that
represents the country will have a less stressful experience in the
World Championship than NBA counterparts would have had.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life as a coach is always filled with pressure,''
Tomjanovich said. ``That's what it's all about. The way I deal with
it is just to go out and try to do your best. You prepare your team
and then let the cards come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're right about that (having less pressure now). There
is a pressure not to lose if you have the NBA guys. And it's no fun
playing not to lose. If you're out there and you win by 15,
everybody's saying you should have won by 30.''
</P>
<P>
   If NBA players were involved, just showing up would be enough.
Enough to win games. And enough to satisfy fans and overseas
corporate tie-ins who wanted to see NBA stars.

JURY ACQUITS DON KING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal jury acquitted Don King of nine counts of
wire fraud Thursday, the second time he was tried on a charge of
attempting to defraud a Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate out
of $350,000 after a Julio Cesar Chavez bout was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Although one juror caused a heated deadlock regarding the guilt
of Don King Productions, a defendant along with King, the
government has chosen not to retry the promoter's company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for all America _ not black America or white
America,'' said King, who said he read from a Bible as he listened
to the verdict, then received the embraces of his lawyers and shook
most of the jurors' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you all very much,'' he said, leaning over the jury box.
</P>
<P>
   The post-verdict scene was reminiscent of one of King's
circus-like news conferences. The promoter laughed boisterously, he
soliloquized his jubilation in religious and hyperbolic terms,
quoting Lord Acton, Martin Luther King Jr, the Bible, Thomas
Jefferson and Rudyard Kipling, and he signed autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say goodbye,'' one juror said to King, gently
kissing him.
</P>
<P>
   As King ventured from the 15th floor courtroom to talk to
reporters outside the U.S. Courthouse in Lower Manhattan, he
greeted three court security officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm free again!'' he said, embracing one. ``I'm free,
brotherman!''
</P>
<P>
   When two rabbis who displayed their support during the
three-month trial approached King, he gleefully shouted, ``My
rabbis! These are my rabbis!''
</P>
<P>
   In his jubilation, King did not directly scorn the government's
case against him, but referred to those who abuse power. ``When my
lawyer said, `We the people,' my liver quivered and my heart
palpitated,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, King, 66, looked like a man unworried
about his legal fate. Although his trademark flamboyance was muted
by the trial's formality, he frequently flashed his broad smile,
garrulously greeted visitors, some bearing gifts, and joked with
the courtroom artist. ``I tried desperately to feel down, but
couldn't,'' he said. ``I'd say, `Your head is in the lion's
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's verdict meant King has won acquittals from two
federal juries in Manhattan, the first one in 1985 on charges of
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's aftermath, Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for
the Southern District, said she would not prosecute Don King
Productions again on the wire fraud charges because it would not be
``in the public interest.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That contrasted with her decision to retry King after a hung
jury in 1995 forced U.S. District Judge Lawrence McKenna to declare
a mistrial in the government's first case against King.
</P>
<P>
   This time, White's office added King's company to its indictment
of King.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum prison term King could have faced if he had been
convicted on all nine counts was was 45 years, but sentencing
guidelines would have pared those years down.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been fined up to $250,000 for each count; fines of
$1 million for each of the seven counts could have been levied
against his company.
</P>
<P>
   A company conviction could have barred him from promoting fights
in Nevada, but the state attorney general had reserved a decision
on that until the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment had prevented King from promoting fight cards in
New Jersey; a call to the state Athletic Control Board seeking
comment was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors presented the case against King and his company
with more clarity than the government did in 1995 but jurors
evidently were not fully persuaded that King or his company
submitted a fake contract to Lloyd's after the cancellation of
Chavez's 1991 fight against Harold Brazier that stipulated King was
due repayment of $350,000 in ``maintenance nonrefundable training
expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that Chavez got $80,000 in training expenses
and owed $270,000 more from a $736,000 loan King made to Chavez
against a future purse, money that was characterized as a
``maintenance'' payment.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fiscus, one of the jurors, said he was persuaded by a
faxed insurance binder that Lloyd's covered what the defense said
it did.
</P>
<P>
   Between Tuesday afternoon and early Thursday, the case had
plunged into chaos. One juror, Dean Yager, pushed to convict King
and his company.
</P>
<P>
   Yager was also said to have related to the remaining jurors a
newspaper report that King's maximum sentence could be 45 years.
The jury forewoman reported to McKenna that they were deadlocked,
causing McKenna to interview each juror Wednesday to see if they
could continue to deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna urged them to deliberate again at 12:15 p.m. Thursday
without discharging Yager, which was an option. After 100 minutes,
the jury told McKenna it had a verdict on King but continued
deadlock on the company.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna refused a government request to compel the jury to
deliberate further on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got unanimous on King this morning,'' said Marianne Mileno,
the jury forewoman, on Thursday. Regarding friction over Yager's
stand on convicting the company, she said, ``It was very emotional.
It was difficult personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Yager said little as he rushed from the courtroom. Asked if the
3 1/2 months of jury service had embittered him, he said:
``Precisely.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fleming Jr., a lawyer for King, said the defense was
unhappy with Yager at jury selection but could not dismiss him for
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he wouldn't have been our first choice, we were
surprised that he was as unyielding and unreasonable as we heard he
was,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   King's legal fights are not over. Now, he must fend off a
federal lawsuit filed against him by Mike Tyson, his former money
train.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll deal with it,'' King said, pausing to expound upon
life's various forms of love. ``I love him. He's my beloved
brother.''

SENATE EXEMPTS WHEAT FROM SANCTIONS AGAINST PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Pakistan poised to make a major wheat
purchase, the Senate Thursday voted 98-0 to exempt Northwest wheat
farmers from the effects of sanctions imposed against Pakistan for
testing nuclear weapons six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear whether the House and President Clinton
can act quickly enough to make the U.S. eligible to bid for next
Wednesday's Pakistani purchase of 350,000 metric tons of wheat,
which is expected to be worth at least $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are only three major competitors for the Pakistani soft
white wheat market _ Australia, Canada, and the United States. The
bulk of the U.S. soft white wheat is grown in the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wheat farmers of the Pacific Northwest are six days away
from a disaster,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``Farmers across
this country are staring an economic train wreck in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan in recent years has emerged as a major market for
wheat, Washington state's largest agricultural export. Last year,
Pakistan purchased more than one-third of Washington state's wheat
crop, with a value of as much as $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, led by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., and Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., has been vowing for
weeks to help Northwest wheat farmers retain the Pakistani market.
But a House-passed measure to do that has stalled in the Senate
after becoming entangled in the debate over tobacco policy.
</P>
<P>
   Senators hope the unencumbered measure they approved Thursday
can be approved in the House on Tuesday _ the first day the House
returns to work after a lengthy recess and the last day for action
before Pakistan wants the wheat bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have high hopes that the House will act on the 14th,'' said
Thomas Mick, executive director of the Washington Wheat Commission.
``We're very pleased (by the Senate vote), and just hope it isn't
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he is prepared to sign the measure, which
was partly brokered by his national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
at Murray's behest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the Senate has passed legislation today that
is consistent with my view that U.S. food exports should not become
an unintended victim of an important non-proliferation law,''
Clinton said. ``Food should not be used as a weapon, and I will
resist any action that would lead to a de facto grain embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote reflected not only widespread concern over the
plight of American farm families, but also increasing unhappiness
in the Senate with the breadth of U.S.-imposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other country on Earth imposes sanctions as often as the
United States,'' said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. ``It is often an
emotional, short-term calculation which drives these sanctions, and
it is America, all too often, rather than the target nations, which
becomes isolated, victims of our own sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing figures claiming that the United States is imposing 115
sanctions against countries that are home to 75 percent of the
world's population, Senate leaders Thursday had hoped to pass a
broader bill that would have exempted Boeing airplanes and other
products. The bill also would have allowed Clinton some flexibility
in the imposition of sanctions against India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But the broad bill was highly controversial among Democrats, and
ultimately, the only issue on which the Senate could agree was to
help the wheat farmers. Nonetheless, many senators clearly saw
their action as the first step toward chipping away at the
country's use of sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the shift of the debate from agriculture to foreign
policy, Thursday's discussion was led not by Murray, the prime
sponsor of the original effort to rescue wheat farmers, but by
Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Joseph Biden, D-Del., who have
taken charge of an effort to re-evaluate overall U.S. sanctions
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions against countries that test nuclear weapons,
sponsored by Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and approved unanimously by
the Senate in 1994, were supposed to function as a deterrent, and
have never before been imposed. Although Glenn said the threat of
sanctions has helped slow nuclear proliferation in countries
including Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and South Korea, they
failed in India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not kept the nuclear genie in the bottle in the
subcontinent, and now we see the bizarre spectacle of the American
government poised to wrestle American farmers to the ground,'' said
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's 3,500 wheat farmers have become accidental victims
of the Glenn amendment, which requires the president to impose
sanctions against countries that test nuclear weapons. The
sanctions law exempts food, but includes credits, and therefore
covers the U.S. government-issued credit guarantees Pakistan needs
to borrow money from private banks to buy U.S. wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Pakistan has used the credit program
to buy about $1 billion worth of wheat from the United States, most
of which has been grown in the Northwest, according to Chris
Goldthwait, general sales manager of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Without the U.S. credits, Pakistan will not buy U.S. wheat,
according to a Pakistani official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wheat which is produced in the Northwest is more suited to
our eating and cooking habits back home, and last year we bought
almost 40 shiploads from the United States, worth more than $350
million,'' said Farrakh Qayyum, minister for trade at the Pakistani
Embassy in Washington. ``But without those credits, a wheat
purchase from the United States is not possible.''

SCHOOLKIDS SEE CLINTON AND GINGRICH IN RARE JOINT APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ President Clinton and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich made a rare joint appearance Thursday in Atlanta to
crusade against illegal drug use, even as their parties are
preparing to club each other with that issue in the congressional
campaigns this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying here to console the families and praise the
firefighters who are grappling with Florida's fires, Clinton
stopped in Atlanta to unveil a new advertising campaign against
drugs that he said was designed to ``knock America upside the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a bipartisan front _ if a rather cool one _ before
hundreds of schoolchildren in a conference center auditorium,
Gingrich and Clinton described how drugs had affected them. The
speaker said that the sister of one of his aides was left in a coma
by a drug slipped into her drink; the president said that his
brother, Roger, ``nearly died from a cocaine habit.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the congressional elections bearing down, the sense of
shared purpose did not last. Immediately after Gingrich finished
his remarks hailing the commercials' ``bipartisan basis,'' an aide
to Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., handed a statement to reporters in
the auditorium that sharply assailed Clinton's drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   And after the anti-drug event, Clinton moved on to a $500,000
fund-raising lunch for Michael Coles, a Democrat who is challenging
Coverdell for his Senate seat. He mocked Republicans as
misrepresenting Democratic policies on the budget, guns and foreign
policy. ``They still milk that old cow every chance they get,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Florida, the president visited with families who lost
most of their possessions to fire. Several people wept as they told
Clinton their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president spoke under a tent to several hundred
firefighters and other emergency workers gathered at the Daytona
International Speedway, which has served as a staging area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here,'' he said, ``because I think it's important that
every American knows that this summer, notwithstanding the great
movies, the real American heroes are not up in space fighting
asteroids, they're in Florida fighting fires.''
</P>
<P>
   After driving the short distance to the speedway from the
airport, Clinton and his motorcade took a stately quarter-lap on
the 2.5-mile oval. The last car of the three-dozen-vehicle
motorcade had barely reached the track as the first vehicle left
it.
</P>
<P>
   As in Georgia, Clinton combined his official duties in Florida
with political ones. He flew to Miami for an $800,000 dinner, with
Sylvester Stallone, on behalf of congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The new advertising campaign, supervised by the Campaign for a
Drug-Free America, is financed this year with $195 million in
federal money that organizers expect to be matched by media
organizations. Some commercials, tailored to different racial and
age groups, have already been broadcast in test markets; the
national campaign began Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the president and speaker sat with several people
between them, but they were careful to compliment each other's work
against drugs. Both seemed to capture the children's attention with
their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described learning from his brother that he had started
drinking beer and smoking marijuana in high school. ``I said, `How
often?''' he said. ``He said, `Every day.' And I thought to myself,
`What kind of family member was I?'''
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience: ``There's somebody like my brother back at
your school who is a good kid, just a little lost,'' adding: ``You
can save them.''

SENATE VOTES UNANIMOUSLY TO WEAKEN SANCTIONS AGAINST INDIA AND
PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bowing to pressure from farmers, the Senate on
Thursday unanimously agreed to exempt food exports from sanctions
that the United States imposed on India and Pakistan after those
two countries conducted nuclear tests in May. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's action, by a 98 to 0 vote, lifts the largest and
most painful economic penalty that Washington inflicted, and leaves
almost no meaningful sanctions in place to punish India and
Pakistan for the nuclear detonations that drew international
condemnation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions on military aid remain, but there was never much to
begin with. The World Bank has resumed aid to India, with the
administration's support. And foreign grain dealers were eagerly
lining up to take Pakistani orders after American farmers were
sidelined by the sanctions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senators said they were still deeply troubled by the nuclear
explosions and the threat of a new arms race in southern Asia. But
looking ahead to the November elections, senators said they also
had important farming constituents to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the Pakistanis buy U.S. wheat, Canadian wheat or some
other country's wheat isn't going to make a difference on a dinner
table in Islamabad, but it sure will in Topeka,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., who helped write the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, rushed the
bipartisan bill to the floor Thursday on short notice, bypassing
the usual committee that reviews legislation.
</P>
<P>
   There was reason to hurry. Pakistan is going into the world
grain market next Wednesday to buy 350,000 metric tons of wheat. If
the sanctions law is not changed by then, American wheat farmers
could not bid on the sale, which agricultural experts value at $37
million.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A parade of farm-state senators took to the floor on Thursday to
urge approval. Wheat prices have plunged to a seven-year low
because of excess supply, causing many farmers from the Dakotas to
the Pacific Northwest to give up their land. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington state wheat growers need this bill,'' said Sen.
Patty Murray, D-Wash. Her state sends 37 percent of its wheat to
Pakistan, which pays Washington farmers about $500 million a year.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., voiced even more distress: ``We in the
Pacific Northwest are six days away from disaster.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have promised to whisk the Senate bill
through the House when it returns from recess early next week.
Clinton indicated in a statement issued on Thursday saying he
supported the legislation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The whole deal nearly fell apart earlier on Thursday when Sen.
John Glenn, D-Ohio, who wrote the sanctions legislation, balked at
an early draft that gave Clinton the authority to exempt other
sectors besides agriculture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the provision said it would give Clinton a
diplomatic carrot to entice India and Pakistan to sign treaties to
restrict their nuclear testing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have dumped out everything on sanctions, and given
the president complete carte blanche without Congress being
involved at all,'' Glenn said in an interview after voting for the
bill that exempted only food products.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Arms Export Control Act of 1994 punishes countries that test
nuclear tests by cutting off trade credits, private bank loans,
loans from international institutions and loan guarantees to
American companies doing business there.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several weeks, the World Bank has resumed aid to
India with Washington's agreement, even though the sanctions that
were automatically triggered by the nuclear tests call on the
United Statesto oppose such lending. Administration officials cited
an exemption in the law for humanitarian aid, a category that the
White House is apparently defining to include most of the
activities undertaken by the World Bank in India.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   World Bank loans were aimed at projects to assure that more
children complete primary school, to train health workers and to
pay for immunization and nutrition services for pre-school
children, and pregnant and nursing women. There were also loans for
irrigation systems and maintaining rural roads.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The remaining sanctions include a longstanding provision that
cut off all arms sales and military aid to Pakistan after the
United States determined in 1990 that Pakistan possessed nuclear
devices. Among other things, it scuttled the sale of 28 United
States F-16 fighter jets for which Pakistan had already paid $600
million.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The legislation approved on Thursday, the Farm Export Relief
Bill, exempts from the sanctions financing and credits for food
products and fertilizer that are guaranteed by the government and
extended to American farmers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Food should not be a weapon of foreign policy,'' said Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``When sanctions are unduly rigid and
automatic, they become a roadblock to diplomacy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congress has been having second thoughts lately about the merit
of sanctions, one of lawmakers' favorite foreign-policy cudgels.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McConnell is heading a bipartisan, 18-member task force to
review the effectiveness of scores of sanctions the United States
has imposed over the years. The task forces' report is due in
September.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many free-trade advocates in the Senate, like Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., argue that unilateral sanctions inflict no pain on their
targets, who buy their wares elsewhere, and hurt American
businesses in an increasingly global marketplace.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., summed up the reservations of many
lawmakers: ``We need to keep in mind that while we're bashing
sanctions, we've not made a distinction between countries who pose
a threat to us and those who do not.''

TOBACCO COMPANIES, STATES SOUGHT SETTLEMENT IN SECRET TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.Y., Calif., Colo., N.C., Ariz.)  (th) 
 By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bid to settle the most troublesome litigation facing the
cigarette industry, negotiators for producers and state attorneys
general held secret talks in recent weeks in an effort to craft a
new tobacco settlement proposal, said state officials and lawyers
with knowledge of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which follow the collapse last month of a $516
billion comprehensive tobacco bill in the Senate, apparently grew
out of a court-ordered effort to mediate an upcoming
smoking-related lawsuit brought by the state of Washington against
the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations then expanded to include officials from other
states with pending lawsuits, including New York, California,
Colorado and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer, who represents numerous states in actions brought
against cigarette producers, said that negotiations between the
industry and state officials had broken off Wednesday night over
monetary and other issues. And another person close to the tobacco
industry confirmed that the talks had broken off over money.
</P>
<P>
   But two state officials, who also spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that they had been told Thursday by colleagues that
the talks were still alive and that details about them would be
discussed during a national meeting of state attorneys general
expected to start Monday outside Durango, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorneys general have always said that if Plan A didn't
work then we would always go with Plan B,'' said Jeffrey Modisett,
the attorney general of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the tobacco industry and 40 state attorneys general
reached a $368.5 billion settlement plan that, if approved by
Congress, would have settled lawsuits by states and smokers,
restricted advertising by tobacco companies and required producers
to pay fines if youth smoking rates did not decline. In return, the
producers would have received protection from certain types of
lawsuits and claims for punitive damages in smoking-related cases.
</P>
<P>
   But a tobacco bill introduced by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
increased the settlement figure to $516 billion while lawmakers
removed the legal protections sought by the industry. As a result,
tobacco producers withdrew from last year's accord and launched an
intensive effort that helped derail the McCain bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tobacco company executives remained concerned about
smoking-related lawsuits brought by states, which they consider the
most difficult and costly cases pending against them. And some
state officials have said that they also remain eager, in the
absence of federal action, to settle their cases and reap the
monetary and public health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Philip Morris Cos. and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.,
the parent company of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, declined Thursday to
comment on the settlement talks. A spokesman for Christine
Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general who participated in
the recent discussions, also said that she would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Black, a tobacco industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co., said that he estimated that a new settlement offer by the
industry to the 37 states with remaining lawsuits would likely be
in the range of $200 billion to $240 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under last June's $368.5 billion proposal, about $196.5 billion
would have gone to the states, with the remainder going to the
federal government. Over the past year, however, the tobacco
industry has paid out about $36 billion to settle lawsuits brought
by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From a public health perspective, any new proposal negotiated
between state attorneys general and tobacco producers would likely
be modeled around the $6.5 billion settlement reached in May
between the industry and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   That accord, which like previous state settlements bans tobacco
advertisements on billboards and near schools, also bars producers
from, among other things, misrepresenting the health hazards of
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But any statewide plan would differ from last June's proposal
because it is not expected to include a federal component: It would
not deal with federal regulation of nicotine or provide companies
with relief from lawsuits brought by smokers, insurers or
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   According to people familiar with the talks, the new round of
negotiations began about three weeks ago when a court ordered
mediation to resolve the state of Washington's lawsuit against
tobacco producers. That lawsuit, which is seeking to recover
billions spent treating tobacco-related diseases, is scheduled to
start in September.
</P>
<P>
   During those talks, two tobacco industry lawyers, Arthur Golden
and Meyer Koplow, and Joe Rice, a lawyer from Charleston, S.C., who
represents about 25 states with tobacco lawsuits, met with Ms.
Gregoire, the Washington attorney general, to discuss bringing
other states into the talks, said lawyers familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the talks were expanded to include several other
states like New York and California, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rice and Golden declined comment and Koplow did not return
telephone calls Thursday. A spokesman for Dennis Vacco, the New
York attorney general, declined comment and the office of Dan
Lundgren, the California attorney general, did not return a
telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   However, versions of how the talks broke down differed sharply.
While one person close to the tobacco industry said that state
officials had demanded too much money, a state official said that
producers had made a ``low-ball'' offer.
</P>
<P>
   But even if talks resume, as some state officials expect,
reaching a new deal may be complex because of the posture of both
the tobacco industry and those states with unresolved lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   While some states are eager to settle or have done little work
to advance their lawsuits, a few states like Wisconsin and Maryland
have been working hard to prepare their cases and have shown little
interest in settling prior to trial. &QL;

NEW YORKER STAFF TAKES DEEP BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: MAGS-MOVIES) 
(lh) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wearing a black T-shirt to a meeting that was
anything but casual, S.I. Newhouse Jr. told uneasy staff members of
The New Yorker Thursday that the departure of his star editor, Tina
Brown, would not create precipitous changes at the magazine his
family owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a slight editorial problem,'' he jokingly acknowledged
to about 75 employees, as Ms. Brown chuckled nearby, having stunned
Newhouse with her resignation exactly 26{ hours earlier. But just
before an awkward kiss and embrace of Ms. Brown, he vowed not to
use the occasion of her replacement to redefine the nature of the
magazine, to change its weekly publication schedule, or to begin
cutting its famously expansive budget.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse gave no indication whom he is considering to succeed
Ms. Brown, according to several people who attended the meeting,
but said he planned to make the decision by next week. When he said
that no one in or out of the magazine had been ruled out, Susan
Orlean, a staff writer, brought down the house by raising her hand
and asking, ``Would you consider me?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlean said later that she would not really be submitting
her resume, but about 10 or 15 editors from around New York have
done so, several current and former employees said. Although Kurt
Andersen, the former editor of New York Magazine and currently a
New Yorker columnist, remains the front-runner in the rumor-driven
sweepstakes, Newhouse said only that he would make his selection
based on a gut instinct of who would make him both ``comfortable
and excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-minute staff meeting came a day after Ms. Brown announced
that she was leaving the magazine to start a company affiliated
with Miramax Films that would produce a new monthly magazine, as
well as books, films and television programming. To dispel rumors
about a growing tension between her and Conde Nast Publications,
which is owned by Advance Publications, she thanked Newhouse, the
chairman and chief executive of Advance, for his ``unflagging
support,'' both financially and emotionally, although several
employees said the warmth appeared to be for display purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was also attended by Steven T. Florio, chief
executive of Conde Nast, an appearance that was apparently designed
to downplay stories of hostility between him and Ms. Brown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Ms. Brown invited a large group of magazine
writers and editors to her home for champagne and dessert Thursday
night, in what was described by those who attended as a thank-you
and goodbye party. Ms. Brown is expected to lure several writers to
her new, still-unnamed magazine over the next year, but employees
said that was not the explicit purpose of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlean's facetious self-nomination had its serious side: the
job is so coveted, and so closely watched, because of the
enormously broad opportunity it allows an editor to put his or her
stamp on an influential magazine. Other magazines are about news or
fashion or music; The New Yorker is largely about its editor's
interests, and as a result, staff members said they were deeply
concerned about life after such a prominent cultural fixture as Ms.
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My deepest anxiety was that he would now bring in some kind of
efficiency expert or cost cutter,'' said Roger Angell, the longtime
writer and editor at the magazine, who asked for and received an
assurance from Newhouse that such a person would not be appointed.
``It was good to hear him say that that was the furthest thing from
his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse, of course, could hardly be expected to promise an
editorial shakeup. But employees are acutely aware that the
magazine has lost more than $100 million in the 13 years since it
was purchased by Conde Nast Publications, and that the choice of a
successor could be determined by whether Newhouse still wants to
spend such sums on the magazine's expensively acquired marketplace
verve.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His remarks Thursday were interpreted by many employees as an
indication that he does not plan to turn off the faucet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not someone who believes in disinvesting from magazine
properties in a way that is likely to diminish their appeal,'' said
Henry Finder, editorial director of The New Yorker. ``It's a
fantasy that you can just put on a green eyeshade and go from red
to black, and I think the last thing he would want to do is to do
anything that would jeopardize the quality and cachet of the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Wickenden, the magazine's executive editor, agreed that
the meeting reassured anxious staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a major turning point when there is a new editor
of an extremely important magazine,'' she said. ``But he was quite
clear that he intended to continue to publish an intelligent,
informed, serious magazine of culture and the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   It was less clear, however, whether a new editor would be
expected to share the particular interests Ms. Brown had brought to
the magazine since her arrival six years ago _ her fascination with
Hollywood and the celebrities of Washington, her enjoyment of
breaking news, her lavish use of graphics and photo spreads, all
but unheard of before her arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Though Finder said the magazine had a core identity, a
``genome'' that could not readily be changed, some people outside
the magazine questioned how much tradition could really be
preserved, noting that Ms. Brown's crusade to eliminate stodginess
from the magazine had already taken it far from its roots into
pop-cultural territory well-covered by other publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at this with extra scrutiny because Tina
Brown raised the stakes, the eyebrows, the volume of that job, so
that any change will be considered dramatic,'' said Daniel Menaker,
a former senior editor of The New Yorker who left in 1994 after 20
years and is now senior literary editor of Random House, which
Newhouse recently sold. ``With a magazine like Refrigeration
Monthly, you know it will always be about refrigerators. With The
New Yorker, it's a more plastic situation, which will be shaped
much more by its editor.''
</P>
<P>
   The race to succeed Ms. Brown took on an almost comic aspect
Thursday, with people in and out of the magazine handicapping long
lists of candidates based on their perceived closeness to Newhouse.
Some people mentioned friends' names, as a favor; others tried
desperately to avoid being mentioned. Those leading the various
lists included Andersen; writer David Remnick; Peter Kaplan, editor
of The New York Observer; Michael Kinsley, editor of the online
magazine Slate; Katrina Heron, editor of Wired, which was recently
purchased by Conde Nast; and Dominique Browning, editor of Conde
Nast's House &AMP; Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But probably not Susan Orlean, as she is the first to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like everyone else in the world had been mentioned,
so I had to throw my name in, too,'' she said after the meeting
Thursday. ``With lists that long, it's just insulting if you don't
get mentioned.''

HOW WELL TO MOVIES AND MAGAZINES MIX? 
</HEADLINE>
   (With NEWYORKER-SUCCESSION) 
 (lh) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Tina Brown's announcement on Wednesday that she was
quitting as editor of The New Yorker to develop a magazine,
television shows and movies with a unit of Walt Disney Co., puts
her in the middle of one of the hottest fashions in the media
industry: the melding of journalism and Hollywood. Peter Bart, the
editor of Daily Variety, called magazine articles ``the source du
jour for movies.''
</P>
<P>
   But though it is still unclear how the arrangement, with the
Miramax Films division, will work, it is the kind of situation that
has heightened concerns about how the need to generate movie ideas
has the potential to warp journalistic principles and to create
conflicts of interest within media conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there have been allegations, usually denied,
that entertainment companies like Disney and Time Warner have used
publications they own to promote films or other projects produced
by their studios.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, various shows on ABC, now owned by Disney, have
devoted a great deal of time to several movies produced by Disney,
although the network has maintained in each instance that there was
justified journalistic interest in the films.
</P>
<P>
   The trend plays into more general criticism that the news media
have become oriented toward entertainment rather than hard
journalistic truth. ``The journalist is focused on the economic
demands, not on the demands of the information he or she is working
with,'' said Bill Kovach, the director of Harvard University's
Nieman Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   William Broyles Jr. an Oscar-winning screenwriter and a former
managing editor of Newsweek, said that ever since so-called new
journalism _ a school in which writers are given more license to
re-create scenes _ became popular many publications have become
more oriented toward spinning compelling yarns rather than dry
expositions of fact, and that that is what attracts the studios.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood loves magazine stories, he said, because ``they have a
whiff of authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It legitimizes the story ideas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Susan Lyne, who worked for Disney for several
years scouring magazines for movie ideas, and whose job involved
speaking with journalists even as they were shaping their articles,
insisted that the studio never sought to skew the facts or twist
ideas. ``I just don't know good journalists who would do that,''
said Ms. Lyne, who now is an executive vice president at ABC.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most difficult aspect of Hollywood's fascination
with magazines, and journalists' infatuation with Hollywood, is
that very few articles receive Hollywood interest actually get
turned into movies. Kovach said that after he quit The Atlanta
Constitution years ago because of a dispute over his journalistic
independence, he signed a deal to turn the tale into movie. A
decade later, he said, he still gets occasional calls about a
project that seems to go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   Broyles said that another reason many of the projects languish
is that the studios never really intend to make movies. ``Some
stories are optioned by people who just don't want anybody else to
have them,'' said Broyles.

HARD TIMES FOR RETAILERS WITH A CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Md., Pa.)   (For release Sunday, July 12)  
 (JT)  
 By SARA SILVER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pueblo to People had a clever name and a noble mission _ selling
clothes and crafts made in Latin America to people in the United
States, and giving the Indian artisans and farmers a chance to earn
a decent living by traditional means instead of leaving their
villages to search for work in the cities.
</P>
<P>
   But neither words nor deeds were enough to pay the bills. After
two decades, Pueblo to People announced its demise last Christmas
in a letter to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company was known as an alternative, or ``fair trade,''
organization _ one that acts as a good-hearted middleman by selling
handicrafts made by cooperatives, so that their members can work
their way out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pueblo to People had bright, committed people, but it's hard
to run both a business and a nonprofit, to balance your head and
your heart,'' said Brian Backe, marketing director of Serrv
International, another fair-trade concern.
</P>
<P>
   At their peak in the mid-1980s, dozens of nonprofit
organizations tried to sell through catalogs, generating an
estimated $15 million to $20 million in annual revenues. But many
soon faced harder times.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the retail market dipped, paper and mailing
costs soared, and all catalog companies faced unprecedented
competition in the mailbox. Many of these groups had little cash in
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a small, undercapitalized company, it hit you like
a punch in the stomach,'' said William Dean, a consultant in San
Francisco whose firm advises companies that sell through catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   The market forces that felled Pueblo to People also brought down
at least three smaller fair-trade organizations last year. Still,
those companies that survived the shakeout have increased their
sales, by some estimates taking in as much as $25 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Littrell, a professor at Iowa State University who
researches alternative traders, says there are just four such
groups in the United States with more than $1 million in annual
sales. ``The majority of consumers want good products, and if it's
made decently then that's a plus,'' she said. ``The era of the
message carrying the product is over. The product must carry the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Pueblo to People, which was based in Houston, boomed in the
1980s and early 1990s. During Central America's civil wars, the
group sold to sympathetic Americans in part by describing the
effect the war had on the artisans. The tactic worked. Sales grew
to about $3.5 million in 1997, from $1 million in 1986, enabling
the group to pump more than $10 million into impoverished villages
in the region. Problems arose, however, in inventory management,
quality control and the fierce loyalty given to certain suppliers,
even when their items were not selling.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which year after year offered many of the same
brightly colored Guatemalan jumpers and bags, cashew brittles and
$350 alpaca throw blankets, began to splinter. ``The fact that we
survived so long is pretty miraculous considering the level of
sophistication with which we approached the problem of running a
business,'' said Sandy Calhoun, the catalog coordinator for Pueblo
to People.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that have survived _ Ten Thousand Villages, Serrv, Equal
Exchange and Marketplace: Handwork of India _ all say they put
sound finances before noble missions. All say they run frugal
businesses despite sales that have grown as much as 20 percent a
year. They pay executives $40,000 to $50,000, for example, far less
than what their counterparts receive at larger retailers. Finally,
they say, they put consumers' needs first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't work with suppliers as charities and sell
poor-quality products,'' said Paul Myers, director of Ten Thousand
Villages, which is based in Akron, Pa., and sold $6.8 million of
merchandise last year through Mennonite churches and a network of
125 stores. The organization avoids catalogs, steers clear of the
clothing market, which is often fickle, and holds $5 million in
equity to weather downturns.
</P>
<P>
   Serrv, based in New Windsor, Md., and an arm of the Church of
the Brethren, started in the 1940s by selling place mats and cuckoo
clocks made by World War II refugees. Last year, it sold $5 million
in products like beeswax candles made by former welfare recipients
in North Carolina, candlesticks by Salvadoran widows, and thumb
pianos by South African slum dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more important to its continued success was the
hiring of a designer two years ago to update and coordinate product
lines, assuring that tablecloths from India matched glassware from
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that alternative businesses can be viable, Equal
Exchange, a coffee retailer based in Canton, Mass., set itself up
in 1986 as a for-profit corporation to show it could survive
without tax breaks or contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with $4.7 million in revenues last year, buys
mostly organic coffee from Latin American, Indonesian and Tanzanian
cooperatives. It gives farmers money up front to eliminate their
dependence on expensive credit to buy seed and material, and pays
20 cents a pound above market rates to raise living standards and
encourage environment-friendly agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Though it once hoped to branch into other products, Equal
Exchange is now content with staying alive in the gourmet coffee
market _ and the $200,000 pretax profit it produced last year.
``Accomplishing change within the system is so difficult,'' said
Jonathan Rosenthal, the executive director. ``If we survive and
grow, that's success.''

 BofA Deal Walloped At Public Hearings   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In the first and perhaps only public hearings on the biggest bank
merger in U.S. history, Bank of America and NationsBank came under
heavy attack yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Packing the first of two days of hearings at the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, community groups and politicians expressed
grave concerns that the plan to create the first coast-to-coast
bank could cut competition, lead to higher fees and reduce
community reinvestment and charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank CEO Hugh McColl, who will run the combined bank from
Charlotte, N.C., reiterated the two banks' unprecedented 10-year,
$350 billion community development pledge, calling it ``a floor and
not a ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The pledge includes $180 billion for small-business lending and
$115 billion for affordable housing. He also noted that combined
charitable giving will top $100 million this year, making the new
BankAmerica the most generous financial institution in the country
``by a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   His BofA counterpart, David Coulter, pointed out that BofA
helped build California by financing everything from the Golden
Gate Bridge to Silicon Valley to Hollywood, including the film,
``It's a Wonderful Life.'' He said the bank intends to continue its
``unparalleled commitment to the communities we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 200 speakers presenting their views yesterday
and today are worried about the merger. ``Life is not so wonderful
in Oakland, Bay View-Hunters Point and other areas that still
suffer from redlining,'' said David Glover, executive director of
Oakland Citizens Committee for Urban Renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Although supporters of the merger testified, its critics were
more outspoken. One of the taped banners on the walls read,
``NationsBank Go Home,'' while another said, ``Don't Redline
California.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gamboa, executive director of the Greenlining Institute in
San Francisco, called the banks' $350 billion pledge ``a hollow
commitment'' because it does not spell out how the loans would be
distributed by geographic market and by product, such as loans to
minority- and women-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the banks made specific pledges on charitable giving or
minority representation among upper management and the board of
directors, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks that have recently merged, such as Wells Fargo,
Washington Mutual and Union Bank of California, have made
more-specific pledges, said Alan Fisher, executive director of the
California Reinvestment Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Californians are afraid that this mega-merger will
accelerate movement away from meeting the distinct needs of
California communities and toward cookie-cutter loans and predatory
banking,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union attorney Earl Liu urged the Federal Reserve
Board to hold up approval of the merger until the new BankAmerica
pledges not to increase fees and minimum-balance requirements,
passes cost savings on to consumers, reaches specific community
reinvestment goals with community groups, and guarantees affordable
checking and savings accounts for low-income consumers .
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno said the $350 billion
community reinvestment pledge should be made binding by including
it in the banks' merger application.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing merger applications, the Federal Reserve Board is
required to examine the banks' compliance with the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires banks to meet the
``convenience and needs'' of all the communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers have never been blocked after such a review, though a
few have been delayed. Many of the speakers at yesterday's hearing
called for additional hearings in Los Angeles and 21 other states
where the combined bank has branches. But they and several bank
analysts believe that even the two-day San Francisco review of the
NationsBank/BofA merger is mainly a formality.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks have received ``outstanding'' marks from regulators
for their community reinvestment programs. Moreover, about half the
speakers yesterday applauded the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $350 billion commitment is unprecedented,'' said Bruce
Marks, executive director of Boston-based Neighborhood Assistance
Corporation of America. ``It makes BankAmerica/NationsBank the
largest provider of affordable mortgages and developer of
affordable housing in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks was accompanied by five African Americans who testified as
to how well they have been served by NationsBank. Genie McNab, 67,
who relies on Social Security payments &UR; ,  &LR; said that earlier this
year she traded a 12.5 percent mortgage loan on her Atlanta home
from another company for a 6.5 percent fixed-rate, 30-year loan
from NationsBank with no down payment and no closing costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now also
praised NationsBank as a leader in community reinvestment. Houston
Mayor Lee Brown called NationsBank ``an excellent corporate
citizen.''

 Washington Mutual Debuts   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Seattle-bas k?~ Washington Mutual will soon be the second biggest
lender in California. But the giant thrift has a tough hurdle to
overcome as it looks for new business _ few Californians have ever
heard of it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When it comes to name recognition in California ... we have
none,'' said Gini Lawson, first vice president of advertising.
Washington Mutual has 365 branches in the state, but until recently
they all operated under the names Great Western and American
Savings, companies Washington Mutual acquired over the last year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual has spent the past three months changing the
name plates on its California branches. On Monday it launches a
humorous television advertising campaign to start building name
recognition and a reputation for good customer service.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has a difficult job ahead as it battles such
gargantuan names as Bank of America and Wells Fargo _ on their
native turf. The stakes will rise October 1 when Washington Mutual
is scheduled to complete its acquisition of another huge thrift,
H.F. Ahmanson, parent company of Home Savings of America.
</P>
<P>
   At that point Washington Mutual will operate about 600
California branches and jump ahead of Wells Fargo to become the
second largest lender in the state. It will manage 17 percent of
all California deposits, compared to 21 percent for Bank of America
and 14 percent for Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any unannounced banking mergers before October,
Washington Mutual will be the seventh largest lending institution
in the United States with $156 billion in assets under management.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual executives believe the key to future growth is
to address consumers' two biggest frustrations with banking.
``People don't want to be treated like a number and they are tired
of being nickeled and dimed to death with fees,'' said Brad Davis,
senior vice president of corporate marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The company's products and advertising are both geared to
address these pet peeves. Its flagship product, a no-fee checking
account, goes further than most other banks by offering overdraft
protection, no minimum balance, no fee for using a teller and no
direct deposit requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Although checking accounts cost banks an average of $150 per
year to maintain, Davis said Washington Mutual makes a profit on
its free accounts after 12 to 18 months. That's the point at which
most account holders have between two and three other
``relationships'' with the bank, such as a mortgage or a
certificate of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Some 175,000 free checking accounts, which are particularly
attractive to the under-30 crowd, were opened at Washington Mutual
in the first five months of this year. ``We build the relationship
so when they get older and they need a car loan and a mortgage,
they will come to us,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep staffers tuned to the needs of customers, Washington
Mutual sends ``secret shoppers'' to each branch four times a year
to rate customer service. Branch managers' salaries are tied to the
previous year's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual is also making an effort to reach low-income
and minority customers and small businesses with a promise to lend
$120 billion to these groups over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its public relations value, the pledge makes good
business sense, because 80 percent of new homeowners in California
are ethnic minorities, said Robert Gnaizda, public policy director
of the Greenlining Institute, a San Francisco advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   A series of TV spots, which premiere Monday, feature Washington
Mutual customers going to extreme measures to express their
satisfaction with the thrift. In one ad, account holders take a bus
tour of tellers' homes and are thrilled to find a favorite teller
mowing the lawn in front of his house.
</P>
<P>
   In the second spot, enthusiastic but graceless Washington Mutual
clients form a cheerleading squad. In the third, two young boys
visit what looks like a baseball card shop to check out the latest
Washington Mutual ``teller cards''.
</P>
<P>
   The company's award-winning TV ads for the Pacific Northwest
market have gained a lot of notoriety, particularly spots featuring
the ``Rodeo Grandmas'' in cowboy hats and chaps. Since appearing in
the ads, the four grandmas have appeared as guests on TV programs
like the Rosie O'Donnell Show.
</P>
<P>
   All the spots were created by McCann-Erickson/Seattle ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry analyst Jim Bradshaw, a former California
banking regulator, said he believes the Washington Mutual formula
will work well here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk in, it feels awfully different than the
traditional bank branch you go to,'' said Bradshaw, of Portland,
Ore.-based Pacific Crest Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual branches generally have customer service desks
positioned near the front door, ``so you're greeted quickly after
you enter, they make you feel at home instantly, and they direct
you to where you need to do your business,'' Bradshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said a company survey shows that 90 percent of Washington
Mutual account holders say they would recommend the bank to a
friend, compared to 46 percent of Wells Fargo customers and 42
percent of Bank of America customers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Marymee, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said of Washington
Mutual, ``Smart competition is good for the marketplace. We're
doing what we've always done, which is concentrating on delivering
fast, convenient service for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bank of America spokesman Harvey Radin: ``The strength we
bring to the market is our range of services and the convenience of
... large branch and ATM networks.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Wheeling and Dealing PCs  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
No down payment. Low monthly payments. Trade it in for a new one
after two years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sounds like financing for a car, but in fact it's a
ground-breaking program by Gateway that lets consumers get a new
personal computer without having to spend $1,500 to $2,000 up
front.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway's move, along with a program by Dell Computer that lets
consumers lease new PCs instead of buying them, are being
scrutinized by the rest of the industry as companies seek new ways
to attract first-time buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and Gateway, the second- and fourth-largest PC-makers in
the United States, sell systems directly to consumers by phone and
over the Internet. They don't have to deal with middlemen or retail
stores, making it easier for them to introduce novel financing
plans.
</P>
<P>
   With trade-in options and different types of leases, they hope
to entice consumers who are reluctant to shell out big bucks for
something that is guaranteed to become obsolete in just a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new financing programs are designed to appeal
to buyers who don't have a lot of cash but can manage payments of
less than $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The affordability coupled with obsolescence protection is
striking a chord with consumers,'' said Bart Brown, vice president
of home marketing for South Dakota-based Gateway. ``The program has
been successful beyond our wildest forecasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Your:)Ware financing program _ promoted through a
slick TV advertising campaign _ seems to have invigorated Gateway.
Since the program was announced at the end of May, Gateway's stock
has soared 44 percent. It closed yesterday at $61.88, up $2.13.
</P>
<P>
   The Your:)Ware program lets you finance a new multimedia PC over
two, three or four years, at interest rates as low as 14.9 percent.
For $49.95 a month, over four years, you can get a Pentium II 300
megahertz PC with 32 megabytes of memory, a five gigabyte hard
drive, a DVD drive and a 15-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The total price of the system, including financing, comes to
just under $2,400, which is a lot to pay for those specifications.
But the deal also gives you unlimited free Internet access through
Gateway's own Internet service. Based on an average cost of $20 a
month, that works out to  &LR;   &LR; $960 worth of Internet access over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Any time after the first two years, you can trade in your system
for a new one and get a trade-in allowance equal to the blue book
value of your computer (typically less than one-third of its
original price).
</P>
<P>
   Dell's Personal Lease program works just like a car lease. For
example, you can get a Pentium II 300 system that retails for
$1,699 for $64 a month over three years. That comes to a total of
about $2,300. At the end of the lease you can either return the
system and walk away, lease a new one, or buy the computer you were
leasing for 15 percent of the original purchase price (in this case
$255).
</P>
<P>
   Dell started its leasing program last August, but at that time
only offered a two-year lease and required an initial payment equal
to the first-and last-month's payments. In March, the company
eliminated the up-front payment and added a 36-month option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we came up with the modifications we've seen a doubling
of customers, and it continues to grow month over month,'' said
Mike Watt, chief operating officer for Dell Financial Services, the
company's financing arm.
</P>
<P>
   One recent customer, C.D. Rowsell of Hayward, said he decided to
lease a Dell Dimension computer after checking out the company's
leasing plan on the Web. And he's happy he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a state-of-the-art machine (with a 400 MHz Pentium II),
the monthly outlay isn't huge, and it was easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see the programs, especially Gateway's, as a way for
PC-makers to establish long-term relationships. In addition to
gaining repeat business through trade-ins, the company can use the
Your:)Ware program to sell upgrades and new services, such as
customized technical support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that PC companies want to turn their
customers into annuities,'' said analyst Scott Miller of Dataquest.
``They don't want to have to resell people every three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said it's ``exceptionally important to watch how Gateway
does with this. It's a complicated undertaking, and I'm not
convinced that this model is where the industry will end up. But
they're moving in the right direction.''

 &HT;    U.S. deployment in Kuwait remains substantial
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Rarely has a year gone by since the end of the Gulf
War in 1991 without American military forces scrambling back to the
region for a few months to counter another threat from Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crisis came in February, when the Iraqi dictator
refused to grant U.N. weapons inspection teams access to certain
areas and threatened to shoot down U-2 spy planes.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike past deployments that were quickly scaled back as
soon as the crisis ended, this one has lingered long after Saddam
backed down.
</P>
<P>
   From a high of 12,000-13,000 troops on the ground in Kuwait in
February, the numbers have been reduced to 3,500-4,000, said Army
Lt. Gen. Tommy Franks, who is responsible for all U.S. ground
forces in the Middle East as commander of the 3rd U.S. Army at Fort
McPherson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have drawn the force level down in accordance with our view
that Saddam Hussein is not now pressing a crisis,'' Franks said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But that is still three times more foreign troops, most of them
American, than are usually in post-war Kuwait when no Iraqi threat
is looming.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said a decision was made after the agreement between U.N.
and Iraqi officials averted another war ``that we should watch this
for a period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to do that, Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of
Central Command, which oversees the region, created a Combined
Joint Task Force that provides an infrastructure and a small
deterrent force. That force can be bolstered by at least 5,000
combat ground troops from the U.S. within 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to be able to do was match Saddam's cycles of
arrogance and recalcitrance,'' said Franks.
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for reducing forces in Kuwait to what they
were before February. Saddam is too unpredictable.

 &HT;    Clinton joins Democratic bash for Coles
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- President Bill Clinton praised Michael Coles as ``a
doer'' and a man of courage who would have impressed America's
founding fathers Thursday, but he acknowledged that the Democratic
candidate for U.S. Senate might not always see eye to eye with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not expect this man, if he is elected to the Senate, to
vote with me on every issue,'' Clinton said at a fundraiser for
Coles in Atlanta. ``I want him to only do so when it is consistent
with his conscience. But I believe he thinks enough to know that we
will be building a future based on progress, not partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, who expects to face incumbent Republican Sen. Paul
Coverdell in November, raised as estimated $500,000 at the event
hosted by Gov. Zell Miller and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 guests paid from $500 to $10,000 to attend the
luncheon at the Marriott Marquis downtown, with the more generous
givers receiving brief photo sessions with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's campaign manager Marty Ryall said Clinton's
participation in the fundraiser shows that Coles has aligned
himself with ``the liberal wing of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Coles praised the Clinton administration for
the nation's low unemployment and balanced budget. But at a press
conference after Clinton left, he cited specific differences he had
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Coles said he strongly disagreed with the administration's
decision to use a $15 billion cut in medical benefits for veterans
with smoking-related illnesses to help fund a highway bill. Coles
added that he never supported Clinton's abortive attempt to create
a national health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when he was running against House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, Coles declined to say whether he planned to vote for
Clinton in his bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to let Newt drag me into sideshow issues,''
Coles said. ``I voted for Clinton in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approval rating in Georgia this month was 53 percent,
down slightly since fall 1996 but still higher than it has been
throughout much of his six years in office.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton and Coles were somewhat reserved toward each other,
they let their emotions flow in praising Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Coles choked back tears after Miller, his close friend,
introduced him. He said Miller was the person most responsible for
his presence in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Democrats must convince moderate Republicans and
independents that the prosperity Americans and Georgians now enjoy
_ the lowest crime, unemployment and inflation rates in a
generation and a balanced budget _ are connected to the policies of
their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that Zell Miller is a good man with a lot of
energy and a lot of courage and he was great in the Marine Corps
and he gives a good speech,'' Clinton said. ``The HOPE scholarship
was in fact the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta attorney Emmet J. Bondurant, who attended the luncheon,
said Clinton' spoke well and should help energize Democrats to work
for Coles.

   KEEVE-FILMS (Undated) _ In his half-dozen years as a filmmaker,
Douglas Keeve, a former fashion photographer, has turned his
penchant for voyeurism into a flair for comedic truth telling. By
Ruth La Ferla.
</P>
<P>
   MCINERNEY-FASHION-NOVEL (New York) _ From the moment that Jay
McInerney's hapless hero of his upcoming novel shaloms through a
crowd of air kissing New York fashionistas at the ``Party You Have
Been to 600 Times Already,'' you are utterly prepared for some 176
pages of haute-runway literature. You would, however, be mistaken,
insisted McInerney, who said that fashion is simply one strand of
his new novel, ``Model Behavior,'' which chronicles the unraveling
relationship of a fashion magazine journalist and his size 6
girlfriend who is gainfully employed as a model in the New York
hothouse of fashion, where appearance is destiny and ``breathless
enthusiasm sings harmony with toxic ennui.'' By Doreen Carvajal.

<P>
   WOMEN-PLASTIC-SURGERY (Undated) _ When Stephanie Hallberg was
16, she decided she wanted to reduce the size of her breasts. Ten
years later and after visits with doctors _ all men, who all
recommended she keep her breasts the way they were _ she found a
doctor who, she said, understood her predicament and agreed to
perform the surgery: Dr. Michelle Copeland, who works out of a
Fifth Avenue office complete with its own operating room and
all-female staff, down to the anesthesiologist. ``Now I couldn't
even imagine going to a man for any plastic surgery,'' Ms.
Hallberg, 26, said. ``A man can study the woman's body forever, but
I believe he can never really understand how a woman is put
together, mentally, emotionally, physically.'' By Alex Kuczynski.

<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ The fig, Ficus carica, is native to
the sunny, hot summers and mild winters of the Mediterranean, but
it is adaptable, and can be grown well beyond its native haunts.
Although a fig tree can grow quite large in Mediterranean climates,
it is easily coaxed into becoming a more easily protected bush or
small tree. Even the roots do not mind being pruned or cramped. The
fig's unique fruiting habit also lends itself to northern growing. &QL;

   HANDKERCHIEF-CHIC (Undated) _ A white linen handkerchief can do
more for a man's personal style and comfort during the summer heat
than the lightest-weight tropical wool suit. It is odd that what
was once a simple utilitarian item has acquired a reputation as a
stuffy, ante-bellum accessory. By David Colman.

 Big Glitch in Electricity Market   By Kenneth Howe  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In the biggest glitch to hit the state's electricity market since
it was deregulated three months ago, prices for backup power shot
up 1,000 percent on Wednesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wholesale price for ``replacement reserve power'' in
California skyrocketed as high as $5,000 per megawatt from a normal
$5 to $10 per megawatt.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent System Operator, which runs the the state's
electricity system, buys reserve power as a kind of insurance in
case a heat spell or emergency causes a surge in energy usage.
</P>
<P>
   This week's price spike cost the ISO more than $9 million. The
ISO passes the cost to power companies, which pass it along, albeit
indirectly, to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities can't directly pass on the higher costs because
rates have been capped at current levels for four years. However,
rates actually were expected to decline before those four years
were over. But if the utilities are forced to absorb higher costs
for reserve power, rates may continue at their high level for the
full period.
</P>
<P>
   The price jump is an embarrassment because electricity
deregulation, which began March 31 after a three-month delay, was
supposed to lower energy costs, not raise them.
</P>
<P>
   Although this spike applied only to power for several hours,
such expensive price swings are apt to occur again unless federal
regulators agree to change energy-trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about this,'' said Jeffrey Tranen, chief
executive of the ISO, which is based in Folsom. He said that ISO
officials were already discussing the problem with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, which governs energy matters.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of this week's price spike lies in the interplay
between supply, demand and federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, companies that generate electricity compete to sell
electric power into the state's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   The company with the lowest price gets the contract to provide
power for certain parts of the state for a set amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   The market for normal power needs is highly competitive,
insuring a low price.
</P>
<P>
   However, fewer suppliers are interested in the smaller market
for back-up power, so the price tends to be higher. To prevent
prices from going too high, the federal regulatory agency limits
how much companies can charge for emergency power.
</P>
<P>
   However, a handful of companies that are based out of state but
have generating plants in California recently applied to the agency
to have their price caps lifted. The agency complied.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cap was lifted, the power companies could charge
whatever they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like giving someone the keys to the bank,'' said Mike
Florio, a senior attorney with the Utility Reform Network and a
member of the ISO board.
</P>
<P>
   Tranen of the ISO said he could not disclose which companies
jacked up the price of emergency power.
</P>
<P>
   However, the power companies asking that their price caps be
lifted include: AES Corp., based in Arlington, Vir.; Houston
Industries Inc.; Dynegy Inc., also based in Houston; and Duke
Energy Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO needs 500 megawatts of replacement reserve power _
enough to power a half-million homes _ each hour.
</P>
<P>
   Such power generally goes for about $5 to $10 a megawatt. But on
Wednesday, the lowest price for backup power that would be
available between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. yesterday shot up to $2,500 a
megawatt.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three 60-minute periods, the price went to $5,000 a
megawatt, before dropping down to $750 a megawatt for the hour
ending at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tranen said the ISO had little choice but to buy the backup
power. However, the ISO did not buy any replacement reserve power
for today. &UR;  &LR; Instead, the agency relied on other back-up power
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Tranen said he believed the price spike was only temporary. ``I
believe this is a blip and we will solve it with the regulators and
then we can move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tranen wants the FERC to bring back the price caps until more
competitors enter the reserve market. Or they could be removed for
all competitors, which would bring more companies into the market.
</P>
<P>
   Tranen said the market could also become more competitive if
out-of-state generating companies are able to participate in the
reserve market. They can't now due to technical computer
limitations at the ISO.
</P>
<P>
   With the hot summer coming up, the ISO will need to buy even
more reserve power.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-July, the ISO expects to be able to bring out-of-state
companies into the reserve market. That will help prevent the
likelihood of another price hike. But the future really depends on
what FERC decides to do.

SELIG'S THE ONE ... OFFICIALLY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ On his 2,130th day as acting commissioner, Major
League Baseball club owners looked at Bud Selig and liked what they
saw. So Thursday they elected him quickly and unanimously as the
sport's ninth commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Although Selig will shed the ``acting'' from his title Aug. 1,
he is not expected to alter the way in which he has performed his
role since Sept. 9, 1992, two days after the last commissioner, Fay
Vincent, resigned under pressure. The owners don't want him to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud knows how to get things done,'' said Drayton McLane of
Houston, who, with Carl Pohlad of Minnesota, led the effort that
persuaded Selig to accept the job. ``He is the most effective
political leader I have ever met. Every owner trusts him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox had been portrayed by
other owners and officials as opposing the idea of an owner being
commissioner, but he voted for Selig and said afterward: ``I don't
think there's anybody in America who could do the job that he can
do. The only alternative was bringing in an outsider. That just
didn't make any sense at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who will turn 64 years old July 30, was elected as
quickly as it took the owners to take a roll-call vote, having
previously voted to dispense with the requirement that election be
done by written ballot. He was elected for a five-year term with
his salary to be set by the executive council.
</P>
<P>
   Selig currently earns $2.5 million as council chairman and is
expected to begin his full-time job with a salary of at least $3
million a year. As the man in charge for the past 70 months, Selig
has already served longer than four of the previous eight
commissioners: Peter Ueberroth (1,643 days), Gen. William Eckert
(1,129), Vincent (1,091) and A. Bartlett Giamatti (154).
</P>
<P>
   As the first owner to become commissioner, Selig will be
replaced as the trustee of his approximately one-third share of the
Milwaukee Brewers, before he officially takes office. The club's
board of directors is expected to elect Wendy Selig-Prieb, his
daughter and current vice president, as president.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said he will move out of his office at County Stadium and
open a new office in downtown Milwaukee, dividing his time between
there and the commissioner's office on Park Avenue in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was sensitive to possible conflicts arising from his
position as an owner, Selig told a news conference that after 28
years as club president, ``It's time for me to go now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I really believed in my heart and mind that I couldn't do
this, if I'm not capable of making that very emotional and very
sensitive shift, then I should have had the decency to say I just
can't do that,'' he added. ``But I know that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig's election surprised absolutely no one, not on
management's side, not on the players' side.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time it has been clear that eventually the owners
would formally name Bud to be the commissioner,'' said Donald Fehr,
the union chief, whose relationship with Selig has improved since
it reached its nadir during the labor dispute in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sue Selig, the commissioner's wife, said Thursday she
``knew in my heart'' probably since the labor dispute was resolved
that he would accept the job. Selig, however, steadfastly said he
did not want the job, though never ruling out that he would take
it.
</P>
<P>
   A search committee, meanwhile, considered hundreds of
candidates, and Jerry McMorris of Colorado, the chairman, had
whittled the list to four names, including Leonard Coleman, the
National League president. But an increasing number of owners told
Selig he was the only man for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on him as long as I can remember,'' Pohlad
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud has stiff-armed us for over a year,'' McLane added.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said Thursday he was driving in his car one day and said
to himself, ``You're going to do this.'' He did not say when he had
that conversation, but another owner said Selig disclosed his
decision in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   A critical factor in his decision, Selig said, was the presence
of Paul Beeston as Major League Baseball's chief operating officer
for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul will do much more of the day-to-day, operational
things,'' he said. ``I'll do more global things.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the global area is the problem of resolving the
economic disparity between large and small revenue clubs. That
issue and lasting labor peace are the two most important matters
facing Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reduce the acrimony from this equation once and for
all,'' said Selig, who was in charge of the owners' labor committee
in the sport's last three work stoppages. ``We've never been able
to do that. We've had eight work stoppages. We have to make sure
that the next generation doesn't have to endure any work
stoppages.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners have responded positively to Selig's
consensus-building style and seem to feel he will be a ``safe''
commissioner because he never acts in a precipitous or
controversial manner.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo, managing partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks
and the National Basketball Association Phoenix Suns, compared
Selig favorably with David Stern, who has been considered the most
successful commissioner of a professional league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're two different individuals with different personalities
and different methodologies,'' Colangelo said. ``Each in his own
way has been very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   During Selig's tenure as acting commissioner, the owners have
adopted interleague play, three-division leagues and wild-card
teams for the playoffs, greatly increased their revenue sharing and
approved a limited form of realignment, shifting Selig's Brewers
into the National League.

NIGERIA ANXIOUSLY AWAITS RESULTS OF PRISONER'S AUTOPSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Stores were shuttered Thursday, isolated fires
burned and streets were unusually empty as Nigeria anxiously
awaited a verdict on the sudden death of its main opposition
leader, Moshood K.O. Abiola, and a timetable for the promised birth
of a democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, who had been imprisoned since 1994 after asserting his
right to the nation's presidency, died Tuesday in Abuja, the
capital, shortly after meeting with high-level U.S. officials. The
apparent cause was cardiac arrest, but the death has raised
suspicion here and set off violence, which continued sporadically
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's body was transported secretly to Lagos on Thursday for
fear that any public sighting could ignite tumult. In a further
effort to prevent unrest, the Lagos state government imposed a
dusk-to-dawn curfew.
</P>
<P>
   The international doctors, including three Americans, who are to
conduct the autopsy on the leader, who died a political prisoner,
also arrived here and Western officials said they would almost
certainly examine Abiola's body Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything goes according to plan we should have the
preliminary findings by the weekend,'' said one Western official.
``If we find blockage of the arteries, then everything will be
pretty straightforward. But of course if the arteries are clear,
then you have a whole new ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's family, gathering here before his funeral, appealed for
calm. ``The greatest honor we can do him in death is to embrace
peace,'' Kola Abiola, the late politician's oldest son, said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Abiola was the apparent winner of elections held in
1993, but annulled by the military government. The government said
last week that it would release all its political prisoners,
including Abiola, who had agreed to relinquish his claim to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived of its leading figure, the opposition here is in some
disarray, deeply concerned that further widespread rioting could
provide an excuse for a military clampdown or delay movement toward
democracy. Mobile police units fanned out across Lagos on Thursday
to quell unrest.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little threat of mass protests that could
bring down Nigeria's recently installed leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, because the opposition here is fragmented, Nigeria's
unity is fragile and there is no obvious successor to the military
ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, who has impressed Western officials with his
reform-minded moderation since he took office last month, convened
the 27-member Provisional Ruling Council, the heart of the
country's military authority, Thursday for the second time in two
days. But the meeting adjourned with no announcement on how or when
a democratic system might be introduced. A working group is to
study possible timetables and is expected to report to the
government early next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Abubakar's commitment to change appears clear _ and was
reiterated to South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who
visited Thursday _ he faces a delicate choice between a gradual
process that could prove too slow to assuage an impatient nation
and a rapid shift that might precipitate chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said Thursday they doubt that an elected
president could take office before Jan. 1, 1999, if a credible vote
is to be organized.
</P>
<P>
   Tension was palpable in Lagos on Thursday, fanned by the
continuing uncertainty over Abiola's death. Members of Abiola's
family remained convinced that he was poisoned. Several opposition
leaders share this conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally convinced that Abiola was poisoned,'' said
Clement Nwankwo, a prominent human-rights lawyer and opposition
figure. ``The way his death has been described _ the cup of tea,
the gasping for breath, the protracted back and forth _ does not
sound like cardiac arrest to me. But the fact is that if the
autopsy shows foul play, that would really intensify a crisis that
now needs to be contained.''
</P>
<P>
   Nwankwo said his chief concern was that the country could
descend into what he called ``major ethnic conflict.'' Some of the
rioting and killing _ at least 19 people have been confirmed dead _
has involved clashes between the mainly Yoruba population of the
Lagos and Abeokuta areas and Hausa from the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being attacked just because of where they are
from,'' the lawyer said. ``If this country becomes ungovernable, no
authority is going to hold elections, and that would be a terrible
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Hausa and Fulani constitute a majority in the military
government and the armed forces, while a significant part of
Abiola's following came from the Yoruba tribe in southwestern
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the many ethnic and religious groups in this
country of 105 million people have been fanned by the domination of
northern military figures since independence in 1960 and the fact
that the oil that earns the country more than $10 billion a year is
concentrated in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The perceived exploitation of one part of the country by another
_ some officers, including Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator who died
suddenly of a heart attack June 8, are widely reported to have
enriched themselves with oil money _ has inevitably made Nigeria
more volatile.
</P>
<P>
   In this context the Clinton administration is not putting any
pressure on the government to adhere to the timetable Abacha had
set for a democratic transition. A presidential election was to
have been held Aug. 1, and he had emerged as the sole candidate.
</P>
<P>
   With Abacha and Abiola dead, and the process of creating genuine
political parties not yet begun, the Aug. 1 election date is
regarded as entirely unrealistic, officials said. So, too, is the
Oct. 1 date that had been set for an inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five government-created parties are largely meaningless in
the new context,'' one Western official said. ``Time is needed. New
parties have to be formed. A six-month transition looks all right
to us, although of course a period of years is entirely
unacceptable. The most important thing is to do this right.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies have about $7 billion invested in Nigeria, almost
exclusively in the oil industry, an increase of about $3 billion
over the last five years. With about 10 percent of U.S. oil imports
coming from Nigeria, there is clearly extreme concern in Washington
that any transition be handled prudently
</P>
<P>
   In addition, through its size and the strength of its armed
forces _ Nigerian troops are involved in military missions in
Liberia and Sierra Leone _ the country dominates the region, and
the United States is concerned that any chaos might rapidly spill
over Nigeria's borders.

MARYLAND OFFICIALS DEFEND THEIR INQUIRY OF TRIPP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Maryland investigators on Thursday defended their
new inquiry of Linda Tripp as she made her fourth appearance before
a federal grand jury here that is investigating the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp has emerged as a central witness in the inquiry by
the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, into whether
anyone committed perjury, witness tampering or obstruction of
justice in connection with the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday a Maryland prosecutor, Stephen Montanarelli,
convened a local grand jury to investigate whether Mrs. Tripp broke
a state law when she secretly recorded telephone conversations with
Ms. Lewinsky. The law in Maryland, where Mrs. Tripp lives, requires
that both parties to a telephone conversation consent to its
recording.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland authorities on Thursday disputed the claims of Mrs.
Tripp's lawyers that the inquiry was a politically motivated effort
to intimidate Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no political agenda at all,'' said Gavin Patashnick,
Montanarelli's spokesman in the Special Prosecutor's office.
``We're an apolitical office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's lawyers have complained that the Maryland inquiry
had been sought by more than 40 Democratic state lawmakers and was
begun as she was appearing before the Washington grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli, who heads an office of the state Attorney General
that handles white collar and public corruption cases, was given
the inquiry at the request of Marna McLendon, the prosecutor in
Howard County, where Mrs. Tripp lives. Ms. McLendon, a Republican
up for re-election, decided she could not proceed without being
accused of a conflict shortly after she received a letter from the
state Democratic lawmakers urging an investigation of Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp on Thursday issued another statement that the
Maryland inquiry would have no effect on her testimony in the
Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the events which have recently unfolded in Maryland, I
continue to focus on my testimony before the federal grand jury,''
she said in a statement read by a spokesman, Philip Caughter.
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli faces significant obstacles in any potential
prosecution of Mrs. Tripp. An immunity letter issued by Starr and a
sealed immunity order from a federal judge prevent the Maryland
prosecutor from using any evidence or information that Mrs. Tripp
provides to the independent counsel against her. As a result,
prosecutors in Maryland will be unable to use the tapes that she
turned over to the independent counsel's office and Mrs. Tripp's
testimony about why she made them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investigators will have to look elsewhere to try to
make a case against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immunity she gets precludes the state from using anything
she turns over,'' said Professor Sarah Sun Beale, a criminal law
authority who teaches at the Duke University School of Law. ``What
the prosecutors use must be independent and pre-existing
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Beale said the Maryland authorities could try to make
a case from other evidence. For example, Lucianne Goldberg, a book
agent and friend of Mrs. Tripp, has said she instructed Mrs. Tripp
to make the tapes in the mistaken belief that Ms. Lewinsky's
consent was not required. Ms. Goldberg also had copies of some of
the tapes, but has apparently turned them over to the independent
counsel. The Maryland authorities could seek those tapes from
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is expected to return to the grand jury in Washington
next week.

IN GM STRIKE, SIDES DISAGREE ON PROSPECT OF PACT BY MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ohio)  (th) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Top negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the
United Automobile Workers union disagreed Thursday on the
likelihood of a settlement by Monday in the most expensive strike
to hit GM in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with reporters here, Richard Shoemaker, the
vice president for GM issues at the UAW, and Gerald Knechtel, GM's
vice president for labor relations, said they were pressing for a
settlement before the automaker's two-week summer shutdown ended
Monday but conceded talks were moving slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be absolutely shocked'' if the strike was settled by
Monday, said Shoemaker, who tried to rein in some of the
speculation about an imminent settlement in the walkout, which has
idled 26 of GM's 29 North American assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   But a more optimistic Knechtel said, ``It's very important that
we get it done by this weekend, if it's at all possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would specify the issues standing in the way of an
agreement, but people close to the union said the talks were
focused on resolving important investment and compensation
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Knechtel said it was critical for GM also to resolve lingering
strike threats at parts factories in Dayton, Ohio, where workers
have already authorized a strike, and in Indianapolis, where a
strike-authorization vote is scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get them all done,'' he said, declining to say
whether GM is seeking a no-strike guarantee regarding those plants.
Shoemaker said the union would prefer to focus only on the strikes
at two plants here because adding the other disputes would only
prolong the process.
</P>
<P>
   Among major remaining issues for the union, officials close to
the discussions said, is whether the 9,200 striking workers here
and the 161,000 workers laid off in the dispute will be granted 32
hours of vacation pay and a week off sometime later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those are benefits they would have normally received as part of
the company's annual two-week shutdown. They are thought to be
protected by language in the national contract, according to one
senior union official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't leave here without an agreement on that issue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said the union also wanted a formal
time line for when GM will invest the remaining $180 million of a
$300 million investment plan at the metal-stamping plant, where the
first strike began on June 5. The company has said it scaled back
investment in the plant because the union failed to help rid the
factory of inefficient work rules.
</P>
<P>
   At the Delphi East spark plug and speedometer factory, the other
plant on strike here, the two sides were still at an impasse over
GM's plan to send work to outside sources, a move that the union
contended would cut at least 2,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials said negotiators at both plants had resolved many
of the hundreds of worker-safety grievances that centered on issues
such as exposure to hazardous materials, noise levels and use of
old equipment. These people, while declining to specify how those
disputes were settled, said the union had begun to look for places
to hold ratification meetings once an overall agreement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Shoemaker denied reports that progress was
being stymied by demands from GM that broader issues such as what
to do with its auto parts unit, Delphi Automotive Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had a conversation about that,'' Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi employs 50,000 UAW members but lags behind rival auto
suppliers in profitability because its wages are more than double
the typical pay for parts assembly work. GM and the UAW reached an
understanding more than a year ago that GM may sell up to 20
percent of the division, possibly through an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the press for a settlement was on because
GM needed to begin to make up some of its losses, which are
calculated at $1.18 billion through June 30, before the strikes
have a chance to dent its third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   ``If GM doesn't settle this strike in the next couple of days,''
said David Healy, an auto analysts with Burnham Securities,
``whatever they've lost, they lose for good.'' &QL;

NEW PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA MEETS GUERRILLA LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ President-elect Andres Pastrana met the top
leaders of Colombia's largest guerrilla force in an unannounced
session Thursday and came away pledging to remove security forces
from five municipalities and to start peace talks with rebel
leaders within 90 days of taking office.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief press statement Thursday afternoon, Pastrana said
that he had met the leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, to deliver on his top campaign promise, a pledge
to negotiate an end to nearly four decades of political violence in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   A brief videotape showed Pastrana shaking hands with leaders of
the group, Manuel Marulanda and Jorge Briceno, at a location he
described only as ``somewhere in Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana became the first president to talk directly with the
insurgent leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Flying in a small plane under the auspices of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, Pastrana, wearing a yellow polo shirt,
was flanked by the rebel leaders in camouflage uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   He said they had raised some ``worries'' over a 10-point peace
plan in his campaign platform, and expressed ``political
willingness'' to hold a dialogue on ``the national problem of
reaching peace with social justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to answer questions on the discussions, saying
the peace process would require ``responsibility, seriousness and
discretion'' on the part of Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pastrana had pledged to meet the rebel leaders soon after
winning the election June 21, Thursday's meeting came as a complete
surprise, and was carried out under extremely tight security.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Pastrana's transition team had told reporters the
president-elect would be leaving for a few weeks' vacation in
France, where his wife and children were waiting for him.
Throughout the week, officials like Guillermo Fernandez de Soto,
who Pastrana plans to name foreign minister, avoided returning
phone calls, without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial, ranching and business leaders, who are among those
hardest hit by guerrilla extortion, greeted word of the meeting
enthusiastically. ``Pastrana is fulfilling his election promises
boldly,'' said Jorge Visbal, head of the Ranchers Federation.
``It's an important step forward which must be vigorously and
enthusiastically consolidated.''
</P>
<P>
   One Colombian news magazine, Cambio 16, reported that the
ranchers lost some $70 million to the rebels last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Fernando Castro, omsbudsman in the outgoing government,
called the meeting ``a historic development without precedent,''
and said it ``showed the will for peace of both the new government
and the FARC.'' The rebel group is Latin America's oldest and most
powerful, with intelligence estimates of its fighting capacity
running from 10,000 to 15,000 combatants.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement of the rebel group would be crucial to negotiating
any lasting peace in this country of 36 million, which has lost
more than 30,000 people to political violence since the 1960s.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the second-largest rebel group, the National
Liberation Army, has been preparing for talks in Germany next week
with business and church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, one government official, Environment Minister
Eduardo Verano, told Colombian radio that two officials of the
current government will meet with National Liberation Army leaders
after they had finished preparatory talks with civic leaders.
Leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia steadfastly
refused to negotiate peace with the government of President Ernesto
Samper, which it calls ``illegitimate,'' and boosted Pastrana's
standing days before the election by meeting with his campaign
chief, Victor Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange, post-election turnaround, a German couple who had
spent the last two years in a Medellin jail for paying a ransom to
National Liberation Army rebels now appear to be the shepherds of
the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Werner and Isabel Mauss, had been accused by police
of colluding with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Mauss, however, said that they were on a mission to
free a German executive's wife who had been kidnapped by the
rebels, and that paying the ransom removed the largest obstacle to
their country's hosting peace talks between the rebels and the
Colombian government.

ADVERTISERS AGGRESSIVELY COURT HISPANIC CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bilingual education may be under attack in the public schools,
but American businesses do speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers spent $1.4 billion last year trying to reach
Spanish-speaking and bilingual Hispanic consumers, according to
Hispanic Business magazine in Santa Barbara, Calif. That was more
than double the $628.2 million spent in 1990 and four times the
$333.5 million of 1985, based on the magazine's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While still less than 1 percent of the $186.8 billion spent on
all advertising here in 1997, according to McCann-Erickson
Worldwide, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos., experts say the
Hispanic number will keep growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to recognize that the Hispanic population
is very large,'' said Dolores Kunda, director of Hispanic marketing
at Leo Burnett USA, part of Leo Burnett Co. and a board member of
the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies. ``The Hispanic
population is as large as the population of Canada,'' she said,
referring to the perhaps 30 million people of Hispanic descent now
living in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent census estimates for 1995 show the Hispanic
population at 26.9 million, or just under 10 percent of the total
population. The Census Bureau predicts that will rise to more than
11 percent in 2000 and to 13.8 percent in 2010, with the Hispanic
population nudging out blacks to become the largest minority.
</P>
<P>
   In response, mainstream publications like Newsweek and People
have come out with Spanish editions, Ms. Kunda said, and bilingual
magazines like Latina are cropping up.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Hispanic radio stations has grown to more than
400, according to SRDS Hispanic Media and Market Source.
</P>
<P>
   And, while mainstream networks struggle to hold onto viewers in
a world full of cable channels, Univision Communications Inc., the
largest of two Hispanic networks, has grown to 2.8 million
prime-time viewers today from 1.3 million in 1993, according to
Anne Corley, vice president for public relations. It added more
viewers in the coveted 18-49-year-old segment than any other
network, including NBC, between 1993 and 1997, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to deliver a block of viewers has made Hispanic
television so popular in places like Miami and Los Angeles that
Spanish-language programming now leads in some time slots, said
Ernest Bromley, chief executive of Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates, a
Hispanic advertising agency in San Antonio that is part of the
D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles unit of the MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Bromley said, most advertisers were attracted to
the Hispanic market for political reasons. ``Now, it's for
marketing reasons,'' he said. ``They can see sales from the work
that they do.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanic Business tracks only those ads designed for the
Hispanic, mostly Spanish-speaking media, Maria Zate, senior editor
there, said a new breed of Hispanic ad has been cropping up over
the last two or three years. These ads are in English and appear in
mainstream media, she said, but are clearly aimed at Hispanic
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   She cites two examples, both for McDonald's Corp., one of the 10
largest advertisers to Hispanic consumers. One, she said, features
a father and daughter in a McDonald's restaurant, discussing the
girl's coming 15th-birthday gala.
</P>
<P>
   The other shows a toddler looking at McDonald's french fries, as
his eager father tries to prod him to speak. When the child utters
his first word, ``Papa,'' English-speaking viewers understand but
only Spanish speakers get the joke that the word also means potato,
Ms. Zate said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just how much is being spent on such crossover advertising is
tough to measure, she said, because determining whether the ad is
aimed at Hispanic consumers can be subjective.
</P>
<P>
   Ads in English for Hispanic people might become more common
because they now tend to be bilingual, she said. Figures from the
1990 census show that 9 million of the 17.3 million Americans who
spoke Spanish at home reported they also spoke English ``very
well.'' Another 3.8 million reported speaking it ``well.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``There's a lot of controversy there,'' because
making Hispanic ads in English could undercut agencies that deal in
Spanish-language ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bromley, Aguilar makes 85-90 percent of its ads in Spanish,
Bromley said. The percentage of the Hispanic population who speak
Spanish most of the time is going up, not down, he maintained.
``We're seeing people who are English-dominant who are becoming
more Hispanic,'' he said. ``They're reclaiming their language,
renewed pride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are people going to increase their knowledge of English? Of
course they are,'' Ms. Kunda said. ``Are they going to give up what
makes them Hispanic, what is important to them? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising tries to reach consumers on an emotional level, she
said, and for the Hispanic population, ``Spanish is the language of
the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic agencies will be needed for English ads as well, she
added, because of the cultural nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Nogales, chairman of the National Hispanic Media Coalition,
agrees that the Hispanic population will continue to have a
distinctive culture best appealed to with the aid of Hispanic
agencies. But he said the day when English ads for them outnumber
those in Spanish could be only 20 years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move is going from Spanish to English very fast,'' he
said. Of advertisers, he said, ``The population is moving from one
to another much faster than they perceive so they're getting left
behind.''

TEXAS EDUCATION PANEL VOTES TO UNLOAD $43 MILLION IN DISNEY STOCK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Name of Harryette Ehrhardt is cq) 
(see optional trim, optional ending) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ &UR;  &LR; A State Board of Education committee voted
Thursday to dump $43 million in Walt Disney Co. stock, despite
concerns the move makes bad sense financially and could push the
board down ``a slippery slope'' toward becoming the moral barometer
for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five percent of the entire S&AMP;P 500 fail some litmus
test or another,'' protested state Rep. Harryette Ehrhardt,
D-Dallas, who appeared with the liberal interest group Texas
Freedom Network at a press conference to denounce the move.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the decision was prompted by ``an influential
radical right organization'' whose primary concern is not the
welfare of Texas schoolchildren but the Disney company's practice
of extending health benefits to domestic partners of gay and
lesbian employees.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said if the board were truly concerned about children,
it would sell off major holdings in a host of other companies,
including a casino company, breweries, defense contractors and
those with human rights and labor relations problems _ all issues
that could fail some group's morality test.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal passed committee by a 2-0 vote, with two Democrats
abstaining in an effort to delay a final board vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done some rather foolish things with some of their
subsidiary investments,'' allowed member Will Davis of Austin, one
of the Democrats who tried to stall the vote. But, he added, ``It
is a slippery slope. Somebody's going to have something they don't
like about some of these big multifaceted corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   A final vote on the controversial proposal is expected Friday
before the full 15-member board, putting Texas in the position of
becoming the first state to tell the company _ which built its
reputation around wholesome family entertainment _ that it is not
going to put its money into companies that produce violent and
sexually explicit material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has taken a bold, firm stand that there's enough
violence exposed to the children, and explicitness _ just too
much,'' said Board Chairman Jack Christie, a Houston Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christie has thwarted previous efforts by social
conservatives on the board to unload Disney holdings, he said he
changed his mind after the American Family Association sent him a
video with excerpts from several movies, including ``Pulp
Fiction,'' ``Trainspotting'' and ``Chasing Amy,'' depicting
violence, sex and profanity. The movies were produced by Miramax
Films, a Disney subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do divest, I hope it sends a message to Miramax that the
public in general has had enough enough of exposing children to the
violence and explicitness in these movies,'' he said. ``How many
more school shootings do you want before we have to do something to
reverse that trend?''
</P>
<P>
   Abstaining with Davis on Thursday was Rene Nunez of El Paso, who
said he resented the pressure the vote would put on him by his
political opponent, Donna Ballard, an outspoken Republican and
social conservative from east Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Voting to sell the 406,000 shares of Disney held by the
Permanent School Fund were David Bradley of Beaumont and Richard
Neill of Fort Worth, both Republicans and social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Christie also said he hopes the AFA did not target Disney over
its tolerant policies toward gay and lesbian employees but rather
the violent and sexually explicit nature of some movies and
recordings produced by Disney subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any evidence of that but that wouldn't influence
my decision at all,'' Christie said. ``My main objection are the
excerpts from the films I saw from Miramax, that it would be a bad
future business investment.''
</P>
<P>
   In protesting the Disney decision, Ehrhardt noted that some
funds people may find objectionable are Harrah's Entertainment
Inc., a casino operator in which the schools own 170,000 shares of
stock valued at more than $3.9 million, and Wal-Mart, which sells
Miramax movies on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Other holdings include Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc., Asahi
Breweries Ltd., LVMH Moet Hennesey ADR, Atlantic Richfield Co.,
Avon Products Inc. and GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``To activists on the left you will have to justify holding the
stock of corporations tied to pollution, animal testing, red-lining
and armament sales to developing nations,'' Ehrhardt said. ``From
the right you will be assaulted for holding the stock of companies
that provide domestic partner benefits and cover the health care of
women who choose to terminate pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie said Ehrhardt and other representatives of the Texas
Freedom Network raised ``a very legitimate question'' about whether
the board has headed into a dangerous area of examining the
morality of all its investments. And he said he does not not know
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the moral compass of this state, and
shouldn't be,'' he said. ``We're standing on the edge of that
slippery slope. ... How long we can stand there, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was a good question whether the Permanent School
Fund ought to divest itself of stock in companies like Harrah's and
those that produce alcohol and beer, but that he is not ready to
re-examine all of the holdings in the $17.6 billion Permanent
School Fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL; 
State Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, in a statement opposing
divestiture, said, ``I think most Texas parents consider alcohol
and gambling to be a greater danger to the moral fiber of their
children than `Mulan.'''

</P>
<P>
   One brokerage analyst who follows Disney stock said it would be
a mistake to sell an investment in the entertainment giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very bullish on Disney,'' said Linda Bannister, analyst at
Edward Jones in St. Louis, enthusiastically noting that Disney is
planning to enter the cruise line business at a time when aging
baby boomers and other demographic factors are ``really playing
into the cruise lines' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Disney stock chalked up an investment return of 45
percent in the last year, easily surpassing the 29.7 percent return
of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index of large companies, a key
investment benchmark. The total return includes dividends and stock
price appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock closed Thursday at 111 1/4, up 2 15/16.

<P>
   But an official with the Social Investment forum in Washington,
D.C., praised the committee vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for investors to take a stand on important
social and environmental concerns,'' said Alisa Gravitz of the
Forum, a nonprofit association of people in the investment
industry. It has about 500 members nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gravitz said good portfolio managers can find other, morally
acceptable investments that will match or exceed the return that
Disney stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas school fund began purchasing Disney stock in 1996, and
since then has seen a total return of 108 percent, or 48 percent
annualized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is over the long term will Disney management
start changing their practices,'' Gravitz said. ``Our experience
has been that when a group of shareholders make a commitment and
work with the company over time that you see change down the line.

AMERICA'S TOUGHEST SHERIFF TUSSLES WITH HAIRDRESSER 
 F 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINA LEONARD AND RACHEL OCHOA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ America's Toughest Sheriff went toe-to-toe with a
drunken hairdresser Wednesday night and came out a winner, though
not without help.
</P>
<P>
   And not without receiving a blow to the throat and a reminder
that good deeds sometimes reap bad results.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sean Huskisson of Giggles Hair Salon apologized
from jail for punching Sheriff Joe Arpaio and two other officers as
they tried to prevent him from driving away from a Scottsdale
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Huskisson, 27, said he doesn't even remember tussling with
Arpaio, aide Dave Hendershott and a Scottsdale police officer in
the parking lot of When in Naples restaurant about 9 p.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   `'All I remember is waking up in a holding cell this morning,''
said Huskisson, who was arrested on suspicion of aggravated
assault, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what caused the situation to arise ... I don't
have a clue as to what happened.'' Later, he added: ``I meant no
harm. I apologize.``
</P>
<P>
   But Arpaio, who said Huskisson had ``super-strength,'' described
the incident differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was personal, because nothing (occurred) until he
saw me and started screaming and swearing,'' the sheriff said.
Huskisson first started fighting with Hendershott, Arpaio said, but
``when he saw me, something went crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio, his wife, Ava, and Hendershott, the department's
Director of Development and Operations, were leaving the restaurant
in the 7000 block of E. Shea Boulevard when they noticed Huskisson,
who was with three friends, stumbling toward his car, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hendershott attempted to stop the man from driving, a
struggle ensued, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It worsened after Huskisson noticed the sheriff, Arpaio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started swinging at me - I won't say what he said - but
evidently he knew who the sheriff was,'' Arpaio said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hendershott and Arpaio suffered minor injuries - sore
muscles, a few bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a swing in on my Adam's apple right here,'' Arpaio
said, pointing to his throat. ``He got in a good shot.``
</P>
<P>
   Stan Levine, who witnessed the attack, said Arpaio and
Hendershott were just trying to prevent a drunk from causing
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sheriff Arpaio) really saved these people's lives and other
people's lives too. If that fellow got behind the wheel, it could
have very well been a fatality,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   Huskisson was so intoxicated he could hardly walk, Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   Huskisson, whose blood-alcohol level was 0.186, said he started
drinking with friends about 6 p.m. He had a couple martinis, but
doesn't remember anything else.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Scottsdale police report, the friends were
leaving Such is Life Bar when Huskisson and his wife began arguing
over the car keys.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing this, Hendershott, who stands 5 feet 11 and weighs well
over 200 pounds, stepped in to help. While he was trying to subdue
Huskisson, who is 5 feet 9 inches, 170 pounds, the suspect saw
Arpaio and tried to approach him. The sheriff is 5 feet 9 inches
and 195 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to fight through me and his two friends to get
to the sheriff,`` Hendershott said.
</P>
<P>
   It finally took Hendershott, Arpaio, Huskisson's two friends and
a Scottsdale police officer to control Huskisson, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Hendershott said he was hit in the head and choked with his
necktie. Huskisson woke up at the Scottsdale police department
Thursday morning with scrapes and bruises, but no memory of the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   `'That doesn't surprise me,'' Hendershott said. ``Last night, he
sure remembered the sheriff. He went after the sheriff three
times.``
</P>
<P>
   Of Arpaio, Huskisson said his opinion is ``neither here nor
there.``
</P>
<P>
   A stylist at Giggles said Huskisson is ``one of the best
hairstylists in Scottsdale'' and doesn't believe he would attack
the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who asked to remain anonymous, said Huskisson just had
a baby girl and is a very nice person.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The press) is already tearing him up and he doesn't deserve
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies said they see no connection between
Wednesday's fight and past death threats against Arpaio, including
a May 11 threat that was broadcast on the Sheriff's Office radio
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   In that incident, a male voice or voices said, among other
things, ``Joe Arpaio. . .I'm goin' to kill him,'' and ``I'm going
to put a bullet in your brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast included details about how an attack was to be
carried out. Deputies say they're especially worried that whoever
made the threat had enough inside knowledge of the Sheriff's Office
communications to get into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Of the latest incident, Arpaio said he's glad Huskisson didn't
drive, but comes away with a sobering realization: ``I'm beginning
to learn there are people out there that do not like me.'' &QL;

POLITICIANS TURN UP HEAT ON HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two years, opinion polls have signaled that
voters are dissatisfied with their health maintenance organizations
and want greater freedom in choosing doctors and seeking
treatments. Now, with the November elections approaching,
politicians are turning HMO reform into a major campaign issue, one
that could soon swamp the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   From California to Georgia, House and Senate candidates are
bashing HMOs in television ads. And in Congress, Republican leaders
who once balked at new HMO rules are rushing to write their own
bill, fearful that Democrats have beaten them to a winning campaign
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is incredibly potent,'' said Mark Mellman, a
Democratic pollster. ``I don't think there will be a Senate race, a
congressional race or a gubernatorial race this year where this
issue is not debated in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long favored new rules on HMOs, in some measure
as a reaction to media accounts of insurers denying patients needed
medical care and limiting their ability to pick their own doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Support for new HMO regulations marks a change of heart for
Republicans leaders in Congress. Last November, Senate GOP leader
Trent Lott warned insurance and employer groups to prepare for
``war'' against new HMO rules, and his office reportedly told
lobbyists to ``get off your butts, get off your wallets'' to
prepare for the battle. Now Republcians feel they must put forth
some kind of HMO legisiation to counter the Democratic initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent of all Americans get health coverage through
managed care programs. Under the most prominent Democratic plan,
HMOs would have to allow patients to see a doctor out of the HMO
network, at no extra charge, if there is no appropriate doctor in
the network. Patients would have the right to appeal HMO treatment
decisions to an outside panel. HMOs would have to pay emergency
room bills if ``a prudent layperson'' thought the hospital visit
was necessary. The most controverisal provision allows patients to
sue HMOs that deny them needed care, a right most patients do not
have today.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal is tougher on HMOs than are most state
laws, and it is more far-reaching than a proposal now before the
Massachusetts legislature.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are proposing a narrower bill that does not
include the right to sue an HMO for withholding treatment. Senate
Republicans have not yet unveiled their bill, but it is expected to
look similar to the House GOP proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the insurance industry is running TV and print
advertisements opposing any new federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   One HMO group, the American Association of Health Plans, says it
has spent about $2 million on a public relations campaign opposing
new federal rules. ``We're going to be investing a lot more as we
go through the year. It will be significant,'' said Mark Merritt,
the group's chief of strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say that most people are satisfied with their health
plans, and that the new federal rules will drive up costs and force
some employers to cut health benefits. ``Nearly two million
Americans could lose health coverage,'' claims one AAHP television
ad, which accuses politicians of bashing HMOs merely to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers alone may not match the $40 million that tobacco
companies reportedly spent to help kill this year's tobacco bill.
But the pricetag of the HMO debate is sure to rise as candidates
seize on it as an issue for this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the candidates are going to spend a fortune on this,''
said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a consumer group that supports
new HMO regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have already started. ``If you can choose who
changes the oil in your car, you should be able to choose who
delivers your baby,'' says Roy Barnes, a Democratic candidate for
Georgia governor, in a TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have led a successful fight to let doctors, not insurance
companies, decide how long women stay in the hospital after a
mastectomy,'' says Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic congressional
candidate in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   While the rhetoric may sound familiar, some analysts warn that
parallels to the fight over President Clinton's 1993 health reform
plan are limited.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, more people belong to HMOs than in 1993, and some
pollsters say many of them are anxious about their health care. And
this time, their anger is focused on one villain: the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, doctors are not seen as the greedy ones,'' said Bob
Castro, a Republican pollster, at a health politics forum Thursday.
``There has been a blame-shift to the insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   That stands in contrast to the failed 1993 &UR;  &LR; effort, when
patients, businesses and health providers all felt they would have
to sacrifice something to institute a new health care system, said
Pollack of Families USA. ``This time, no one feels their ox is
being gored, except for the HMOs -- and no one cares about them,''
Pollack said. ``In fact, that makes it better, because the HMOs are
unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Mellman, Democrats can cast their proposal as
the government using its policing and regulatory powers to set new
rules for HMOs. By contrast, voters saw the Clinton plan as using
the government's ``bureaucratic and programmatic powers'' to set up
a large new bureacracy, which many opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is percolating not only in this year's congressional
campaigns but in state races as well. On Wednesday, Bob Taft, a
Republican candidate for the governor of Ohio, backed part of a
Democratic rival's health care plan, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, Representative Jim Bunning faces criticism from his
opponent in a US Senate race for backing away from a bill that
would have imposed tough rules on HMOs. Bunning had signed on as a
co-sponsor of the bill, then withdrew his name.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Senate, Democrats have stalled a variety of
legislation by threatening to attach their managed-care proposal to
nearly every bill that comes to the floor. The threat forced
Republican leaders to set aside an appropriations bill for the
Veterans Administration, and it is partly responsible for forcing
Republicans to delay action on a product liability bill that they
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have said that Lott, the GOP leader, will not allow a
debate or vote on their managed care bill because it is sure to
draw support from Republican senators facing elections this fall.
Tom Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, Thursday predicted the
measure would win ``60-some'' votes if a simple up-or-down vote was
held.

UNION ORGANIZATION DRIVE EXPOSES FLAWS IN NATION'S LABOR LAWS

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Five years ago, the workers at Avondale shipyard
voted to join a union, with hundreds of them cheering wildly
outside the company's headquarters along the Mississippi when the
vote count was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is still no union at the shipyard. The 50,000 pages
of documents _ furious charges and countercharges _ stacked in the
offices of the National Labor Relations Board are evidence of what
took place instead: one of the longest, most heavily litigated
unionization fights in the board's history. At a time when labor
unions nationwide are stepping up efforts to organize millions of
workers, labor leaders and even some government officials point to
the Avondale battle as proof that the nation's labor laws are
cumbersome and replete with loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   National union leaders assert that the laws encourage Avondale
and other companies to dismiss union supporters and use other
illegal tactics to beat back organizing drives because it can take
five years or more before the courts order an employer to accept a
union. By that time, some organizing efforts have died.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, acknowledging the problem, say scores of
cases are caught up in this legal limbo, as companies file appeal
after appeal. These include Overnite Trucking, which is fighting a
Teamsters' organizing drive at its terminals nationwide, and the
Santa Fe Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, which has litigated for
five years against a hotel workers' election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many Avondale workers say they desperately need a union to raise
wages at the lowest-paying major shipyard in the nation and to end
Avondale's unusually high rate of fatal accidents. According to the
union, at least 29 workers have died in accidents since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, two years after a hearing officer upheld the
election, the labor board certified the Metal Trades Council as the
union for the Avondale workers, which would normally bring
negotiations for a labor contract. Instead, Avondale refused to
recognize the union or bargain with it and began its appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process to put a union in takes too long,'' said Harry Lee
Thompson, a pipefitter who began working at Avondale in 1969, after
returning from Vietnam. ``Five years is too much. It's a slap in
the face of the working man.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Feinstein, the labor board's general counsel, said the
Avondale case had exposed many weak links in the system. He
acknowledged that the mountain of papers and months of hearings had
taxed the board's staff to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to take issue with the notion that it's frustrating
that an election that took place five years ago still hasn't come
to conclusion,'' Feinstein said. ``It's something we're looking at
as an example of the process not being what it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Avondale case, a judge with the National Labor Relations
Board found that in the company's zeal to keep the union out, it
had violated the law more than 70 times, dismissing, for example,
28 workers because they supported the union. Even though those
workers were dismissed four or more years ago, none of them have
been reinstated because Avondale is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Defending its lengthy legal maneuvering, Avondale Industries,
the nation's largest nonunion shipbulder, asserts that the vote for
the union was tainted by fraud. Avondale, which beat back
organizing drives in decades past, insists that unionization would
hurt it by pushing up production costs and causing it to lose
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a new campaign to show that stubborn employers can
make a mockery out of the right to organize, the AFL-CIO is
pointing to Avondale as the nation's leading corporate outlaw for
the way it has kept unionization efforts at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avondale struggle is important because it's a group of
workers who have tried so hard for so long to form a union, and
they've had everything thrown in their way,'' said John Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO. ``We're seeing the rule of labor law
becoming the rule of hypocrisy _ corporations that pretend to be
upstanding citizens and live off taxpayer money violate fundamental
laws that are supposed to protect workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Avondale workers point to what they view as an unfortunate
contradiction. Officials from one federal agency _ the labor board
_ found Avondale guilty of ``egregious misconduct'' and ``an
outrageous and pervasive number'' of labor law violations. Yet
those at another federal department _ the Navy _ recently awarded
Avondale a $685 million contract to build amphibious assault craft,
with the possibility of $5 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Avondale workers often say they need a union to get fair wages
and fair treatment at the shipyard, which looks like a giant
erector set in the shadow of the Huey P. Long Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Wages range from $8 an hour for the least-skilled workers
($16,600 a year) to $13.50 an hour ($28,000 a year) for welders and
pipefitters, including those with 25 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ingalls shipyard in neighboring Mississippi, the top pay
rate is $2 an hour higher, while at the Bath Iron Works
shipbuilding concern in Maine, top pay is $3.50 more, or 26 percent
higher. Both are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale's pensions are also low. Retirees with 30 years'
experience often receive $300 a month. And many workers complain
that they cannot afford Avondale's family health insurance, which
costs them almost $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another big worry is safety. According to the most recent
federal statistics, 12 Avondale workers died in accidents from 1982
to 1994, often from falls or having large pieces of metal crash
down on them. That's twice the number at the shipyards with the
second largest number of deaths, Tampa Bay Ship Building, in
Florida, and National Steel and Shipbuilding, in San Diego. And
Avondale's death toll is more e than double the number at its
larger competitors, Ingalls and Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale officials say they have improved their record, noting
that there have been no deaths since 1994. In a statement,
Avondale, the largest private employer in the New Orleans region,
said it has ``an excellent safety record relative to the rest of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Pyburn Jr., an Avondale lawyer, maintained that the labor
board's tortoise-like pace, and not the shipbuilder, had caused the
years of delay. Repeated appeals are justified, he said, because
the company believes that the labor board failed to properly
oversee the election and that the unionization vote was fraudulent
for numerous reasons, including that some voters failed to show
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale's chairman, Albert L. Bossier Jr., said in a recent
statement, ``We did not believe at the time of the election that
the union was supported by anywhere near a majority of Avaondale
workers nor do we believe they have any significant support in our
work force today.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union supporters argue that the labor board needs to act
faster and that unions should be installed quickly after winning an
election, just as political candidates are. If the labor board or
courts overturn the election, national union officials say, then
the union should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   For many workers, the dispute is not about abstruse legal
issues, but bread-and-butter ones. Avondale, the home of the
shipyard, and other communities around the port are hardly
prosperous, with the area replete with dilapidated one-story houses
and aging pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Pyburn defended Avondale's wage levels, saying they are the
highest of any shipyard in the area. But many Avondale workers say
they have relatives at nearby shipyards who earn more than
Avondale's top rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sweatshop, with such low wages,'' said Mike Boudreaux,
a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a labor board judge found that Avondale intimidated
employees so systematically that he ordered an unusual remedy. In
addition to reinstating illegally dismissed workers, the judge,
David Evans, ordered Bossier, Avondale's chairman, to read a
statement _ or stand alongside a board official who read a
statement _ to the shipyard's 5,300 workers, cataloguing its labor
law violations and pledging to end such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Evans ruled that Avondale had sought to suppress the union by
punishing dozens of workers because they supported the union.
Federal labor law bars managers from retaliating against union
supporters. Evans found that Avondale had acted illegally in
discharging the 28 pro-union workers, suspending 5 others, issuing
18 warning notices, denying benefits to 8 employees and assigning
``onerous'' work to 8 others.
</P>
<P>
   Pyburn said the workers were disciplined for valid reasons, like
leaving work stations without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal labor law, administrative law judges make the
initial decisions in labor dispute, and those decisions can then be
appealed to the full labor board and after that to a U.S. Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the labor board rules against Avondale on its appeal
regarding the dismissals and discipline, the shipyard could appeal
to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where it has already
appealed the ruling upholding the election. The company can also
appeal to the Supreme Court. These appeals could take at least
another year, meaning that workers dismissed in 1993 might not have
a chance at reinstatement until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, union supporters nationwide say it is fruitless to
look to the labor board and courts for redress. Instead, many
Avondale workers are rallying behind a campaign that aims to
pressure Avondale to recognize the union. They are demonstrating
outside the shipyard, getting dozens of clergymen to denounce
Avondale and urging the Navy to take a tougher stance toward
Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the Vietnam War veteran, said: ``A foreman once said
to me, `Why are you passing out handbills for the union? You're one
of the top-paid people and you're going to retire soon.' I said,
`Maybe one day my son or relative will want to come out here. I
want them to get a fair shake on wages and benefits. I want them to
be treated better than I'm treated.' If someone doesn't stand up
for something, then where will we be?''

DOCTORS TO BUY A STAKE AND RUN 2 CHICAGO HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a novel effort to take control of their patients' care, a
group of physicians said Thursday that they had reached agreement
to salvage an eminent teaching and research hospital on Chicago's
South Side that had been especially rocked by the turmoil in the
nation's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians and an Arizona investment firm said they would
buy the 523-bed Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center and a
smaller hospital. The physicians, who would be minority owners,
would hold a majority of the seats on the board and would control
the hospitals' operations.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. is selling Reese and the 212-bed
Grant Hospital, in Lincoln Park, for $60 million to the physicians
and Doctors Community Healthcare Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz., and a
company that is buying debt owed the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, the latest of three owners in a decade, is under
federal investigation for fraudulent billing practices, and the
sale is part of a vast reorganization of the company. Columbia
bought eight hospitals in the Chicago area in a now abandoned
effort to become a major presence in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Health care industry analysts said the transaction was another
approach in physicians' efforts to unite to fight managed
care-organizations and for-profit hospital chains, like Columbia,
which have chipped away at their incomes and patient care
prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have often formed and bought hospitals, but most are
small, suburban and specialized. The Reese venture is unusual for
its size and its focus on the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``That arrangement _ a silent corporate partner giving
physicians control over everything but the budgeting aspect _
that's unusual,'' said Richard Wade, senior vice president and
chief spokesman for the American Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   But in a climate of cost constraint, Wade asked, ``will they be
able to make the tough decisions to secure the future of the
institution?''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they expected at least 200 of 1,200 affiliated
physicians to pay $10,000 to $30,000 each to buy 20 percent
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tuft, chairman and principal owner of the investment firm,
said he would have the last word on the annual budget. The
hospitals' chief executive will report to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Reese Hospital, one of Chicago's biggest hospitals,
occupies about 40 acres along Lake Michigan. It was established in
1881 by an immigrant German Jew and California real estate
developer, Michael Reese, to serve the city's growing Jewish
population.
</P>
<P>
   But in time, Jews moved beyond the inner city, to the North
Shore. Financial support stalled and new settlers, blacks and
Mexican-Americans, moved into the South Side. About 10 years ago,
the owners sold the company to a managed care organization, Humana,
which sold the hospital in 1993 to Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors complained that both owners let facilities and services
decline. With the spread of managed care and the expanded use of
outpatient care, Chicago, like most cities, found itself with more
hospital beds than it needed. Reese, the doctors feared, would be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's excess supply,'' said Dr. Claudia Fegan, an
internist and Reese's medical director. ``But this is about access.
This population, on the South Side, is not a population that would
be served if we go away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 25 percent of the hospital's patents are covered by
Medicaid, the state-federal health program for the poor, and 35
percent, many of whom are also poor, by Medicare, the program for
the elderly, Dr. Enrique Beckmann said. Beckmann is a pathologist
and president of Reese-Grant Acquisition Group, which first
approached Tuft about buying the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main focus,'' Beckmann said, ``has been to make sure we
don't lose this community asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Reese physicians questioned whether any for-profit investor
would provide the financing and support they said Reese needs.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Humana and Columbia, Dr. Quentin Young, an internist and
president of the American Public Health Association, said: ``I just
happen to believe that when you add `for-profit' the record is
clear. You get very bad results.'' Tuft, who has made similar
investments in three smaller hospitals in Massachusetts, California
and Washington, D.C., said he hoped to prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that health care is very, very, very local,'' he
said. ``We look at ourselves as stewards of health care for the
community, and that means keeping the entity viable.''

TOBACCO COMPANIES, STATES SOUGHT SETTLEMENT IN SECRET TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to revise lede, drop reference to North Carolina in 3rd
graf. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for producers and state attorneys general held
secret talks in recent weeks in an effort to devise a new tobacco
settlement proposal, state officials and lawyers with knowledge of
the discussions say.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which follow the collapse last month of a $516
billion comprehensive tobacco bill in the Senate, apparently grew
out of a court-ordered effort to mediate an upcoming
smoking-related lawsuit brought by the state of Washington against
the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations then expanded to include officials from other
states with pending lawsuits, including New York, California and
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer, who represents numerous states in actions brought
against cigarette producers, said that negotiations between the
industry and state officials had broken off Wednesday night over
monetary and other issues. And another person close to the tobacco
industry confirmed that the talks had broken off over money.
</P>
<P>
   But two state officials, who also spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that they had been told Thursday by colleagues that
the talks were still alive and that details about them would be
discussed during a national meeting of state attorneys general
expected to start Monday outside Durango, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorneys general have always said that if Plan A didn't
work then we would always go with Plan B,'' said Jeffrey Modisett,
the attorney general of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the tobacco industry and 40 state attorneys general
reached a $368.5 billion settlement plan that, if approved by
Congress, would have settled lawsuits by states and smokers,
restricted advertising by tobacco companies and required producers
to pay fines if youth smoking rates did not decline. In return, the
producers would have received protection from certain types of
lawsuits and claims for punitive damages in smoking-related cases.
</P>
<P>
   But a tobacco bill introduced by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
increased the settlement figure to $516 billion while lawmakers
removed the legal protections sought by the industry. As a result,
tobacco producers withdrew from last year's accord and launched an
intensive effort that helped derail the McCain bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tobacco company executives remained concerned about
smoking-related lawsuits brought by states, which they consider the
most difficult and costly cases pending against them. And some
state officials have said that they also remain eager, in the
absence of federal action, to settle their cases and reap the
monetary and public health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Philip Morris Cos. and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.,
the parent company of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, declined Thursday to
comment on the settlement talks. A spokesman for Christine
Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general who participated in
the recent discussions, also said that she would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Black, a tobacco industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co., said that he estimated that a new settlement offer by the
industry to the 37 states with remaining lawsuits would likely be
in the range of $200 billion to $240 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under last June's $368.5 billion proposal, about $196.5 billion
would have gone to the states, with the remainder going to the
federal government. Over the past year, however, the tobacco
industry has paid out about $36 billion to settle lawsuits brought
by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From a public health perspective, any new proposal negotiated
between state attorneys general and tobacco producers would likely
be modeled around the $6.5 billion settlement reached in May
between the industry and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   That accord, which like previous state settlements bans tobacco
advertisements on billboards and near schools, also bars producers
from, among other things, misrepresenting the health hazards of
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But any statewide plan would differ from last June's proposal
because it is not expected to include a federal component: It would
not deal with federal regulation of nicotine or provide companies
with relief from lawsuits brought by smokers, insurers or
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   According to people familiar with the talks, the new round of
negotiations began about three weeks ago when a court ordered
mediation to resolve the state of Washington's lawsuit against
tobacco producers. That lawsuit, which is seeking to recover
billions spent treating tobacco-related diseases, is scheduled to
start in September.
</P>
<P>
   During those talks, two tobacco industry lawyers, Arthur Golden
and Meyer Koplow, and Joe Rice, a lawyer from Charleston, S.C., who
represents about 25 states with tobacco lawsuits, met with Ms.
Gregoire, the Washington attorney general, to discuss bringing
other states into the talks, said lawyers familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the talks were expanded to include several other
states like New York and California, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rice and Golden declined comment and Koplow did not return
telephone calls Thursday. A spokesman for Dennis Vacco, the New
York attorney general, declined comment and the office of Dan
Lundgren, the California attorney general, did not return a
telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   However, versions of how the talks broke down differed sharply.
While one person close to the tobacco industry said that state
officials had demanded too much money, a state official said that
producers had made a ``low-ball'' offer.
</P>
<P>
   But even if talks resume, as some state officials expect,
reaching a new deal may be complex because of the posture of both
the tobacco industry and those states with unresolved lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   While some states are eager to settle or have done little work
to advance their lawsuits, a few states like Wisconsin and Maryland
have been working hard to prepare their cases and have shown little
interest in settling prior to trial. &QL;

WOODWARD PURSUES `COME AND GET ME' STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly broke and an ocean away, Louise Woodward seems
to have decided to hold up her hands and let the Eappen family try
to collect a civil judgment against her, legal analysts said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strategy,'' said Boston attorney Thomas Hoopes. ``This
way she doesn't have to sit down and negiotiate. She just says
`Come and get me, but I don't have anything anyway.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Telling her family's attorney in England that she could not
afford to fund her defense, Woodward removed herself from the first
step in the civil suit pending against her in a U.S. District
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Now a judge will decide how much the life of baby Matthew Eappen
was worth, as his parents, Sunil and Deborah, try to prevent the au
pair convicted of killing their son from benefiting from the sale
of her story.
</P>
<P>
   Once a dollar amount is set in the civil suit, it would be
difficult for the Eappens to prevent Woodward from receiving money
from a media outlet for her story, so long as she is not paid in
the United States, or by a company covered by US law, said Boston
attorney Roderick MacLeish, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are open issues about the international enforcement of a
judgment,'' he said, referring to a treaty currently pending before
the U.S. Senate that would make it easier to collect international
civil judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cases are examined by British courts on an individual
basis, and, in general, they are not enforced, according to several
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens could choose to file suit in England, MacLeish said,
to help ensure the collection of any funds Woodward might receive.
But it would be more likely that they would choose to sue any media
outlet that might offer money to the former au pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a sizeable verdict, it probably won't be
meaningless, because it will prevent Louise Woodward from doing
business with any enity that is subject to the jurisdiction of the
U.S. courts,'' MacLeish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may get a little tricky because everyone will be alert to
this,'' he said. ``So money could change hands without everyone
knowing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joseph Balliro, Jr. said that if Woodward changed her
mind, and decided to fight the case after all, she could argue for
a special dispensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in another country, and it makes it susbsantially
difficult for her to attend to a matter in federal court,'' Balliro
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for defendants in civil suits to default,
specialists say, though it is far less likely to occur in cases of
wrongful death because defendants usually feel their reputation is
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hoopes: ``What's uncommon about this is that you have
someone who protested her innocence to the whole world, and now the
protestation has collapsed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Stock Exchange may be the market of
choice for investors who want the best execution of their
securities trades.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Kord Lagemann, a securities lawyer in New York,
says those lodging complaints against their brokers appear less
likely to succeed at the Exchange's arbitration department.
</P>
<P>
   He bases his conclusion on the results of customer arbitration
cases filed at nine self-regulatory securities organizations since
1980. Lagemann found that the percentage of arbitration hearings
held by regulators at the Big Board that led to awards for
customers fell to 41.4 percent last year from 51.3 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is the opposite at the nation's biggest
self-regulatory organization, the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market. Last year,
58.4 percent of the customers who brought complaints against
brokerages there won something. In 1990, 54 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   Lagemann recently pointed out this widening gap between the two
exchanges in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Chris Ullman, a spokesman for the commission, said: ``While
statistics can tell different stories, this study has piqued our
interest, and we are going to look into it. We are not going to
wait until the next scheduled review of the New York Stock
Exchange.'' The SEC reviews arbitration procedures at each
self-regulatory organization about every two years.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration information that Lagemann consulted goes back to
1980 and was compiled by the Securities Industry Conference on
Arbitration, a rule-making body formed at the Securities and
Exchange Commission's behest in 1976. It includes customer cases
that went before the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, as well
as the regional exchanges and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 6,665 arbitration cases were filed by customers
against their brokerage firms last year. (Brokerage customers are
generally required to resolve disputes in arbitration rather than
in the courts under the agreement they sign with their brokers upon
opening an account.) The bulk of the cases filed last year _ 90
percent, or 5,997 _ went to regulators at the NASD. A distant
second was the Big Board, which received 546.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of cases received by the NASD in this bull
market have more than doubled in the last decade, they have fallen
by 52 percent at the Big Board. The NASD might be expected to
handle the most arbitration cases, since it oversees 5,573 firms
nationwide. The New York Stock Exchange oversees 441 member firms,
and only 283 of those conduct business with public customers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the number of cases is so much smaller at the Big Board,
its win rates may be more volatile as well. Just a few more
customer victories, for example, can push up its win rate far more
than they could at the NASD.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trend is clear. In 1996, customers arbitrating at the
Big Board won only 33.6 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Like most securities lawyers contacted for this article,
Lagemann gives the New York Stock Exchange high marks for
efficiency and staff professionalism in its handling of arbitration
cases. ``In all respects other than the win rates, arbitrating at
the New York Stock Exchange is far preferable,'' Lagemann said.
``The arbitration counsel are courteous, they get cases heard in
six or seven months, administratively it is so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   James E. Buck, senior vice president and secretary of the New
York Stock Exchange, said that the question should not be why the
Big Board has lower win rates, but why the NASD has higher victory
rates. ``The New York Stock Exchange has the highest regulatory
standards, so we tend to have the best firms, and the fewest major
mishaps,'' he said. ``All of the recent cases, the debacles that
have spawned large numbers of arbitration cases, Stratton Oakmont,
Hanover Sterling, Bevill Bressler, First Jersey Securities,'' have
been NASD firms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Buck is correct about this. And, for comparison purposes, data
are not available on the win rates for firms that are members of
both the New York Stock Exchange and the NASD, which would
eliminate the effect of more risky penny stock firms in the NASD.
</P>
<P>
   Penny-stock firms, though, are far from new for the NASD. Back
in the late 1980s, when Blinder Robinson, Stuart James and other
notorious penny-stock firms were alive and kicking, the customer
arbitration results between the two organizations were comparable.
</P>
<P>
   When a case is brought to the New York Stock Exchange, the
exchange's arbitration counsel picks a three-person panel to rule.
The plaintiff can reject any of the people selected for cause and
is allowed to reject one, if need be, without supplying a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Are there differences between the panels? Some lawyers think so.
Lewis Lowenfels, a securities lawyer in New York who has brought
many arbitration cases said: ``In my experience, arbitration panels
at the NASD are more customer oriented. They seem to be more of a
populist forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Bentley, an attorney in Newark, N.J., specializing in
arbitration matters was, in the early 1980s, arbitration counsel at
the New York Stock Exchange. What concerns him about the current
gap in win rates is that it may point to too much control by the
Exchange's arbitration counsel in the selection of the panel. ``If
they went to a random selection process, they would take that
potential for prejudice out of the system,'' he said.

 &HT;    Coming togethert to fight fire
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM COAST, Fla. _ On the road to Greg Weston's neighborhood, a
sheet hangs between two trees with the message ``HOME OF THE BRAVE
(firefighters).''
</P>
<P>
   Weston, a sheriff's deputy, has been one of those firefighters
for the past month in Flagler County, where deputies, paramedics
and even regular citizens were pressed into service to try to save
this small county.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday night, just hours before the county was evacuated,
Weston's own house burned down while he fought a fire at the other
end of the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew, even if I was here, there was nothing I could have
done,'' Weston said Thursday morning, standing at his old address.
``There was an identical house over there that had three firetrucks
sitting on it. The same thing. It's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard on the police radio that his house was going to
burn, he called his wife. She had about an hour to get their sons,
Alex, 2, and Paul, 6, and a few photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's great. Last night was the first time she cried,'' he
said. Last night they sent their sons to Pennsylvania with his
parents. ``You should have been there last night, trying to put
Paul in the van. He kept saying, `I want to go home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Weston isn't going to let his children see what used to be their
home.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to start building a new one Monday. Thursday, he was on
the job, as he has been all week since his home burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `As long as my family's safe, I gotta keep working,'
'' said fellow deputy Chris Oh. ``I guess that's the Marine in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   He's one of hundreds of people in Flagler County who have gone
above and beyond the call of duty in the past month in this rural
county. Officials don't know how many of the 100 volunteer and 18
paid firefighters have been injured because none would leave the
fires _ paramedics went to the front lines where they bandaged them
up and sent them back to their hoses. Even the chiefs and captains
were fighting fires. The county's emergency operations director was
hospitalized Wednesday for exhaustion or heat-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to meals, citizens loaded up pickups full of what
they had cooked and collected at churches and in their
neighborhoods. Officials wouldn't take it at the emergency
operations center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd tell them where a fire was and ask them to take it to the
firefighters,'' Rich Weizer, Flagler's emergency spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Shinnick, 72, a volunteer firefighter, abandoned his sign
painting business to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can just wait for the signs,'' Shinnick said. ``Something
like this is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of the Palm Coast volunteer fire station, another sheet
hangs with a message on it, this one from the firefighters who
continued fighting after the county was evacuated and are still
fighting now that the residents have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome home.''

SEN. MCCAIN PRAISED, CRITICIZED FOR BILL TO CUT AIRCRAFT  NOISE
OVER PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain was applauded Thursday for a bill
to reduce aircraft noise over national parks, but then he was
accused of using the same bill to help a Phoenix-based airline and
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican won approval of the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee, which he heads, for a measure
that would allow greater federal control over commercial air-tour
operators.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was criticized by citizens' groups opposed to another
provision in the bill designed to enhance airline competition by
permitting more takeoffs and landings at such airports as Chicago's
O'Hare and Washington's Reagan National.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would grant Phoenix-based America West Airlines what it
has long sought from Congress: the opportunity to fly nonstop from
Phoenix to Washington's Reagan National Airport, a key business
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have impugned my motives, suggesting that my secret
purpose is to convenience my own travel between Washington and
Arizona,'' McCain said in a statement prepared when the bill was
introduced. ``I find this charge wearisome and offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even so,'' McCain continued, ``to allay these concerns, I have
pledged not to take a nonstop flight from (Reagan National) to
Arizona should such an opportunity ever result from this
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied, members of several groups accused McCain of
ignoring local plans to limit the expansion of Reagan National,
which is just across the Potomac River from the capital, and to
direct more flights to a suburban airport, Dulles International.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to just run roughshod over the local population''
in the District of Columbia area, said Don MacGlashan, spokesman
for Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise.
</P>
<P>
   MacGlashan said it was ``interesting'' that America West would
benefit from the bill. ``Obviously, it will open up a lot of things
for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives said that relaxing the
flight-mileage rule that was holding America West back ``is for the
benefit of travelers across the nation, not for any one airline.''
The Transportation Department would still need to certify that
exemptions to the rule are in the consumer interest.
</P>
<P>
   America West flies nonstop to Dulles International but must make
a stop from the West before landing at Reagan National.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bill would lift that restriction by allowing exemptions
to a rule forbidding carriers from flying into Reagan National from
a distance greater than 1,250 miles. The rule is designed partly to
steer traffic toward the newer Dulles airport.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, McCain aides said that adding more flights _ and,
in the one case, allowing them to fly a longer distance _ is
designed to increase airline-industry competition, resulting in
better service and lower fares. Other members of the Commerce
Committee agreed with McCain's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bill Franke, chairman and chief executive officer of
America West Holdings Corp., said that flying nonstop to Reagan
National from Arizona ``would be really significant.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said last year that, to mollify critics, he would agree
to a continued ban on nonstop flights from Arizona to Reagan
National. But he decided instead merely to apply the ban to his own
travel so as not to punish others, according to Ives.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won plaudits for the park overflights provision, which
would require companies to apply to the federal government for
authority to conduct air tours over national parks.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bill wouldn't apply to Grand Canyon National Park,
which has its own air-route requirements. Environmental groups have
challenged those requirements in federal court, contending they are
not stringent enough to restore the canyon's natural quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Although approving the bill, the Commerce Committee planned to
return to consider some minor amendments next week.

NEAR ABORTION INTENSIFIES PARTIAL-BIRTH DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV   AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Partway through the procedure, a doctor realized the
late-term fetus he was aborting was in fact a full-term baby and
delivered the infant instead. The error has angered activists on
both sides of the issue and intensified the fight over abortions
performed well into a woman's pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise birth late last month came after ultrasound testing
at the A-Z Women's Center, which terminates pregnancies through the
24th week, showed the teenage mother was 23.6 weeks pregnant,
Phoenix police said. But the doctor, who has had run-ins with
Arizona medical authorities before, delivered a 37-week-old baby
girl weighing 6 pounds, 2 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's skull was fractured and she had lacerations on her
face, but she showed no signs of brain damage, Phoenix police said.
A Texas couple now plans to adopt her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This highlights the fine line between where you separate life
from death and it will do nothing but help the cause,'' said Robert
Trynham, spokesman for Senator Rick Santorum, the Pennsylvania
Republican who last year sponsored a bill banning so-called
partial-birth abortions, which passed the House and Senate but was
vetoed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of a woman's right to an abortion, even late in
her pregnancy, said the potentially fatal error in Phoenix had
nothing to do with abortion, everything to do with medical
ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't have anything to do with partial-birth
abortion,'' said Betsy Cavendish, legal director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League, which supports reproductive rights.
``This was a case of malpractice. ... It appears something went
awry and those who are responsible will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is also likely to resound in Washington, where
legislators are preparing to take up the issue of late-term
abortions once again.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two weeks, on July 23, the House is scheduled to
vote whether to override Clinton's veto; the Senate is expected to
take up the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which would forbid the
procedure except to save a mother's life, in September. A
two-thirds majority is needed in both chambers to override the
veto, and the Senate vote is expected to be tight.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, employees at the A-Z Women's Center, housed in a
concrete block-and-stucco building beside a medical center, turned
away all questions about the baby's unexpected birth Thursday. Not
a single patient sat in the clinic's waiting room, which is filled
with row after row of pastel-flecked chairs and must be entered
through a thatched steel cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cooperating 100 percent with police,'' said a woman in
a white medical coat.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Biskind, who delivered the child, could not be reached
for comment at his home in Scottsdale. But the Arizona Board of
Medical Examiners said it has had contact with him before; Biskind,
licensed in Arizona since 1981, was censured by the agency for
``gross neglect'' two years ago because a 26-year-old woman left
the clinic after an abortion and bled to death, records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint over quality of care is pending against Biskind, and
his file at the medical board contains a ``letter of concern'' over
the inappropriate prescribing of medicine and another for
misdiagnosis or mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police are investigating the baby's birth on June 30,
but are uncertain whether any laws were broken, said Sergeant Mike
Torres. At the same time, Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley
would like a chance to investigate and hopes police refer the case
on to his office, said spokesman Bill Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Under the criminal code, a Phoenix physician may not attempt to
abort a viable fetus unless a second physician is on hand to take
over in case a live birth occurs. Performing an abortion after 26
weeks is illegal in Arizona, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, 17, went to the clinic after a home pregnancy test
result was positive, police said, and an ultrasound was performed.
The mother, whose identity was not disclosed, returned the next day
to undergo a late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question really is what did (Biskind) know and when did he
know it,'' said one local law enforcement official, who requested
anonymity. ``Of course, his answer will be: `It came as a total
shock to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although no criminal charges have been filed, the fact that the
mother was 17 years old and that the clinic mistook a baby for a
fetus is expected to add to the debate over the controversial but
legal procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. During
the procedure, the fetus's skull is collapsed and then the now-dead
fetus is delivered through the birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   The question of wrongly estimating the fetus's age has not been
a focus of past debate; abortion foes did not make it an issue
Thursday. Instead, the debate has centered on the morality of
aborting a late-term fetus whose life doctors would try to save
under other circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That a doctor made a mistake is not the issue,'' said Douglas
Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life
Committee, a group that opposes all forms of abortion. ``It is the
routine practice of killing a baby at 5 months.''
</P>
<P>
   The half-page advertisement for A-Z Women's Center in the Yellow
Pages promotes the clinic as ``the only Abortion Provider in
Arizona up to 24 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates and opponents, however, said that other clinics and
hospitals in the area perform the procedure but that most decline
to advertise for fear of attracting antiabortion demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason this baby is getting so much attention is that
it lived,'' said Dr. Carolyn Gerster, chairwoman for Arizona Right
to Life, a former member of the state medical board and a sometime
demonstrator outside the A-Z clinic. ``It will certainly focus
attention on the issue and maybe get more people to ask, `What's
the cut-off for performing abortions.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gerster, abortion opponents around the country seized on
the baby's birth to draw attention to abortion in general and
partial-birth abortions in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case reminds us of the truth about abortion _ that
innocent lives are taken, in some cases right up until the time of
delivery,'' Representative Charles T. Canady, a Florida Republican
who sponsored the House bill, said in a prepared statement.
``Miraculously, in this instance, a little girl who was sentenced
to die is alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights advocates noted that Biskind halted the abortion
as soon as he realized the fetus was viable outside the womb. The
newborn was then taken to Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center
across the street from the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody in the clinic made a mistake and corrected it,'' said
Louise Melling, associate director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom
Project. ``They acted exactly as you would want people to act. They
took care of this delivery.''

&HT;        SEN. REID STARTS LEADERSHIP PAC AS HE FIGHTS TO SAVE HIS OWN
SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 9 -- Sen. Harry Reid is openly campaigning for
a top Democratic leadership position next year, bringing many
people -- including his chief opponent -- to speculate that Reid
thinks he has this year's Senate race won.
</P>
<P>
   In a apparent move to win support from his colleagues to replace
retiring Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., as Senate minority whip, Reid
formed a political action committee in May to help Democrats across
the country financially with their Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Reid does not deny he is interested in becoming the next whip
and said the people of Nevada would benefit if he is elected to the
leadership position. Reid points to his seniority in the Senate as
one of the main reasons discussions of an interim nuclear dump site
at Yucca Mountain came to a halt in June. And Reid said his
position on the Senate Appropriations Committee has brought
millions of dollars into the Silver State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, and I am
in line to be the next whip,'' he said. ``I think the people of the
state of Nevada are very happy I am in a leadership position and
best friends with (Senate Minority Leader) Tom Daschle.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said there are ``a lot of reasons'' he opened the PAC three
months ago, which he said has raised about $100,000. Reid said his
PAC dubbed the Searchlight Leadership Fund has contributed to about
32 Senate campaigns including Evan Bayh's in Indiana and Sen.
Barbara Boxer's in California.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign said Reid is making a mistake if he thinks the Senate
race is over five months before the November election. And Ensign
said Reid is following the same ill-fated path of Sen. Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., who was upset by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Some political pundits speculate that Sasser was more focused on
succeeding retiring Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, as the next
majority leader, instead of focusing on his campaign back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reid) is in the race for his life out here,'' Ensign said.
``We don't think he is going to be the next whip, because we don't
think he is going to be in the Senate after November.''
</P>
<P>
   Ensign said it is ideologically impossible for Reid to be part
of the ``liberal leaning'' Democratic Senate leadership team and
still represent the needs of Nevadans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevada is a very conservative state,'' Ensign said. ``When you
run for leadership positions in the Senate they normally elect more
liberal members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very typical for (Reid) to be doing one thing in
Washington and saying another (in Nevada).'' Paul Henry, chairman
of the Nevada Democratic Party, refuted Ensign's statement and said
Reid is very active on a number of issues important to Nevadans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first day of his election, he has paid a great deal of
attention to constituent services,'' Henry said. ``This is a man
that is very much in step with the issues that concern the people
of Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Burdish, executive director for the Nevada Republican Party,
said he is not surprised Reid formed his own leadership PAC.
Burdish also said Republicans will be watching to make sure Reid
doesn't use the PAC to illegally fund his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern about him starting up a leadership PAC to fund
other campaigns is if he starts to receive campaign contributions
from the campaigns he has already given to,'' Burdish said. ``If he
is doing it to raise money for his campaign to get around FEC
contribution rules I don't think it is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said he would support Reid if he
runs for the whip position. Bryan also said he thinks Reid will
beat Ensign, but it will be a tough campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point, Sen. Reid has run a great campaign,''
Bryan said. ``I think Sen. Reid is going to win, but Congressman
Ensign is a formidable opponent.''

 &HT;    President Clinton thanks Florida firefighters
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH _ President Clinton made a brief stop in
fire-weary Central Florida Thursday to thank firefighters,
sympathize with burned-out families and deliver three messages:
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida is ready to welcome tourists again and needs the
economic boost to recover.
</P>
<P>
   _ The world is facing further extremes of heat, drought and
severe weather and needs all the knowledge firefighters gained from
Florida's ordeal to be better prepared.
</P>
<P>
   _ It shouldn't take a disaster to remind us that we're all part
of a community and that ``we're at our best when we're giving.''
</P>
<P>
   With praise for ``the real American heroes,'' Clinton thanked
the firefighters who kept wildfires from consuming whole
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the Daytona International Speedway in Volusia
County, which was hit hard by fires. But Thursday, there was no
trace of smoke in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton squeezed in the visit between stops in Atlanta and
Miami, attracting a stage full of smiling state and local officials
and a tent full of awed firefighters, National Guardsmen, forest
rangers, Americorps volunteers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, Clinton met privately with 10 families who
had lost homes Many of them were renting and had no insurance, and
are now living in hotels or with relatives. ``I'm very sorry for
what you're going through,'' Clinton told them.
</P>
<P>
   He also met with children who had donated money to fire relief
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared Florida's 34 counties disaster areas, and
announced new federal assistance for farmers and people who are out
of work because of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance includes a Labor Department grant of up to $1
million for hiring 200 temporary workers to help clean up charred
areas, restore roads and assist at shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew cheers when he alluded to the movie Armageddon and
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer . . . the real American heroes are not up in space
fighting asteroids. They're in Florida fighting fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hundred of the 5,000 firefighters spread out through
Florida's fire zone got to attend the event, and they rushed to get
within handshaking and picture-taking distance as Clinton slowly
worked his way out through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it!'' exulted Boca Raton firefighter and paramedic Joel
Narcowich, holding up ``the hand that shook the hand of the
president of the United States.'' And he got a picture with his
pocket camera.
</P>
<P>
   Narcowich and four others from Boca Raton arrived Tuesday, along
with seven from Palm Beach County Fire Rescue and a Broward County
contingent. They're manning fire stations so local firefighters who
have worked weeks without a break can get some rest.

WOODWARD PURSUES `COME AND GET ME' STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly broke and an ocean away, Louise Woodward seems
to have decided to hold up her hands and let the Eappen family try
to collect a civil judgment against her, legal analysts said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strategy,'' said Boston attorney Thomas Hoopes. ``This
way she doesn't have to sit down and negiotiate. She just says
`Come and get me, but I don't have anything anyway.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Telling her family's attorney in England that she could not
afford to fund her defense, Woodward removed herself from the first
step in the civil suit pending against her in a U.S. District
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Now a judge will decide how much the life of baby Matthew Eappen
was worth, as his parents, Sunil and Deborah, try to prevent the au
pair convicted of killing their son from benefiting from the sale
of her story.
</P>
<P>
   Once a dollar amount is set in the civil suit, it would be
difficult for the Eappens to prevent Woodward from receiving money
from a media outlet for her story, so long as she is not paid in
the United States, or by a company covered by US law, said Boston
attorney Roderick MacLeish, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are open issues about the international enforcement of a
judgment,'' he said, referring to a treaty currently pending before
the U.S. Senate that would make it easier to collect international
civil judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cases are examined by British courts on an individual
basis, and, in general, they are not enforced, according to several
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens could choose to file suit in England, MacLeish said,
to help ensure the collection of any funds Woodward might receive.
But it would be more likely that they would choose to sue any media
outlet that might offer money to the former au pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a sizeable verdict, it probably won't be
meaningless, because it will prevent Louise Woodward from doing
business with any enity that is subject to the jurisdiction of the
U.S. courts,'' MacLeish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may get a little tricky because everyone will be alert to
this,'' he said. ``So money could change hands without everyone
knowing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joseph Balliro, Jr. said that if Woodward changed her
mind, and decided to fight the case after all, she could argue for
a special dispensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in another country, and it makes it susbsantially
difficult for her to attend to a matter in federal court,'' Balliro
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for defendants in civil suits to default,
specialists say, though it is far less likely to occur in cases of
wrongful death because defendants usually feel their reputation is
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hoopes: ``What's uncommon about this is that you have
someone who protested her innocence to the whole world, and now the
protestation has collapsed.''

EPIDEMIOLOGIST CHOSEN TO HEAD CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ga.)  (lh) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has selected Dr. Jeffrey
P. Koplan, an epidemiologist, as the next director of the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Koplan spent 22 years
at the agency before leaving four years ago to run the research arm
of Prudential Healthcare, one of the nation's largest health
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, is
expected to announce the appointment on Friday morning at the
centers' headquarters in Atlanta, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan will assume the post on Oct. 5, replacing Dr. David
Satcher, who left the agency in February to become surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan is ``respected by the left and the right alike,'' said
one official who is familiar with Koplan's selection but who spoke
on condition that he not be identified. ``I have been impressed by
the people who have called on his behalf. Unlike any other senior
post, I haven't heard a bad thing from anyone who has some ax to
grind.''
</P>
<P>
   At the disease control centers, Koplan will oversee a vast and
often unseen bureaucracy with 6,900 employees and a wide-ranging
mission, from curbing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases
to investigating the effects of violence on the public health. He
is also being appointed administrator of the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry, which is concerned with preventing
health damage from exposure to hazardous substances. Neither
appointment requires Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Boston, Koplan, 53, is a graduate of Mount Sinai
School of Medicine and the Harvard University School of Public
Health. He began his career at the Centers for Disease Control in
1972 as one of the agency's celebrated ``disease detectives,'' who
are dispatched around the world to investigate outbreaks of
infectious diseases. For the next two decades, he worked on public
health matters, including the eradication of smallpox and the
promotion of screening for breast and cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Koplan was instrumental in formulating the
agency's response to the AIDS epidemic, particularly its efforts to
protect the nation's blood supply, an effort that later became
controversial. In 1984, he led a federal delegation to Bhopal,
India, to investigate an explosion at the Union Carbide chemical
plant. Five years later, he became the first director of the
agency's new Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion, a job he held until he left the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Koplan is a world-class scientist, but above all, he is a
leader,'' said Dr. Bill Roper, who served as the director of the
centers from 1990 to 1993 and who later recruited Koplan to
Prudential Healthcare, a unit of Prudential Insurance Company of
America. ``He has a deep personal commitment to public health and a
burning zeal for prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   At Prudential, Koplan is president of the Center for Health Care
Research in Atlanta, where he supervises studies intended to make
medical care more efficient and effective.
</P>
<P>
   That experience may be particularly useful for Koplan in his new
job, as the centers tries to persuade managed-care organizations to
pay more attention to public health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a very strong mix of technical expertise and
management ability, with a vision of where to go with public
health,'' said an agency official, who insisted on anonymity. ``My
sense is that his appointment will be very warmly received.''

CIPOLLINI HAS ONE GOAL: JUST LOOK AT HIS BICYCLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Mario Cipollini, the biggest hot dog outside
the dreams of Oscar Mayer, has come to Ireland for the start of the
Tour de France with a bicycle as green as a shamrock.
</P>
<P>
   The star Italian sprinter and showman arrived Thursday with his
Saeco teammates and the 20 other teams of nine men each who will
set off Saturday in the three-week race. The riders began showing
up for cursory medical examinations at Dublin Castle on Thursday
afternoon and few are very likely to attract more attention than
Cipollini.
</P>
<P>
   Cipollini knows no Gaelic and less English, so he will be spared
explaining to the natives that his bicycle was not painted in honor
of the Emerald Isle. Like his yellow bicycle, it was painted in
honor of Cipollini.
</P>
<P>
   He flaunted the yellow bicycle last year during the two days
that he wore the yellow jersey of the Tour's leader. This year his
eye is on the green jersey of the points leader, hence the green
bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   A notoriously feeble climber, Cipollini does not have a bicycle
with the red polka dots that denote the king of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   For all his sartorial bluster, his pet cheetah and Via Veneto
scruffy good looks, the 31-year-old Cipollini is surprisingly
soft-spoken. While he may refer to himself as the Lion King or Il
Magnifico, he does not say he is the sport's best sprinter. He
agrees, however, with anybody who does say so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy being among the best for 10 years,'' he said
during the Giro, where he tied Eddy Merckx's career record of 25
stage victories. ``It's more difficult every year for me to train,
to suffer. My biggest boost is that I win, which makes it
worthwhile. I still feel an indescribable joy when I do.''
</P>
<P>
   And he keeps winning. After his triumphs in the Giro early in
June, he went to Spain and won four stages there in the Tour of
Catalonia, his tuneup for the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   His overall strategy here will be the same as last year: finish
high in the short prologue on Saturday and then try to win the
first road race around Dublin on Sunday or the second stage to Cork
on Monday, gaining enough bonus seconds for victory to don the
yellow jersey again and wear it to France on Tuesday. Until July
18, the Tour's terrain will be flat _ ideal for sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Cipollini will rely on his Saeco teammates to
overtake any breakaways and power him to the front near the mass
finish. Saving energy, he will tuck in behind his leadout man, Gian
Mateo Fagnini _ a good enough sprinter himself to have won two
stages in the last Giro _ and then burst past him and presumably
everybody else with 100 or 150 meters left.
</P>
<P>
   Any sprint finish in the top 25 of the 189-man field will also
give him the points, on a sliding scale of 35 down to 1, that count
toward the green jersey. That is Cipollini's main goal in this
Tour, he says, but to win the jersey, not just keep it for a few
days, he will have to get over the Pyrenees and Alps and make it to
Paris Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In his four previous Tours, citing the heat, lack of motivation
and general weariness, he has been unable to finish. ``They say I
can't do it,'' he said, ``but I think I can. When I get something
in my head, I go for it.'' &QL;

   STRONG RETAIL SALES PUSH SHARES OF RETAILERS HIGHER
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales rose 4.4 percent in June, down from the 7.1 percent
increase in May and the 10.2 percent gain in April. And not every
chainparticipated in the sales gains. J.C. Penney, for example,
announced that its sales fell 2.1 percent and second-quarter
earnings would be lower than expected as a result. But shares of
retail companies have jumped, as indicated by the Standard &AMP; Poor's
retail stores index, which is up 54.8 percent so far this year,
compared with a 19.39 percent gain in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE APPROVES IRS OVERHAUL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved legislation overhauling the Internal Revenue
Service. The measure, which was approved by the House late last
month, now goes to President Clinton, who has said he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA DELAYS SALE OF OIL COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has postponed the sale of its state oil
company, Rosneft, for the second time because of a lack of bidders,
which was attributed to the faltering Russian economy and plunging
world oil prices. The Government, which expects to sell a
controlling interest in the company for at least $1.6 billion, will
put it up for sale this fall.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ SETS ANOTHER RECORD HIGH
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 85.19 points, to 9,089.78,
and the Nasdaq composite index posted its second consecutive record
close, rising 4.43 points, to 1,939.82. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
composite index of 500 stocks fell 7.82 points, to 1,158.56. DuPont
and other companies issued warnings on their earnings that sent
investors scrambling to grab some profits.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont announced that its second-quarter earnings would be 10
percent to 15 percent lower than the 99 cents a share it earned in
the comparable period last year, sending shares of the chemical
company down $7. DuPont attributed the lowered earnings
expectations to problems with its crop protection products
business, prompted by the Asian financial crisis and weather and
pricing pressures in North America.
</P>
<P>
   TREASURY PRICES RISE
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices made modest gains Thursday, bolstered by a
strong dollar. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.60
percent from 5.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DETAILS EMERGE IN ARCHER INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   After more than three years of being shrouded in secrecy,
evidence from the government's investigation of a huge price-fixing
conspiracy involving Archer Daniels Midland is emerging as the

   LAWYER SEES ARBITRATION GAP
</P>
<P>
   A securities lawyer who studied customer arbitration cases filed
at nine securities organizations says investors lodging complaints

The trend is the opposite at the National Association of Securities

   STOCK MUTUAL FUNDS ATTRACTED CASH

SENIOR SUES HMO FOR DENYING HIM VIAGRA COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In what is thought to be the first case of its
kind in the nation, a 77-year-old man has sued his HMO for refusing
to pay for the anti-impotence drug Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for retired machinery worker Louis Marcil of suburban
Burbank filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court late Wednesday to
force Kaiser Permanente to pay for the popular new medicine and to
stop what they say is false advertising by the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials said Thursday they have not seen the lawsuit,
but insist they are not required to cover the drug even if a Kaiser
physician has prescribed it.
</P>
<P>
   Marcil, a longtime Kaiser member, was left impotent last fall
after two years of radiation therapy to kill cancer cells in his
prostate. The World War II and Korean War veteran said that before
the treatment he enjoyed an active sex life with his wife of 52
years and that sexual intimacy was an important part of their
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been having good sex all our lives,'' Marcil said. ``With
six months of impotence it was a little rough around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Food and Drug Administration approved Pfizer Inc.'s
Viagra in March, Marcil's physician recommended that he try the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   After six months without sex, ``I told him one pill would be
enough'' to get started, Marcil said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Marcil's doctor wrote him a
prescription for five Viagra tablets, which he then tried to fill
at Kaiser's Panorama City pharmacy. But instead of his customary $7
co-payment for prescription medicines, the pharmacy charged Marcil
$50 for the five pills.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Marcil claims that if the health plan won't pay for
Viagra, much of the HMO's marketing material aimed at recruiting
senior citizens is misleading. Statements that ``we will provide
all of your health care'' and Kaiser ``physicians have autonomy''
constitute false and misleading advertising, the suit states.
</P>
<P>
   Marcil is asking that Kaiser change its marketing material and
pay for Viagra, and is seeking unspecified compensation for
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Les Zendle, associate medical director for Kaiser Permanente
in Southern California, said that while a physician may prescribe
Viagra for a patient, that in itself does not mean the HMO must pay
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Zendle said Viagra is not on Kaiser's formulary, which is a list
of drugs for which the HMO will cover most of the cost. Kaiser will
still pay for nonformulary drugs if a physician deems them
medically necessary, but in some cases a doctor will determine a
drug is appropriate but not necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems from a philosophical point is that with a
drug like Viagra there isn't a clear line between medically
necessary and non-necessary,'' Zendle said. ``What the physician
evidently did not say (in this case) is that it's medically
necessary for the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Zendle said Kaiser has paid for Viagra in several hundred other
cases and that still more Kaiser patients pay for the medicine
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Darras, an attorney representing Marcil, said the
distinction between medically necessary and medically appropriate
is not made clear in any Kaiser literature or in its member
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say because Viagra is the first pill to
effectively treat male impotence, the Kaiser case is unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you need Viagra? I guess that's the real issue,'' said San
Francisco attorney David Lee, a former chairman of the American Bar
Association's committee on health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health plans have been upheld on this with some frequency,
that they are not required to provide everything doctors might
prescribe, especially in cases in which the therapy is
experimental,'' Lee said. ``But I don't know if there have ever
been situations comparable to Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the case will likely come down to what Kaiser has said
in its literature and contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is being investigated by the California Department of
Corporations, which regulates HMOs, for its policy of not including
Viagra among its basic drug coverage. Four state legislators have
called on the department to pull Kaiser's license unless the HMO
begins coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Del Konnor, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management
Association, a trade group for managed-care pharmacy benefit
managers, said that given the enormous societal interest in Viagra,
more lawsuits are likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a Kaiser Permanente problem,'' Konnor said.
``This is an issue that each plan has to address individually.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Viagra's approval in March, several large health groups
including Kaiser, Prudential HealthCare and Humana have said they
will not cover the drug, citing alternately its high cost or safety
concerns. Others, including Woodland Hills-based WellPoint Health
Plans, will pay for a limited number of pills for their members
each month.

IT'S OFFICIAL SELIG THE COMMISH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes commissioner history text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ He grew up wanting to be like Joe DiMaggio. Instead,
after six years of indecision, Bud Selig has become Fay Vincent's
replacement as commissioner of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest twist in a fascinating career for Selig, who
has been majority owner and chief executive officer of the
Milwaukee Brewers for 33 years and interim baseball commissioner
since September 1992. By a 30-0 vote by baseball owners here
Thursday, Selig is now fulltime commissioner. He has agreed to a 5
1/2-year contract, details of which have yet to be worked out, and
he will put his interest in the Brewers in a trust by Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Like Vincent, who was asked to resign six years ago, Selig, 63,
promised harmony among owners. But he says he also will work toward
the end of acrimony among large and small markets as well as with
the players' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan,'' said Selig after the vote Thursday. ``There is no
one who can love the game more than I do. It's history and
tradition and above all it's decency. We've had eight work
stoppages. We have to ensure the next generation doesn't have to
endure any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus belongs back on the field. We need to get together
and take the anger out of the system. Yes, we will have our
differences. That's part of the business. But we can work together.
And by the turn of the century you will see the greatest
renaissance in baseball history.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened Thursday was hardly historic. After six years of
service, a longer tenure than the late Bart Giamatti and Fay
Vincent combined, he is merely assuming fulltime the job that has
been his all along. Selig will have two offices, one in New York
and one in Milwaukee. Much of the day-to-day operation will be in
the hands of Paul Beeston, a former Toronto owner, who virtually
has been running baseball's central office for the last 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston, who plans to have a big role in the national and
international marketing of the game, was among those who for years
had been urging Selig to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be a problem,'' he said. ``Bud is a man
of integrity. Until today, it was very difficult. Before today, we
didn't know who would be the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acrimony is a problem, but I think it's realistic that we can
one day eliminate it. Right now, we're working together and we've
got to continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got great leadership,'' said Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner. ``It's leadership that has been there. Leadership
that understands the problems that owners have. I don't recall
before if we've ever had that, and we've had some very good
leadership. I'm not criticizing anybody. Selig has done well for
the small market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we hopefully have a good relationship with Don Fehr
and the union. We have labor peace, and that's good. We have a
sport on the upswing. I can sense it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado owner Jerry McMorris, who headed baseball's search
committee, said no one interviewed was better qualified to handle
the problems that still plague baseball since the 1994 strike. As
commissioner, Selig becomes chairman of the Executive Council (of
owners), which in the absence of a commissioner had become
baseball's ruling body.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four or five challenges that Bud is very familiar
with,'' said McMorris. ``Differences in the markets and in the
payroll size of the team. International expansion and how we market
our game to keep it affordable for families. Also how to get
additional stadium facilities that are needed in different parts of
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo, the Arizona owner who also owns an NBA
franchise, sees Selig as the logical choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that history plays a significant role in baseball,''
said Colangelo. ``When you look at Bud and Paul you have two guys
who have been in the trenches. They've run franchises. They
understand the ins and out and what it takes to run a team. That's
invaluable to team operators to know they have that kind of
leadership. What you're about to see is a collective effort for
baseball to continue its rise. But will represent all of baseball _
fans, players, and the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his nature, Selig put an emotional cap to his acceptance
speech. He is a long way from the days when he was called a used
car dealer from Milwaukee. Aside from the money, said to be at
least $3 million a year, he is assuming the role because it feels
it's the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a baseball man,'' said Selig. ``I've been one all my adult
life. I dreamed of being one when I was a kid. I thought I would be
the heir-apparent to Joe DiMaggio. After I saw a curveball, I knew
I had to do something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time. There is a burden to always do the right thing.
It's 33 years later, and it's time to go. It's also time, if I
can't make the shift, I should have the decency to say I just can't
do it. But I believe I can.''

EVIDENCE EMERGES ON INQUIRY INVOLVING ARCHER DANIELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (th) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than three years of being shrouded in secrecy,
evidence from the government's investigation of a huge price-fixing
conspiracy involving Archer Daniels Midland Co. is emerging as the
first criminal case stemming from the inquiry heads to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, referenced in government records filed with the
U.S. District Court in Chicago, portrayed the conspiracy between
Archer Daniels and foreign competitors to fix prices of a feed
additive as a complex, often frustrating effort that involved
several of the company's most senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   During the efforts to hammer out a deal, according to the
government documents, competitors were invited to Decatur, Ill.,
for a lunch at Archer Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officers then provided the competitors with a tour of its
plant to impress upon them the company's ability to manufacture
mass quantities of the additive lysine. That would decrease the
worldwide price of lysine, cutting into all the companies' profits.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection began Thursday in the criminal case against three
former Archer Daniels executives _ Michael D. Andreas, who is now
on leave as the vice chairman of the company, Terrance S. Wilson,
the former head of its corn processing division, and Mark E.
Whitacre, the former head of its bioproducts division. Opening
arguments are expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   But records filed recently by the government lay out a blueprint
of the prosecution's case, with a description of some evidence and
a detailed chronology of the events leading up to the federal raid
of Archer Daniels in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the evidence described were recordings made by
Whitacre, who worked for more than two years as a government
informant. Whitacre first alerted the government to the conspiracy
in November 1992 and was offered immunity for his role as part of a
cooperation pact. But prosecutors withdrew his immunity after
learning that Whitacre had illegally taken millions of dollars from
Archer Daniels while working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In pretrial hearings, lawyers for Wilson and Andreas have made
clear that they intend to attack the government's inquiry as shoddy
and Whitacre as an out-of-control informant. They contended that
Whitacre set up their clients, and that no price-fixing ever
actually occurred. Lawyers for both men did not return calls
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the most compelling evidence described comes from the tapes.
Numerous conversations, at times laced with obscenities, portrayed
Wilson as being intricately involved in the pricing scheme. At
times, he was described as telling competitors that if they tried
to compete on price, Archer Daniels would increase its production
of lysine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start losing business because of price,'' he was quoted
as telling a competitor, ``then we will change our mind and do what
we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, Andreas, the son of the company's chairman, Dwayne
Andreas, was portrayed as an important strategist in the scheme.
The documents described repeated briefings of Andreas by Whitacre
on the progress of the scheme. During a briefing about one meeting
with competitors, Whitacre mentioned to Andreas that prices were
rising slowly, to 85 cents a pound. ``Did you mention the idea that
you might take it up another nickel?'' Andreas asked.
</P>
<P>
   At another meeting, Andreas was quoted as expressing frustration
about talks with competitors to control production levels. ``We got
to start vocalizing our displeasure with volume,'' he was quoted as
saying, adding that Archer Daniels had to tell competitors that
they ``promised us we'd have our share if we backed off to the
levels we talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives who have not been indicted in the case were
also portrayed as being aware of the scheme. For example, James
Randall, the former president of Archer Daniels, was described as
having attended the tour of the Archer Daniels plant with
competitors, during which the benefits of price fixing were
discussed by Wilson. That conversation was not recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cole, Randall's lawyer, said he had not heard before of the
allegations about his client attending a tour where price-fixing
was discussed. ``If that is true, how on earth did Jim not get
indicted?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One person whose role in the conspiracy was only scantily
portrayed in the documents was Whitacre. At early meetings, the
only time in which he was not cooperating with the government, he
was described as saying ``very little'' during meetings with
competitors, according to the documents. After November 1992, as
the conspiracy unfolded for another two and a half years, Whitacre
was acting with the full knowledge of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they have little against him is because he was
acting as an agent for the government in securing the evidence they
needed,'' said Bill Walker, a lawyer for Whitacre. &QL;

CABARET REVIEW: 10,001 NIGHTS OF GRECO, MR. LOUNGE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan and Atlantic City are only about a hundred
miles apart, but in terms of pop music cultures they might as well
be different planets. In certain downtown Manhattan clubs, lounge
music (everything from Dean Martin to Henry Mancini) is
self-consciously embraced by young audiences as a campy retro-hip
genre, while in Atlantic City it remains a stalwart pop tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Because these two cultures rarely converge, local lounge-music
cultists should take note of the arrival of Buddy Greco at the Oak
Room of the Algonquin Hotel for a two-week engagement. There is
nothing campy or retro-hip about this chipper 71-year-old singer
and pianist, who will give his 10,000th performance during his run.
He is the real thing. In fact, he helped invent it.
</P>
<P>
   Greco is about as pure an example of the lounge-music esthetic
as you could find. A genial hard-boiled swinger and custodian of
Frank Sinatra's tough, high-rolling showroom style, he is different
from most of his peers in that he is a singing pianist rather than
a standup vocalist. And at Tuesday's opening night show, which
included two piano solos (``Misty'' and ``MacArthur Park''), he
acknowledged Erroll Garner and Nat (King) Cole as his pianistic
idols.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot more Garner than Cole in Greco's rolling chords
and ornate fills. Both his pianism and his singing (in a shorthand
version of Sinatra's pugilistic vocal mannerisms) suggests an
instant freeze-dried version of something else.
</P>
<P>
   Greco doesn't have a distinctive voice, but he has more than
enough of a veteran swinger's cocky attitude to make up for it.
That means punching out phrases like ``gotcha, gotcha, gotcha,
sugar,'' into ``I've Got You Under My Skin'' or interpolating a
reference to Richard Simmons into ``The Lady Is a Tramp.'' It's
called entertaining.

IT'S ALL MARKET VALUE, YOU KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Maybe he has good reasons. Maybe there's so much bad
history between himself and the Red Sox front office that Mo Vaughn
can't see fit to play for Boston anymore. But after listening to
Vaughn explain himself, I'm having a hard time sticking up for the
big guy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are to blame for letting it get this far, and for
busting the chops of their best player. There is a Duquette
double-standard (pre-Duke people are not to be trusted, post-Duke
people are worthy). But now that Mo has rejected, and refused to
counter-offer, a four-year, $37 million contract extension, we can
come to only one conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   The issue is market value. The issue is about what Mo makes vs.
what Albert Belle makes; about what Mo makes vs. what Gary
Sheffield makes.
</P>
<P>
   And it makes me sick.
</P>
<P>
   I love Mo as a competitor and like him as a person. Few athletes
have done for Boston what Vaughn has done off the field.
</P>
<P>
   But first he told us that this was about playing for a winner.
He said he wanted to see a commitment from the Sox front office.
They did that.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was about the length of commitment the Sox were willing
to make. They offered him only two years in the spring, which was
tantamount to a Dear John letter. A 30-year-old player with
Vaughn's resume is never offered a two-year deal. But now the Sox
are willing to commit to four years. And Vaughn's people failed to
counter, preferring to put it off until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So now we know it's not about winning and it's not about a
long-term commitment. It's strictly about the Benjamins. And we
don't mean Mike Benjamin and family.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn calls it ``market value.'' That's a euphemism. Market
value is the silly scorekeeping that drives agents and greedy
ballplayers. Never mind where you can win, or where you are loved,
or where you want to make your home. Get the most money you can
get. Don't settle for a penny less than what people of comparable
talents are making. This is why Antoine Walker won't be a Celtic
much longer. And now it's why Mo has made up his mind to go.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll explain himself later, and talk about being followed
by Red Sox detectives looking for dirt. Maybe he'll tell stories
about smear campaigns by the Sox front office, wiretaps on his
phone, and Red Sox double agents posing as dancers at the Foxy
Lady. But right now we can only assume it's strictly about money.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Thursday said, ``The bottom line is this: we are gonna
get a market deal in '98 _ what fair market value is. I'm gonna get
my market value contract in '98. Period. There's a lot of things
that take into that, but I'm going to get that. There will not be a
hometown discount.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a little touchy when asked about old remarks that he'd
stay in Boston for less if the Sox showed a commitment to winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that a year and a half ago. And we're winning. But the
market changes every day. The stock market changes every day and
people's attitudes are gonna change every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Sox have met a couple of his conditions (commitment
to winning and four-year deal), how does he explain rejecting a $37
million offer without even countering? What would he tell angry and
disappointed Red Sox fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't tell 'em anything, because when you try to tell 'em
something, they're never going to understand,'' Vaughn said. ``I
just have to go and play and play hard like I always have. The only
way to explain yourself is when things are done. You can't explain
yourself in the middle of a situation. 'Cuz there's no way for
people to understand. If things get done either way there'll be an
opportunity to explain yourself. Hopefully, people will
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he expect to be booed when the Sox come home to play the
Indians Wednesday night?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been booed before. No one wants to get booed. But I've
sat down with my family and I've sat down with my people and this
is the best situation we could come up with for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said we could get this deal done in a telephone
booth if everybody wants to get it done. This is not a posturing
situation. It's a situation where you're gonna do a deal, or you're
not gonna do a deal. We've been talking for two years. There's
nothing else we can say. We know what everybody looks like. We know
what their breath smells like. We've been that close. It will
happen or it won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like it won't happen. Vaughn's going to give Sox fans
another three months of sweet swings and sweat and then he's off to
Texas, Baltimore, New York or Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   This is a complicated story. There's been a lot of irrational
positioning in both camps. Granted, the Sox waited too long and
treated Vaughn shabbily, but now Mo has to decide if he wants to
play for Boston in exchange for lifetime security or just take the
top dollar. At this hour, he's leaning toward the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Market value, you know.

&HT;        SEN. REID STARTS LEADERSHIP PAC AS HE FIGHTS TO SAVE HIS OWN
SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORRECTS FIFTH GRAPH AND SIXTH GRAPH
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 9 -- Sen. Harry Reid is openly campaigning for
a top Democratic leadership position next year, bringing many
people -- including his chief opponent -- to speculate that the
Nevada Democrat thinks he has already won this year's Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a apparent move to win support from his colleagues to replace
retiring Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., as Senate minority whip, Reid
formed a political action committee in May to help Democrats across
the country financially with their Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Reid does not deny he is interested in becoming the next whip
and said the people of Nevada would benefit if he is elected to the
leadership position. Reid points to his seniority in the Senate as
one of the main reasons discussions of an interim nuclear dump site
at Yucca Mountain came to a halt in June. And Reid said his
position on the Senate Appropriations Committee has brought
millions of dollars into the Silver State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, and I am
in line to be the next whip,'' he said. ``I think the people of the
state of Nevada are very happy I am in a leadership position and
best friends with (Senate Minority Leader) Tom Daschle.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said there are ``a lot of reasons'' he opened the PAC three
months ago, which he said has raised about $100,000. Reid said his
PAC dubbed the Searchlight Leadership Fund has contributed to about
32 Senate campaigns including former Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh and
California Sen. Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Ensign, R-Nev., who is leaving his House seat this
year to challenge Reid, said the Democratic senator is making a
mistake if he thinks the Senate race is over five months before the
November election. And Ensign said Reid is following the same
ill-fated path of Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., who was upset by Sen.
Bill Frist, R-Tenn., in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Some political pundits speculate that Sasser was more focused on
succeeding retiring Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, as the next
majority leader, instead of focusing on his campaign back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reid) is in the race for his life out here,'' Ensign said.
``We don't think he is going to be the next whip, because we don't
think he is going to be in the Senate after November.''
</P>
<P>
   Ensign said it is ideologically impossible for Reid to be part
of the ``liberal leaning'' Democratic Senate leadership team and
still represent the needs of Nevadans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevada is a very conservative state,'' Ensign said. ``When you
run for leadership positions in the Senate they normally elect more
liberal members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very typical for (Reid) to be doing one thing in
Washington and saying another (in Nevada).'' Paul Henry, chairman
of the Nevada Democratic Party, refuted Ensign's statement and said
Reid is very active on a number of issues important to Nevadans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first day of his election, he has paid a great deal of
attention to constituent services,'' Henry said. ``This is a man
that is very much in step with the issues that concern the people
of Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Burdish, executive director for the Nevada Republican Party,
said he is not surprised Reid formed his own leadership PAC.
Burdish also said Republicans will be watching to make sure Reid
doesn't use the PAC to illegally fund his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern about him starting up a leadership PAC to fund
other campaigns is if he starts to receive campaign contributions
from the campaigns he has already given to,'' Burdish said. ``If he
is doing it to raise money for his campaign to get around FEC
contribution rules I don't think it is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said he would support Reid if he
runs for the whip position. Bryan also said he thinks Reid will
beat Ensign, but it will be a tough campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point, Sen. Reid has run a great campaign,''
Bryan said. ``I think Sen. Reid is going to win, but Congressman
Ensign is a formidable opponent.''

GOP AT RISK IF HEALTH BILL FAILS TO PASS, POLLSTERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican strategists conceded Thursday that their
party was vulnerable on managed-care legislation and needed to pass
a credible bill before the November elections or risk political
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for Republicans not to come up with some
token effort, because we are perceived as the party that doesn't
care about the issue,'' said Rick Reed, a Republican media
consultant who has worked on the managed-care issue. ``This issue
can only intensify at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks came at a pivotal time in Congress, as Democrats in
the Senate have begun to carry out their threat to attach their
managed-care bill to essential spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, soon after Democrats tried to add the proposal to a
bill to provide money for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and
Housing and Urban Development for the next year, Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the majority leader, pulled the bill from the Senate
floor rather than consider the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, led by Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority
leader, vowed to repeat the tactic on other spending bills,
threatening to tie up the Senate, which has 45 business days left
to complete legislative business before adjourning for the
elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has said that he has offered Democrats a chance to debate
their bill but that so far the offer, which Daschle maintains has
too many limitations, has been rejected. With the clock ticking, it
is clear that Republicans and Democrats must come to an agreement
on bringing managed-care legislation to the floor soon.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Thursday that Lott's refusal to allow the
managed-care amendment was one reason they refused to end their
filibuster against a product liability bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our Republican colleagues won't agree voluntarily to allow
a full and fair debate on this issue, we will force them to address
it,'' Daschle said at a news conference. ``We will be back, again
and again and again, for as long as we have to, until we get a
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week may be crucial for Republicans in their efforts to
address the managed-care issue. A Senate Republican task force,
headed by Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority
leader, is expected to announce a detailed outline of their party's
managed-care bill, and House Republicans are also expected to make
their legislation public.
</P>
<P>
   In what turned into a day of salvos related to managed care, a
group of conservatives, including Randy Tate, the head of the
Christian Coalition, and small-business representatives held a news
conference Thursday morning to promote medical savings accounts as
a remedy to the problems of managed care. The savings accounts,
which are now functioning on a limited basis, are in the House
Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need more Soviet-style regulations,'' said Steve
Forbes, a potential candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000, referring to Daschle's bill. ``We have too many
restrictions and regulations on health care today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two hours later, a panel of four prominent Republican and
Democratic strategists and pollsters discussed their strategies and
the issue's impact on congressional campaigns. The discussion was
sponsored by Families USA, which supports Daschle's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said his polls showed
Democrats with a 15- to 25-point advantage over Republicans on the
issue. Republicans did not dispute that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to agree that this is not something that Republicans
have an advantage on,'' Reed, the Republican consultant, said,
adding that Democrats ``are perceived as more capable by the
public, and that's a problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Reed and Bob Castro, vice president of the Luntz Research
Cos., which helps Republicans, challenged the notion that the
managed-care issue is as explosive as Democrats say it is. But they
acknowledged the potential for damage to their party.
</P>
<P>
   It does not help matters, Castro said, that Congress has done
little legislatively this year. He counseled Republicans to move
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more time that passes, the less credible that Republicans
look on the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A centerpiece of the Democratic bill is a provision that gives
all patients the right to sue managed care companies for bad
decisions, something most Republicans oppose, viewing it as a gift
to trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, as well as the insurance industry and
small-business groups, contend that Daschle's bill would increase
costs and rapidly raise the number of uninsured, a position Castro
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Shrum, a Democratic media consultant, said the charge
sounds like an ``old song.'' In at least one poll, he said, those
surveyed were given a worst case scenario that involved increased
costs, more regulation and unnecessary lawsuits and 66 percent
still favored the proposal.

DIRECTOR AWARDED $80 MILLION FOR UNMADE PINOCCHIO MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A Los Angeles jury ordered the Warner Brothers
movie studio Thursday to pay director Francis Ford Coppola and a
partner $60 million in punitive damages for blocking their efforts
to make a movie based on the story of Pinocchio.
</P>
<P>
   The award followed one of $20 million last week by the same jury
in Los Angeles County Superior Court to compensate Coppola and his
partner, Fred Fuchs, for lost income from the movie, which was
never made.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was a resounding triumph for the director of movies
like ``The Godfather'' series and ``Apocalypse Now,'' whose
relations with major Hollywood studios have often been strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warner Brothers has traditionally not treated its creative
people well,'' Coppola said outside the court. ``Hopefully, this
will teach them to treat creative people as an asset, not as
serfs.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, called the $60 million
in damages ``simply ludicrous'' and said it was confident the award
would be reduced or overturned by the judge or on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute goes back to 1991 when Coppola entered negotiations
to make Pinocchio and two other pictures for Warner Brothers. But
the studio and Coppola could not agree on the movie budget.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola later approached another studio, Columbia Pictures, to
make a Pinocchio movie. Columbia, owned by Sony Corp., agreed but
later dropped the project.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers wrote Columbia saying it had the rights to the
project. Coppola said in his lawsuit that Columbia dropped the
project because of Warner's objection. But Coppola said Warner
never had a contract with him.
</P>
<P>
   Warner argued that there was a contract and that Columbia
dropped the picture for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled before the trial that there was no contract. The
jury was asked to decide whether Warner Brothers reasonably
believed it had a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chapman, one of Coppola's lawyers, said Thursday that
Warner Brothers prevented Coppola from making the film because
``they had a vendetta against him.'' Warner Brothers denied any
vendetta, saying it was still working with Coppola on another film.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict might make studios more wary of the common Hollywood
practice of not signing formal long contracts. Coppola never signed
such contracts for the other two films he agreed to make for Warner
either. &QL;

BROKER SAYS POLITICAL VIEWS DREW PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An organizer of an unsuccessful anti-affirmative
action ballot initiative in Houston last year has accused the
city's former mayor and his former employer, the brokerage firm
Paine Webber, of trying to pressure him to curtail his political
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber officials said Thursday that they had spoken to the
organizer and employee, Edward Blum, about his anti-affirmative
action efforts. The officials said they had sought to prevent Blum
from making speeches and publishing his opinions criticizing
government programs that provided preferences to minorities and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Blum, a Paine Webber stockbroker for 16 years, resigned last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Blum was not fired,'' Paine Webber said in a statement.
``He was asked to refrain from publishing articles with a point of
view that reflected negatively on the firm's reputation and led to
client complaints and a loss of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Blum is president of the Campaign for a Color Blind America, a
private nonprofit organization that opposes affirmative action. He
was also co-chairman of the campaign in favor of the Houston Civil
Rights Initiative, which would have barred the city from hiring and
promoting workers and awarding city contracts based on race and
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Blum also accused Bob Lanier, who was mayor of Houston then and
an opponent of the ballot initiative, of notifying Donald Marron,
chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber Group. Blum said
Lanier had threatened Paine Webber with the loss of contracts to
underwrite bonds for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier conceded Thursday that he had complained about Blum's
tactics promoting the initiative to his employer last October. Both
Lanier and the company denied that he had suggested that Paine
Webber would lose city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's completely false,'' Lanier said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of Blum's organizations was connected to Paine Webber.
But during the campaign on the ballot initiative, Blum was
identified as a broker at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   In a written reprimand dated March 31, company officials
criticized Blum for submitting an anti-affirmative action op-ed
article to a number of business journals, stating that his position
could ``negatively affect'' the brokerage house's business.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the letter stated, ``You are advised that the firm
will not clear for publication articles or other press contacts in
which you espouse an anti-affirmative action position such as in
the article submitted to The Wall Street Journal or published in
The Investor's Business Daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber's employee code of conduct requires articles
written by workers to be cleared by the company's communications
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they're telling me that I can't express a view that
could be construed as anti-affirmative action,'' Blum said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blum and his supporters say that Paine Webber's tactics were at
best heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to be having a national conversation on race
and his views fall within the parameter of that discussion,'' said
Abigail Thernstrom, an author and opponent of affirmative action.
``You don't want a society in which people feel intimidated or that
their jobs are on the line because of their political views.''

PIKES PEAK WAS MOLEHILL FOR THIS RIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Ryan makes his living keeping Hollywood
supplied with hot cars and colossal driving stunts.
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend, the Santa Clarita stunt driver and businessman
was working without a script as he drove to his third straight
victory in the big rig truck class at the Pikes Peak International
Hill Climb in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 41, hit speeds of over 80 mph as he powered his
Freightliner cab through the 12{-mile, 5,000-foot ascent in 14
minutes, 30.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The time was a record for Ryan's class, 10 seconds faster than
he achieved in winning in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he started competing at Pikes Peak as a way of
promoting his stunt career and his business, Picture Vehicles of
North Hollywood. ``It's just turned into something really neat,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan made his first runs up Pikes Peak on motorcycles, always
finishing near the middle of the pack. Then he saw a guy climb the
hill in a semi truck _ and was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, whose stunt credits include ``Terminator II'' and ``Thelma
and Louise,'' said his truck is a specialized racing machine.
``It's like a sprint car on steroids,'' he said of the
1,200-horsepower machine.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he plans to defend his title next year at Pikes Peak.
And he hopes to run other events, possibly including the Baja 1000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``I plan to keep doing this for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen ... again:For the fourth time in the past five years, Rod
Millen of Newport Beach was the overall winner of the Pikes Peak
climb.
</P>
<P>
   Millen failed to crack the 10-minute barrier and was more than
three seconds off his record time (10 minutes, 4.06 seconds), set
in 1994. But he was still the fastest guy out there, finishing in
10:07.70.
</P>
<P>
   Cup drivers return to Fontana:NASCAR's Winston Cup series takes
a recess next weekend, allowing several Cup drivers to come to
Fontana's California Speedway for the Craftsman Truck No Fear
Challenge and the Busch Grand National Kenwood Home &AMP; Car 300 on
July 19.
</P>
<P>
   Signed up for the truck race are Cup regulars Bobby Hamilton and
Ernie Irvan. Entered in the Busch race are Dale Jarrett and Dick
Trickle. Michael Waltrip has signed up for both.
</P>
<P>
   Also racing will be former Houston Oilers and Atlanta Falcons
coach Jerry Glanville, who will race in the trucks and in
Saturday's Winston West race.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets remain available for the three races and Friday's
qualifying runs. Prices are $10 for Friday, $30 for Saturday and
$35 for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Go west: Valencia's Sean Woodside trails series leader Kevin
Harvick by five points as the Winston West tour heads to Portland,
Ore., for tonight's TCI Digital Cable 200.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside has been a study in consistency this season, finishing
in the top 10 in all seven races, while winning once. He also has
completed the most laps and led the most laps.
</P>
<P>
   The series makes its second visit to California Speedway in
Fontana on July 18 for the California 200.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Winston Cup driver Mark Martin, in third place
in season points, has a herniated disc but will delay surgery until
after the season.... Ricky Craven will be back in the driver's seat
of the Budweiser No.50 car at Sunday's Winston Cup Jiffy Lube 300
after a four-month recuperation from post-concussion syndrome....
Todd Bodine, who failed to qualify for nine of this season's first
16 Winston Cup races, has lost his job in the No.35 Tabasco
Pontiac. Fellow drivers Ted Musgrave and Mike Skinner are reported
close to losing their rides as well.... Though his old car has
already given him the points lead in the NHRA's top fuel division,
Cory McClenathan will debut a new dragster at next week's Mopar
Parts Mile High Nationals in Colorado.... A new sports car racing
series has been formed, bringing the total to three in the United
States. The American Le Mans Series tour will be based in
Indianapolis and will run as many as 11 events in 1999.... Alex
Zanardi was the last CART driver to win a race from the pole,
taking the Cleveland Grand Prix a year ago. The series bonus for
such a feat has grown by $15,000 per race since and stands at a
record $255,000 for Sunday's race.... Tony Stewart drove his Team
Menard G Force/Aurora to a fast lap of 228.505 mph during testing
at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The time was not official. If it had
been, it would have been a new Indy Racing League record.... Wally
Dallenbach Jr., recently fired from his Winston Cup job with Team
SABCO, will drive for Pennzoil/Panther Racing in the IRL's Lone
Star 500K in Texas in September.... Dallas has joined Indianapolis
and Las Vegas as cities seeking to host a Formula One race in
2000. &QL;

EPIDEMIOLOGIST CHOSEN TO HEAD CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ga., N.Y.)   (EDS: Subs to give location of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
graf 6.)  
(lh) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has selected Dr. Jeffrey
P. Koplan, an epidemiologist, as the next director of the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Koplan spent 22 years
at the agency before leaving four years ago to run the research arm
of Prudential Healthcare, one of the nation's largest health
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, is
expected to announce the appointment on Friday morning at the
centers' headquarters in Atlanta, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan will assume the post on Oct. 5, replacing Dr. David
Satcher, who left the agency in February to become surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan is ``respected by the left and the right alike,'' said
one official who is familiar with Koplan's selection but who spoke
on condition that he not be identified. ``I have been impressed by
the people who have called on his behalf. Unlike any other senior
post, I haven't heard a bad thing from anyone who has some ax to
grind.''
</P>
<P>
   At the disease control centers, Koplan will oversee a vast and
often unseen bureaucracy with 6,900 employees and a wide-ranging
mission, from curbing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases
to investigating the effects of violence on the public health. He
is also being appointed administrator of the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry, which is concerned with preventing
health damage from exposure to hazardous substances. Neither
appointment requires Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Boston, Koplan, 53, is a graduate of Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York City and the Harvard University
School of Public Health. He began his career at the Centers for
Disease Control in 1972 as one of the agency's celebrated ``disease
detectives,'' who are dispatched around the world to investigate
outbreaks of infectious diseases. For the next two decades, he
worked on public health matters, including the eradication of
smallpox and the promotion of screening for breast and cervical
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Koplan was instrumental in formulating the
agency's response to the AIDS epidemic, particularly its efforts to
protect the nation's blood supply, an effort that later became
controversial. In 1984, he led a federal delegation to Bhopal,
India, to investigate an explosion at the Union Carbide chemical
plant. Five years later, he became the first director of the
agency's new Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion, a job he held until he left the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Koplan is a world-class scientist, but above all, he is a
leader,'' said Dr. Bill Roper, who served as the director of the
centers from 1990 to 1993 and who later recruited Koplan to
Prudential Healthcare, a unit of Prudential Insurance Company of
America. ``He has a deep personal commitment to public health and a
burning zeal for prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   At Prudential, Koplan is president of the Center for Health Care
Research in Atlanta, where he supervises studies intended to make
medical care more efficient and effective.
</P>
<P>
   That experience may be particularly useful for Koplan in his new
job, as the centers tries to persuade managed-care organizations to
pay more attention to public health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a very strong mix of technical expertise and
management ability, with a vision of where to go with public
health,'' said an agency official, who insisted on anonymity. ``My
sense is that his appointment will be very warmly received.''

&HT;        SEN. REID STARTS LEADERSHIP PAC AS HE FIGHTS TO SAVE HIS OWN
SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORRECTS FIFTH GRAPH AND SIXTH GRAPH
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 9 -- Sen. Harry Reid is openly campaigning for
a top Democratic leadership position next year, bringing many
people -- including his chief opponent -- to speculate that the
Nevada Democrat thinks he has already won this year's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In a apparent move to win support from his colleagues to replace
retiring Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., as Senate minority whip, Reid
formed a political action committee in May to help Democrats across
the country financially with their Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Reid does not deny he is interested in becoming the next whip
and said the people of Nevada would benefit if he is elected to the
leadership position. Reid points to his seniority in the Senate as
one of the main reasons discussions of an interim nuclear dump site
at Yucca Mountain came to a halt in June. And Reid said his
position on the Senate Appropriations Committee has brought
millions of dollars into the Silver State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, and I am
in line to be the next whip,'' he said. ``I think the people of the
state of Nevada are very happy I am in a leadership position and
best friends with (Senate Minority Leader) Tom Daschle.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said there are ``a lot of reasons'' he opened the PAC three
months ago, which he said has raised about $100,000. Reid said his
PAC dubbed the Searchlight Leadership Fund has contributed to about
32 Senate campaigns including former Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh and
California Sen. Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Ensign, R-Nev., who is leaving his House seat this
year to challenge Reid, said the Democratic senator is making a
mistake if he thinks the Senate race is over five months before the
November election. And Ensign said Reid is following the same
ill-fated path of Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., who was upset by Sen.
Bill Frist, R-Tenn., in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Some political pundits speculate that Sasser was more focused on
succeeding retiring Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, as the next
majority leader, instead of focusing on his campaign back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reid) is in the race for his life out here,'' Ensign said.
``We don't think he is going to be the next whip, because we don't
think he is going to be in the Senate after November.''
</P>
<P>
   Ensign said it is ideologically impossible for Reid to be part
of the ``liberal leaning'' Democratic Senate leadership team and
still represent the needs of Nevadans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevada is a very conservative state,'' Ensign said. ``When you
run for leadership positions in the Senate they normally elect more
liberal members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very typical for (Reid) to be doing one thing in
Washington and saying another (in Nevada).'' Paul Henry, chairman
of the Nevada Democratic Party, refuted Ensign's statement and said
Reid is very active on a number of issues important to Nevadans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first day of his election, he has paid a great deal of
attention to constituent services,'' Henry said. ``This is a man
that is very much in step with the issues that concern the people
of Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Burdish, executive director for the Nevada Republican Party,
said he is not surprised Reid formed his own leadership PAC.
Burdish also said Republicans will be watching to make sure Reid
doesn't use the PAC to illegally fund his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern about him starting up a leadership PAC to fund
other campaigns is if he starts to receive campaign contributions
from the campaigns he has already given to,'' Burdish said. ``If he
is doing it to raise money for his campaign to get around FEC
contribution rules I don't think it is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said he would support Reid if he
runs for the whip position. Bryan also said he thinks Reid will
beat Ensign, but it will be a tough campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point, Sen. Reid has run a great campaign,''
Bryan said. ``I think Sen. Reid is going to win, but Congressman
Ensign is a formidable opponent.''

BOEING PRODUCT OF TRANSPORT JETS TO DOUBLE OVER NEXT FEW YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as The Boeing Co. eliminates jobs and slashes production of
commercial jets at the former Douglas aircraft plant at Long Beach,
Calif., it's a much different story for the 8,000 Boeing workers
who assemble the military's giant C-17 transport less than a mile
away.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the cargo jet for the U.S. Air Force will nearly
double over the next several years, and this week Great Britian
gave the strongest signal yet that it may become the first foreign
customer for the C-17.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Defense Secretary George Robertson, after a year-long
review of that country's defense priorities, announced Wednesday
that the government plans to buy four C-17s ``or their
equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a small order by Great Britian is considered significant
since it could lead to other NATO countries deciding on the C-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news,'' Rick Fuller, Boeing's C-17 spokesman in
Long Beach, said Thursday. ``We are very encouraged that the U.K.
has publicly identified their air transport needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that any actual order for the C-17 by Great
Britian is still months away.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing would be able to deliver the first C-17 to Great Britian
less than two years after any contract is signed, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Boeing submitted an unsolicited proposal to
the U.K. Ministry of Defense to lease several C-17s for up to 12
years to meet its strategic airlift requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom has already ordered 25 of Lockheed Martin's
smaller C-130J transports to replace older model Hercules
transports. The C-17 can carry up to four times as much cargo as
the C-130J, but land on the same length runway.
</P>
<P>
   With a flyaway cost of about $175 million dollars, the C-17 is
more expensive than a Boeing 747, which has a list price of from
$158 million to $176 million.
</P>
<P>
   By improving manufacturing processes, Boeing reportedly believes
it can reduce the unit cost of the C-17 to about $150 million. But
that is still a lot of money for a single airplane, and Great
Britian and other European countries are looking at the possible
development of something called the Future Large Aircraft to meet
their military airlift needs.
</P>
<P>
   Cost of such an aircraft is estimated at $75 million, but many
aviation experts don't believe the plane will ever get off the
ground because of declining defense budgets and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing believes there is a market outside the United States for
as many as 50 of its C-17s.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the only orders have come from the U.S. Air Force,
which will get 120 planes. Forty have been delivered. Nine more
will be delivered to the Air Force this year. Production will peak
at 15 planes a year by 2002, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the C-17 is assembled at Long Beach, the parts are
manufactured elsewhere. About 2,000 workers in St. Louis build the
nose section.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited the C-17 in its merger last year with McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The C-17 plant in Long Beach is less than a mile from the
Douglas facility where Boeing now builds the MD-90, MD-80 and
MD-11, as well as its new 100-seat jet, the 717.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing is discontinuing production of all the McDonnel
Douglas planes. That could leave only the 717 commercial line in
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   However, Boeing executives have been studying the feasibility of
adding a 737 assembly line in Long Beach to ease production
problems of that model in Renton. A decision is expected by Aug. 1.

JURY ACQUITS DON KING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs for clarifications; minor changes throughout)

 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal jury acquitted Don King of nine counts of
wire fraud Thursday, the second time he was tried on charges of
attempting to defraud a Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate out
of $350,000 following cancellation of a boxing match involving
Julio Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   The jury could not reach a verdict concerning Don King
Productions, a defendant along with King. It voted 11-1 to acquit
the company, according to one juror. The government has chosen not
to retry the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for all America _ not black America or white
America,'' said King, who said he read from a Bible as he listened
to the verdict, then received the embraces of his lawyers and shook
most of the jurors' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you all very much,'' he said, leaning over the jury box.
</P>
<P>
   The post-verdict scene was reminiscent of one of King's
circus-like news conferences. The fight promoter laughed
boisterously, soliloquized his jubilation in religious and
hyperbolic terms and signed autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say goodbye,'' one juror said to King, gently
kissing him.
</P>
<P>
   As King ventured from the 15th floor courtroom to talk to
reporters outside the U.S. Court House in Lower Manhattan, he
greeted three court security officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm free again!'' he said, embracing one. ``I'm free,
brotherman!''
</P>
<P>
   When two rabbis who displayed their support during the
three-month trial approached King, he gleefully shouted, ``My
rabbis! These are my rabbis!''
</P>
<P>
   In his jubilation, King did not directly scorn the government's
case against him, but referred to those who abuse power. ``When my
lawyer said, `We the people,' my liver quivered and my heart
palpitated,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, King, 66, looked like a man unworried
about his legal fate. Although his trademark flamboyance was muted
by the trial's formality, he frequently flashed his broad smile,
garrulously greeted visitors, some bearing gifts, and joked with
the courtroom artist. ``I tried desperately to feel down, but
couldn't,'' he said. ``I'd say, `Your head is in the lion's
mouth.'''
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's verdict, King has won acquittals from two
federal juries in Manhattan, the first one in 1985 on charges of
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, said she would not prosecute Don King Productions again
on the wire fraud charges because it would not be in the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasted with her decision to retry King after a hung
jury in 1995 forced U.S. District Judge Lawrence McKenna to declare
a mistrial in the government's first case against King.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This time, with McKenna presiding again, White's office added
King's company to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   King faced a maximum of 45 years in prison had he been convicted
on all nine counts, but sentencing guidelines would have pared that
down.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been fined up to $250,000 for each count; fines of
$1 million could have been imposed for each of the seven counts his
company had faced.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction against his company could have barred King from
promoting fights in Nevada, but the state attorney general had
reserved a decision on that until after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment had kept King from promoting fight cards in New
Jersey. A call to the state Athletic Control Board seeking comment
was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were not convinced that King or his company submitted a
fake contract to Lloyd's after the cancellation of Chavez's 1991
fight against Harold Brazier that stipulated King was due repayment
of $350,000 in ``maintenance nonrefundable training expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that Chavez, who was injured during training,
prompting the bout's cancellation, got $80,000 in training expenses
and owed $270,000 more from a $736,000 loan King made to Chavez
against a future purse, money that was characterized as a
``maintenance'' payment.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fiscus, one of the jurors, said he was persuaded by a
faxed insurance binder that Lloyd's covered what the defense said
it did.
</P>
<P>
   Between Tuesday afternoon and early Thursday, the case had
plunged into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the jury forewoman reported to McKenna that one
juror related to the others a newspaper report that King's maximum
sentence could be 45 years. The forewoman also reported to McKenna
that one juror was causing a deadlock, leading the judge to
interview the jurors Wednesday to see if they could continue to
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Dean Yager, had pushed hard to convict King and his
company, according to lawyers involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna urged the jurors to deliberate again at 12:15 p.m.
Thursday. After 100 minutes, the jury told McKenna it had a verdict
on King but continued to be deadlocked on the company.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna refused a government request to compel the jury to
deliberate further on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got unanimous on King this morning,'' said Marianne Mileno,
the jury forewoman. Regarding friction over Yager's stand on
convicting the company, she said, ``It was very emotional. It was
difficult personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Yager said little as he rushed from the courtroom. Asked if the
three and a half months of jury service had embittered him, he
said: ``Precisely.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fleming Jr., a lawyer for King, said the defense was
unhappy with Yager at jury selection, but could not dismiss him for
cause.
</P>
<P>
   King's legal fights are not over. Now, he must fend off a
federal lawsuit filed against him by Mike Tyson. ``We'll deal with
it,'' King said, pausing to expound upon life's various forms of
love. ``I love him. He's my beloved brother.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was a tough one for the New York City Fire
Department, maybe tougher than some of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Not just because Capt. Scott LaPiedra, who died on the Fourth of
July, left behind a wife and four young children. Or because he was
twice cited for bravery. Or because he was a member of a family
that counted among its ranks a father who is a retired police
officer and brothers who are now in the police, fire, sanitation
departments.
</P>
<P>
   For some firefighters, LaPiedra's funeral Thursday in Staten
Island was especially difficult because the captain, a veteran
marathoner, had died after running the bravest, and most
spectacular, marathon of his 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite burns to 70 percent of his body, LaPiedra, with big
lungs and a big heart, defied medical logic by surviving for a
month. And in the process, firefighters often found it difficult to
cope with what became an emotionally draining roller coaster, day
after praying day, week after hoping week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he hung on, it kind of made it a sadder situation,''
said Lt. Timothy Murphy of the Glen Falls Fire Department in
upstate New York, who, as a firefighter and a licensed funeral
director, knows a thing or two about emotional duress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in limbo,'' said Murphy, who didn't know LaPiedra but
felt compelled to drive four hours to pay his respects. ``Everyone
is like, `Is he going to make it? If he does, what's the situation
going to be?'''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters are accustomed, of course, to danger on the job;
LaPiedra was the third New York City firefighter to die this year
as a result of job-related injuries and the 767th in the
department's 133-year history. But when a firefighter dies, it
usually occurs so soon after the devastating blaze that people can
grieve and bounce back in relatively quick order.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, did not happen in LaPiedra's case. And it only
gave firefighters more time to appreciate the risks that their
colleagues embrace and to contemplate their own mortality and
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were praying for Scottie every day, so how can you not
think about it?'' said Capt. Michael DeGennaro of Engine Company 82
in the Bronx. ``It puts everything in perspective because you don't
know who it's going to happen to next.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPiedra, a 19-year veteran who was a ranking officer in Ladder
Company 176 in East New York, Brooklyn, had been injured while
fighting a five-alarm inferno on June 5 that swallowed a row of
small, wood-frame houses in that neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve others were injured that night; one other firefighter,
Lt. James W. Blackmore, 48, died in the blaze, while two others
remain in stable condition at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center with serious burns.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Staten Island resident, LaPiedra was, by all
accounts, the consummate family man and neighborhood guy, living
with his wife, Addie, and their four children in the same house
that he had grown up in with his seven siblings.
</P>
<P>
   At work, he was revered for quiet leadership and unassuming
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great teacher and 100 percent professional, yet he
did it with a smile,'' said Lt. Cliff Miller, a pallbearer
Thursday, who retired last year after a heart attack. ``We had a
party last year to celebrate my recovery and his promotion to
captain. I'll always remember him and I, arm and arm, with the
pipers playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, more than 12,000 others remembered LaPiedra, too,
descending upon St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church in a pleasant,
residential neighborhood dotted by shingle-style houses and
magnolia trees.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m., the crowd grew hushed as Police Department
motorcycles began purring toward the church, past an army of
firefighters in crisp blue uniforms standing 20 deep and extending
perhaps a half-mile. Other teams followed: two black cars groaning
under the weight of flowers, bagpipers wailing ``Amazing Grace''
and drummers playing drums covered in purple-and-black bunting.
</P>
<P>
   One, two, three, drum roll. One, two, three, drum roll.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a mournful silence, punctured only by chirping birds
and barking dogs in the distance. A fire engine rolled up to the
church carrying LaPiedra's coffin, which was wrapped by the
red-and-white flag of the Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   It was standing room only inside the 850-seat church, with
relatives occupying most of the front pews to the right of the
aisle, and city officials, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, sitting to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was one of several people to eulogize LaPiedra. And to
let LaPiedra's four children _ Scott, 13, Buddy, 12, and twins,
Megan and Shannon, 10 _ know how much their father was revered and
respected, the mayor asked the congregation to stand, salute the
captain and applaud.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Richard LaPiedra, the captain's brother and a fellow
firefighter, who delivered the most heartfelt of the eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott, I would've felt privileged if I had only known you as a
friend,'' he said, his voice quivering with emotion. ``I am honored
for 30 years to have been your brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people lingered after the funeral, talking quietly,
sighing heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ennis Keating, a firefighter with Ladder Company 37 in the
Bronx, reminisced about how he and other firefighters had prepared
french toast, sausages and eggs every morning for the last month
for LaPiedra's family, who had maintained a vigil at Jacobi Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But now, there will be no more breakfasts. &QL;

A FAST BREAK FOR MADKINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twenty-nine players are in Chicago, vying for the
right to be slandered and second-guessed and maybe even snubbed by
the very people they aim to please.
</P>
<P>
   Former UCLA guard Gerald Madkins is among the players
auditioning to be stand-ins for an all-NBA team that came up with a
collective case of blue flu six weeks before basketball's turn on
the world's stage.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA lockout has left peripheral players such as Madkins in a
bit of a bind; the summer leagues, long an opportunity for free
agents to assimilate an NBA team's system and showcase their
individual talents, won't have the same emphasis this year. Teams
are unsure of their rosters because no player transactions can
occur during the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the FIBA World Championship in Athens, Greece, as
the only proving ground around. And yet to play for Team USA is to
risk being perceived as traitors rather than patriots by some NBA
suits, or singlets, as it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the competition itself. With Vlade Divac playing
for his native Yugoslavia and a handful of other NBA players
representing their homelands, the battle for first place among the
16 participating nations is expected to be fierce.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian team has been practicing together for months and
the Greeks always are tough on their home turf. But heaven help the
patchwork patriots from the U.S. if they fail to bring home the
title, and with it, the automatic berth for the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 candidates chosen to accept this assignment are playing
with a stacked deck; if they win, the spin back in the states will
be they simply minded the chips in the absence of Vin Baker, Gary
Payton, Terrell Brandon, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Tom Gugliotta,
Tim Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allan Houston, Christian Laettner, Glen
Rice and Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose, they're liable to know how the U.S. soccer team
felt during the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters to Madkins, 29, who started the 1997-98
season with the Rockford Lightning of the Continental Basketball
Association, was summoned by the Miami Heat for a 10-day stay
midway through the year and spent the last month under contract
with the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between a career-threatening moped accident at UCLA
after his freshman year and a career-lurching ride through France,
Spain, the CBA and the NBA, Madkins learned to discern his inner
voice in the din.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife (Julie) and I looked at it like this,'' Madkins said
Thursday from Chicago. ``I've been in the NBA for parts of three
seasons but I've been an American for 29 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention to defense that distinguished Madkins' career at
UCLA remains keen, both on and off the court. To cover himself,
Madkins said he contacted the NBA Players' Association before
accepting the invitation to what amounts to a three-day tryout (the
squad will be selected Saturday and the team will leave Wednesday
for Greece by way of Monaco and Rome).
</P>
<P>
   ``The players' association said they wouldn't hold it against me
if I came here,'' said Madkins, who isn't one to bear a grudge if
they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been bounced around so much. I can't really say I'm in
the NBA, even though I finished the season there. I can honestly
say my career is on a downward slide. Who knows if I'll ever play
in the NBA again, with the lockout? So this is a great opportunity
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Madkins, who averaged 12.8 minutes in 19 games with the
Warriors, is the oldest guard and fourth-oldest player in camp.
There will be no need to towel off the basketball when Madkins gets
through handling it. Battling the likes of ballyhooed 5-foot-5
guard Earl Boykins, a recent college graduate, isn't likely to make
the L.A. resident sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another tryout in a long line of them,'' said Madkins,
who has acquiesced to more auditions than a struggling actor since
leaving UCLA in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His big break came in 1993 when he was signed by the Cleveland
Cavaliers. He spent two seasons there and has bounced back and
forth between the CBA and the NBA since.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball took Madkins far, transporting him to the edge of
Hollywood, quite literally, before dumping him off at the side of
the road to navigate the final mile. It has proven to be a long and
oftentimes lonely journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough grind for me,'' said Madkins, whose fatal
flaw, if you can call it that, is he's too selfless a player to put
up the numbers that command attention.
</P>
<P>
   CBA coaches have told him as much. All Madkins knows is, ``I've
never gone anywhere and stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Madkins is starting to feel the pull to put down some permanent
roots. He and Julie, his college sweetheart, have two boys,
Christopher, 2, and Brandon, six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to leave your children, even though you know
you're doing it for the betterment of their future,'' said Madkins,
who will miss Christopher's birthday if he survives Saturday's cut.
</P>
<P>
   His firstborn turns 3 on Aug. 9, the date of the championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be magical if Madkins was able to give his son a belated
gift of a gold medal. Truth to tell, any souvenir from the trip
would be priceless to Madkins, who has labored long enough to fully
appreciate the opportunity created by the NBA's labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   If Madkins makes the team, you can be sure there will be no
flying elbows or fire extinguishers in Athens. A pampered U.S. star
like Charles Barkley or certain NHL standouts he and the other
prospective players decidedly are not.
</P>
<P>
   That alone should make everyone root all the harder for this
team, whomever ends up on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like myself,'' Madkins said, ``don't need a lot. We
just want to be a part of something that's growing.'' &QL;

 This article was reported by JAMES RISEN, CHRISTOPHER DREW and
DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and was written by Drew.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last two years, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, a
mother-and-son team with long criminal records, have traveled
across the United States and beyond, always remaining a step ahead
of criminal investigators seeking to question them about theft,
arson and the disappearance _ or murders _ of at least three
people.
</P>
<P>
   They fled the West earlier this year, avoiding police who were
hunting them in connection with a complex swindle and a murder that
left a house burned to ashes in Las Vegas and the body of a friend
crumpled in a dumpster at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators zeroed in on them in Louisiana, where the Kimeses
purchased a mobile home under a false name. But police just missed
them there, and they discovered the mobile home abandoned in
Florida. Again the Kimeses were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Police finally tracked them down Sunday in New York, arresting
them at the New York Hilton on a Utah warrant for writing a bogus
check.
</P>
<P>
   But one last time, investigators now fear, they were just hours
too late.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the mother-and-son team were in jail that
investigators suspected their involvement in the disappearance
earlier that day of a wealthy East Side Manhattan socialite, Irene
Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   And in interviews Thursday, investigators in New York and in
other cities said they believe the Kimeses are classic con artists,
using fake names, fradulent documents and quick getaways. When they
were arrested Sunday, they were carrying Mrs. Silverman's passport
and other papers, an investigators believe they were fraudulently
trying to take possession of her home. In addition, officials said
they had recovered a 9-mm handgun from a car the Kimeses were
driving and that they were analyzing blood found outside her 65th
Street townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And law-enforcement officials said they have been struck by how
closely the pair's dealings with Mrs. Silverman tracked a series of
possibly fraudulent transactions they had early this year with
David Kazdin, a Los Angeles businessman and longtime friend of the
Kimeses whose body was later found in an airport dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who spent any time with them quickly realized they were
scammers,'' DePasquale said. ``They came across like real
first-class types at the start. But pretty soon, everyone saw they
were just conning people left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the concern is that Mrs. Kimes, 63 and long a wealthy
woman, has a lengthy history of committing petty and bizarre crimes
and hiding behind numerous aliases. But while neither of the
Kimeses has been charged with any crimes in connection with the
disappearances of Mrs. Silverman and a banker in the Bahamas, and
the murder Kazdin, the investigators say they are trying to
determine why her activities have taken on a more serious and
disturbing cast, and how her 23-year-old son came to join her in
these suspicious dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from New York and Los Angeles met in New York on
Thursday to compare notes on Mrs. Silverman's case and the murder
of Kazdin. Detective Mike DePasquale, a homicide co-ordinator for
the Los Angeles Police Department, confirmed that the Kimseses are
suspects in Kazdin's murder and that efforts to obtain some of his
money is the most likely motive.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said Bahamian officials also would
like to question the Kimeses in connection with the disappearance a
banker, Syed Bilal Ahmed, there in 1996. Doug Hanna, chief of the
criminal investigative unit of the Royal Bahamas Police, said Ahmed
had some dealings with Sante Kimes, who was in the Bahamas at that
time, but that she had left the Bahamas before police could ask her
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said Ahmed's body has never been found and his
disappearance has never been solved. He added that the Bahamas
never issued an arrest warrant for Sante Kimes because police did
not have enough evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   New York City detectives said they also have not gathered enough
evidence to charge the Kimeses in Mrs. Silverman's disappearance,
and they still have found no sign of her body. The Police
Department and federal agents executed a search warrant on the
Kimeses' green Lincoln Town Car Wednesday, finding two suitcases in
the trunk that contained $10,000 in cash, a loaded 9mm handgun,
some loose ammunition for a .22-caliber gun and a collection of
documents involving Mrs. Silverman's finances. The documents
contained Ms. Silverman's signature, but the authorities were
investigating Thursday night to determine whether they were
authentic or forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   But while police try to determine whether the Kimeses, who are
being held at Rikers Island have committed any violent crimes,
several investigators said there is substantial evidence showing
they have tried to bilked other people out of their money.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews and records show that the first public signs of Mrs.
Kimes' propensity for trouble came in the late 1970s, when she and
her husband, Kenneth K. Kimes Sr., a wealthy owner of motels and
other real-estate, were living in an expensive beachfront home in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Catterlin, a lawyer who represented Mrs. Kimes then,
recalled that she was accused of stealing a car from an auto
dealer's lot. He also said an insurance company sued her for
passing off a new quilt that she had lost as an antique worth
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Catterlin said Mrs. Kimes also would embellish the truth to
appear more wealthy than she was. For example, he said, she would
tell people that a five-carat glass ring was a diamond given by her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the lawyer said, she often used aliases. When Mrs.
Kimes later failed to pay his legal fees, Catterlin said, he sued
her unsuccessfully, identifying her in court papers by 22 possible
names. ``She was known by every name there ever was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mr. Kimes' motel companies bought a house on a golf
course in Las Vegas in 1980, and the couple also spent time in the
early 1980s in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes also was convicted in mid-1985 of stealing a $6,500
mink coat from a piano bar at one of Washington's most fashionable
hotels. And about two weeks after that, she was arrested for
enslaving several Mexican maids at houses the couple owned in San
Diego, Las Vegas and Honolulu. She served a five-year sentence for
refusing to pay the maids or allow them time off, and her husband
pleaded guilty to a lesser offense.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these years, acquaintances said, the Kimeses often
lived at a house on a golf course in Las Vegas that one of Mr.
Kimes' motel companies bought in 1980, and neighbors say they
rarely socialized. ``She always had lots of hair and wore a
wide-brimmed hat, but I never talked to her,'' said one long-time
neighbor who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1994, and the most serious questions about
Mrs. Kimes _ and how she seemed to team up with her son _ have
arisen since then.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Ahmed, an official of the Gulf Union Bank,
based in the Cayman Islands, disappeared in September 1996 after
going to Nassau to investigate irregularities at the bank's unit in
the Bahamas. Hanna said Ahmed met with Mrs. Kimes shortly before he
disappeared. And shortly after that, Kenneth Kimes was arrested in
Florida in May 1997 on attempted theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   But law-enforcement officials say the questions about the
Kimeses' activities intensified after they conducted a series of
financial transactions with Kazdin late last year and early this
year. The deals involved the house in Las Vegas that the Kimeses
had bought in 1980, and had later sold to Kazdin, the Los Angeles
man who owned a document-copying business.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas and Los Angeles police say these deals now seem
remarkably similar to parts of the Silverman case.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the Kimeses had promised Kazdin that they
would provide him with a steady tenant who would rent the property.
But late last year, the Kimeses arranged for the house to be sold
to the renter, another Las Vegas man named Robert McCarren. The
real estate documents were notarized by a woman named Nanette
Wetkowski, a local notary public who was a business partner of the
Kimeses. Police believe the documents were falsified, and that the
renter was simply a front for the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas police said they believe Ms. Wetkowski should have
known that she was notarizing false documents. The purpose of the
false sale was to obtain a new loan of $280,000 on the property,
police believe, with that money going to the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the check from the loan cleared, police said,
Kazdin's body was found in a dumpster at Los Angeles International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The house in Las Vegas burned on Jan. 31, and local fire
officials determined that the fire had been set. Officials
considered Sante Kimes a suspect in the fire, said Mike Patterson,
the Las Vegas chief of fire investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that fire officials believe that the fire was
related to the complex real estate transactions that had occurred
just before the fire. He said that Mrs. Kimes may have used
McCarren as a front for the purchase in part to obtain new fire
insurance on the home that she could not have obtained with her
long criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson added that there is an open criminal arson
investigation of Mrs. Kimes, which has remained open because fire
officials did not know where she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our theory is that they used Mr. McCarren to rebuy the house
to get additional insurance, then burned it,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely set by her, you didn't have to go inside to
see that. There had been a fire upstairs, and a fire downstairs,
and they weren't even related.'' But Patterson added that ``I
didn't even have any clue where to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kazdin's murder in March, McCarren was held by the Kimes
in Los Angeles this spring, and police believe he could have become
their next victim, but he escaped and called the Los Angeles police
for help. The Kimeses then fled themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as April, they lived at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel
in Beverly Hills, and it was there that they ordered the green 1997
Lincoln Town car that eventually led to their capture. Scott Burns,
the district attorney in Iron County, Utah, said the dealership
agreed to accept their order by phone because the Kimses had
purchased other cars without problems.
</P>
<P>
   The dealership had an employee and his wife drive the car to the
Wilshire on April 4, 1998, where the Kimeses bought them a $500
dinner at a glitzy restaurant and rewarded them with a $100 tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the check, it was for $14,900 and headed back
home,'' Burns said. ``It was only later that the dealership learned
the account had been frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   The check was written from a Wells Fargo Bank account of Ms.
Wetkowski, the notary public who worked as the Kimeses' accountant,
authorities said. When Sante Kimes was informed that the check had
bounced, she apologized and called it ``a mistake,'' Burns said.
But before sending a new check, the Kimses moved to Las Vegas and
Sante Kimes began calling the dealership to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she'd only write them a new check if they gave her
new car, `` Burns said. ``She'd be grumbling, `I want a black one.
I want a 1998. The trunk leaks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After a series of haggling phone calls over the course of the
next several days _ all of which were placed from public
telephones, investigators said _ the car dealer grew worried and
filed a criminal complaint. It was then that Utah officials learned
that the Kimeses were wanted for questioning in the Kazdin murder.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Kimes resumed her calls demanding a new car, Utah
police set up a sting. The dealership agreed to deliver a new car
to Mrs. Kimes at the Las Vegas Hilton. But unbeknownst to the
Kimeses, a detective would accompany the delivery and was prepared
to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
   But when they arrived at the hotel bar, they were paged by the
Kimeses, and Sante asked them to meet her and Kenneth at Landry's
Hotel, a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that the Kimeses were suspects in a murder, and fearing
that their cover had been blown, the detective decided not to.
</P>
<P>
   `He was afraid for their well being,'' Burns said. ``So he and
the transporter just headed back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Police picked up their trail when they purchased a mobile home
in Louisiana, and used Ms. Wetkowski's name to purchase it. Police
tracked the mobile home to Florida, but found it abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The next time they heard about the Kimeses was when the
informant in Las Vegas contacted the police to say they had called
him and asked him to join them in New York.

PANEL URGES MORE STUDY ON DRUG-RESISTANT ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 1st graf for smoothing)   (bl)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Humans can contract antibiotic-resistant infections
from animals used for food, a National Academy of Science panel
said on Thursday, but the risk to public health from eating meat or
poultry or by being in contact with the live animals or meat
products has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was charged with investigating the safety of a wide
variety of drugs in livestock. It returned with a report that both
presented possible problems with the use of drugs, but also
pointing out that many drugs help insure the safety of the food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   The number of documented cases of human illnesses traced to
antibiotic-resistant disease organisms from animals is very low,
the experts said, but the true risk is difficult to assess because
critical data are lacking on sources of human diseases and the
extent that food animals harbor resistant germs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Coffman, provost at Kansas State University in
Manhattan and chairman of the panel, said antibiotics used to
control and treat diseases in animals help provide healthier meat,
eggs and dairy products for consumers. ``But there have been a few
cases in which resistant bacteria have been passed to people,''
Coffman said. ``Extra vigilance is needed to prevent the spread of
bacteria that cannot be destroyed with currently available drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member panel _ which included health specialists, food
industry scientists, disease experts and consumer representatives _
reviewed the role of drugs in the food supply, the majority of
which are antibiotics. The committee included members of two units
of the National Academy of Sciences _ the National Research Council
and the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, in a 200-page report, recommended that the
federal government establish a permanent oversight panel to monitor
drug resistance and suggest the best ways for antibiotics to be
used in humans and animals. This panel should include members from
regulatory agencies, medical and veterinary groups, the food
industry and consumer groups, said the report, whose sponsors
included the departments of Agriculture and Health and Human
Services and the American Feed Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended establishing a national database on
antibiotic use and resistance trends in humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it called for more research to develop new classes
of antibiotics because bacteria that develop resistance to one
antibiotic tend to become immune to others in the same class.
Current monitoring systems to detect the levels of drugs in meat,
milk and other food products from animals are adequate, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 60 percent to 80 percent of all cattle, swine,
sheep, and poultry in the United States receive antibiotics at some
point. While some of these drugs are used to treat specific
diseases, it said, much of the estimated 19 million pounds of
antibiotics used annually in agriculture is added to food or water
to promote the growth of animals and to prevent disease
transmission among animals held in close quarters. This
``subtherapeutic'' use of antibiotics allows more animals to be
raised at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups have called for regulators to ban
antibiotic use in food animals for purposes other than to treat
specific diseases posing an immediate threat. The Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group
that has campaigned for restricted antibiotic use among both
animals and people to preserve the effectiveness of the drugs, said
the new report bolstered its call for banning subtherapeutic uses
in the food system.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new report estimated that such a ban in agriculture
would cost consumers between $1.2 billion and $2.5 billion a year
in higher prices for poultry, beef, pork, fish and other foodstuff.
In addition, the report said, animal diseases might become more
widespread, increasing public health risks, and lead to higher
demand for antibiotics for treating sick animals.
</P>
<P>
   The Animal Health Institute, representing makers of vaccines,
drugs, food additives and other animal health products, said
conclusions of the report were consistent with other studies
calling for prudent use of antibiotics in farm animals, better
monitoring and science-based regulations governing approval and use
of antibiotics. It praised the report for recognizing the benefits
of antibiotic use in improving the food supply.

   2 REAL ESTATE TRUSTS JOIN TO BUY TOWER
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reckson Associates Realty Corp., a real estate
investment trust, announced Thursday that it was joining with a
partner to acquire Tower Realty Trust, which owns 2.3 million
square feet of office space in New York City and properties in the
Orlando, Fla., and Phoenix areas.
</P>
<P>
   Reckson said it has a partnership with Crescent Real Estate
Equities Co. of Fort Worth, Texas, to acquire Tower in a
transaction valued at $733 million.
</P>
<P>
   Reckson and Crescent have agreed to pay $24 a share for Tower
stock. The price includes the assumption of $285 million in Tower
debt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cash, th acquiring companies are offering Tower
stockholders up to 40 percent of the value of their shares in
Reckson and Crescent stock, a move intended to help owners who sold
property to Tower to shelter their capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   Reckson and Crescent plan to form a joint venture called
Metropolitan Partners that will operate as a private real estate
investment trust and will seek to make further acquisitions in New
York City, said Reckson's president, Scott Rechler. He said the
companies have a combined capital of about $8 billion, $2.2 billion
of which is from Reckson.
</P>
<P>
   Rechler said Tower's properties in Phoenix and Orlando would be
sold to allow the partnership to focus on New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tower, formerly Feldman Equities, went public last October,
raising about $300 million.

   BROKERS CHARGED IN FRAUD
</P>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Eight management-level stockbrokers from a
defunct New York City brokerage house were charged Thursday with
cheating thousands of investors out of more than $100 million by
using fraudulent sales techniques. The indictment, returned in
federal court in Newark, raises the number of brokers from the
brokerage house, L.C. Wegard &AMP; Co., who have been accused in the
case to 16.
</P>
<P>
   David Rosenfield, an assistant U.S. attorney, said the
defendants named in the indictment hired inexperienced brokers from
1991 to 1995 and handed them scripted sales pitches containing
misleading information and forecasts on risky stocks. The
defendants instructed the brokers not to warn their customers that
some of the stocks were highly speculative or notify them that some
of the companies were under investigation for securities
violations, Rosenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   When investors tried to sell their stocks, the brokers often
refused to execute the orders, he said. &QL;

YANKEES DROP DEVIL RAYS 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Yankees' final place in the American
League East standing has become almost a foregone conclusion. After
Joe Girardi supplied the runs with a two-run homer and Andy
Pettitte and Mariano Rivera combined Thursday night to shut out
Tampa Bay, 2-0, in the first game following the three-day All-Star
break, the Yankees forged 11-and-a-half games ahead of the
second-place Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   For the Yankees, the shutout was the second in a row, following
David Cone's effort against Baltimore on Sunday _ the first
back-to-back shutouts since 1989. The Yankees have won seven games
in a row, 11 of their last 12, and their clinching number for a
playoff spot already is down to 62 with 80 games to play.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle for posterity remains heated: With a 62-20
record, they are tied with the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates for the best
82-game record in history. If the Yankees do manage to pull away
from Honus Wagner and the '02 Pirates, it will be because of their
starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 32 games, the Yankees have had 26 quality starts _
six or more innings, three earned runs or less. The earned run
average of the starting pitchers has dropped from 4.18 to 3.59, and
they have a record of 20-5.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, who yielded only five hits and one walk while striking
out eight in eight innings Thursday night, established immediately
that the Yankees would not be guilty of attention deficit disorder
as the second half of the season began.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre called a mandatory, full-squad workout for
early Thursday afternoon; apparently, Torre understands the mindset
of his boss, George Steinbrenner, how he dwells on preparation and
how he might feel about losing the first game after the All-Star
Game break to an expansion team. Torre also wanted to give his
players a chance to reacquaint themselves with the game, following
three days of rest and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   The three days off changed nothing. Chuck Knoblauch led off the
game and fought Bryan Rekar, the Devil Rays' starter, until
grounding out on the seventh pitch of the at-bat. The Yankees
eventually loaded the bases, forcing Rekar to throw 27 pitches
before Darryl Strawberry flied out to end the scoreless inning.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, however, the Yankees scored the inning after forcing
the opposing starter to throw an unusually high number of pitches.
With one out in the second, Rekar threw a fastball into the back of
Scott Brosius. Girardi worked the count to two balls and one
strike, a natural hit-and-run situation for Girardi, a contact
hitter, and Brosius did indeed break from first base.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than hit the ball through the first-base hole,
Girardi smashed a line drive into the Tampa Bay bullpen in right
field for his third home run of the season _ as many home runs as
Girardi hit in his first two years with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, now 11-5, guarded the two-run lead with dogged
intensity, sometimes throwing his fastball _ clocked as high as 90
mph _ over the outside corner. Then, when the Tampa Bay hitters
leaned over the plate, Pettitte would ram his cut fastball, a ball
that moves inside to right-handed hitters, in on their hands and
they would swing weakly.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Pettitte threw a cutter with so much
movement that Randy Winn swung at it and missed _ before being hit
by the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   When Pettitte wasn't striking somebody out, his infielders were
making plays, turning potential hits into outs. Derek Jeter, the
shortstop, charged a two-bounce grounder in the third and threw
off-balance to get Quinton McCracken and end the inning. Brosius,
the third baseman, speared a line drive to open the fifth inning
and then fielded grounders from the next two hitters, assuming
responsibility for the entire inning himself.
</P>
<P>
   McCracken smacked a one-out single in the sixth and Bobby Smith
laced a grounder into the shortstop hole _ but Jeter grabbed the
ball, flipped it to second to Knoblauch, who avoided McCracken and
completed the double play. Only the Baltimore Orioles have allowed
fewer unearned runs than the Yankees among the 30 major-league
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay loaded the bases in the eighth with the aid of an
error by Brosius. But with two out, Torre stuck with Pettitte. When
Smith grounded to second, Knoblauch fielded the ball and threw
high, drawing Tino Martinez off the base, but Smith went out of the
baseline to avoid Martinez's tag attempt and was called out, ending
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera took over in the ninth, walked the first two batters,
then pitched out of the jam by getting Wade Boggs to ground to
third for the final out with runners on second and third. It was
Rivera's 23 save of this marvelous Yankee season. &QL;

   But even in normal balmy summers, Wichita Falls is hot.
Legendary hot. Like the name on the popular bike race, it is Hotter
n' Hell.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, I headed for ground zero. The Cowboys' soon-to-be
main practice field. The 50-yard line. The epicenter of Hell
itself.
</P>
<P>
   I carefully laid the thermometer on the grass and then stood
there, wondering why I hadn't packed a pith helmet, a camel and
several canteens. I looked at the thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   124!
</P>
<P>
   I turned around to see if, by some chance, a nuclear bomb had
quietly gone off behind me.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. I checked the thermometer again.
</P>
<P>
   Still 124.
</P>
<P>
   My legs started quivering and I thought of Hollandsworth's fish.
</P>
<P>
   The heat notwithstanding, it is easy to see why owner Jerry
Jones thought Midwestern State University would make a fit host for
his famous football team. The campus is a jewel in the sun _ 170
acres of tree-lined sidewalks and trim, brown-bricked buildings
with Spanish-tiled roofs. A ``handsome'' campus, the Chamber of
Commerce would call it.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the Cowboys are trading up. About a full century
up, compared to the grim Gothic ambiance of their former home, St.
Edward's in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the Cowboys mined the conveniences of preparing
for the football season in the political and social capital of the
state. They didn't mind the heat, they said. But the team, in time,
outgrew its boundaries and its welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jones was ready for a change. And Midwestern State was
ready to carve its place on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Robertson, a mass communications senior, was helping
prepare stock for the soon-to-open Cowboys Pro Shop, a large tent
adjoining the practice fields where fans will be able to purchase
Cowboys T-shirts and sundry souvenirs. The prediction here is that
it will be a raging success _ i.e., the tent is air-conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people _ the older generation, I guess _ didn't like the
idea of the Cowboys coming to town,'' Robertson said. ``But in the
long run, it's going to create a lot more money for the local
economy. Not too many people outside of Texas have heard of Wichita
Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot outside of the Pro Shop tent, I checked the
thermometer again.
</P>
<P>
   122.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up,'' Hollandsworth wrote, ``I was told the
reason that there are two state mental hospitals there ... was
because so many people went crazy during the summer, when the heat
is as heavy as wool.''
</P>
<P>
   The neatest and oldest building on campus is the Hardin
Administration Building, erected when the ``new campus'' was opened
in 1937. The main hallway is lined with photographs of campus
scenes, from football games to the student center to,
conspicuously, two shots of the Hardin building taken after a
six-inch winter snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe I was so hot that I just dreamed it.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school's public information office, director Janus
Buss said, ``This is one of the biggest things to hit not just the
school, but the city. We're excited about the exposure. A lot of
people around the country couldn't tell you what or where
Midwestern State University is.''
</P>
<P>
   For five weeks, Buss knows, dispatches and wire service reports
will go out around the world with the city's name and Midwestern
State's prominently mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a PR dream come true,'' she confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope, of course, none of the Cowboys will succumb to the
Hadeslike heat. Let's hope none of the team's limo radiators will
boil over. Let's hope the players will avoid the kind of headlines
here that plagued them in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   On the front page of the ``Wichita Falls Times Record News'' the
other day, there was a big story about how bloodhounds really can
catch criminals and another story about a local outbreak of head
lice.
</P>
<P>
   I checked the temperature at the newspaper stand.
</P>
<P>
   123.
</P>
<P>
   There is a modern mall near the Midwestern State campus and
enough chain restaurants to salve all but the most discriminating
tastes. For any players who might be reading this, the classiest
strip club in town, Maximus, is way out on Seymour Highway.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys, another chapter is about to begin. The Barry
Switzer era is over. The Hotter n' Hell chapter is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Bring plenty of water. Wear loose clothing. And whatever you do,
don't bring a thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   The heat is like wool. And here come America's Sheep.

SUNS RAISE SAFETY CONCERNS OVER AMERICA WEST CHARTER PLANE
</HEADLINE>
 PLANE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 yMARY JO PITZL AND BOB YOUNG 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns want to fly on a different plane because of
reports that the Federal Aviation Adminis tration is concerned
about airplane maintenance at America West Air lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline replied Thursday that the 29-year-old plane is
per fectly safe and is flying on regular commercial routes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Federal Aviation Administra tion last month put the airline
on ``Troubled Air Carrier Status,'' cit ing safety concerns raised
by the airline's flight attendants and me chanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have expressed our own concerns to America West regarding
the age and condition of the air craft,'' Bryan Colangelo, the
Suns's executive vice president and general manager, said in a
statement. ``They have repeatedly assured us that all maintenance
and safety issues are sufficiently monitored and addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, recent news has heightened our sense of urgency to
change planes for the remaining term of our charter agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined further comment Thursday, except to say the team has
ongoing discussions with the airline about its charter agreement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Built in 1969, the Boeing 737-112 that the Suns lease is one of
the oldest in America West's fleet. Suns officials have been
negotiating with airline officials for months, trying to upgrade
equip ment on the aging plane.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials would not comment directly on the Suns'
statement but said the plane poses no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to get across is the aircraft is in great shape,''
said airline spokeswoman Patti Nowack.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed as ``allegations, speculation and rumors'' reports
that the Suns' plane is the subject of FAA scrutiny because airline
offi cials failed to comply with a mandatory maintenance check and
instead continued to fly the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been notified by the FAA that there are any
problems with that aircraft,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was returned to service June 28 after undergoing an
annual maintenance check. It is modified annually for the
basketball team, with more first-class seats installed to
accommodate the players.
</P>
<P>
   During the off season, the plane is fitted with cabin-class
seats and is used to fly commercial routes. Nowak said she did not
know to which cities the plane is flying now. It looks like a
regular America West airplane but with a Phoenix Suns logo next to
the passenger door.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, some Suns players balked at flying on the plane
after its pilot walked off as he was getting ready to take the team
to Houston. The pilot was concerned about how the aircraft would
oper ate because its yaw damper, which helps stabilize the plane in
flight, was inoperable and the weather forecast called for choppy
weather between Phoenix and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After conferring with a senior pilot who was more familiar with
the plane, the pilot returned and flew to Houston without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the March 30 inci dent, combined with the age of
the plane, fanned some players' fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my Lord,'' Suns center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, a nerv
ous flyer anyway, said at the time. ``Any time the pilot jumps off,
that makes you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the team needs a new plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like a car,'' he said last spring. ``You can't just
pull over to the side if something goes wrong. They said that part
isn't important. If it's not important, why'd they put it on the
plane?''
</P>
<P>
   A plane is ``completely flyable'' without its yaw damper, and
the part is not on the FAA's ``minimum equipment list,'' which
stipulates which parts must be in good working order before a plane
can leave the ground, said Russ Young, a safety officer with
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   But repeated problems with the 737's yaw damper have made it the
subject of an FAA airworthiness directive. By mid-2000, the part
must be replaced in all 737s. Replacement parts should be avail
able this fall, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if a yaw damper breaks, the plane's owner
should fix it promptly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened, Nowack said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, she declined to provide copies of the maintenance
records and could not specify when the repair was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's operational now,'' she said. ``It was fixed when we knew
there was a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of the part being reported as causing
``diffi culty,'' according to 12 years' worth of records filed with
the FAA. The records are current through mid-April, the latest date
for which information could be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Nowack said she didn't know why the yaw damper never appeared on
the service-difficulty reports, but she said she assumed it was
because it never caused a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, however, Colangelo characterized the yaw damper as
an ``ongoing problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing has said that the part has been a persistent problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although the yaw damper was never mentioned, incidents ranging
from the mundane to the alarming are detailed in the
service-difficulty reports.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs cropped up during routine inspections as well as
during flights, such as a September 1997 incident in which the
plane had to make an unscheduled landing be cause cabin pressure
was not being maintained. A check found that seals on the aircraft
door were not tight. The seals were replaced, and the plane
returned to service, re cords show.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's service-difficulty his tory revealed nothing out of
the ordinary, said Bill Waldock, associ ate director of the Center
for Aerospace Safety Education at Em bry Riddle Aeronautical
University in Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   Waldock reviewed records dating back to 1991 at &UR; The
Republic's &UR; request.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the repairs might appear frightening to a
layman. But, he noted, problems were fixed as soon as they were
detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it, the airplane itself was never in danger,''
Wal dock said.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane's condition is a touchy subject. The Suns and the
airline have a long and mutually beneficial relationship, including
naming rights of America West Arena, where the team plays.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is scheduled to be retired at the end of next year
because it won't meet new noise-abatement guidelines that take
effect in 2000. Modifying the plane to make it run more quietly
would not be cost-efficient, airline officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a newer-model craft could increase charter costs by four
or five times, according to airline officials, and the Suns' plane
actu ally is newer than many planes used to charter professional
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Suns players contin ued to fly on the plane, even
those with doubts about its reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been assured that noth ing can go wrong, that there is
no more chance, no more possibility that something could go wrong
(than on any other plane),'' said forward Danny Manning. ``We've
heard that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, when the pilot gets on the plane, then gets off saying
he doesn't want to fly the plane because it's inadequate, or he
doesn't feel comfortable doing it, that puts thoughts in your head.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as guard Jason Kidd, said they weren't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jerry (Colangelo, the club's president) and Bryan
(Colangelo) were nervous about it, then I would be,'' Kidd said.
``But they've as sured us it's safe. We fly for a living. With a
perfect airplane there's always something that could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a few complaints, but I'm not that worried about
it. When we win a championship, maybe that (a new plane) will be
our reward.'' &QL;

LAW OF GRAVITY BOUND TO CATCH UP WITH INTERNET STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
What will be the pin that pops the Internet bubble?
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hate to break it to you, but some event or series of events
ultimately will let the air out of these insanely valued Web
stocks. Gravity will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Most reasoned investors and even those stock-pickers who trade
like they're free-basing St. John's Wort will tell you that Yahoo
doesn't deserve its current market capitalization of about $8.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's bigger than the $7.6 billion-dollar market capitalization
of the New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   For heaven's sake, despite a second-quarter loss reported on
Wednesday that included one-time charges associated with the
company's acquisition of Viaweb, a maker of e-commerce software,
Yahoo's stock still rocketed as high as 9 percent to $202 in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, while most analysts pounded the table
yesterday for their firms' clients to buy Yahoo, the stock closed
down $2.19 at $184. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   It's wacky. Even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan couldn't have
envisioned such madness when he made his infamous ``irrational
exuberance'' assessment of the market in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. By most enlightened accounts, Yahoo is a
fine company led by smart managers who have built a well-oiled
brand-building machine. It is the No. 1 Internet search engine and
deserves a stellar stock price.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you intelligently justify an $82 price surge in five
weeks?
</P>
<P>
   Short answer: You can't. Which brings us to this point: What
factors might bring Internet stocks in general, and Yahoo in
particular, back to Earth?
</P>
<P>
   One possible scenario is that weaker Internet stocks eventually
may start to suffer from their laggard positions and begin to miss
their quarterly earnings targets.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, some of the economic models used by analysts to
value Internet stocks may be called into question.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, could cause investors to re-evaluate their
positions in such search engine stocks that are performing like
Yahoo, says fund manager Kevin Landis of Firsthand Funds in San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``Like all stocks that miss their numbers, the laggards'
stock prices should head south,'' Landis says. ``That, I think,
will be the wake-up call'' for investors to start selling even
their top-performing Internet holdings, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the consensus earnings estimate of Wall Street analysts
hasn't been terribly difficult for Yahoo, maintains Landis, who
doesn't own any Yahoo shares in either his technology value fund or
technology leaders fund.
</P>
<P>
   Landis, for one, thinks that Internet stock analysts have been
easy on the companies by setting relatively low earnings targets.
(Yahoo beat second-quarter earnings estimates of nine cents a share
_ charges excluded _ by six cents.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That could change. ``Pretty soon, you're going to see some
analysts break from the ranks and become more bullish, raising
their expectations (of quarterly profits),'' Landis says.
</P>
<P>
   Another pin that could pop the bubble could be a general
downturn in the overall stock market, says analyst Dave Jones of
the California Technology Stock Letter in Half Moon Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A geopolitical event such as a war or energy crisis likely would
awaken investors to the fragility of Internet valuations, Jones
says.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Internet stocks has been difficult to watch for
Jones. In April, the Overpriced Stock Service, the California
Technology Stock Letter's sister publication, recommended that
investors short Yahoo at $114 a share. And although the stock has
defied such wisdom, Jones sticks by his publication's basic
assessment. ``The facts are that (Yahoo's valuation) isn't real,''
Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the stock analyst believes that a lot of money is
parked in Internet companies because there are few other hot
sectors to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   One last hope to return sanity to Internet stock prices is that
content really will be king. While, for now, portals and the
delivery of eyeballs on the Internet are winning investors' favor,
the companies that will bring entertainment programming and
financial services to the Internet will be the stocks that fetch
high valuations, says the chief executive of a Bay Area Internet
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once investors start to figure out that content companies will
drive relationships with the portals,'' their money will begin to
shift to stocks other than search engine companies, the CEO says.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist analyst Paul Noglows weighed in
yesterday as a voice of reason on Yahoo. He went against the grain
of his analyst counterparts by lowering his rating on the Santa
Clara company to ``hold'' based solely on valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stock is trading around 37 times 1999 revenue
estimates of $265 million, `` I just didn't feel comfortable
telling investors to buy the stock at ($184) a share,'' Noglows
says.
</P>
<P>
   Reason. What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON RAIDERS
</P>
<P>
   The move by big-hitting investment banker Frank Quattrone from
Deutsche Bank Securities to Credit Suisse First Boston is proving
to be a transition of major proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the technology banker and his top lieutenants
joined CS First Boston, more than 100 Deutsche Bank bankers,
analysts and support people are following them to new jobs at CS
First Boston offices in Menlo Park, San Francisco, London and
Boston, according to a Bay Area executive recruiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the largest shifts of talent that I've ever
seen,'' the recruiter says.

HOFFMANS MAKE SIBLING HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, there were rare instances when major-league
managers had brothers on their rosters. But on Thursday, Dodgers
manager Glenn Hoffman and his brother, San Diego reliever Trevor
Hoffman, are believed to have made major-league history when the
manager and player were in opposing dugouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, Fred Clarke managed his brother Josh at Louisville of
the National League. From 1894-95, Cleveland's Patsy Tabeau managed
his brother George. And in 1884, Ed Hengel managed his brother
Moxie during the lone season of existence for the Chicago franchise
of the Union Association.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the 1997 edition of ``Total Baseball _ The
Official Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball,'' the Hoffman
battle is one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know fathers and sons have played against each other. But
brothers?'' said the 40-year-old Glenn. ``There is always a first
for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a neat business to be able to see your brother on the
other side,'' said Trevor, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw unnerved: While with the Cincinnati Reds, Jeff Shaw was
pitching for a club written off for the playoffs. The new Dodgers
closer, who has 23 saves, inherits the pressure of finishing games
for a team fighting to make a major turnaround toward the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the same situation anywhere else,'' said
Shaw, who was not used Thursday after being traded Saturday for
infielder/outfielder Paul Konerko and pitcher Dennis Reyes. ``The
Dodgers being in a large market is the same as Cincinnati in a
small market or in Pittsburgh. It's a one-, two- or three-run lead
and you go out there and get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino out longer: Dodgers shortstop Jose Vizcaino expects to
be out 3-4 more weeks to recover from his right-ankle sprain.
Vizcaino, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 22,
has missed 14 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino had his cast removed Monday and began working out on a
treadmill Wednesday. Juan Castro, who went 2 for 4 at shortstop
Thursday, Wilton Guerrero and Alex Cora are expected to platoon at
the position.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks Mike: During the All-Star Game, former Dodger Mike Piazza
and Dodgers right fielder Gary Sheffield discussed hitting. The two
were involved in a blockbuster seven-player deal May 15 that sent
now New York Met Piazza to Florida and Sheffield to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said Piazza suggested they both need to stay on their
back leg longer, which would help their hands come through the
hitting zone quicker. After working on it during batting practice,
Sheffield hit a two-run, first-inning homer off San Diego's Mark
Langston in his first at-bat Thursday. His homer also extended his
streak of reaching base to 21 straight games dating to June 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about our power and what we've been doing
wrong,'' said Sheffield. ``He had some great advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Right-hander Ramon Martinez began shoulder exercises
Wednesday. Martinez, who had season-ending shoulder surgery June
30, said he will begin weightlifting in August and might return to
his native Dominican Republic for the remainder of the season....
Right-hander Darren Hall, who pitched two innings for Class-A San
Bernardino on Tuesday, said he is ready to return, and the Dodgers
will likely make a decision on him soon. The reliever has been on
the DL since April 8 with a rotator-cuff injury.

WORLD CUP GETS BEST POSSIBLE FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There are other teams that might have made for a
storybook World Cup final: Holland, possibly the most brilliant
side in France the past month; or Croatia, overlooked and
underestimated; or even faltering Nigeria or the dangerous Danes or
maybe even Italy, which makes defense, at least in my eyes, a
beautiful thing.
</P>
<P>
   But it's impossible to ignore the truth, which is that the first
62 games of the 1998 World Cup have led to the perfect championship
game, a fight between the reigning champion, seeking an
unprecedented fifth crown, and the proud host, thrilled to be
taking part in the final for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That Brazil and France, which will face off Sunday night at the
Stade de France in Saint-Denis, may also be the two finest teams
--- sorry, Holland --- in the tournament makes it all the better.
But that neither of them are all that great says more about the
current state of world soccer than anything else might.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians have stumbled through this tournament, constantly
seeking to find form, a search that has led to moments of brilliant
offensive soccer and little else.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ronaldo is a god; he hasn't been at his best during this
Cup, slowed by a knee injury, and yet there is no other striker
here even remotely near his level. Yes, he's got some superb
support, especially from the brilliant Rivaldo and from Dunga, the
rock at the back of the Carioca midfield.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense, despite Cafu and Junior Baiano and Roberto
Carlos, has been porous, so much so that with a little more luck,
Denmark might be here instead of the Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   Poor defense is part of the price Brazil pays to play beautiful,
flowing soccer, (ital) jogo bonito (end ital), to make art from
sport. If only it were so. Rarely this Cup have the Brazilians been
artists, or poets; when given the perfect opportunity to
demonstrate how stunning this game can be, in the semifinal against
the Netherlands, they sat back on defense and went at the superior
Dutch with a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Put this Brazilian side up against the wonderful team that won
the title in 1970, and it would be sad. Maybe 3-0, maybe 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, put this one up against the team that outlasted Italy in
the '94 final at the Rose Bowl. I'll take the '94 bunch, which ---
thanks to Carlos Alberto Parreira's defensive tactics --- was far
more organized than this group.
</P>
<P>
   That said, we can expect the (ital) penta (end ital) from
Brazil. It is too strong for France, especially a France that must
play without suspended Laurent Blanc, the backbone of the finest
defense on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Defense is the core of the French game, which is workmanlike
and, in the hands of playmaker Zinedine Zidane, capable of some
remarkable things. But take away Zidane, and take away defensive
midfielder Didier Deschamps, and take away three-quarters of that
back line --- Blanc and stopper Marcel Desailly and right back
Lilian Thuram, the hero of the semifinal triumph over Croatia ---
and what you've got is a quite ordinary team.
</P>
<P>
   No forward has scored in three games, and the way starters Youri
Djorkaeff and Stephane Guivarc'h thrash around out there, it's
amazing that France ever produces up front. Defenders --- Blanc and
Thuram --- are responsible for all the goals since the first round,
when 20-year-old Thierry Henry, somehow relegated to a reserve
role, found the net three times.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's defense can be scored upon, but can France do it? We'll
see.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of truly strong teams in France is a product of
soccer's globalization. The sport has become, largely, faceless:
Everybody does the same things, everybody knows each other (they
all play, all the world's stars, in the same leagues, in Italy and
Spain and England and France). That's why when someone like a
Ronaldo or a Zidane comes along, he is so celebrated. There are few
Ronaldos and Zidanes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is a creed, ``professionalism,'' which dictates
that results matter over content, over style. When you are touched,
you go down and hope the referee awards you a penalty kick. When
someone goes by you, you grab his jersey or kick his ankles,
anything to stop him. It's the way the game is played, and
everybody knows this.
</P>
<P>
   The losers are the fans, who are denied --- except in a few
instances, when the Dutch play or when Ronaldo or Zidane or one of
Laudrups weaves their magic --- what they most want: spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this has led to an amazing amount of parity, so we
get few blowouts anymore. The games are tighter, and that's good;
if only they were more spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, the best teams --- Brazil and France and Holland
--- survive, and so we get the promise of a ``great'' final, a
matchup between two of the ``finest teams in the game.
</P>
<P>
   If only that were enough.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ending the criminal case stemming from the city's
worst racial clashes in years, a man convicted of inciting the
crowd before the killing of a Hasidic scholar in Crown Heights was
sentenced Thursday to 21 years in prison, a term even longer than
that dealt to the killer.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Charles Price, was convicted of violating the civil
rights of the victim, Yankel Rosenbaum, by egging on a crowd during
the first of four nights of violence that tore apart the Brooklyn
neighborhood in August 1991. Although Price was not directly linked
to the stabbing of Rosenbaum, prosecutors said a member of the mob,
Lemrick Nelson Jr., carried out the stabbing afterward. Nelson was
sentenced to 19 and a half years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In imposing a sentence on Price on Thursday, Judge David Trager
of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn said he did not render the
maximum sentence, 24 years, because he did not believe that Price
intended for the mob to kill Rosenbaum. However, Trager said he did
not impose the minimum sentence, slightly more than 19 years, in
part because Price had not expressed any remorse for ``the evil
that his rhetoric set in motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Price is the last of two men charged in the Rosenbaum killing.
Prosecutors said that he received a longer sentence than Nelson in
part because Price had a previous criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing ended the criminal phase of one of the most
bitter racial conflicts in the city's recent history. The Crown
Heights violence, which exposed the rifts between the black and
Jewish residents of the neighborhood, had repercussions citywide,
and was seen as a key element in the electoral defeat of Mayor
David Dinkins by Rudolph Giuliani in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this sentence we close the last chapter of a terrible
incident in New York City history,'' Valerie Caproni, the assistant
U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case, told the court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caproni asked the judge to impose the maximum sentence on
Price, arguing that ``bias crimes strike at the very essence of
what we are as Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, the length of the sentence depended on Trager's
interpretation of the legal significance of Price's actions. If the
judge had found that Price's conduct constituted manslaughter or a
lesser offense, he would have imposed a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   However, in court Thursday, Trager said that Price's conduct in
inciting the crowd was so reckless and depraved that it met the
legal standards of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``By setting off what he did he bears the moral
responsibility,'' Trager said. He later added that ``even though he
did not intend to kill Rosenbaum, the bottom line is he is morally
and legally responsible for the events he set off.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Crown Heights erupted after a 7-year-old black
boy, Gavin Cato, was fatally injured in a traffic accident
involving a car driven by a Hasidic Jew. During the trial of Price,
a prosecutor, Alan Vinograd, said that he fired up with mob with
expressions like ``Kill the Jews!'' ``An eye for an eye!'' and
``Let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   Price and his lawyers have continued to maintain his innocence,
and have announced their intention to appeal the verdict. Thursday,
Price demonstrated a powerful speaking voice as he told Trager that
the jury had reached the wrong verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry for his death,'' Price said. ``I had nothing to do
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Price denied that he had ever demonstrated
any racial prejudice and said he had not received justice from the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me I got a fair trial and I don't see it,'' Price
said. ``I can't do anything because I am a small person.''
</P>
<P>
   During her statement to the court, Fay Rosenbaum, Yankel's
mother, assailed Price's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no apology from Charles Price, no remorse,''
she said. ``While his family and friends will always be able to
visit him and be with him irrespective of the sentence passed, my
husband and I, Yankel's family and friends are left only to visit a
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenbaum said her son was the ultimate innocent victim, a
man who harbored hatred for no one and who was killed by a
hate-filled mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankel accepted people for who they were, not what they were
or what they had _ irrespective of race, creed or color,'' she
said, her voice breaking. ``His respect of all people was
demonstrated by his absolute abhorrence of discrimination of any
kind, his unqualified defense of the oppressed and his inflexible
principles of fairness, equality, truth and justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the real Yankel Rosenbaum that Charles Price would
have found had he bothered to seek, had he not vented his putrid,
violent hate, calling for his cold-blooded murder and insuring that
it was carried out with no regard or respect for Yankel, the
person, but with a blind, baseless bigotry aimed at what Yankel was
_ a Jew.''

GEORGE LLOYD, 85, BRITISH SYMPHONIC COMPOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Lloyd, an English symphonist and opera composer who
rejected the major stylistic currents of the 20th century in favor
of the language, coloration and sheer lushness of late Romanticism,
died July 3 at University College Hospital in London. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were divided about Lloyd's music; some found it
refreshingly communicative, others considered it old-fashioned.
Even his detractors, however, recognized his compositional voice as
authentic and original, not merely a 19th-century pastiche.
Although his language is unabashedly tonal, there is a freshness in
the melodic writing in the 12 symphonies he composed between 1932
and 1990, and there are engaging complexities in his solo piano
works.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the late 1970s, when English musicians began
reviving his long-neglected scores, Lloyd built a strong popular
audience. In the United States, the Albany (N.Y.) Symphony
Orchestra offered him a guest conducting position in the late
1980s, and with that orchestra he recorded his Symphony No. 1 and
Symphony No. 12 in 1990. He also maintained an association with
Albany Records, an enterprising American label that recorded
several disks of his music, both in the United States and in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The success Lloyd enjoyed during the last 20 years belatedly
mirrored that of his early career. Lloyd was born in 1913 in the
English town of St. Ives in Cornwall, and though bouts of rheumatic
fever kept him out of school until he was 11, he studied the violin
privately with Albert Sammons and composition with Harry Farjeon.
He later attended Trinity College. He completed his Symphony No. 1
when he was 19 and sent it to Sir Dan Godfrey, the director of the
Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, who agreed to program the work with
the composer conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Two more symphonies followed in close succession, but by the
time he completed the third, in 1935, Lloyd had also written his
first opera, ``Iernin,'' which had a performance at Penzance, in
Cornwall. When a critic for The Times of London, vacationing
nearby, reviewed a performance, the work was brought to London for
a run at the Lyceum. A second opera, ``The Serf,'' which like
``Iernin'' was based on a Cornish legend and had a libretto by the
composer's father, was produced at Covent Garden in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Having had three symphonies and two operas performed by age 25,
Lloyd was regarded as a promising composer when World War II
intervened. He was a gunner on Arctic convoys and a member of the
Royal Marine Band when his ship was blown up in 1942. He was
rescued, but was severely traumatized and his childhood health
problems reoccured. After the war, he spent several years
convalescing in Switzerland, his wife's homeland, where he wrote
his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies. Lloyd is survived by his wife of
61 years, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, he was commissioned to write a third opera for the
Festival of Britain. The work, ``John Socman,'' was about a soldier
returning from the battle of Agincourt. When reviews of the
premiere were mixed, and reviews of tour performances that year
were little more enthusiastic, Lloyd withdrew from the musical
world and settled in Dorset, where he grew carnations and
mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1950s and '60s he continued to compose, however,
between 4:30 and 7:30 a.m. daily and produced three more symphonies
and the first of his four piano concertos. The pianist John Ogden
performed the concerto in 1969 and later championed other works by
Lloyd. That same year the BBC Symphony Orchestra accepted his
Eighth Symphony for performance, but did not program it until 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd began to devote himself fully to composition again in
1973. Among his late works are four symphonies, a violin sonata and
several large choral works including ``The Vigil of Venus'' (1980),
an 80-minute work in Latin for soprano, tenor, chorus and
orchestra, and a requiem, which he completed shortly before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   A story told about Lloyd in the late 1980s suggests the extent
of the popularity that his works had achieved. When Tower Records
opened its outlet in London, Lloyd wandered into its classical
department and heard one of his works on the sound system.
Surprised, he walked to the counter and asked a salesman, who was
dressed in punk fashion with orange spiked hair and a nose ring,
what was playing.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman replied, ``Why sir, it's your Fifth Symphony.''

 &HT;    Streak hits 9 behind 3 HRs
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In nine innings Thursday, the Braves reconfirmed much of
what had been learned over the season's first half. No park can
hold them, and their bullpen still can make a henchman's blood run
cold.
</P>
<P>
   In their first visit to Pro Player Stadium since last October's
NLCS debacle, the Braves extended their win streak to nine games _
the longest in two years _ with a 6-4 win over Florida, the game
determined on a Chipper Jones two-run homer in the first and Javy
Lopez's upper-deck job with two men on in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Not as convincing was the relief work of Dennis Martinez, who
was handed a four-run lead in the eighth and promply gave up a pair
of runs after a Todd Zeile double and Derreck Lee's triple. With
the lead down to two, John Rocker and Russ Springer worked out of
the mess with a pair of line-drive outs, before Kerry Ligtenberg
recorded his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get a scoreless 1-2-3,'' said Rocker. ``That
would have been a shame to lose that one, after being up 6-0. But
that's a good way to start the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz took a shutout into the sixth inning to improve his
record to 6-2. The night marked the seventh time in Smoltz's 12
starts this season he has held opponents to two runs or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chipper set the stage with the bomb in the first and Smoltz
was on the top of his game,'' said manager Bobby Cox. ``Awesome
performance. We're just trying to be careful with John. He threw 95
(mph), 96 all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as hard as I've thrown this year,'' Smoltz said.
``Coming off seven days off, I didn't know how I'd come off but my
back cleared up real good.''
</P>
<P>
   With Andruw Jones scratched from the lineup when his (and
Randall Simon's) morning flight to Miami from Curacao was canceled,
the Braves played three men short, with Ryan Klesko still
recovering from an appendectomy. But Lopez filled the power vacuum
with a three-run shot into the upper deck as the Braves had their
fourth multi-homer game in the last seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big relief, coming out of a slump,'' said Lopez, who
neglected to recall he is hitting .362 in his last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Slump? ``Well, I was trying to get to the All-Star Game with 20
home runs,'' the catcher confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was better for 20. He merely won a game.

COWBOYS ADD TWO, TALK TO ELLIS' AGENT
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys got two more rookies to agree to
terms yesterday and began negotiations with the agent of top pick
Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Former Alabama-Birmingham safety Izell Reese, a sixth-round
pick, and former Cincinnati tight end Rod Monroe, a seventh-round
pick, became the fourth and fifth of the Cowboys' nine draft picks
to come to terms. Both players agreed to three-year deals, Cowboys
vice president Stephen Jones said. On Wednesday, Michael Myers,
fourth-round pick from Alabama, and seventh-round picks Antonio
Fleming, from Georgia, and Tarik Smith, from California, agreed to
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys talked to the agents of the remaining unsigned
picks, including Ellis' agent Butch Williams yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams nor Jones, who is handling the Ellis negotiations, was
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have said they will try to get things done before
training camp opens Wednesday. Williams proved his commitment to
that pledge by flying to Dallas yesterday for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the parameters for Ellis' contract have been set. As the
eighth overall pick, he will likely get a little better deal than
the one signed by ninth pick Fred Taylor, who got $10.7 million
over six years with a $5 million signing bonus from the
Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's eighth pick James Farrior received $8,846,000 over
five years with a $4 million bonus from the Jets.

PADRES' GWYNN CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES Tony Gwynn walked down the tunnel from the Padres'
clubhouse to the visitor's dugout, gazed at the empty Dodger
Stadium, and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``How,'' said Gwynn to the walls of the stadium, ``could they
fire Mark Cresse?''
</P>
<P>
   That is just one of the dozen or so questions people have about
the Franchise Formerly Known As The Dodgers. The routine now for
everyone, from the players to the fans, is to come to the ballpark,
buy a scorecard and see if you recognize the names.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' Hall of Famer-to-be grew up in Long Beach as a fan
of the Dodgers, back to the years when the franchise was
transitioning from the Drysdale, Wills and Willie Davis era to
Lopes, Garvey and Cey.
</P>
<P>
   So watching the Dodgers chip away at this foundation of
consistency with Marlin-like abandon left him as dumbfounded as the
next guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all so ... so ... different,'' said Gwynn before
Thursday's game, a 12-2 Dodger win. ``Something like this has never
happened before. That's why there's so much ... Heck, it's so
unusual I don't even know what to call it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers have not only been stable around here (meaning Los
Angeles), but around baseball. They've been as stable a franchise
as you could have. So to make the moves they've made in just one
year has caught a lot of people off guard. Things just weren't done
the usual Dodger way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, like 1997, Gwynn would make his first visit to
Dodger Stadium and spend a few hours touching base with guys he's
known as Dodger landmarks, guys like Cresse, the former bullpen
coach and fellow Long Beacher who was launched at the same time as
Glenn Gregson and Reggie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he spent a few minutes talking to Bobby Bonilla and
finding out how he likes being in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers always were consistent about their personnel. The
manager, the general manager, the players,'' Gwynn said, ``these
are guys who were here 10, 20, 30 years. So turning it around like
they've done is incredibly surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was told that four different hands made the four major
decisions of 1998. The owners (Fox) traded Mike Piazza, Fred Claire
traded Hideo Nomo, Bob Graziano fired Fred Cclaire and Bill
Russell, and Tommy Lasorda made the Jeff Shaw-Paul Konerko deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's response: Welcome to baseball, '90s style.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way things are done now. Corporate people own teams
and make swift and emotionless corporate-style dexisions. Tradition
may be hallowed by some, but it can be an obstacle to the
ever-hungry bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around baseball, just about everyone is talking about what Fox
has done to the Dodgers,'' he said. ``They're not talking about the
Dodgers as much as pointing a finger at Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has gone through two separate fire sales during his 17
seasons in the Padres organization, in 1987 and 1993, watching the
Padres dispense or lose personnel like the Alomar brothers, Derek
Bell, Joe Carter, Fred McGriff and Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no time for him to worry about what the Dodgers are
doing. Whatever childhood attachment he had about the team departed
the first time he stepped into the batter's box against them.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the Padres of 1998 bear a resemblence in
several areas to the Dodgers of old. There is the presence of two
Dodgers on the coaching staff, Dave Stewart and Davey Lopes, and
catcher Carlos Hernandez is a former Dodger. But it goes beyond the
literal.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, a club-record 25 games over .500 and leading the
N.L. West by five games, have built their team around a solid corp
of pitchers -- Andy Ashby, Trevor Hoffman, Kevin Brown and Joey
Hamilton. It has stuck by a solid veterans, one homegrown, Gwynn,
and two acquired four years ago in a major trade, Ken Caminiti and
Steve Finley.
</P>
<P>
   When it decided to make a offseason move, it was for a
high-quality talent like Brown, who gives the Padres the kind of
pitching depth to compete with the Atlanta Braves in the
postseason, much less the N.L. West. The Padres have lowered their
team ERA from last year's 4.99 to 3.62.
</P>
<P>
   The roster has also been supplemented by products from the farm
system, guys like outfielder Ruben Rivera and pitcher Matt Clement,
who are slowly being given room to grow into their uniforms and
have been labeled as untouchables -- the way Paul Konerko once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moves we made were the right moves,'' said Gwynn, who
considers this Padres team to be the best one ever. ``The guys we
have counted on have delivered. Greg Vaughn (30 homers, 74 RBI) has
come through like a champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had all of the ingredients you need to have in a good
year. But our offense can be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti started the season slowly, hitting .240 into late June
before a nine-game, .531 sprint to end the first-half. Gwynn, who
has hit .353 or better the last seasons, will tell you that he's
having a horrible season at .329 and 45 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good enough to get us a five-game lead, but we can
do better,'' said Gwynn. ``We'll have to if we want to keep things
going. We have to remind ourselves that we haven't accomplished
anything yet. We've played well, but we still have half a season to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Dodgers. But Dodger fans may not be watching the
standings as much as the transaction wire. The Padres are here
through Sunday, then don't return until September. By then, the
walls may be the only thing Tony Gwynn recognizes.

WINDHAM PASSING TEST AS GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When there were no opportunities for women basketball players in
the United States, like the playmaker she was at USC, Rhonda
Windham created one.
</P>
<P>
   Founder of the Say No Classic that has provided summer league
basketball for college players since 1991, and many other
tournaments for former players, Windham would not rest until the
job was done. She is the consummate businesswoman with a special
interest in women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Today her job as the general manager of the Los Angeles Sparks
is just as demanding. It's grueling, has many challenges, but it's
everything Windham wanted and more when she sought the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job,'' Windham said while watching the Sparks work
out at the Forum. ``It's a lot of work, a lot of hours, but this is
what I've wanted to do. I've been working toward being a boss in
women's basketball on a full-time basis for a long time. All I'm
trying to do is do the best job I can possibly do and share with
our team and our staff the insight I may have to this game.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would be plenty.
</P>
<P>
   The rebirth of the new women's pro leagues today probably can be
traced back to the mid-80s at USC, where Cheryl Miller, Pamela and
Paula McGee, Cynthia Cooper and Windham transformed and popularized
the game on the collegiate level, drawing national attention and
paving the way for young girls to follow in their footsteps. Except
for Paula McGee, who is a minister and manager for her twin sister,
Pamela, all are making their mark in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   Windham, a New York native who grew up in the Bronx, left her
mark at USC where she is still the career record-holder in assists
(735). She made her most assists (197) as a freshman in 1983,
dishing off to Miller and the McGeees en route to the Trojans'
first NCAA championship. She redshirted in 1984, another banner
season for USC, after undergoing knee surgery, but returned just as
strong, and as a senior won the 1987 Naismith Award for the
nation's top players under 5-foot-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always providing leadership in getting our team
together and knowing how to keep egos in check and making sure
everybody got the ball on our national championship team,'' Pamela
McGee said. ``I guess she somewhat has the same responsibilty now
as general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BALANCING ACT
</P>
<P>
   For Sparks president Johnny Buss, Windham brought the perfect
balance to the position. Besides the management skills she honed
with the summer league program, she spent seven years as assistant
public-relations director with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how I am and what I need to balance myself,'' Buss
said. ``There were certainly general managers that I talked to ...
but to balance me, I needed someone who had a strong interest in
women's basketball, and a person who would put their heart and soul
into it. I needed someone who was business-minded, that would be
strict and tend to the business at hand. I tend to be a free
spirit. I needed Rhonda to balance me out.''
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most crucial decision Windham has made was firing
her former USC coach, Linda Sharp, after the team produced a 4-7
mark midway through the inaugural season last year.
</P>
<P>
   Windham demands ``effort and passion'' from the players as well
as from the staff, but when she saw that missing and didn't see any
signs of improvement, she fired Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to take my personal feelings put of it,'' said Windham,
who spoke briefly to Sharp at the women's NCAA Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Windham moved another old friend, Julie Rousseau, from assistant
to interim head coach after relieving Sharp. Rousseau salvaged the
season, turning it into a near playoff contender. Windham removed
the interim label and made Rousseau a permanent fixture.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship aside, Rousseau understands the nature of her role as
head coach and Windham's responsibilty as the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I even took this job and Rhonda told me last season
that I was going to be the interim head coach, she said this is not
about friendship, this is business and I know that,'' said
Rousseau, who used to coach in Windham's summer league. ``She put
me in this position because she believed in me. In that same
respect, I know that any decision she would make would be for
business-sake and professional-sake and I respect her enough for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   GROWING PAINS
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in the second year of the WNBA, the Sparks (3-8) are
in another uncomfortable position, struggling to find consistency
before another playoff passes.
</P>
<P>
   Windham is concerned, but she's not panicking. She sighted the
late arrivals of Lisa Leslie and Haixia Zheng, who played in the
World Championships and joined the team two days before tipoff, and
subsequent injuries to the Sparks' promising top draft pick,
Allison Feaster, and then Zheng, as contributing factors to the
sluggish start. She's not ready to push any buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a young coach and she has a bright future in this
league as a head coach,'' she said. ``I have a lot of confidence in
my staff and the players that we have on this team. It's important
not to panic. And if you believe in your personnel, sometimes when
you don't want to be patient you have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all in a day's work as a general manager.

LASORDA SWEARS HE DIDN'T BACK-STAB RUSSELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Incredibly, my old pal, Tom Lasorda, still is sizzling at me for
breaking omerta more than two weeks ago and brazenly quoting ousted
Dodger manager Bill Russell about what he thought of Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of Thursday afternoon's match between the
Dodgers and San Diego Padres, he angrily berated me in the Dodger
clubhouse in front of Eric Karros' locker, then took me in the
players' television lounge and continued his verbal assault behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you do that to me?'' shrieked Lasorda. ``I thought
you were my friend. Do you realize that you've caused me to have to
defend myself all over the country?
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you quote Bill Russell saying those things about me?
How could Bill Russell say those things about me? I love Bill
Russell. I would never do anything to hurt him. You've caused me a
lot of grief.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, Tommy, I'm very, very sorry.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to solemnly promise right now that the next time Bill
Russell accuses you of undermining him and Fred Claire, I won't
write it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Tom Lasorda bristled when I questioned him about
giving up that intriguing young hitting prospect, Paul Konerko,
plus left-handed pitcher Dennis Reyes for reliever Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you give up on Konerko?'' I wondered. ``What if he
turns out to be a great hitter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, well, what if he doesn't?'' bristled Lasorda. ``We
needed a stopper. And we got a damned good one in Shaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Lasorda just might have gotten rid of a future
star in Paul Konerko.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Konerko's going to be one of those guys who can hit 30
homers, hit .300 and drive in 100 runs,'' a well-known major league
scout told me in the Dodger Stadium pressbox.
</P>
<P>
   The scout pleaded anonymity because he wants to remain Tom
Lasorda's friend. ...
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, I heard Bob Graziano the other day say that Tom
Lasorda will help him locate a general manager. I'm sure he will.
Here's betting that ol' Tommy points to himself. ...
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Tom Lasorda cocked his fearsome left hand against me
in the pressbox, although he did so in a playful manner. But even
had he popped me, I wouldn't have retaliated. I don't fight
septuagenarians. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'll believe Tom Lasorda that these Gary Sheffield-Juan
Castro-Trenidad Hubbard Dodgers will make a strong second half
impact in the West Division if they can rough up the Padres' Kevin
Brown today as thoroughly as they did Mark Langston Thursday. ...
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the 7th inning and the Dodgers holding a 12-1
lead, Glenn Hoffman did his Red Auerbach-lighting-a-cigar victory
bit when he had Roger Cedeno pinch hit for Gary Sheffield. ..
</P>
<P>
   I know how FIFA can get rid of all the insufferable flopping
that goes on in its sport. Change its absurd, purely subjective red
card rule that has deprived France's fine defender, Laurent Blanc,
from participating in the World Cup final against Brazil. You can't
blame guys giving Oscar performances when such theatrics might
result in rivals being ejected and their teams suddenly having a
one-man advantage. ...
</P>
<P>
   The two best World Cup players this soccer dilettante has seen
is Brazil's Ronaldo and England's Michael Owen. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'll be surprised if Brazil, quicker, slicker and flashier,
doesn't beat France by at least two goals. . .

UNION ORGANIZATION DRIVE EXPOSES FLAWS IN NATION'S LABOR LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd and 4th grafs to broaden top of story) 
(ATTN: La.) (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Five years ago, the workers at Avondale shipyard
voted to join a union, with hundreds of them cheering wildly
outside the company's headquarters along the Mississippi when the
vote count was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is still no union at the shipyard. The 50,000 pages
of documents _ furious charges and countercharges _ stacked in the
offices of the National Labor Relations Board are evidence of what
took place instead: one of the longest, most heavily litigated
unionization fights in the board's history. At a time when labor
unions nationwide are stepping up efforts to organize millions of
workers, labor leaders and even some government officials point to
the Avondale battle as proof that the nation's labor laws are
cumbersome and replete with loopholes, and that companies intent on
keeping unions out have become more adroit at exploiting them.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a new campaign to show that stubborn employers can
make a mockery of the right to organize, the nation's labor leaders
say they are using Avondale as Exhibit A to show how companies
dismiss union supporters and use other illegal tactics to beat back
organizing drives. These leaders complain that employers are
abusing the law to create delays because they realize that
organizing drives can fizzle in the five years it can take for
courts to order a company to recognize a union that won a
unionization election.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, acknowledging the problem, say scores of
cases are caught up in this legal limbo, as companies file appeal
after appeal. These include Overnite Trucking, which is fighting a
Teamsters' organizing drive at its terminals nationwide, and the
Santa Fe Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, which has litigated for
five years against a hotel workers' election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many Avondale workers say they desperately need a union to raise
wages at the lowest-paying major shipyard in the nation and to end
Avondale's unusually high rate of fatal accidents. According to the
union, at least 29 workers have died in accidents since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, two years after a hearing officer upheld the
election, the labor board certified the Metal Trades Council as the
union for the Avondale workers, which would normally bring
negotiations for a labor contract. Instead, Avondale refused to
recognize the union or bargain with it and began its appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process to put a union in takes too long,'' said Harry Lee
Thompson, a pipefitter who began working at Avondale in 1969, after
returning from Vietnam. ``Five years is too much. It's a slap in
the face of the working man.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Feinstein, the labor board's general counsel, said the
Avondale case had exposed many weak links in the system. He
acknowledged that the mountain of papers and months of hearings had
taxed the board's staff to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to take issue with the notion that it's frustrating
that an election that took place five years ago still hasn't come
to conclusion,'' Feinstein said. ``It's something we're looking at
as an example of the process not being what it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Avondale case, a judge with the National Labor Relations
Board found that in the company's zeal to keep the union out, it
had violated the law more than 70 times, dismissing, for example,
28 workers because they supported the union. Even though those
workers were dismissed four or more years ago, none of them have
been reinstated because Avondale is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Defending its lengthy legal maneuvering, Avondale Industries,
the nation's largest nonunion shipbulder, asserts that the vote for
the union was tainted by fraud. Avondale, which beat back
organizing drives in decades past, insists that unionization would
hurt it by pushing up production costs and causing it to lose
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a new campaign to show that stubborn employers can
make a mockery out of the right to organize, the AFL-CIO is
pointing to Avondale as the nation's leading corporate outlaw for
the way it has kept unionization efforts at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avondale struggle is important because it's a group of
workers who have tried so hard for so long to form a union, and
they've had everything thrown in their way,'' said John Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO. ``We're seeing the rule of labor law
becoming the rule of hypocrisy _ corporations that pretend to be
upstanding citizens and live off taxpayer money violate fundamental
laws that are supposed to protect workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Avondale workers point to what they view as an unfortunate
contradiction. Officials from one federal agency _ the labor board
_ found Avondale guilty of ``egregious misconduct'' and ``an
outrageous and pervasive number'' of labor law violations. Yet
those at another federal department _ the Navy _ recently awarded
Avondale a $685 million contract to build amphibious assault craft,
with the possibility of $5 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Avondale workers often say they need a union to get fair wages
and fair treatment at the shipyard, which looks like a giant
erector set in the shadow of the Huey P. Long Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Wages range from $8 an hour for the least-skilled workers
($16,600 a year) to $13.50 an hour ($28,000 a year) for welders and
pipefitters, including those with 25 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ingalls shipyard in neighboring Mississippi, the top pay
rate is $2 an hour higher, while at the Bath Iron Works
shipbuilding concern in Maine, top pay is $3.50 more, or 26 percent
higher. Both are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale's pensions are also low. Retirees with 30 years'
experience often receive $300 a month. And many workers complain
that they cannot afford Avondale's family health insurance, which
costs them almost $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another big worry is safety. According to the most recent
federal statistics, 12 Avondale workers died in accidents from 1982
to 1994, often from falls or having large pieces of metal crash
down on them. That's twice the number at the shipyards with the
second largest number of deaths, Tampa Bay Ship Building, in
Florida, and National Steel and Shipbuilding, in San Diego. And
Avondale's death toll is more e than double the number at its
larger competitors, Ingalls and Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale officials say they have improved their record, noting
that there have been no deaths since 1994. In a statement,
Avondale, the largest private employer in the New Orleans region,
said it has ``an excellent safety record relative to the rest of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Pyburn Jr., an Avondale lawyer, maintained that the labor
board's tortoise-like pace, and not the shipbuilder, had caused the
years of delay. Repeated appeals are justified, he said, because
the company believes that the labor board failed to properly
oversee the election and that the unionization vote was fraudulent
for numerous reasons, including that some voters failed to show
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale's chairman, Albert L. Bossier Jr., said in a recent
statement, ``We did not believe at the time of the election that
the union was supported by anywhere near a majority of Avaondale
workers nor do we believe they have any significant support in our
work force today.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union supporters argue that the labor board needs to act
faster and that unions should be installed quickly after winning an
election, just as political candidates are. If the labor board or
courts overturn the election, national union officials say, then
the union should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   For many workers, the dispute is not about abstruse legal
issues, but bread-and-butter ones. Avondale, the home of the
shipyard, and other communities around the port are hardly
prosperous, with the area replete with dilapidated one-story houses
and aging pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Pyburn defended Avondale's wage levels, saying they are the
highest of any shipyard in the area. But many Avondale workers say
they have relatives at nearby shipyards who earn more than
Avondale's top rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sweatshop, with such low wages,'' said Mike Boudreaux,
a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a labor board judge found that Avondale intimidated
employees so systematically that he ordered an unusual remedy. In
addition to reinstating illegally dismissed workers, the judge,
David Evans, ordered Bossier, Avondale's chairman, to read a
statement _ or stand alongside a board official who read a
statement _ to the shipyard's 5,300 workers, cataloguing its labor
law violations and pledging to end such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Evans ruled that Avondale had sought to suppress the union by
punishing dozens of workers because they supported the union.
Federal labor law bars managers from retaliating against union
supporters. Evans found that Avondale had acted illegally in
discharging the 28 pro-union workers, suspending 5 others, issuing
18 warning notices, denying benefits to 8 employees and assigning
``onerous'' work to 8 others.
</P>
<P>
   Pyburn said the workers were disciplined for valid reasons, like
leaving work stations without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal labor law, administrative law judges make the
initial decisions in labor dispute, and those decisions can then be
appealed to the full labor board and after that to a U.S. Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the labor board rules against Avondale on its appeal
regarding the dismissals and discipline, the shipyard could appeal
to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where it has already
appealed the ruling upholding the election. The company can also
appeal to the Supreme Court. These appeals could take at least
another year, meaning that workers dismissed in 1993 might not have
a chance at reinstatement until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, union supporters nationwide say it is fruitless to
look to the labor board and courts for redress. Instead, many
Avondale workers are rallying behind a campaign that aims to
pressure Avondale to recognize the union. They are demonstrating
outside the shipyard, getting dozens of clergymen to denounce
Avondale and urging the Navy to take a tougher stance toward
Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the Vietnam War veteran, said: ``A foreman once said
to me, `Why are you passing out handbills for the union? You're one
of the top-paid people and you're going to retire soon.' I said,
`Maybe one day my son or relative will want to come out here. I
want them to get a fair shake on wages and benefits. I want them to
be treated better than I'm treated.' If someone doesn't stand up
for something, then where will we be?''

TECHNOLOGY FAILS TO SAVE PLOT OF `SMALL SOLDIERS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the monster toys against the human soldier toys, with real
people caught in the middle, in the violent live-action,
computer-animation and puppet kid's movie, ``Small Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   As any kid could predict, it's the monster toys who are the nice
heroes, while the soldier toys are the kill-'em-all bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Soldiers'' is a mix of live action (real actors and
settings) with two forms of trickery. One is actual puppets,
created by the studio of the famous Stan Winston, who has gotten
four Oscars for films such as ``Jurassic Park'' and ``Terminator
2.'' The other is Industrial Light and Magic computer animation
matching the puppets Winston's teams created.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of all three is really pretty amazing, creating an
almost seamless interaction between life, animation and puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the story built around the animation, while
beginning with nice touches of parody to amuse adults in the
audience, soon degenerates into a juvenile script aimed directly at
kids who like to see things smashed up. It comes with enough
violence and dangerous behavior to concern parents.
</P>
<P>
   One scene that may scare some kids has a ``live'' toy soldier
getting his legs chewed off in a garbage disposal while his top
half is still visible. In another scene, a boy climbs a live power
pole with instructions on how to short out the neighborhood. Wonder
if kids will try that after seeing this?
</P>
<P>
   But once word gets around summer camp how cool-destructive these
animated toys are, it's going to be hard to keep kids from going.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is directed by Joe Dante, who brought us ``Gremlins,''
and has much of the feel of that movie. Watch close to see a
Gremlin toy spotted in a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   When a big, heartless megacompany buys up a small,
child-friendly toy company, the plan is to create toys that will
sell, no matter how bad they are for kids.
</P>
<P>
   The toy designers have already come up with two new, completely
separate toy ideas. One is a race of monster-looking but peaceful
fantasy creatures called Gorgonites who are forever looking for
their lost island of Gorgon.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a squad of toy soldiers modeled after the kind of
cliche Nick Fury-style commando characters you'd find in the kind
of military comics parents don't want their children to read. Each
one's name fits his character. The leader is Chip Hazard. The radio
man is Link Static.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the big company (Denis Leary) decides that the two
lines should be designed as enemies, with the heroic Commando Elite
human soldiers out to track down and kill the monster Gorgonites.
</P>
<P>
   To make the toys sophisticated, futuristic software is combined
with a computer chip designed for military weapons. The resulting
toy soldiers are unexpectedly and frighteningly human and
ultra-aggressive. Unfortunately, in their rush to market the toys,
the company doesn't have time for field testing.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of their boxes and turned on, the toy's new computer
chips give both races the ability to learn. The Gorgonites, trained
to hide and lose when attacked, are at the mercy of the
increasingly real Commando Elite, who only want to destroy the
``Gorgonite scum.''
</P>
<P>
   In a small Ohio town, young Alan (Gregory Smith) and his
would-be girlfriend Christy (Kirsten Dunst) befriend a group of the
goofy-looking Gorgonites when they are mercilessly attacked by the
Commando Elite. The commandos then turn their attack on the kids
and eventually their families. At first, the humans have an
advantage because they are larger and smarter, but the commandos
learn and get lots of reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, there are some pretty funny touches to the film, such
as a commercial in which a company selling its military chips to
the public boasts, ``You'll enjoy the same high-quality technology
the U.S. Defense Department gets.'' Globotech's business is
``turning swords into plowshares for you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon the film turns into a formulaic child's film with
little to offer adults except admiring the computer animation. That
is quite impressive, but so what? How long can we be interested in
real-looking toys?
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Gorgonites, Archer (voice of Frank Langella),
is an appealing, furry-beast character. The rest of the creatures
are comic: One looks sort of Frankenstein-ish; another is a big eye
on a long neck.
</P>
<P>
   The voices of the Commando Elite may be the best joke in the
movie. They belong to actors who could have played the same role in
war movies 30 years ago: Besides Jones, they are Ernest Borgnine,
Jim Brown, Bruce Dern, George Kennedy and Clint Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The commandos also recruit a collection of Barbie-type dolls
onto their side.
</P>
<P>
   When his troops start ogling the faux-Barbies, Chip Hazard tells
them, ``This is the modern army, those are reinforcements.'' The
dolls are stripped down, and computer brains are placed between
their oversize Barbie-doll breasts. (No, really.)
</P>
<P>
   The film does have a number of humorous lines and moments. When
one of his squad is killed (chopped in half), Hazard says ``Nick
Nitro's battery has run out, but his memory will keep on going and
going and going.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasional one-liners and great animation effects are not
enough to keep adults enthralled through the mundane story of the
humans fighting toys, or the uninspired romance between the
12-year-old kids.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the adult cast includes Jay Mohr, the late Phil
Hartman and Robert Picardo, all in small roles.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, there would seem to be a conflict between the
rating for ``Small Soldiers'' and its intended audience.
</P>
<P>
   The movie gets and deserves a PG-13 rating, which means that
parents are warned to consider carefully before letting their
children age 12 and younger see it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the movie is aimed at kids 12 and younger.
One must assume either that the filmmakers thought their movie
should get a less-severe rating, or that they know few parents
restrict their younger kids from seeing PG-13 movies, unless the
rating is for sex instead of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical view is that the studios _ in this case DreamWorks
and Universal _ are just banking on parents not caring. It's
possible that in this case the filmmakers thought they would get by
with a PG, since much of the violence is between toys. But because
the toys seem so human, it still seems very violent.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Motion Picture Association of America's reason
for the rating mentions drug use. This is from the toys putting
prescription pills in the parent's alcoholic drinks, not from
children using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sex _ except one big smooch between the 12-year-olds
_ and only doll nudity. &QL;

SCHOOLKIDS SEE CLINTON AND GINGRICH IN RARE JOINT APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert three grafs about Clinton and Sylvester Stallone,
starting at the 11th graf; no other changes)  (mk) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ President Clinton and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich made a rare joint appearance Thursday in Atlanta to
crusade against illegal drug use, even as their parties are
preparing to club each other with that issue in the congressional
campaigns this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying here to console the families and praise the
firefighters who are grappling with Florida's fires, Clinton
stopped in Atlanta to unveil a new advertising campaign against
drugs that he said was designed to ``knock America upside the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a bipartisan front _ if a rather cool one _ before
hundreds of schoolchildren in a conference center auditorium,
Gingrich and Clinton described how drugs had affected them. The
speaker said that the sister of one of his aides was left in a coma
by a drug slipped into her drink; the president said that his
brother, Roger, ``nearly died from a cocaine habit.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the congressional elections bearing down, the sense of
shared purpose did not last. Immediately after Gingrich finished
his remarks hailing the commercials' ``bipartisan basis,'' an aide
to Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., handed a statement to reporters in
the auditorium that sharply assailed Clinton's drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   And after the anti-drug event, Clinton moved on to a $500,000
fund-raising lunch for Michael Coles, a Democrat who is challenging
Coverdell for his Senate seat. He mocked Republicans as
misrepresenting Democratic policies on the budget, guns and foreign
policy. ``They still milk that old cow every chance they get,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Florida, the president visited with families who lost
most of their possessions to fire. Several people wept as they told
Clinton their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president spoke under a tent to several hundred
firefighters and other emergency workers gathered at the Daytona
International Speedway, which has served as a staging area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here,'' he said, ``because I think it's important that
every American knows that this summer, notwithstanding the great
movies, the real American heroes are not up in space fighting
asteroids, they're in Florida fighting fires.''
</P>
<P>
   After driving the short distance to the speedway from the
airport, Clinton and his motorcade took a stately quarter-lap on
the 2.5-mile oval. The last car of the three-dozen-vehicle
motorcade had barely reached the track as the first vehicle left
it.
</P>
<P>
   As in Georgia, Clinton combined his official duties in Florida
with political ones. He flew to Miami for an $800,000 dinner on
behalf of congressional candidates at the home of the actor
Sylvester Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting Clinton with the boxing gloves he wore in ``Rocky,''
Stallone compared him to the title character, saying he ``has an
uphill battle but doggedly asks for one more round just to keep
punching, keep punching, keep punching until finally he gets his
point across.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallone concluded: ``It's been a grand evening. I shan't forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president thanked Stallone for the gift and said: ``I think
I've established that I can take a punch. Now the time has come for
me to deliver a few.''
</P>
<P>
   The new advertising campaign, supervised by the Campaign for a
Drug-Free America, is financed this year with $195 million in
federal money that organizers expect to be matched by media
organizations. Some commercials, tailored to different racial and
age groups, have already been broadcast in test markets; the
national campaign began Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the president and speaker sat with several people
between them, but they were careful to compliment each other's work
against drugs. Both seemed to capture the children's attention with
their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described learning from his brother that he had started
drinking beer and smoking marijuana in high school. ``I said, `How
often?''' he said. ``He said, `Every day.' And I thought to myself,
`What kind of family member was I?'''
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience: ``There's somebody like my brother back at
your school who is a good kid, just a little lost,'' adding: ``You
can save them.''

GIBSON, GLOVER TEAM UP FOR MORE COMEDY, MAYHEM IN ``LW 4'' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Policemen Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh are the two stooges of
super-violent action movies. Where they go, mayhem follows,
giggling all the way.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth entry in their ``Lethal Weapon'' series, Murtaugh
(Danny Glover) and Riggs (Mel Gibson) spend their professional time
trying to stop smugglers who are bringing Chinese immigrants into
the country for forced labor. In their private moments they are
each coming to grips with an unexpected pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the plot matters much, but it turns out the smuggling
covers up an even more dangerous plan to get some major Chinese
crime lords into the country.
</P>
<P>
   A subplot, so downplayed you may miss it, is that some of
Murtaugh's associates are beginning to wonder where a lowly street
officer gets the money to pay for his family's lavish lifestyle.
Even Riggs is worried Murtaugh is on the take.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting are the personal stories. Murtaugh's daughter
is pregnant and hasn't named the father. And Riggs' live-in mate,
Lorna Cole (Rene Russo again), is also with child.
</P>
<P>
   Both babies are due any day. Murtaugh is trying to find out who
the dad is (he prays the father is black and not a cop) and widower
Riggs must decide whether to propose to Lorna.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs and Murtaugh have caused so much public destruction in
their police work _ the opening scene in which they cause an oil
tanker to explode has been shown in previews for months _ that they
both have been promoted to captain to keep them off the street and
out of trouble. Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   If the purpose of a movie review is to let readers know if they
will enjoy seeing a picture, then ``Lethal Weapon 4'' requires
asking just one question: Did you like its predecessors? Whatever
you felt about previous ``Lethal Weapon'' movies, you are almost
sure to feel the same about this edition. It is cut very much from
the same cloth, by many of the same tailors.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Gibson and Glover back, but also so are Joe Pesci
as the irritating, foul-mouthed sleaze-ball Lou Getz (``LW 2 and
3'') and Russo (``LW 3'') as Cole, an officer who matches Riggs in
tough fighting, sex appeal and zany attitude. Steve Kahan returns
to play Capt. Ed Murphy for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Richard Donner returns to direct. Aside from
making all four ``LW'' movies, Donner has guided Gibson through
``Maverick'' and ``Conspiracy Theory.'' He is one of the few
directors who has a sure hand blending comedy and action scenes (he
also did ``Superman: The Movie``).
</P>
<P>
   Most action-movie sequels suffer badly compared to their
originals, relying on bigger (not better) action to cover up a lack
of a reason to exist (aside from making more money from the same
title, that is).
</P>
<P>
   Donner and action producer Joel Silver, who also has been there
all the way, have managed to maintain a high-percentage of the
original film's qualities, such as they are. While adhering closely
to a formula established in 1987, the sequels have felt relatively
fresh, especially ``Lethal Weapon 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret has been finding ways of doing the predictable action
scenes in wild and funny ways, and by playing up the strong comic
relationship between the stars. In addition, all the ``LW'' films
keep up such a furious pace you hardly notice how ridiculous they
are.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it helps that this is the first ``LW'' movie in six
years. The plotting is thin, disguised beneath all the bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least five action set pieces, most of them
extremely well staged. There's a gun fight between our heroes on a
fishing boat and smugglers on a ship. There is a car chase _ as if
there wouldn't be _ in which Gibson ends up in a predicament so
outlandish and funny it would be unfair to describe.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that there is some pretty gross violence?
</P>
<P>
   As superficial as the personal stories are, we have to be
thankful when an action film these days makes any attempt at
character.
</P>
<P>
   In the original ``Lethal Weapon,'' Riggs was near suicidal after
the death of his wife. Eleven years later, he still struggles with
the idea of marrying someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear the ring anymore,'' he says, ``but I look down,
and it's still there.'' No kidding, that line elicited a sad
``Awww'' from the woman sitting behind me.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the comedy built around the nutty cop (Riggs)/stable
cop (Murtaugh) relationship is a major element. After Riggs
convinces Murtaugh to distract a bad guy by stripping to his shorts
and acting like a bird, he tries to pat the older officer on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't touch me when I'm naked,'' snaps Murtaugh.
</P>
<P>
   A running joke involves a young cop, Lee Butters (comedian Chris
Rock), who is being very friendly to Murtaugh. It is Butters who is
the lover of Murtaugh's daughter. Riggs has convinced his pal that
Butters is so nice to him because he's gay.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's character supplies some funny moments, but like Pesci,
whose main comic riff is to cuss like he's back in a Scorsese
movie, he detracts far more than he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and Glover give a good show; they don't act like they
were playing the same rather thin characters for the fourth time.
They are the core of this series, as much as the wild stunts and
heavy violence.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, who was a major attraction of ``LW 3,'' is under-used
this time. She does have two good scenes and one good fight, even
nine months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, almost forgot. Every action film needs a chief villain,
and here the part is played by Jet Li, a martial arts expert and
Asian star. He's not threatening-looking. He can sure move in
fights though. (These things are so over-edited, they can make
anybody look good.)
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the soundtrack is at times so loud, both from music
and gunfire, that it's often hard to catch key words of dialogue.
You may miss completely the comic explanation, when it finally
comes, of where Glover gets all his money.
</P>
<P>
   After ``LW 3'' Gibson and Glover made noises about not doing any
more sequels. And with a superstar status that lets him pick almost
any role and any salary, Gibson had little reason to change his
mind, especially after winning serious filmmaker status with his
best-director Oscar for ``Braveheart.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Lethal Weapon 3,'' the most profitable of the series, made
$319 million worldwide _ not counting the post-theatrical ancillary
markets. Is it any wonder Warner Bros. was willing to pay Gibson
$20 million to make another one? Even so, he said no for years,
only relenting when _ he said _ the script and the time were
finally right.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``LW 4'' is unexceptional story-wise and too long.
Still, it's one of the more entertaining action films of late.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sex or nudity, but there are tons of profanity and
over-the-top gore in the R-rated movie.
