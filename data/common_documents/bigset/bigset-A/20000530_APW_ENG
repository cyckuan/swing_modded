<HEADLINE> Buffalo-Niagara Falls No. 1 in union membership, stats show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Finally, Buffalo can say ''We're No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the hockey or football title residents long for,
but federal statistics show the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metro area is
first in the nation when it comes to union membership.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by a heavy union presence in the public sector, a
factor throughout New York state, plus union strength in the
industrial job base, the 27.3 percent rate of membership is nearly
double the national average of 14 percent, Bureau of National
Affairs statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (labor's influence) has helped protect the quality of
life,'' Buffalo Common Council member Mary Martino told The Buffalo
News. The former vice president of a nurses union, Martino said
union members in her district usually have a better health and
retirement safety net than nonunion members.
</P>
<P>
   However, union dues do not buy job security, as 340 mostly
unionized workers at Occidental Chemical Co. found out last week
when the company announced it is closing operations in Niagara
Falls and Grand Island.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the pro-union reputation a selling point when it comes to
luring companies to replace lost jobs, development officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no secret, if you ask the site selection guys, the fact
participation is high is an eliminator for us in searches,'' said
Thomas Kucharski, president of the Buffalo Niagara Enterprise, a
business coalition that hopes to attract 50,000 new jobs in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is, most companies state a strong preference
to remaining nonunion when they site a new facility,'' agreed
Dennis Donovan, a site selection consultant with the Wadley-Donovan
group in Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Nonunion companies oppose sharing authority, Donovan said, and
avoid areas where unions are strong. The exceptions are high-tech
and service industries, which usually are not unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester, which last month passed Buffalo in jobs, has 15
percent union membership, No. 38 on the list of 100 metropolitan
areas. Farther down the list are Austin, Texas, and Raleigh-Durham,
N.C., where job growth races ahead of the national average.
</P>
<P>
   While it may not help attract jobs, labor leaders said union
strength contributes to better wages and conditions for people in
existing jobs. The average weekly paycheck for a union worker was
$650 last year in Buffalo, 25 percent more than nonunion wages,
federal data shows.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Buffalo and Niagara Falls-area unions formed the
AFL-CIO Development Group to market the region to employers, hoping
to dispel the negative perception of area unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Organized labor is cooperative with management. The idea is to
bring good jobs here,'' said coalition spokesman Kevin Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal, Quebecor Printing, American Axle &AMP; Manufacturing
and other companies have said their unions worked with management
to strengthen the company. At American Axle, for example, an
innovative contract with the UAW allowed the company to open a
100-job factory last year in Cheektowaga that performs work
formerly done by out-of-state suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly a change in federal record-keeping that put the
Buffalo-Niagara Falls area atop the list of union strongholds
during the 1990s, the Buffalo News said. The change combined Flint,
Mich., and some other union towns with nearby cities, taking them
out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Slow job growth also increased Buffalo's union density. While
other cities gained jobs, mostly nonunion ones, the Niagara
region's job total barely budged.

<HEADLINE> New York GOP prepares to nominate little-known congressman as Giuliani sub </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Republican activists from across the state
gathered today in New York's second largest city to nominate a
little-known congressman, Rick Lazio, to take over from Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani in the battle to keep Hillary Rodham Clinton out
of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's withdrawal from the race just 11 days ago to deal
with prostate cancer opened the door for the boyish-looking,
four-term congressman from Long Island. His candidacy was quickly
supported by Gov. George Pataki and other Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a true hometown boy versus somebody from another state,''
said state GOP Chairman William Powers, stressing a favorite
Republican theme used against Clinton -- that she had never lived in
the state before moving to New York in January -- on the eve of the
party's nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's formal nomination was to come late this afternoon at a
Buffalo hotel, a far cry from the sports arena in Albany that
Democrats packed with more than 10,000 people earlier this month as
they nominated the first lady for the seat being vacated by her
fellow Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have more than 2,000 people, which for us is great,''
Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   There was little suspense for the more than 400 GOP delegates.
The congressman's own schedule, issued Sunday, stated that at 4:30
p.m. Tuesday: ''Lazio to accept nomination at the New York state
GOP Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio lacks the star power of Clinton, he did embark on a
whirlwind pre-convention schedule that had him hitting all the
major Sunday morning news shows just one day after his formal
candidacy announcement. He then flew around the state and marched
in two Memorial Day parades on Monday before heading to a barbecue
at the Rochester-area home of Monroe County GOP Chairman Steve
Minarik.
</P>
<P>
   After staying the night in Rochester, Lazio planned a breakfast
with supporters in Buffalo this morning and a luncheon with
Republican women.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman was arriving in Buffalo literally with a
campaign battle scar. He tripped during a parade Monday on Long
Island, leaving him with a cut lip that required eight stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be the first of a few,'' quipped Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this lip it looks like I was kissing the grill,'' Lazio
joked at the Rochester barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   After being patched up, Lazio joined Giuliani in Queens for
another Memorial Day parade, their first campaign appearance
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's gotten off to an absolutely tremendous start, and if I
could judge by the reception here in northern Queens, he's going to
be a very very strong candidate. ... I'm going to do everything I
can to help him get elected,'' the New York City mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that, Giuliani was skipping the GOP state convention
so as not to upstage Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls, even before the Giuliani withdrawal, have
shown Clinton hovering in the mid-40 percentage range, a situation
that has given Republicans hope that Lazio can copy the
giant-killer role played by Pataki in 1994 when, as a little-known
state senator, he toppled three-term Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pataki, Lazio is from the suburbs surrounding New York City
and is considered a moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   GOP boss Powers said that while he expects a close race, he is
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's represented the people of New York, like his opponent
hasn't and he's paid New York state income taxes, like his opponent
hasn't,'' the party leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said they were happy to have Lazio instead of
Giuliani as their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now going to be an issues-oriented campaign. It's no
longer going to be a celebrity campaign,'' Monroe County Executive
Jack Doyle said at the Rochester barbecue. ''With Giuliani and Mrs.
Clinton, it was going to turn into a celebrity issue, as to who
looked better and who had more celebrity friends and who was more
famous ... I think people are a little tired of the celebrity side
of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that Rick's in, there's some excitement and the feeling
he's really going to put his heart and soul into this race, whereas
it seemed that the mayor wanted the office but he didn't really
want to campaign for it,'' said Larry Staub, vice chairman of the
Monroe County GOP.

<HEADLINE> For spot movement Monday, May 29 for use Tuesday, May 30.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Twenty years ago, school nurse Sharon Shea
could lock up the inhalers and respiratory medication for the 800
students in her middle school in a small lock box that fit in her
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the ''meds'' take up two shelves in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   Each square inch of that additional space means that more
children are suffering from asthma, allergies and other respiratory
ailments. School nurses say the increase in medications cries out
for restricting pesticides and exposure to other substances which
they say amounts to assaults on student health throughout New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a great increase in the allergy and asthma rate,''
said Shea, a nurse practitioner in the Long Island community of St.
James and past president of the New York State Association of
School Nurses. ''You have a lot of things going on you'd never see
24 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The association is pushing the state Legislature for laws that
would require schools to buy fewer toxic and polluting materials,
from workshop engines to cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   The group also wants schools to adopt a ''least-toxic'' pest
control program. That would require schools to choose the
least-powerful pesticide that would still kill a specific pest. It
is common approach in government buildings and even on many public
golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   But school districts, as many found out in defeated budget votes
this spring, have to worry about finances, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schools are already burdened by mandates,'' said Barbara
Bradley, spokeswoman for the New York State School Boards
Association. ''If an environmental product makes sense, the school
board should be able to do that and not be mandated to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the association opposes the proposal to require
more environmentally sensitive purchasing in part because of a lack
of a clear definition of the proposed policy. That restriction,
Bradley said, could force schools to unnecessarily pay much more
for a product.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to require a least-toxic pest control program is
similar to an existing law, Bradley said. The proposal simply
requires reports more often, even though its advocates say it would
provide greater protection to students and staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids are affected immediately by pollutants and schools aren't
taking it seriously,'' said Claire Barnett, executive director of
the Health Schools Network that is lobbying for the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need immediate passage of legislation aimed at reducing
toxics used by schools around children. No more excuses: children
aren't even covered by OSHA,'' Barnett said, referring to state and
federal workplace protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Studies and commonsense suggest symptoms like labored breathing
and shortness of breath aren't just a physical concern, but can
affect students' ability to concentrate, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   To back it up, the association released a survey of 206 school
nurses in 42 counties last week. Its findings include:
</P>
<P>
   --71 percent said students' ability to learn, breathe easily or
behave properly was hurt by indoor pollutants including bus fumes,
cleaners, pesticides, small engines and scented products.
</P>
<P>
   --25 percent said their schools didn't properly control air flow
quality.
</P>
<P>
   --42 percent said more students were using inhalers than five
years ago for respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   While the need for action may be clear to the nurses, the cause
is more elusive.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and environmental advocates have long said
modern schools built or renovated for energy efficiency reduce the
flow of fresh air and irritate respiratory problems. Some old
school buildings still have dirtier-burning coal- or oil-fired
boilers for heat.
</P>
<P>
   Activists also cite air pollution in the environment in general
as contributing to the problem among youngsters in schools.

<HEADLINE> Catholic bishops speak of 'false success' of welfare reform  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's Roman Catholic bishops are
calling on Gov. George Pataki and the state Legislature to
determine conclusively what has become of former welfare recipients
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Both common sense and compassion dictate that the state find out
more about the lives of some 800,000 people who were on welfare in
1995 and are not any more, the state Catholic Conference said.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare rolls in New York have dropped almost by half from the
1.6 million people receiving public assistance when Pataki became
governor in 1995. His administration said the research done so far
indicates the bulk of those people are gainfully employed and
leading productive lives.
</P>
<P>
   In their most recent pronouncement on welfare, delivered to a
state Senate hearing in New York City late last week, the bishops
said there is more call for emergency food, clothing and shelter
provided by Catholic Charities in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests to Catholic leaders that welfare reform has
resulted in ''false success,'' Kathleen Ayers Lanzillotta told the
Senate hearing on behalf of the bishops. She is administrator for
substance abuse services of Catholic Charities run by the diocese
of Rockville Centre on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is easy and seductive to claim that they have left welfare
for work, but the state has not completed evaluations that were
mandated under federal and state welfare reform laws,'' Lanzillotta
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear to the Catholic Conference whether the failure to
definitively track former welfare recipients is intentional or not,
conference spokesman Rick Hinshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, you get into the political sound bite,''
Hinshaw said. ''It sounds good to say you've reduced the rolls by
this much. It's almost a question of why look for trouble from a
political standpoint. 'This (numbers drop) is good news.' Maybe
there is a hesitancy to dig deeper and to find that the news is not
as good as you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Catholic Conference official, David Hamilton said
Catholic Charity workers in Albany and on Long Island have
interviewed more than 500 people recently coming into their food
pantries and found that most feel they are worse off than they were
six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The state should be tracking those people to determine how
effective welfare reform has really been, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we seem to be seeing are closed cases in state data,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration argued, however, that it is doing just
what the bishops are calling for.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the State University of New York's Rockefeller
Institute of Government reported that 83 percent of 8,983 families
who had left welfare in the first quarter of 1997 were not on
welfare one year later. The study also found 75 percent of the
former welfare recipients had been employed at some point since
leaving the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA)
said it has two other studies currently underway. One is examining
people who have been receiving public assistance since December
1996 since those people will be the first to face an automatic
cut-off of benefits after five years. The other is tracking people
who left public assistance in 1999 to see what transitional benefit
programs work and what do not, according to OTDA spokesman Jack
Madden.
</P>
<P>
   Planned studies will look at would-be welfare recipients who are
diverted into other assistance programs and at the role drug and
alcohol abuse has on the welfare system, Madden said.

<HEADLINE> US Won't Pressure Taiwan Over Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The United States will not pressure Taiwan
to accept China's conditions for talks between the two rivals, the
top U.S. representative in Taiwan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Raymond Burghardt, director of the American
Institute in Taiwan, were apparently aimed at calming Taiwanese who
fear that Washington might team up with Beijing and try to force
Taiwan to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   New Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian has offered to meet with
Chinese leaders. But Beijing has insisted that before talks begin,
Chen must agree that Taiwan is an inseparable part of ''one
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen has said he would discuss the issue during a summit, but he
has said he would not agree to any preconditions for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Burghardt repeated Washington's assurance that it
would not pressure Taipei to accept Beijing's precondition. He also
said that Taiwan and China should solve their differences on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will support any arrangement that is voluntarily agreed to
by both sides,'' Burghardt, the de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan,
said at a conference of scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Like most nations, the United States does not have formal
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which split from China amid civil war
51 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province and uses its
political and economic clout to discourage nations from forming
official ties with it.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, China's state-run media said Chinese President
Jiang Zemin thanked President Clinton in a telephone call for his
help last week in pushing through permanent low-tariff trading
rights for China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed with Jiang that granting permanent normal trade
relations to China ''will further strengthen the foundation of
U.S.-China relations,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.

<HEADLINE> Mori's Popularity Plunges Further  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC PRIDEAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Support for Japan's prime minister hit a new low
Tuesday, making him the least popular prime minister in decades to
lead this country's ruling party into parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's government has dropped
to just 19 percent, according to a new poll by the Asahi, a major
Japanese newspaper. The poll, conducted by telephone Sunday and
Monday, showed Mori's support rating had fallen from 41 percent
just a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The rating was the lowest for a prime minister heading into
general elections since the poll was first conducted in 1946, the
Asahi reported. As is customary with Japanese polls, it gave no
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Mori has indicated he will dissolve the lower house of
Parliament, the more powerful of its two chambers, for elections
June 25.
</P>
<P>
   It is within Mori's right as prime minister to set the date, and
he still has room to change it. By law, he has until October. But
experts believe that backing away from the June 25 date now is
impossible for Mori, despite his low support.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he were to move back the date, political chaos would ensue.
He would have to step down,'' said Minoru Morita, a well-known
political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is not expected to
lose hold of the government, Mori's plunging popularity could make
it difficult for them to hold their current strength in the lower
house.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mori makes another blunder between now and the election,
he'll put himself in a very severe situation,'' Morita said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had forecast an outpouring of voter sympathy for the
late Keizo Obuchi, whom Mori replaced on April 6. Obuchi -- whose
birthday is June 25 -- had suffered a stroke days earlier, and died
May 14.
</P>
<P>
   That support has appeared to evaporate amid a series of scandals
over the administration's handling of Obuchi's illness, and reports
that Mori was caught in a brothel while he was a college student
and attended a 1995 wedding reception where a gangster was among
the guests.
</P>
<P>
   Mori has denied knowing a gangster was at the reception, and is
suing the magazine that printed the brothel allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Mori has gotten himself into more trouble over remarks that
Japan is a 'divine nation'' with the emperor at the center --
recalling for many the emperor-worship that drove Japan's wartime
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   He has since denied any intention of reviving the prewar
state-sanction of Japan's indigenous Shinto faith, but his efforts
at spin control appear to be failing.

<HEADLINE> Health care workers, veterans rally against budget cuts  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) -- On a day set aside to remember fallen
soldiers, a group of health care workers rallied to preserve
medical treatment for today's aging veterans.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 health care workers, veterans and family members
on Monday protested potential budget cuts at the state veterans
hospital in Rocky Hill. Speakers said veterans deserve better
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took care of us,'' said Helen Bergeron, whose husband,
Eugene, is a World War II veteran who lives at the facility. ''Now
we should take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Health Care Employees Union District 1199, which
represents about 250 health care employees at the Rocky Hill
facility, said the state Department of Veterans Affairs wants to
eliminate the hospital's acute care license. The change to only
chronic care would mean the loss of physicians and nurses and
eliminate onsite services such as radiology, lab testing and
electrocardiography, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which organized the rally, also said the department
projects savings of $395,000 and the elimination of about 27
positions. Several speakers said previous budget cuts have already
hurt services and created poor conditions at the facility,
including inadequate air conditioning and heating, and fewer staff
to supervise veterans with Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conditions here are deplorable,'' said Edward Kalinowski,
first selectman in Portland whose father, a World War II veteran,
was cared for at the facility until his death last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Veterans Affairs Commissioner Eugene Migliaro charged that
the rally is aimed primarily at preserving bloated overtime
accounts. He said it is inappropriate and disrespectful to scare
veterans and their families on Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no substance to anything that the union is saying,''
Migliaro told the Journal-Inquirer of Manchester on Sunday. ''They
are exploiting these people and on Memorial Day. That's shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   The union said many of the employees are relatives of veterans
and feel strongly about the care they receive.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said the licensing change was proposed largely
to recognize that many typical acute-care services never have been
provided at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Migliaro did note that, as recommended by a consultant's report,
he eliminated two radiologist positions and may contract out for
some services. But he insisted that hospital operations would not
change much, and the facility's 170 patients would not see any
changes in care.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature this month approved a $28.2 million
2000-01 operating budget for the department. And while it
represents a $1 million increase over the current fiscal year, it
falls $322,000 below the level originally projected as necessary to
maintain services.
</P>
<P>
   Migliaro said most of the money can be offset by reductions in
overtime.

<HEADLINE> Fire marshals to push for repeal of legalization  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) --A bill that sailed through the Legislature
could legalize sparklers in time for the Fourth of July, but state
fire marshals want the governor to veto the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Fire Marshals Association said that if Gov. John
G. Rowland doesn't act, they will in the next session of the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the governor doesn't veto it, then I believe it will be a
prime concern for discussion in the next General Assembly,'' said
David Roth, president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rowland said the governor plans to sign the
bill, perhaps as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved with little opposition during the
legislative session, allows people 16 and older to buy and sell
sparklers -- nonexplosive fireworks which give off a shower of
colorful sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut was one of 10 states to ban sparklers, which burn at
1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ban include Prevent Blindness Connecticut, a
nonprofit organization based in Middletown; the Connecticut
Association of Optometrists; the Connecticut Society of Eye
Physicians; and the Connecticut Firefighters Association.
</P>
<P>
   They say sparklers are a fire hazard and danger to children's
health. According to federal government statistics, sparklers are
the second biggest cause of eye injuries that require trips to
hospital emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   One pediatric group estimates that sparklers cause up to 7
percent of the nation's estimated 10,000 fireworks-related injuries
a year. Most of the injuries are caused by explosive fireworks,
which would not be legalized under the state bill.
</P>
<P>
   The sparkler proposal was first brought to the legislature's
Public Safety Committee in January. The U.S. Fireworks Safety
Commission, a group formed by makers of nonexplosive fireworks,
hired a Hartford-based lobbyist to push the measure.
</P>
<P>
   No one testified against the bill at a March 7 hearing,
lawmakers said, and the bill was unanimously approved by the Public
Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a momentous bill in the scheme of things,'' said
Sen. Alvin Penn, a Bridgeport Democrat who is co-chairman of the
committee. ''We looked at the safety issues. We did not receive any
evidence to show they were any more harmful than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Another committee member, Rep. Ronald San Angelo, R-Naugatuck,
said the bill passed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think most legislators as kids had sparklers in their lives,
so they thought it was relatively harmless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, who is East Hartford's fire marshal, said the state fire
marshals group fought the bill with letters to lawmakers and calls
to the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Gary S. Keith, of the nonprofit National Fire Protection
Association in Quincy, Mass., wrote to Rowland recommending he kill
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us in the fire safety community have spent many years
trying to teach children that fire is not a toy,'' Keith wrote in
the letter, dated May 11. ''The message will be seriously affected
by the contradiction of letting young children use sparklers and
similar devices.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman in the state Department of Public Safety said the
Division of Fire, Emergency and Building Services has received
calls from the public about the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had calls from people saying they're not happy with
it,'' she said. ''But since the bill hasn't yet been signed, we've
told them to call the governor's office.''

<HEADLINE> Politics turns small-town parades into big-time events  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three local Memorial Day parades with the
traditional pageantry of American flags, marching bands and
uniformed veterans turned into high-powered political events
featuring New York's Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, of Long Island, who was expected to be
nominated by the state Republican Party today in Buffalo to replace
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as the Republican candidate, marched Monday
with the mayor at a parade in Douglaston, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, at a parade in Babylon, Lazio was so
enthusiastic about stopping to shake hands that he fell behind the
line of marchers and tripped as he sprinted to catch up. Lazio fell
on his face, cut his top lip and needed eight stitches at Long
Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so happy to be back home that I kissed the ground,''
Lazio joked later.
</P>
<P>
   Babylon is in his home district in Suffolk County, and he
recalled having marched in the same parade as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton marched Monday in a parade in her adopted
hometown with the Girl Scouts of Chappaqua, holding the
white-gloved hands of two little girls dressed in Brownie and Daisy
uniforms. Spectators lining the parade route applauded as they
spotted their most famous resident taking part in a treasured local
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hi, Hillary!'' called Grace Bucolo, who works at the local
Grand Union. ''She's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. And she's been
in our store a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I shook Hillary Clinton's hand! I'm never washing this hand
again,'' announced Julia Deutsch, an 8-year-old Girl Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Chappaqua's only fire trucks were pulled out of the parade to
respond to an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we just got the fire safety badge for getting out of
the way,'' said Clinton, who is the honorary chairwoman for the
Girl Scouts of America, as she led several girls to the side to let
the red trucks pass, sirens blaring.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who turned out for the parades sported red, white
and blue accessories -- headbands, hats, earrings and scarves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Great sweater!'' Clinton called out to Kerri Moore, who was
wearing a hand-knit sweater bearing a flag design.
</P>
<P>
   Moore politely smiled and waved back but admitted privately that
she is a registered Conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her telling me she liked my sweater won't sway my vote,''
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   David Metz, clutching a copy of Peggy Noonan's book ''The Case
Against Hillary Clinton'' was less reserved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go back to Illinois!'' he shouted as Clinton walked by.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was also on the minds of spectators in Queens, who
shouted ''Go get her, Rick!'' and ''Give her hell!'' as Lazio
passed by. He and the mayor zigzagged from the march to the curb to
work the crowd and engage in a little mutual admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very enthusiastic about his candidacy,'' said Giuliani,
who dropped out of the race for treatment of prostate cancer.
''He's gotten off to an absolutely tremendous start, and if I could
judge by the reception here in northern Queens, he's going to be a
very, very strong candidate. ... I'm going to do everything I can
to help him get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the mayor's support, Lazio said:
''Believe me, it's very welcome. He's a tremendously popular
figure. He's done a great job for the city of New York, and he
believes in the same things I'm talking about -- work and
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, son of an Army veteran father and a Navy veteran mother,
added: ''Memorial Day is a very special day for me, having both
parents who served our country in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reminisced about parades from her childhood in a
suburb of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I marched in parades with the Girl Scouts probably every
Memorial Day ever since I was in first or second grade, all through
high school, in a town that was about the size of Chappaqua,'' she
said. ''I loved being here and meeting a lot of my neighbors and
seeing a lot of the kids. It was a great day, and it was pretty
nostalgic.''
</P>
<P>
   When the parade was over, Clinton bought coffee for her staff at
a local deli, Lange's, where she was invited to go behind the
counter to shake hands. As she stood with a group of workers in
white aprons, she joked, ''If the Senate race doesn't work out,
I'll get a job here.''

<HEADLINE> Taliban Supporters Gain Influence  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIRALI, Pakistan (AP) -- Loudspeakers used to blare songs from
the small music shops inside the crowded bazaar of this town in
Pakistan's remote northwestern border region.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The shops are shuttered. Also gone are the television antennas
that sprouted from the rooftops of the mud and brick houses of
Mirali, 20 miles east of the Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the success of the Taliban religious militia next
door in Afghanistan, men espousing the same restrictive brand of
Islam have formed their own Taliban movement and started to impose
their rules.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Tehrik-e-Taliban, the movement has the same goals as
the Taliban in Afghanistan. It wants to eradicate music, TV, videos
-- virtually all forms of light entertainment. It seeks to ban women
taking jobs and to limit girls' schooling to the study of the Koran
and only up to age 8.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban supporters also impose religious observance, requiring
all men to pray in the mosque five times a day, grow beards and
wear turbans.
</P>
<P>
   While the movement wants to see such rules for all of Pakistan,
it is concentrating on the rugged region that borders Afghanistan
and is largely run by tribal elders. Like the Afghan Taliban, the
people of Pakistan's tribal belt are predominantly ethnic Pathans
and follow similar tribal traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the religious interpretations by Afghanistan's
Taliban rulers are more a reflection of tribal traditions than of
the teachings of Islam. They say Islam extols the value of
education for both men and women and has no objection to music or
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The critics are especially bothered by the forcible imposition
of Taliban ways on everyone under the militia's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of force is against Islam's spirit. We should win
people by love and reasoning,'' said Qibla Ayaz, an Islamic studies
professor at Pakistan's Peshawar University.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's tribal region, however, is increasingly embracing the
Taliban version of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In April, more than 2,000 armed Taliban followers went on a
rampage in Mirali, smashing TV sets and burning hundreds of audio
and video tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ''All men keep weapons here, but the Taliban outnumbered
shopkeepers,'' said Mohammed Turrab, who repairs tape recorders.
''All music and video shops have stayed closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Zar Gul, a tribal elder who supports the Taliban, said the
campaign against television and music was ''just a beginning toward
the goal of Islamic law's enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Television and music are evil,'' Gul said. ''They should have
no place in a Muslim society because they promote obscenity and
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Taliban leaders have formed a parallel
administration in some parts of Pakistan's tribal region, said
Shaharyar Bangash, an official of a foreign-financed aid group, the
National Research and Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Taliban are winning supporters because national
governments have ignored the impoverished and backward region. Less
than 6 percent of the area's people can read and write, compared
with the national average of 45 percent. Each acre of agricultural
land must support nearly seven people, three times the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Mushtaq Jadoon, a senior government official, dismissed
suggestions a parallel Taliban administration has sprung up.
</P>
<P>
   ''In parts of the tribal area, people decided voluntarily to
curb social evils,'' he said. ''But we have asked clerics to
approach us with complaints of obscenity, drugs or liquor instead
of taking a direct action, and they say they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the tribal belt supports the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes no sense that things that are allowed elsewhere in
the country are considered a crime here,'' said Mohammed Sadiq, a
truck driver in Mirali.
</P>
<P>
   He said some people have taken to surreptitiously watching
television at night, sneaking out in the darkness to erect a TV
antenna and taking it down before daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we're afraid,'' Sadiq added.
</P>
<P>
   In the tribal town of Zargari, 80 miles south of Peshawar,
Taliban supporters are in firm control. Residents have been ordered
to smash their TV sets or sell them to people elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ajab Khan Orakzai, principal of Zargari's religious school, said
harsh punishments are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can check wayward people only through a stick,'' he said.
''Islamic punishments, like chopping hands and feet of criminals as
is done in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, are the best way to clean
the society.''

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Regains Some Authority  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland regained a
measure of self-rule today, giving the province's Protestant and
Catholic leaders another chance to achieve a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   Britain handed back powers at midnight (7:00 p.m. EDT) Monday to
the four-party Cabinet and the Assembly created as part of a
landmark 1998 peace agreement that envisioned a Catholic-Protestant
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope these institutions will take root,'' Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble said Monday during a news conference at
Stormont, the government's Belfast headquarters. ''Certainly, for
our part we will do everything we can to maximize the opportunity
here for people.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in six months that Britain has ended its
27 years of direct rule and returned power to local hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists' narrow approval Saturday of a return to
Catholic-Protestant power-sharing cleared the way for Britain to
restore the administrative authority it suspended in February just
11 weeks into its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's top minister for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson,
suspended the power-sharing administration -- launched in December --
after the Irish Republican Army refused to make any disarmament
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA broke the impasse three weeks ago, promising to begin
putting its weapons ''beyond use'' -- a euphemism for disarming -- if
power-sharing resumed.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Trimble narrowly managed to persuade his badly
divided party to give the IRA a chance to live up to its pledge.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Trimble warned the IRA that it must deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, leader of the province's major Catholic party,
the pacifist Social Democratic and Labor Party, warned of
disastrous consequences if the newly restored administration wasn't
able to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the toleration of people on the ground wouldn't wear
it again,'' said Mallon, the most senior Catholic in the newly
restored Cabinet. ''The credibility factor would be destroyed if
there was another cessation of the institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and Mallon met Monday to prepare for the second transfer
of power. The full Cabinet was scheduled to meet Thursday to get
back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Northern Ireland's unlikely local coalition succeeds
will depend largely on IRA actions.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party declined to speculate on when the
IRA would begin to reveal any of its secret weapons dumps to
international inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities must also deal with reforming Northern Ireland's
police force and with potentially divisive questions such as
whether to fly Britain's Union Jack flag over government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, reputedly a former IRA chief of staff, said
he was hopeful that political leaders would make the new authority
stick this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Political leaders need to reflect the reality that there is a
great opportunity for us all,'' said McGuinness, who is due to
resume work as Sinn Fein's education minister in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to build a future for everybody. The question is, are
we up to that task? I think we are. I think we can get this
right.''

<HEADLINE> Arson Eyed in Abortion Clinic Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Investigators say a weekend fire that
damaged an abortion clinic likely was the work of an arsonist.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had no suspects in the blaze that broke out at 10
p.m. Sunday at the Concord Feminist Health Center. The center was
closed at the time, but damage was estimated at several thousand
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hadn't pinpointed what caused the fire, but police
Lt. Paul Murphy said Monday that it was probably set.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the nature of the facility the probability is fairly
high that it was targeted, as opposed to having been just ...
random,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were stationed at the clinic Monday, which was closed for
the Memorial Day holiday. It was uncertain when the clinic would
reopen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second fire at the clinic, which also has been a site
of frequent protests.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1989 a fire was set the night the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld a Missouri law prohibiting abortions from being performed at
public facilities or by government employees. There was only minor
damage and the arsonist never was caught.

Acquittal Sought for Accused Iranian Jews
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- The lawyers for 10 Iranian Jews charged with spying for
Israel closed their case Monday, arguing the accused should be acquitted because
of insufficient evidence. ''If the court is not politically influenced, the
judge will have no choice but to clear all the charges against the defendants,''
lawyer and spokesman for the defense team, Esmail Naseri, told reporters and
relatives of the defendants outside the court in this southern Iranian city. The
case now turns to the prosecution side, which is led by the judge.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Smoking, Gum Disease  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- More than half of the cases of severe gum disease
in U.S. adults may be linked to cigarette smoking, according to
government researchers who suggest that a main cause of tooth loss
could be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been known that smoking can help cause gum disease,
but this is the first national study to show how widespread the
problem is, said Dr. Scott Tomar, a researcher with the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Current smokers were about four times more likely than people
who never smoked to have periodontitis, but ex-smokers who had
abstained for 11 years faced no increased risk, according to Tomar,
whose findings were published in the May issue of the Journal of
Periodontology.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 52.8 percent of periodontitis in the study was
attributed to current and former smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Caton, president of the American Academy of Periodontology,
called the numbers ''staggering'' and said the study should
''compel even more dental care providers to get involved in tobacco
cessation efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodontitis, advanced gum disease that destroys the tissue and
bone surrounding the teeth, is generally caused by bacteria
contained in plaque buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe smoking causes damage that makes the gums
more vulnerable to bacterial infection. Tobacco can suppress the
body's immune system, impeding its ability to fight infection. It
also reduces blood flow to the gums, depriving them of oxygen and
nutrients that allow gums to stay healthy, Tomar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the functions of gums is to prevent underlying bone
from being destroyed. If you reduce the ability of cells to repair,
you will over time lose support for the tooth'' and tooth loss may
result, said Tomar, who studied government health data on 12,329
people.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five percent of the study subjects with periodontitis were
current smokers and 21.8 percent were former smokers. Current
smokers of more than 1{ packs of cigarettes a day were nearly six
times more likely than nonsmokers to have periodontitis. Those who
smoked less than half a pack daily were almost three times more
likely to have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking and periodontitis were both more common in black men and
low-income adults -- findings in line with U.S. Surgeon General
David Satcher's report last week on a ''silent epidemic'' of oral
disease in minorities and low-income Americans. Tobacco use was one
of the factors blamed for the problem in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Winn, a specialist in dental disease and oral cancer at
the National Cancer Institute, called Tomar's findings
''complementary'' with Satcher's report.
</P>
<P>
   She said the study does a good job of outlining yet another
reason to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tobacco prevention and cessation will be critical in reducing
periodontal disease,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Lazio, though new to national spotlight, is old hand at politics  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY SHORE, N.Y. (AP) -- He certainly didn't have the regal
political upbringing of a Kennedy, a Bush, or even Al Gore, but in
his own way, Rep. Rick Lazio appears to have spent much of his life
preparing for his moment.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an aide to a Suffolk County Republican chairman,
Enrico Anthony Lazio has burst onto the national media scene,
picking up the torch after ailing New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
dropped out of the U.S. Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the path to political stardom for the little-known,
four-term congressman and former county legislator winds back at
least three decades. Old friends remember Lazio, 42, as always
serious and always interested in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick was kind of born into the political process,'' said Edwin
''Buzz'' Schwenk, the former Suffolk GOP chairman who recalls a
teen-age Lazio attending Republican functions with his parents in
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd be there on Election Night, running around with chalk in
hand, putting the vote totals up on the blackboard, doing whatever
was needed,'' Schwenk said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's father, Anthony Lazio, was an aide to Schwenk,
responsible for organizing fund-raisers that brought such GOP
heavyweights as Ronald Reagan, John Connolly and Spiro Agnew into
Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick picked this up from his father,'' Schwenk said. ''Seeing
all this as a youngster, that was kind of how it happened, I
suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Suffolk County Executive John V.N. Klein also said his
earliest memories of the younger Lazio were ''being in tow with
Tony'' at GOP functions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had I known he was someday going to be a U.S. Senate
candidate, I might have treated him better back then,'' Klein
joked.
</P>
<P>
   A 1976 graduate of West Islip High School, Lazio went on to
Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, then American University Law School
in Washington, D.C. He joined the Suffolk County district
attorney's office in 1983, staying five years before moving into
private practice.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for a seat on the Suffolk County Legislature in 1989 and
beat Democrat Thomas Downey in the 1992 Congressional election, a
victory over an 18-year incumbent that made Lazio a star in Long
Island politics.
</P>
<P>
   Colton Johnson, who as dean at Vassar knew Lazio, said he's not
surprised Lazio gravitated to a career in public service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have seemed entirely likely from the guy I knew
here,'' he said. ''I had no doubt when I saw him the other day
(announcing his Senate candidacy) that he was one of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that despite Vassar's ''image as a quite liberal
institution,'' there also is a tradition of conservative thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many years, we've published a conservative journal,''
Johnson said, although he could not recall if Lazio ever
contributed.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kittrie, a professor at the American University School
of Law, described Lazio as ''serious-minded'' and ''deliberate.''
Kittrie said Lazio has the habit of keeping up contacts -- a skill
for any good politician.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once or twice, I'd be on a shuttle to New York when all of a
sudden I'd hear his cheerful voice,'' Kittrie said. ''He always
comes over and chats with me, something that I think shows that he
obviously cares about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cohen, the chief assistant district attorney in Suffolk
County, recalled his colleague as ''an excellent prosecutor.''
Lazio worked in the DA's rackets bureau, helped craft anti-crime
legislation and became spokesman for the DA's office, a role that
put him on television announcing indictments or convictions.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lazio's best friends is Manhattan attorney Mike
Moriarity. The two met in law school, and Moriarity introduced
Lazio to his sister, Patricia Moriarity, who became the
congressman's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Moriarity says that as a student, Lazio was a serious guy who
''always knew where he wanted to go'' -- into political life. Even
then, Moriarity said, ''he knew he wanted to be a local
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also had another youthful experience -- courtesy of his
parents, both World War II veterans -- that would prepare him for a
politician's regular chore.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would always take him to the Memorial Day parades, the
Veterans Day parades,'' Moriarity said. ''He's very comfortable
with interacting with veterans and veterans' organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwenk, the former GOP boss, said Lazio's father, who died in
1985, would be his son's biggest cheerleader today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his father would be jumping through hoops, going
bananas,'' Schwenk said. ''He'd be so overjoyed at this -- a thrill
times a hundred.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Begins Trip to Europe  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's trip to Europe this week
begins with political consultations in Portugal and ends a
continent away in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic still trying to
shake off the economic and social legacies of communism.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Clinton collects a statesmanship prize in Germany
and engages in summitry in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Washington on Monday night for Lisbon, Portugal,
where he was meeting with the president and prime minister today.
Clinton planned to spend three days in Portugal, which holds the
European Union's rotating presidency. He also was scheduled to
address researchers, scientists and students at a science park.
</P>
<P>
   Finding ways to enhance Internet commerce and containing the
spread of AIDS, especially in Africa, will top the agenda of talks
between Clinton and Portuguese officials.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has long experience working on the AIDS problem in
Africa through its five former colonies there, Angola, Mozambique,
Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration recently announced it now regards the
world AIDS epidemic, which is particularly acute in Africa, as a
threat to U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton will attend a summit meeting of the United
States and the European Union at Queluz Palace outside Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue our work with our European allies for peace
and freedom to make their sacrifice matter,'' Clinton said during
Memorial Day observances Monday at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that his trip marks the first visit of an American
president to Berlin since the city became the capital of a unified
Germany and the first time an American president will address a
democratically elected legislature in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world of today would not be recognized by those who lived
at the beginning of the Cold War,'' Clinton said. ''Old adversaries
have become allies, dictatorships have become democracies. Europe
is more peaceful and united, the communism we fought to contain has
collapsed, reformed or been discredited around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aachen, Germany, Clinton will be awarded the International
Charlemagne Prize, presented annually to a person who has worked
toward European unity. In Berlin he will attend with leaders of a
dozen other countries a summit on ''third way'' politics hosted by
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The idea is to consider alternatives
to the traditional liberal and conservative approaches to
government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will journey on to Russia for weekend talks with the new
president, Vladimir Putin, and then travel June 5 to the Ukraine
for a meeting with President Leonid Kuchma before departing for
Washington that night.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been lowering expectations for the Russian
summit, saying Clinton does not expect to win any new arms control
agreements. However, White House officials have emphasized that
Clinton is president through the rest of this year and have
rejected George W. Bush's request that Clinton refrain from signing
an arms control pact before he leaves office. Bush is the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touched on the national security implications of his
visit Monday, but also put change in Russia in more sweeping
context.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will visit Russia, our former adversary with whom we are
trying so hard to build a new partnership and a safer world,''
Clinton said at Arlington. ''Russia has just seen its first
transition from one democratically elected government to another in
a thousand years of history.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Salute Military Veterans  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CURRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore, mostly putting
aside presidential campaign issues for a day, focused on patriotism
during Memorial Day speeches to audiences composed largely of
military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush saluted veterans' sacrifices in Killeen, home to nearby
Fort Hood and hub of an area with a high concentration of retired
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, recalled his own Army days in Vietnam during an
appearance in the small town of Elizabeth, Pa., which lost six sons
in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people braved temperatures that reached into the 90s
to see Bush take the flag-filled stage at a downtown amphitheater
in his first visit to the community as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was introduced as a former Texas Air National Guard
pilot, Bush did not refer to his stateside military service during
the Vietnam years. He noted that the area of the state was home to
many war heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for serving our country. You make us all proud to be
Americans,'' the presumed Republican presidential nominee said.
''Whatever it is about Texas that produces these veterans, whatever
it is about America, that thing is sacred. We must never lose it.
We must always honor it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic nominee for president, asked for a
show of hand from veterans of the Korean War, World War II and the
Persian Gulf War during an appearance before a crowd of about 500
in Elizabeth, a town of 1,600 people in western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking directly to the veterans in his audience, the vice
president said: ''You have that bond with those you served with.
You feel the same feelings, thought the same things, you made the
same sacrifices. Of course, some sacrificed a whole lot more than
others, and today we particularly honor those who made the ultimate
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose to visit Allegheny County because, said Lou Lignelli,
district director for Democratic Rep. Frank Mascara, it has one of
the nation's highest concentrations of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, introduced by Army buddy Bob Delabar, spoke of his service
in Vietnam, where he spent five months as an Army journalist that
he has said included brushes with enemy fire. He said Monday that
the duty didn't in any way match what was done by those being
honored on Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a reporter, and when I went into the field I carried a
pencil and an M-16,'' he said. ''But anybody who has seen those
that made the greatest sacrifices and have met their families ...
hears the famous phrase that was delivered here in the commonwealth
of Pennsylvania by Abraham Lincoln about 'the last full measure of
devotion' -- you hear that phrase in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, surrounded by flags, local dignitaries and a band from
Fort Hood, paid homage to war heroes of the past while emphasizing
that the nation should take steps to honor their commitment in the
future. That can be done by maintaining a well-equipped, well-paid
military, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States remains ''the bright signal in a dark night,''
the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us resolve that our country will always be prepared to
protect our interests. Let us resolve to keep faith with our past
by being vigilant in our time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bush planned to discuss military readiness at a Veterans
of Foreign Wars post in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was traveling to Milwaukee to accept the endorsement of the
League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Lobby for Capitol Tours  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ah, the signs that summer is near: blooming
flowers, sunny skies, hurried lawmakers and, of course, tourists.
At the U.S. Capitol, after all, tourists are as much a springtime
rite as the annual budget battles.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder when Capitol administrators moved to cut back
visitors' hours in the historic building, lobbyists representing
tour operators got to work.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an agreement reached earlier this month that
keeps the Capitol open in the evening until June 15, when the peak
period of mostly student visitors ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''It created the biggest brouhaha I've ever had in terms of
personal interest and response,'' said former Nevada Rep. Jim
Santini, now a lobbyist for the Lexington, Ky.-based National Tour
Association, which represents 4,000 tour operators.
</P>
<P>
   NTA President Mark Hoffmann said the victory shows ''the effect
of grass-roots lobbying efforts by NTA members.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the Capitol had been open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. from
March 1 to Aug. 31 to accommodate the peak tourist season in
Washington. During the other months, the Capitol closes to tours at
4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officials figured that the later hours would help ease tourist
congestion by spreading tours throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, the Capitol Management Board decided to close
the Capitol at 6 p.m. during the peak season both as a cost-saving
measure and after noticing a drop in late evening tours.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of people taking advantage of the 6 to 8 period
wasn't nearly as big as the number during the prime hours,'' said
Ted Daniel, director of the Capitol Guide Service. Prime hours are
between 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. when between 10,000 to 15,000 tourists
enter the Capitol, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was when tour operators mobilized.
</P>
<P>
   Santini sprang into action soon after receiving a call from a
concerned operator in late February and launched what he calls ''a
pretty aggressive grass-roots network appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   They visited congressional offices. They wrote letters. They
made phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congressmen said 'We didn't know it was shut down.' Not only
did we not get any notice, nobody received any notice,'' Santini
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators argued that closing the Capitol early would
affect more than 38,000 visitors expected to take advantage of the
6 p.m. to 8 p.m. time slot during May and June.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, thousands of students visit the
Capitol, particularly during the months of April, May and June, as
part of their civics classes and many of those groups have had
their itineraries planned for months, Santini said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to me an imperative that certainly during this peak
period of visitation to do everything we could to accommodate the
nation's students in their opportunity to learn and to study
firsthand the seat of government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the management board, which included the
Senate and House sergeant at arms along with the Capitol architect,
a compromise was reached to keep the Capitol open until 8 p.m.
during the week until June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators will examine the visitor numbers to determine
whether later hours are needed next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's perfect,'' teacher Ron Miller said of the Capitol visit.
His students from the Archer School for Girls in Los Angeles get to
see firsthand ''all the historic events that took place that formed
our nation and how important it is we have a judicial system.''

<HEADLINE> Briton Heads for N. Pole in Balloon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A British adventurer floated over the polar
ice cap Monday in a bid to be the first person to fly over the
North Pole in a balloon, his supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   David Hempelman-Adams, 44, lifted off from Longyearbyen, the
main town on Norway's Svalbard islands, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest fear is to have to land in the Arctic Ocean,'' he
was quoted as telling the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet before he took
off. He said there would be little chance of surviving a crash in
the icy waters he has now successfully flown over.
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt to fly in a balloon from Svalbard to the North
Pole, in 1897, ended in tragedy for a Swedish expedition when the
three flyers died after three months on the ice when their balloon
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Hempelman-Adams told the newspaper that he hoped to complete the
600-mile solo flight in about four days in the 80-foot-tall helium
balloon. From there, he would either land or attempt to fly on to
Canada, depending on wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
   One of his greatest challenges will be to withstand temperatures
down to 76 degrees below zero as he rides in an open wicker basket.

<HEADLINE> Logging Co. Seeks Tree Plantations  </HEADLINE>
By DON THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMINO, Calif. (AP) -- For the last 20 years, while other logging
companies retrenched or relocated, Sierra Pacific Industries
quietly grew into the second-largest private landowner in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   It owns 1.52 million acres of Northern California, timberland
stretching more than 350 miles from Mount Shasta to Yosemite
National Park. Last year, Forbes magazine listed company owner
Archie Aldis ''Red'' Emmerson as the 161st richest American.
</P>
<P>
   The company's days of anonymous expansion are over.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Pacific plans to convert much of its land into tree
plantations over the next century or so, angering environmentalists
and property owners. The plan would abandon the industry's practice
of going into forests and selectively cutting the best trees for
lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company plans to clear-cut much of the timber,
meaning large tracts would be felled, and plant new trees
''plantation style.''
</P>
<P>
   There have already been protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public doesn't want to see large-scale logging on public
land,'' said Scott Hoffman Black, director of the Sierra Nevada
Forest Protection Campaign. ''They're making up for it by
overharvesting on their private land.''
</P>
<P>
   State forestry officials say Sierra Pacific's clear-cutting grew
156 percent, or 14,514 acres, from 1998 to '99. Acreage clear-cut
rose from 943 acres in 1992 to 23,823 acres last year.
</P>
<P>
   State logging regulators are concerned about the new plan and
have increased monitoring, California Department of Forestry
spokesman Louis Blumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, clear-cutting is not necessarily worse than the
selective logging that prevailed in the Sierra Nevada for decades,
Blumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public doesn't like clear-cutting because of the way it
looks,'' Blumberg said. ''(But) with clear-cutting, the impact
happens once and the land recovers. With selective cutting, you
keep going back and back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Pacific maintains it has no choice but to cut down much
of its timber and start over. Emmerson declined to be interviewed,
but company foresters say a century of selective cutting by logging
companies has emptied the forests of good timber.
</P>
<P>
   Bold steps are nothing new for the 71-year-old Emmerson.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a changing political climate that would make it tougher
to log on public land, Emmerson in 1987 risked his company's future
to buy 522,000 acres of railroad timber for $460 million. He put
all 10 of his lumber mills up as collateral and bought enough land
to make him the state's largest timberland owner.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as old-growth timber from national forests grew scarcer
during the '90s, Emmerson retooled his mills to handle the smaller
trees that come from younger forests. He built new mills and
installed new and automated equipment across the company.
</P>
<P>
   At the Camino plant, three-dimensional scanners determine how to
get the most valuable wood from each tree before the first
robot-operated, laser-guided sawblade bites into a log. Waste
woodshavings that used to be disposed of now produce electricity
and steam for the company's computerized wood-drying kilns.
</P>
<P>
   The company's efficiency draws grudging admiration from critics
such as Felice Pace of the Klamath Forest Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a tremendous amount of respect for this company -- not
admiration, respect -- because they're very effective,'' he said.
''Rather than maximize the amount of wood that comes out of the log
... they maximize the amount of money that comes out of the log.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Pacific also started manufacturing more sophisticated
wood products such as moldings, door and window parts. The four
plants where they are produced account for a third of its sales and
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although mills once operated by hundreds of employees now run
with only a handful, the company's overall employment has increased
from 2,400 to 3,500 over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company is negotiating a land swap that
environmentalists hope will prevent logging on Sierra Pacific land
near a popular hiking and camping area along the South Yuba River.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has also had to adjust to California logging
laws that are stricter than those in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the company has done its best to bend those rules or
in some cases get around them. It has been cited by the U.S. Forest
Service three times since 1995 for illegally removing government
timber. The company blames contract loggers for what it
acknowledges were mistakes, in some cases reported by Sierra
Pacific itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, they turned themselves in, and yes, they paid a fine --
but we've lost those trees,'' said Charlotte Fox of the Government
Accountability Project, a Washington, D.C.-based environmental
group. ''It's kind of like, 'We're going to cut down anything we
want and then we'll pay you for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a plantation system, modern methods can substantially raise
per-acre timber production, company officials say. Those methods
include culling trees to precise spacing, using healthier,
genetically selected trees and applying herbicides to thin
competition that might stunt saplings' growth, similar to growing
plants in a garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been accused of cut-and-run, but really we're cutting
less than we're growing so we can build our inventory to sustain
ourselves,'' said Tim Feller, a Sierra Pacific district manager.

<HEADLINE> China's Self-Made Tycoon Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Mou Qizhong, a businessman once billed as China's
richest man, was sentenced today to life in prison for fraud, state
television said.
</P>
<P>
   Mou, president of the Land Group, was convicted by the
Intermediate People's Court in Wuhan city, in central Hubei
province, of fraudulently using letters of credit, state television
reported. Land Group was fined $603,000 and an unspecified number
of Mou's business associates were also sentenced to prison terms,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Mou fascinated the Chinese press with his
flamboyant style that seemed to typify the frenetic changes and
enormous possibilities of China's reform era.
</P>
<P>
   Mou became famous in 1989 by swapping 500 freight cars of
factory-surplus socks, shoes and other goods for four Tu-154 Soviet
passenger planes, netting $25 million. He used his riches to fund
ventures that kept him in the public eye, from soccer clubs to a
North Pole scientific expedition.
</P>
<P>
   For some in China, Mou's downfall was a cautionary tale about
the difficulties private businesses face in a socialist system. For
others, it illustrated how weak accounting rules make it possible
for a person with grand schemes to pile up loans without making
money.
</P>
<P>
   State television reported that Mou's company turned to fraud
after it had trouble obtaining loans because of a government
squeeze on credit in 1995. It said the Land Group illegally
obtained 33 letters of credit from a Bank of China branch in Hubei.
</P>
<P>
   The case caused $35 million economic losses, the television
said. It said Mou was identified as a main culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Mou had pleaded innocent at his one-day trial last November. The
report did not say why the court needed six months to deliver its
verdict.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Defends Claim to 3rd Term  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Facing international pressure after his
lopsided re-election victory, President Alberto Fujimori went on
national television to defend his claim to a third term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Without identifying to whom he was referring, Fujimori said in
the appearance late Monday that there had been a campaign to
''satanize'' the electoral process and to ''misinform and disorient
the citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated that the election was fair and said he hoped he
would not disappoint Peruvians ''in initiating a more authentic
democracy'' in his next five years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential message came one day after a runoff election
that was boycotted by challenger Alejandro Toledo, marred by
clashes between demonstrators and police, and abandoned by
independent monitors who deemed the process unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department said in a statement Monday that the
election was not ''valid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No president emerging from such a flawed process can claim
legitimacy. The manner in which the Fujimori regime handled this
problem is a serious threat to the inter-American system and its
commitment to democracy,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   With 94.4 percent of the ballots counted Monday, Fujimori had
51.1 percent to Toledo's 17.4 percent. Another 30.3 percent of the
ballots were defaced.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the outcome was already rigged, Toledo had urged voters
to void their ballots, marking them with the words ''no to fraud.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Advocates To Eye Sex Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- At the end of the line for sex crime cases
are the so-called unfounded files.
</P>
<P>
   In them are attacks on women that are so random police are
stumped, accusations by children that are so wild they cannot be
used or recanted testimony by women against abusive husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Now Philadelphia police are taking a second look. Officials have
invited a handful of special victims' advocates to examine these
dead-end cases and make recommendations to police about ways they
can be revived.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed to be the first time a city's police department
has opened its sex crimes cases to scrutiny from victims' groups.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters say the openness will benefit future
investigations, police officials hope it will help improve the
image of the city's troubled sex crimes unit. Earlier this year,
the department admitted misreporting thousands of sexual assaults
over the past decade to make the city appear safer than it was.
</P>
<P>
   To help remedy the situation, police Commissioner John Timoney
ordered a review of thousands of old cases, added dozens of new
detectives and -- in a surprise concession -- allowed a handful of
advocates for women and children to review cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a conscious decision to blow the doors open. Will you
get blown apart sometimes? Sure,'' Timoney said. ''But the bad
stories will come out anyway, and this way all the information is
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Six legal experts and victims' advocates made three visits this
month to the special victims unit. The group sifted through about
100 rape and attempted rape cases from 1999 that were classified as
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   After the first two meetings, the group requested the full case
files for 20 cases. Last week, the group presented officials with
10 cases that the advocates thought needed to be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The names of victims and suspects were blocked out on the
initial reports; identities were included in the full reports, but
advocates agreed not to take notes or disclose identities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw some teen-agers who we thought maybe might have been
raped, who changed their story maybe because they were afraid of
getting in trouble,'' said Carol Tracy, executive director of the
Women's Law Project.
</P>
<P>
   The unique experiment yielded unprecedented dialogue with
police, advocates said. Police officials remembered specific cases
and sometimes discussed why a suspect was not interviewed or
promised to ask the investigator about re-interviewing a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they have taken many corrective measures,'' said
Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Joseph Mooney, a former internal affairs detective now
leading the special victims unit, said the outside guidance was
helpful and is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The advocates have worked with victims and cases similar to
this, so you get an insight into victims. You don't see that side
of it as clearly as you would or could on the police side,'' Mooney
said.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is evolving. Advocates want to study the city's
sexual assault cases and look for trends, such as the tendency for
Philadelphia's assault victims to be under age 18, Tracy said.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation developed after The Philadelphia Inquirer
reported last fall that thousands of sexual assault cases had been
improperly shelved since the sex crimes unit was founded in 1981.
Police officials confirmed that many were classified in a way that
helped deflate crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police, which had
criticized the use of outside review as relying on untrained
observers to do police work, recently reassessed its stance, noting
that bringing in knowledgeable victims' groups is a good way to
improve community relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Partnership between police and these groups is in line with
national and innovate thinking. You have a situation where police
gain expertise and information that they might not have on their
own,'' said John Firman, research director of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the open dialogue and access to police files is
helpful, especially for victims' groups, typically among the most
critical of police activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often in homicide cases, when they have a cold case, they'll
seek outside experts,'' said University of Pennsylvania professor
Ann Burgess, who has written six books about sex crime victims and
offenders. ''This is a little different, but what they are asking
is similar, 'Have you seen something here that we have missed?'''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Leader Seeks New Ruler  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The leader of armed rebels holding Fiji's
government hostage in parliament refused today to recognize the
authority of the country's new military ruler, and called on the
army to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   George Speight -- who led Fiji's coup attempt May 19 and holds
more than 30 hostages, including Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry --
questioned Commodore Frank Bainimarama's control over the military.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the parliamentary complex, Speight
claimed that only half the military supports Bainimarama and the
other half supports the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Speight is a member of the Fijian majority. He wants Chaudhry,
Fiji's first prime minister from the Indian minority, removed from
power and Indians barred from leading the country again.
</P>
<P>
   Fijians of Indian ancestry make up 44 percent of the population
of 813,000 on this Pacific Island, but control much of the nation's
commerce in this country 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   After declaring martial law and taking command of the country
late Monday, Fiji's new military rulers said they would begin
negotiations to free the hostages. The forces have not cracked down
on the rebels or stopped their supporters from entering parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama announced after assuming control that President Ratu
Sir Kamisese Mara had quit after running the country since the coup
began and Chaudhry was taken captive.
</P>
<P>
   Mara's resignation had been one of Speight's main demands and
led to hopes that the crisis would quickly be resolved and the
captives released. Speight also wants Fiji's 1997 constitution
scrapped and his self-styled Taukei civilian government installed.
Taukei is a nationalist Fijian movement.
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous Fijians blame the 1997 constitution for giving too
much political power to Fiji's ethnic Indian minority, which
controls many businesses in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Formalizing his powers, Bainimarama today revoked the 1997
constitution, but in a second decree said all laws in force under
that constitution would remain unchanged under martial rule.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution effectively was revoked the moment martial law
was declared and the decree was not seen as a major concession to
Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he would meet a delegation of senior army officers
today but would not negotiate with Bainimarama, whom he accused of
remaining loyal to Mara. The reason for Speight's opposition to
Mara, a fellow indigenous Fijian, was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Commodore Bainimarama is a lost cause,'' Speight said.
''I think he is so blinded by his allegiances to Ratu Mara that it
clouds his ability to take the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A 48-hour curfew imposed Monday was lifted early today, and the
streets of Fiji's capital, Suva, were calm, with many people
returning to their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Armed soldiers were stationed outside some government buildings
and manned roadblocks, but there appeared to be fewer roadblocks in
Suva than on Monday, and soldiers did not prevent Speight
supporters from entering parliament -- as Bainimarama had said they
would.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama's military previously had expressed support for
Mara, but the troops at first took little action. However, the day
after a mob supporting Speight killed a policeman and knocked Fiji
television off the air, the military called the curfew and declared
martial law.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the policeman was the first death in the hostage
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A former insurance salesman, Speight was fired last year by the
prime minister as chairman of two companies involved in managing
Fiji's lucrative timber trade. He had been appointed to both posts
by the previous government, in which his father was a senior
member.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and countries including Australia, New
Zealand and the United States have criticized Fijian forces for
failing to crack down on Speight and his allies. Sanctions have
been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer urged the
military to make way for civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the military as soon as possible -- and I don't mean by
that months later but as soon as possible -- to restore civilian and
democratic government, and we hope very much that this is going to
be a step toward that final outcome,'' Downer told Australia's Nine
Network television company.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Forces Leave Eritrea Areas  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopia said it withdrew its
forces today from parts of Eritrea captured along the western
front, saying Ethiopian troops had achieved their goals and had no
interest in holding on to the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The western front is only one of three areas where Ethiopia and
Eritrea have fought along their poorly demarcated border. Ethiopia
launched a punishing offensive May 12 along all fronts to take back
territory Eritrea captured earlier in the 2-year-old war.
</P>
<P>
   Selome Taddesse, Ethiopia's government spokeswoman, said that
after destroying the Eritrean army and recovering occupied
territory on the western front, Ethiopia troops had been withdrawn.
There has been no fighting along the western front for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''After successfully achieving their mission, the heroic
Ethiopian defense forces that had been controlling western Eritrea
since May 12 have withdrawn,'' Selome said. ''As the Ethiopian
government has reiterated on numerous occasions, it has no interest
in occupying sovereign Eritrean territory and, having achieved its
goals, it has withdrawn its troops accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers from both sides are expected to participate in
indirect peace talks today in Algeria to find a permanent solution
to the border dispute that has cost tens of thousands of lives.
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin's late arrival Monday in
Algiers forced their postponement.
</P>
<P>
   In Asmara on Monday, four Ethiopian MiG-23s swept in over the
international airport at midday, unleashing rockets and then bombs
on a military airstrip just west of the commercial runways.
</P>
<P>
   Two Eritrean MiG's took off in pursuit, with flames and black
and white smoke billowing into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Two civilians were wounded in the attack, said Eritrean
presidential spokesman Yemene Gebremeskel.

<HEADLINE> Army: 44 Die in Indonesia Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- At least 44 people were killed in an
armed raid on a mostly Christian village in the eastern Indonesian
province of North Maluku, an army chief said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   North Maluku military chief. Lt. Col. Sukarwo said suspected
Muslim militants attacked the village on Halmahera island before
dawn on Monday. In addition to the 44 killed in the attack, at
least 102 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarwo said the military believed the attackers came from a
neighboring island and were members of a Muslim fighting force
known as Lasker Jihad, or Holy War Troops. The group recently
arrived in the area from Indonesia's main island of Java.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's attack was almost identical to a pre-dawn raid last
week in the same area which left 34 civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Maluku's provincial capital of Ambon said another
17 people were killed on Tuesday on Halmahera. However, Sukarwo
could not confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   North Maluku, 1,600 miles northeast of Jakarta, and Maluku
provinces, collectively known as Spice Islands during the Dutch
colonial era, have been plagued by sectarian violence which first
broke out sixteen months ago. More than 2,500 people have died in
clashes since.
</P>
<P>
   Halmahera has been one of the worst-affected islands. About 800
people died in clashes there at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   A local priest on Halmahera, who identified himself only as
Hadi, said at least 52 Christians had died in the pre-dawn attack
Monday. He said many of those killed were slaughtered while they
slept. About 300 houses were also torched.
</P>
<P>
   An Islamic activist on nearby Ternate island, said at least
three Muslim attackers were also killed and seven others injured in
the raid, after the Christians started fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   Laskar Jihad is believed to have infiltrated more than 2,000
Islamic paramilitaries into the Malukus despite repeated assurances
by the government in Jakarta that they would be prevented from
fomenting trouble in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader Jafar Umar Thalib, who is believed to have close
ties to the former regime of ex-dictator Suharto, has vowed to wage
a holy war against the Christian community.

<HEADLINE> State holiday sought to remember Harriet Tubman  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In ceremonies across New York state Monday,
Harriet Tubman was remembered as a Civil War nurse, scout and spy
for the Union Army who helped hundreds of slaves find freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And while Tubman does not have official veteran status, veterans
here saluted her likeness on the Women Veteran's Memorial and
joined the call for a state holiday honoring the heroine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harriet Tubman is long overdue for honors from the state in
which she lived and where she is buried,'' reads a letter calling
on state officials to adopt a bill making March 10 ''Harriet Tubman
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   She ''devoted her life to the realization of the American credo,
'Liberty and Justice for all,''' the letter reads.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day gatherings in Queens, Syracuse, Binghamton, Buffalo
and the Bronx also celebrated the life of Tubman, who earned the
nickname ''Moses'' for her pivotal role in leading slaves to the
Underground Railroad -- a secret escape route used before the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by thousands of ''conductors'' who helped escapees get
from one hide-out to another on their way north, more than 100,000
slaves are estimated to have met freedom through the Underground
Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Deputy Speaker Arthur O. Eve, D-Buffalo, and
State Sen. Michael Nozzolio, R-Seneca Falls, have sponsored bills
calling for a Harriet Tubman state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany Monday, James Howe of the 369th Veterans' Association,
an association of black veterans named after the all black unit
that served in World War I, presented state officials with a stack
of petitions signed by 10,000 people calling for the March 10
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is thicker than the Manhattan phone book,'' Howe said,
''and on Tuesday we've got five more volumes going to the
governor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor's office did not immediately return
a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the measure would make Harriet Tubman day the 13th
official state holiday and the most recent since Martin Luther King
Jr. Day was created in 1985 in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Bachmann of the Women's Building, a feminist organization,
said an official day honoring Tubman would also be the first
holiday in the country named for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a brave woman who deserves the necessary recognition
that other historic figures have had,'' Bachmann said. ''With
10,000 signatures of people calling for this, it can't be too long
before politicians feel pressure to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   A pamphlet produced in support of the holiday by the Black
Women's Leadership Caucus describes Tubman as the first woman to
serve in active duty in the Armed Services and calls her the only
woman in American history to lead an armed attack during a state of
war.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Smith, vice president of the Black Nurses Association,
said Tubman was much more than a ''relentless and fearless
soldier,'' explaining how she created a nursing home in upstate New
York to care for freed slaves who fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I treat her as a mentor and role model; a woman of distinction
who I strive to emulate,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A day in Tubman's honor would be a celebration of ''freedom,
justice and equality,'' said Hayley Eaddy, who attended the Albany
commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a woman who had a major role in the building and
reconstruction of America.''	   
</P>
<P>
   Tubman died March 10, 1913 and is buried in Auburn, 23 miles
west of Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Out-of-state buyers snapping up vacation homes  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Aging baby boomers and beneficiaries of a strong
economy are
reviving the sale of second homes both in Connecticut and
nationwide.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real estate agents say more Americans are putting their
discretionary dollars into a vacation home and properties aren't
lasting long on the market as both demand and prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting several e-mails a day from people looking for
second homes,'' said Litchfield agent Frank Moss, of Landmark Real
Estate Co. ''We went through a pretty slow period 10 years ago when
nothing was moving. Today, it's booming.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss said a couple from New Jersey recently walked into his
Goshen office and paid $695,000 -- in cash -- for a three-bedroom
vacation home on Woodridge Lake. A week later a New York couple
paid the $995,000 asking price for a Litchfield Hills weekend home.
</P>
<P>
   Property also is at a premium on the Connecticut shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Years ago the majority of our buyers were coming down Route 9
from Hartford. But we are seeing more and more people coming up the
coast'' from New York, New Jersey and Fairfield County, said Sue
DiMeo, shoreline regional manager for William Raveis Home-Link in
Old Saybrook. ''We have a lot of land here and people are beginning
to discover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the second-home market has increased 9.3 percent since
1997, with 377,000 second homes purchased in 1999, according to the
National Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, demand is outpacing supply and driving up the
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The median sales price of a home in Madison, for example, was
$245,000 in 1999, 20 percent higher than in 1995. In Guilford, the
$210,000 median sales price of homes last year was an 18 percent
increase from 1995, and in Essex, the $207,000 median sales price
of homes in 1999 was 15 percent higher than 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the median sales price of second homes was $127,800
in 1999, a 29 percent increase since 1989, according to the
National Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller summer shoreline cottages have been snapped up and razed
to make way for half-million dollar, year-round second homes. For
example, on Maple Avenue in the Knollwood Beach section of Old
Saybrook, almost every fifth house is under renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone called and wanted a fixer-upper in the early 1990s
they had their pick. Not anymore,'' said agent Arlene Soden.
''There is absolutely nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Corwin family of New York recently settled on a vacation
home in Madison after years of vacationing in the Hamptons and Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were so sick of it,'' Pamela D'Arc Corwin said of the
crowds in the Hamptons. ''Everything was difficult. Getting into a
restaurant. Going to the movies. Unless you planned far in advance,
you didn't get to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spent one year on the Cape, and trying to get back and
forth was impossible,'' she said. ''One time it took my husband 10
hours to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Their $350,000 four-bedroom Madison home has views of the water
and beach rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we couldn't imagine going anywhere else,'' Corwin said.
''It's the perfect amount of time from the city. It's easy. It's
filled with kids. It's a real community with a real neighborhood.
To me, it's paradise.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Import Rules  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify
whether courts must defer to U.S. Customs Service rulings on
whether import duties should be paid on certain products.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear the Clinton administration's
argument that the Mead Corp. should have to pay such a fee for
importing loose-leaf daily planners.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court reversed a Customs Service decision that
required payment of the import duty. The appeals court said it did
not have to defer to the agency's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Mead, based in Dayton, Ohio, imports the daily planners that
contain a calendar, sections for daily notes, phone numbers and
addresses, and a note pad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Customs Service classified the planners as ''bound
diaries'' on which a 4 percent duty was owed. Mead argued that the
loose-leaf planners were neither bound nor diaries and therefore it
owed no duty.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of International Trade ruled for the government in
1998, but last year the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit reversed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said it was not required to defer to such
decisions by the Customs Service because they were not formal
regulations and only applied to a specific case. The appeals court
agreed with Mead that the daily planners should not be considered
''bound diaries,'' and that the company did not owe a duty on them.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers said
the appeals court's refusal to defer to the agency's rulings ''has
left both importers and the Customs Service without effective
guidelines for a wide range of transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will lead to ''expensive customs litigation and
unpredictable outcomes,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Mead's lawyers said such Customs Service determinations
traditionally have not been given the deference courts must give to
other federal agency decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The case is U.S. vs. Mead Corp., 99-1434.

<HEADLINE> Court Stays Out of Medicare Fight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today stayed out of a
dispute between the federal government and 181 hospitals that say
they were underpaid for care they provided to particularly
high-cost Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away the hospitals' argument
that federal law sets a minimum payment for such high-cost
patients. Their appeal said the government underpaid hospitals
nationwide by $342 million during fiscal 1985 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Further underpayments through the 1990s might total $3 billion,
the hospitals contend.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, which has provided health insurance for the elderly
since 1965, was overhauled in 1983 to reimburse hospitals at fixed
rates based partly on the hospital's location and the type of
illness treated.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays extra for patients whose treatment is particularly
expensive. Federal law says the payments must be 5 percent to 6
percent of the total projected payments for that year.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services has interpreted that
to mean such estimates are to be made at the beginning of a fiscal
year, but the final amounts may turn out to be more or less than 5
percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The supplemental amount for fiscal 1985 was 3 percent of the
total payment and 4.4 percent in fiscal 1986. The hospitals said
that meant hospitals nationwide were shortchanged by $241 million
in 1985 and $101 million the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals contended the law requires the government to
adjust the payments at the end of the year. After the government
refused to do so, the hospitals sued.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled in January 1998 the law did require such
retroactive payments but said the government properly used 1981
data to set reimbursement rates for 1985 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
reversed on both questions.
</P>
<P>
   The law on the percent 5 to 6 percent payment is unclear, said
the court in deferring to the government's decision that
retroactive payments were not required. However, the court ordered
the government to either explain why 1984 data were not used to set
reimbursement rates, or to recalculate those rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the hospitals' lawyers said the
law was clear and the appeals court should not have deferred to the
government's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said the appeal was premature.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Los Angeles County vs. Shalala, 99-1421.

<HEADLINE> Court Sidesteps Phone Subsidy Fight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to referee a
dispute over federal rules intended to keep telephone service
affordable in high-cost areas and to subsidize Internet hookups for
schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a paging
service company.
</P>
<P>
   The court took no action on similar appeals still pending from
AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and local phone company GTE.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission long has had rules
designed to ensure affordable ''universal service'' for everyone,
including people in rural and other high-cost areas. Before 1996,
the rules involved shifting costs to other customers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, designed to
open local phone markets to full competition. Because competition
could erode the universal-service subsidies, Congress directed the
FCC to write new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The law also introduced new subsidies for Internet access in
schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The commission adopted rules requiring all telecommunications
companies to contribute to the universal-service subsidies, based
on their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided that phone carriers' contributions to
high-cost customers should be based only on the carriers'
interstate revenue. But their contributions to the Internet hookup
program were to be based on both interstate and in-state revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidies given to companies serving high-cost customers would
be based mainly on the future cost of providing such service, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Various telecommunications companies challenged the rules,
including Celpage, a company that provides paging services in
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the rules
last July. It rejected Celpage's argument that paging companies
should not have to help pay for subsidies, and it generally upheld
the rules for subsidies to high-cost areas.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court said the contributions for Internet
hookups could be based only on companies' interstate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, Celpage said requiring it to help pay the
subsidies was an unconstitutional tax because it cannot receive
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Celpage vs. FCC, 99-1072.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 82; Nasdaq Climbs 104  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher in early trading
today as investors returned from a three-day weekend ready to look
for bargains. Technology and telecom stocks led the gains.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 82.25 at 10,381.49.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 104.85 at 3,309.96, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 16.68 at 1,394.70.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications sector received a lift from the news that
France Telecom is buying Britain's Orange from Vodafone Air Touch
PLC for about $37.6 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom shares rose 7\ to 138\ on the New York Stock
Exchange, and Vodafone Air Touch rose 3 3/16 to 45 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raised speculation that more global mergers will follow
in the telecom industry. Alcatel rose 6 1/16 to 55 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of high-tech industry leaders also rose. Sun Microsystems
rose 3\ to 76{ and Cisco Systems rose 2} to 57 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Traders attributed the gains to bargain-hunting. Many
high-profile technology stocks have been under pressure in the past
two weeks as investors have wondered whether their future earnings
will justify their relatively high share prices. Most analysts
expect rising interest rates to eventually take a toll on corporate
earnings as it become more expensive to borrow money to finance
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies could be hurt if their old-economy clients
curb spending on technology while they weather rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose despite an economic report that suggested six rate
increases by the Federal Reserve in the past year have not yet
sapped consumer sentiment. Consumer confidence jumped sharply in
May, approaching the all-time high it reached in January, the
Conference Board said.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were choosing to gloss over the consumer confidence
report and look ahead to a pair of reports due out later this week.
On Thursday, the National Association of Purchasing Management will
issue a report on activity in the industrial economy during May.
And on Friday, the Labor Department will issue its May employment
report.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 105.49 million
shares, ahead of Friday's sluggish pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 7.35 to 464.72.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average slipped 0.1 percent.
European indexes were mostly higher. Germany's DAX index was up 1.7
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 2.2 percent, and France's
CAC-40 was up 1.8 percent.

By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The United States is planning some unilateral
steps against Peru to protest what it considers the flawed
electoral process in that country, a State Department official said
today.
</P>
<P>
   The official, asking not to be identified, said the
administration is reviewing its policies toward Peru in
international lending organizations. Bilateral aid programs, both
military and non-military, also are being examined, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The official acknowledged that an across the board aid cut is
not being considered because of the impact that would have on
Peru's majority poor population.
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs not likely to be affected are those that
support health clinics and assist farmers in gaining access to
markets for their products, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that it would be difficult to cut back on the U.S.
counterdrug program in Peru because that issue is a high
administration priority.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has been a key ally in the
drug war. The latest State Department report on the drug situation
worldwide, issued in March, says Peru ''has made enormous strides
toward its goal of eliminating illegal coca cultivation.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. counterdrug assistance for fiscal year 2000 is estimated at
$48 million. The administration hopes to maintain that level in the
next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Figures on other aspects of the U.S. assistance program in Peru
were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Peru's cooperation in the drug war, the administration
believes it is important to send a strong message of disapproval
over Peru's authoritarian turn, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a complacent U.S. attitude could tempt
anti-democratic forces elsewhere in the region to move against
constitutional governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States permanent council is
expected to approve a resolution on Wednesday condemning Peru's
action, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Court To Study Maritime Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Tuesday it will use a
dispute from Illinois to resolve what the justices were told are
conflicting legal rules for maritime businesses on different
stretches of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will decide whether a man who says he hurt his
back while working on a ship can sue the ship's owner in state
court even though the owner previously filed a federal lawsuit
seeking to limit its liability for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   James Lewis was a resident of Madison County, Ill., when on
March 17, 1998, he allegedly hurt his back while working as a
deckhand on the M/V Karen Michelle. The ship is owned by Lewis &AMP;
Clark Marine Inc., which is based in Granite City, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the accident, Lewis &AMP; Clark Marine filed a federal
lawsuit seeking to limit its liability for the accident to no more
than $450,000, the ship's stated worth. The lawsuit, filed with a
federal trial judge in Missouri, invoked the federal Limitation of
Liability Act, which allows shipowners to seek such limits and to
select the court.
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, Lewis sued the shipping company in an
Illinois state court. He alleged that Lewis &AMP; Clark Marine was
negligent and that the ship was not seaworthy.
</P>
<P>
   After being informed of Lewis' state court lawsuit, the federal
judge dismissed the limitation lawsuit that had been filed by the
shipping company.
</P>
<P>
   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judge's
decision, and ruled that the federal trial judge should proceed
with the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Lewis' lawyer said the appeals
court's ruling conflicts with those of other federal appeals
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result,'' argued Roy Dripps of Wood River, Ill.,
''vessels plying the Mississippi River cross into a different set
of maritime rules when they pass into Mississippi from Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal said the 8th Circuit court's ruling ''erected a
conflicting set of maritime rules over the country's primary inland
waterway which vary, not with the behavior of the parties, but with
the location of the vessel within a particular (judicial)
circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lewis &AMP; Clark Maritime had urged the justices to
reject Lewis' appeal.
</P>
<P>
   They called the appeals court's ruling ''a straightforward
application of traditional and unremarkable principles of maritime
law to a non-traditional situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Lewis vs. Lewis &AMP; Clark Maritime Inc., 99-1331.

<HEADLINE> New York GOP prepares to nominate little-known congressman as Giuliani sub </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Promising to take his campaign against
Hillary Rodham Clinton ''block by block'' and ''house by house,''
Rep. Rick Lazio today prepared to accept the U.S. Senate nomination
of Republican leaders gathered in Buffalo for their state
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be in every county, in every community and in every
neighborhood,'' the little-known congressman from Long Island told
reporters before breakfast with a small group of supporters at a
Buffalo restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's withdrawal from the race just 11 days
ago to deal with prostate cancer opened the door for the
boyish-looking, four-term congressman. His candidacy was quickly
supported by Gov. George Pataki and other Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a true hometown boy versus somebody from another state,''
said state GOP Chairman William Powers, stressing a favorite
Republican theme used against Clinton -- that she had never lived in
the state before moving to New York in January -- on the eve of the
party's nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's formal nomination was to come late this afternoon at a
Buffalo hotel, a far cry from the sports arena in Albany that
Democrats packed with more than 10,000 people earlier this month as
they nominated the first lady for the seat being vacated by her
fellow Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have more than 2,000 people, which for us is great,''
Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel this morning, more than 200 state prison
guards protested their lack of a contract with the state, seeking
to send a message to Pataki by raining on Lazio's parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lazio, we vote!'' the protesters chanted.
</P>
<P>
   There was little suspense for the more than 400 GOP delegates.
The congressman's own schedule, issued Sunday, stated that at 4:30
p.m. Tuesday: ''Lazio to accept nomination at the New York state
GOP Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio lacks the star power of Clinton, he did embark on a
whirlwind pre-convention schedule that had him hitting all the
major Sunday morning news shows just one day after his formal
candidacy announcement. He then flew around the state and marched
in two Memorial Day parades on Monday before heading to a barbecue
at the Rochester-area home of Monroe County GOP Chairman Steve
Minarik.
</P>
<P>
   After staying the night in Rochester, Lazio planned a breakfast
with supporters in Buffalo this morning and a luncheon with
Republican women.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman was arriving in Buffalo literally with a
campaign battle scar. He tripped during a parade Monday on Long
Island, leaving him with a cut lip that required eight stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be the first of a few,'' quipped Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this lip it looks like I was kissing the grill,'' Lazio
joked at the Rochester barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   After being patched up, Lazio joined Giuliani in Queens for
another Memorial Day parade, their first campaign appearance
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's gotten off to an absolutely tremendous start, and if I
could judge by the reception here in northern Queens, he's going to
be a very very strong candidate. ... I'm going to do everything I
can to help him get elected,'' the New York City mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that, Giuliani was skipping the GOP state convention
so as not to upstage Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls, even before the Giuliani withdrawal, have
shown Clinton hovering in the mid-40 percentage range, a situation
that has given Republicans hope that Lazio can copy the
giant-killer role played by Pataki in 1994 when, as a little-known
state senator, he toppled three-term Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pataki, Lazio is from the suburbs surrounding New York City
and is considered a moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   GOP boss Powers said that while he expects a close race, he is
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's represented the people of New York, like his opponent
hasn't and he's paid New York state income taxes, like his opponent
hasn't,'' the party leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said they were happy to have Lazio instead of
Giuliani as their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's now going to be an issues-oriented campaign. It's no
longer going to be a celebrity campaign,'' Monroe County Executive
Jack Doyle said at the Rochester barbecue. ''With Giuliani and Mrs.
Clinton, it was going to turn into a celebrity issue, as to who
looked better and who had more celebrity friends and who was more
famous ... I think people are a little tired of the celebrity side
of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that Rick's in, there's some excitement and the feeling
he's really going to put his heart and soul into this race, whereas
it seemed that the mayor wanted the office but he didn't really
want to campaign for it,'' said Larry Staub, vice chairman of the
Monroe County GOP.

<HEADLINE> 'American Daughter' Adapted for TV  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A presidential appointee's personal misstep
is disclosed and the frenzy begins. Cameras track her every move,
friends spill their guts on television and self-annointed pundits
weigh in on her fate.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal of Lyssa Dent Hughes in ''An American Daughter,''
Wendy Wasserstein's television adaptation of her 1997 Broadway
play, makes for a carnival ride through our topsy-turvy world
swirling with sound bites and stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, debuting 9 p.m. EDT Monday, June 5 on Lifetime,
blends delicious ''Network''-like satire and emotional angst as it
thrusts at questions of women in power, fidelity and what it sees
as a growing national fondness for superficiality.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes (a perfectly tuned performance by Christine Lahti) is a
wife, mother and prominent physician -- and a descendant, no less,
of Ulysses S. Grant -- who is awaiting certain confirmation as
surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   Then her husband (Tom Skerritt) dredges up for a reporter a
seemingly innocent detail: Hughes' failure to respond to a jury
notice. That proves the first of far-uglier revelations, not about
Hughes but about her world (and ours) and the people in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Knocked by theater critics as shooting at too many targets, the
play benefits from its TV makeover. By opening up the one-set play
to include television studios and talk shows as well as the
reporter-besieged Hughes home, the focus on a media run amok is
sharpened.
</P>
<P>
   The teleplay is also funny. There's a daytime show, ''The
Focus,'' with a grab bag of chatty female hosts that's a dead-on
spoof of Barbara Walters and ''The View'' crew.
</P>
<P>
   Complex themes including privacy and public service and the
evolution of feminism are intact, along with the Tony Award-winning
performance of Lynne Thigpen as Hughes' loyal friend who carries
her own emotional burden.
</P>
<P>
   Lahti's portrait of Lyssa Hughes, a woman battered by the world
but steadfast in her beliefs, deserves awards of its own. Others in
the solid cast include Jay Thomas, Mark Feuerstein and, in an
eye-catching turn as opportunistic neo-feminist Quincy Quince,
Blake Lindsley.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing Thigpen on film was a major reason Wasserstein wanted
to bring the play to television. Lahti, who starred in
Wasserstein's Pulitzer Prize-winning ''The Heidi Chronicles'' but
did not appear on stage in ''American Daughter,'' lobbied for the
TV role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really felt for this character,'' Lahti said. ''She's flawed
but courageous. I think she's a compassionate and thoughtful public
servant who's not allowed to do all that she's capable of because
of the glass ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The play's inspiration came from the criticism that met Clinton
nominees Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood over their child-care hiring
practices, Wasserstein recounted in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was fascinating about 'Nannygate' was that if you had to
pin something on the 'having-it-all' generation, or my generation
of women, it was fascinating that you landed on child care and the
nanny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein also was struck by the fallout from Hillary
Clinton's cookie-baking comment that some considered a slam against
homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed for a while that women in public office were all
wearing pastel suits, and I thought no one I know wears those
colors, just those women because we have to see how soft they
are,'' Wasserstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was very peculiar. ... Why can't a person just be
a person?'' That unfair burden falls on those outside the public
arena, too, the playwright added: ''I think people have opinions
about women and how they live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein's favorite scene comes at the end of the film, when
Hughes has the chance to redeem herself in a public confessional --
a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the character proclaims, ''The women of America should
not concern themselves with my father's wives, my cooking or my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein hopes the film makes people more alert to political
and social manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they think about what they're actually watching when
they're watching someone running for public office .... and try to
listen when the Quincy Quinces come on and have an opinion about
everything. Is it about their own careers, or are they saying
something of value?''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein has new reason to reflect on the state of the world:
daughter Lucy Jane Wasserstein, born last fall. What kind of world
would she like for her?
</P>
<P>
   ''A world that is much more tolerant, that recognizes character,
what constitutes that .... and that it's not the person who spins
the best.''

<HEADLINE> Court Restricts Rights of Creditors  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies that provide insurance or other
services to a business during its bankruptcy proceedings cannot try
to collect unpaid fees from collateral held by another creditor,
the Supreme Court said today.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling in a Missouri case said only bankruptcy
trustees can invoke a provision of federal bankruptcy law to
collect fees from collateral held by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that the law says
''the trustee'' can recover costs in such a manner, but does not
mention anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that the sole party named -- the trustee -- has a
unique role in bankruptcy proceedings makes it entirely plausible
that Congress would provide a power to him and not to others,''
Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The court also:
</P>
<P>
   --Declined to enter a dispute between the federal government and
181 hospitals that say they were underpaid for care they provided
to particularly high-cost Medicare patients. Without comment, the
court turned away the hospitals' argument that federal law sets a
minimum payment for such high-cost patients.
</P>
<P>
   --Refused to consider federal rules intended to keep telephone
service affordable in high-cost areas and to subsidize Internet
hookups for schools and libraries. A paging service company's
appeal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in a second bankruptcy case today, the justices made it
easier for governments to collect back taxes from bankrupt debtors.
In an Illinois dispute over state sales taxes owed on a $12 million
jet, the court said that if a tax law puts the burden of proof on
the taxpayer instead of the government, that burden remains the
same in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   The justices unanimously upheld a 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals decision that said Illinois law put the burden on William
J. Stoecker to prove he did not willfully avoid paying sales taxes
on the jet owned by his now-defunct corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Missouri case, the justices ruled against the Hartford
Underwriters Insurance Co.'s effort to collect unpaid premiums for
workers' compensation insurance it provided to Hen House
Interstate, which operated businesses such as service stations,
restaurants and gift stores.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Hen House sought protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court in St. Louis to allow it to reorganize under
federal bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
   During the bankruptcy reorganization, Hartford provided workers'
compensation insurance to Hen House, which the company needed to
continue operating. During that time, Hen House failed to pay
$51,871 in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   After the reorganization was converted to a bankruptcy
liquidation proceeding, Hartford sought to collect the premiums
from collateral held by Hen House's lender, Magna Bank. The bank
later merged into Union Planters National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank argued that Hartford lacked legal standing under
bankruptcy law to seek such payment.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy judge and a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for Hartford, but the full 8th
Circuit court reversed and rejected Hartford's claim.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy law allows only trustees, and not other parties
such as Hartford, to collect from collateral held by a secured
creditor, the full appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed today.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that provide services to firms in bankruptcy
proceedings can insist on being paid in cash, or they can contract
directly with the secured creditor, Scalia said. Also, he said,
they can ''avoid unnecessary losses simply by paying attention to
the status of their accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases decided today are Hartford Underwriters Insurance Co.
vs. Union Planters National Bank, 99-409, and Raleigh vs. Illinois,
99-387.

<HEADLINE> In Atlantic City and Ocean City, lifeguard hours are being extended </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Two towns where drownings occurred last
year are extending hours for lifeguards at some beaches this year,
saying the moves may be necessary to protect swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Ocean City, three of the busiest beaches will remain guarded
by lifeguards on weekends until 8 p.m. -- three hours later than
usual. The beaches are Eighth Street, Ninth Street and 12th Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlantic City, guards will remain on the beach at Kentucky
Avenue until 8 p.m. -- two hours later -- every day of the week,
beginning in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've noticed that people come later and stay later,'' said
Assistant Capt. Bud McKinley of the Ocean City Beach Patrol. ''One
thing is skin cancer is a concern for some people. Another is that
it's quieter in the evening, and aside from there being no
(lifeguard) protection, it's a pretty pleasant time to be on the
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   In both cities, after-hours drownings prompted the changes.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, Brian K. Wilson, 34, of Philadelphia died when he
rushed into the water at the Eighth Street beach in Ocean City to
save an 8-year-old girl who had been swept out to sea by a riptide.
She survived. The incident occurred about 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, Johnette Bailey, 32, of Atlantic City died when she
went to the aid of three young nephews struggling against a riptide
in the water at Kentucky Avenue. That incident occurred about 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City Beach Patrol officials extended lifeguard hours at
the beach after the drownings and intend to do so again this year,
Chief Bob Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean City officials made the decision this year, after beach
patrol officials conducted a study that found more swimmers to be
using the ocean late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   They picked the three beaches that are closest to public
restrooms, amusement rides and hotels because those are the ones
most likely to have late-staying bathers, McKinley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great idea,'' said George Browne, chairman of
the Jersey shore chapter of the Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit
environmental organization based in San Clemente, Calif. ''A lot of
the people who come to the beach have no experience with the
currents and don't know the difference between a riptide and an
undertow.''
</P>
<P>
   The hours changes make sense for Atlantic City and Ocean City,
where day-trippers and novice swimmers are more common because of
the resort nature of the cities and the high number of rental units
or hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Beach patrol officials elsewhere on the shore say they don't
need longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Stone Harbor, it's a family-oriented beach,'' said beach
patrol Lt. Rodney Tice. ''With the (cost of) beach badges, you
don't get the day people. They'll go to Wildwood. So you have more
experienced people swimming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Unger, a spokesman for the Surfers Environmental Alliance,
says beach patrols are mistaken if they believe they can wipe out
drownings entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey beach towns have this mentality that they can
control nature and control people with 100 percent safety. It's
unrealistic, and it's counterproductive. You have to have more
respect for the ocean, that's all,'' Unger said.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq Each Climb 125  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today as investors
returned from a three-day weekend ready to look for bargains.
Technology and telecom stocks led the gains.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 126.45 at 10,425.69.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 125.65 at 3,330.76, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 21.28 at 1,399.30.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are in a buying mood,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. ''At the close of
trading last week, the Nasdaq was 37 percent off its record high,
and many investors believe that there are bargains to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, volume was light, suggesting that investors remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications sector received a lift from the news that
France Telecom is buying Britain's Orange from Vodafone Air Touch
PLC for about $37.6 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom shares rose $6.75 to $137.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange, and Vodafone Air Touch rose $3.688 to $45.688.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raised speculation that more global mergers will follow
in the telecom industry. Alcatel rose $6.063 to $55.063.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of high-tech industry leaders also rose. Sun Microsystems
rose $3.25 to $76.50 and Cisco Systems rose $2.188 to $57.125.
</P>
<P>
   Many high-profile technology stocks have been under pressure in
recent weeks as investors have wondered whether their future
earnings will justify their relatively high share prices. Most
analysts expect rising interest rates to eventually take a toll on
corporate earnings as it become more expensive to borrow money to
finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies could be hurt if their old-economy clients
curb spending on technology while they weather rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose despite an economic report that suggested six rate
increases by the Federal Reserve in the past year have not yet
sapped consumer sentiment. Consumer confidence jumped sharply in
May, approaching the all-time high it reached in January, the
Conference Board said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Withdrawal Encourages U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The United States is encouraged by Ethiopian
withdrawals which reportedly have begun in the western areas of
Eritrea, the State Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Philip Reeker called on the Ethiopian government to
desist from all further offensive actions, including air attacks of
the kind carried out against a power plant near Massawa and against
the Asmara airport.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the United States wants to avoid any interruption in
the flow of humanitarian supplies to the civilian victims of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He added that U.S. officials have received confirmation from
Eritrea that it has left all territories its forces forcibly
occupied since May 6, 1998.

<HEADLINE> $10M project to rebuild blocks plagued by fires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- In a two-block area of abandoned
buildings, many of them blighted further by fire, business and
community groups are conducting a $10.8 million experiment in
revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The project will build homes in the section of the Frog Hollow
neighborhood where previously police found drinkers and drug
dealers. Residents believe the abandoned buildings attracted
troublemakers, who are blamed for many of the two dozen fires in
the last three years, community activist Jose Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has worked to rid Frog Hollow of blighted
buildings for 10 years, called the makeover long overdue. It's the
most important step, he said, in rejuvenating an area that was once
beautiful and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be a great achievement, especially since it's so
close to Burns School,'' said Martinez, chairman of the
Mortson/Putnam Heights Project committee. ''It will change the face
of the neighborhood and hopefully put an end to all the problems
those abandoned buildings brought.''
</P>
<P>
   Most properties on the two blocks -- not far from the state
Capitol -- are vacant, and owners are frequently behind on property
taxes. Empty lots mar the stretch of street.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for renovating or building 42 owner-occupied one- and
two-family homes and 22 rental units on 29 properties. David A.
Mesite, director of development with Broad-Park Development Corp.,
a nonprofit group that is a partner in the project, has been
working with city officials to buy foreclosed buildings and lots
that are now city-owned.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership is targeted at moderate-income people who might
not be able to afford a home, but is not limited to first-time
homeowners, Mesite said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say they fear that they'll be left out of the
plan or that the work will price them out of rentals. Mesite says
there will be safeguards to protect renters.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Welgoss, whose three-bedroom rental is not among the
buildings designated for development, is eager to apply to become a
homeowner for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what we've been waiting for,'' said the 38-year-old
secretary who was burned out of another apartment in the
neighborhood seven years ago. ''It looks like we've survived the
bad times.''

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Running Free'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a disastrous decision by the filmmakers to tell their
equine tale ''Running Free'' straight from the horse's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, the horse's mind. This story of an orphaned colt's
adventures in Africa has some lovely visuals, but whatever the
family film had going for it is undermined by absurd, droning,
unnecessary narration, a human voice relating the horse's
none-too-interesting thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, talking dinosaurs?
</P>
<P>
   ''Running Free'' tells the story of Lucky, a horse born at sea
in 1914 aboard a ship carrying workhorses from Europe to an African
mining town. Lucky is separated from his mother, befriended by a
stable boy, bullied by a thoroughbred stallion, and ultimately
abandoned with the other horses when World War I forces the humans
to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   The narration, with Lukas Haas providing Lucky's musings, kicks
in at the starting gate, and proceeds from cloying to aggravating
to downright exasperating by the movie's end.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone, viewing the wrenching image of a helpless foal
parted from its mom by careless humans, really need to hear the
young horse blandly asking, ''Why didn't they understand that I
needed to be with my mother?''
</P>
<P>
   As Lucky flees alone into the desert, is anyone really
illuminated by his pronouncement, ''It was time for me to set out
into an unknown world, where I would be as wild and free as in my
dreams''?
</P>
<P>
   Are Lucky's sad face and images of him wandering alone among
endless sand dunes insufficient to convey his solitude, or must the
filmmakers have the horse whine, ''I started to feel lonely''?
</P>
<P>
   ''Running Free'' has a terminal case of open mouth, insert hoof.
</P>
<P>
   A mute button may be the answer. Russian director Sergei Bodrov
and producer Jean-Jacques Annaud (''The Name of the Rose,'' ''The
Bear'') visually captured all the elements to propel the story,
without the narration.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky's voice-overs may be a concession to young children, who
might have squirmed in their seats if they had to watch a whole
movie without words. But they're likely to be just as bored with
the talking version, which plays out like a child's picture book,
Haas' staccato narration subbing for parents reading along with
their youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than shelling out for ''Running Free,'' adults would be
better off pulling a picture book off the shelves, parking the kids
on their laps, and letting the children hear a story in their
parents' voices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Running Free,'' distributed by Sony, is rated G and runs 82
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Aid Mission to Lithuania To Close  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States plans to close its foreign
aid mission in Lithuania on Wednesday, another on a list of
regional countries to become ''graduates'' of the assistance
program.
</P>
<P>
   Missions in seven others have already closed down, including
Latvia and Estonia, both Baltic neighbors of Lithuania, said Donald
Pressley, assistant administrator of the Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   The mission in Poland will be closed in July. That will be the
last of eight formerly communist countries in the area to be
deleted from the aid recipient list.
</P>
<P>
   Pressley will take part in a ceremony Wednesday formally
shutting the AID office in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10 years, Lithuania has received about $80 million in U.S.
assistance. Included have been programs to support civil society
and the promotion of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Baltics surged into transition process right from
beginning,'' said Pressley.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was something that they welcomed, even though there were
painful results in terms of societal implications but they saw
there were much larger rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those countries that have taken the difficult reform steps are
now the ones that are doing the best,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Summary of Supreme Court Actions  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Supreme Court took these actions Tuesday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Expanded its review of a major clean-air dispute, agreeing to
decide whether anti-pollution regulations must take into account
compliance costs as well as health effects. Environmentalists
criticized the action, while industry representatives praised the
justices for adding the cost issue to a Clean Air Act case they
agreed to review last week.
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled unanimously in a Missouri case that companies that
provide services to a business during its bankruptcy proceedings
cannot try to collect unpaid fees from collateral held by another
creditor. The court said only bankruptcy trustees can recover costs
in such a manner.
</P>
<P>
   --Made it easier for governments to collect back taxes from
bankrupt debtors. Ruling unanimously in an Illinois dispute over
state sales taxes owed on a corporate jet, the court said that if a
tax law puts the burden of proof on the taxpayer instead of the
government, that burden remains the same if the tax dispute becomes
part of a bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to clarify whether courts must defer to U.S. Customs
Service rulings on whether import duties should be paid on certain
products. The government says a lower court erred in saying it need
not defer to Customs findings in a dispute over whether an Ohio
company must pay a duty to import loose-leaf daily planners.
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to referee a dispute between Virginia and Maryland over
whether Virginia can extend a drinking-water intake pipe halfway
across the Potomac River. Maryland owns the entire Potomac River
where it touches both states, but Virginia long has had the right
to use water from the river.

<HEADLINE> Newly battle-scarred Lazio is GOP choice to face Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- His fresh face marred by a fat lip, Rep.
Rick Lazio was to be nominated Tuesday by his Republican Party's
leadership to battle Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York's
high-profile U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to take this block by block, house by house,''
Lazio told reporters before a breakfast with a small group of
supporters at a Buffalo restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   For Lazio, 42, it marked the culmination of a dream that seemed
dashed just nine months ago when Gov. George Pataki convinced the
congressman to suspend his fledgling Senate campaign in favor of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's expected run.
</P>
<P>
   The dream was reborn on May 19 when the New York City mayor
announced he was leaving the Senate race because of prostate
cancer. Pataki and other Republican leaders quickly rallied around
the little-known Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Republicans have been dismissing the first lady's
star power advantage, maintaining the race would now become one of
issues and experience, rather than celebrity. They also took note
of the New York City's mayor's testiness and seeming lack of
enthusiasm for the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy was certainly better known than Rick is, initially, but
with that were a lot of pluses and minuses,'' state GOP Chairman
William Powers said before Tuesday's convention began. ''Rick seems
to have all of the pluses and not as many of the minuses.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed that the mayor wanted the office but he didn't
really want to campaign for it,'' said Larry Staub, vice chairman
of the Monroe County GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio arrived in Buffalo as a wounded warrior. He tripped Monday
during a Memorial Day parade on Long Island, splitting his lip. It
required eight stitches to close.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, expecting a tough race against Clinton and seeking
to disspell any notion the stumble could be a metaphor for the GOP
campaign, made light of the wound.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be the first of a few,'' Powers remarked.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the state Democratic convention in Albany where
more than 10,000 people gathered in a cavernous sports arena two
weeks ago to witness the first lady's nomination, with President
Clinton at her side, the more than 400 Republican delegates
gathered in the ballroom of a Buffalo hotel. Powers said he
expected about 2,000 people in all.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was not among the guests, chosing to stay away rather
than upstage his newly minted replacement. The two did campaign
together Monday at a parade in Queens, their first joint appearance
since Lazio jumped into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to do everything I can to help him get elected,''
the New York City mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Buffalo hotel, more than 200 state prison guards
displayed their unhappiness with going more than a year without a
new contract with the Pataki administration by raining on Lazio's
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lazio, we vote!'' the protesters chanted. On May 18,
negotitators for the union and the state reached a tentative
agreement on a new four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls, even before the Giuliani withdrawal, have
shown Clinton hovering in the mid-40 percentage range, giving
Republicans hope that Lazio can copy the giant-killer role played
by Pataki in 1994 when, as a little-known state senator, he toppled
three-term Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pataki, Lazio is from the suburbs surrounding New York City
and is considered a moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers like the underdog,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the race, Lazio has been stressing his New York
roots, a none-too-subtle reminder that Clinton only moved into the
state in January. And, he has pointed to his record as a four-term
congressman who helped overhaul the nation's public housing system,
worked to protect the environment and voted to raise the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp, on the other hand, has been portraying Lazio
as a conservative out of step with mainstream New Yorkers. Clinton
aides have repeatedly pointed to Lazio's support for eight out of
10 proposals from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ''Contract
with America.'' She has also taken her rival to task for saying
he's a supporter of abortion rights, noting he has regularly voted
to cut federal Medicaid funding for poor women's abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton and Giuliani, Lazio has also come out in favor of
banning the late-term abortion procedure that critics called
''partial-birth abortion.'' That has cleared the way for him to
pick up the endorsement of the state's Conservative Party. No
Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974 without
Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
   Emulating Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign
and Sen. John McCain's failed run for the White House this year,
Lazio was to leave the convention Tuesday night for a three-day bus
trip across the state.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb loses out as CIBA Vision buy Wesley Jessen for $785 million </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. abandoned its
10-week-long pursuit of Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc. after the Des
Plaines, Ill.-based cosmetic contact lens maker revealed Tuesday it
had accepted a $785 million buyout offer from CIBA Vision.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Atlanta-based CIBA, the eye-care unit of Swiss
pharmaceutical giant Novartis, tops a sweetened but hostile bid
valued at about $725 million that Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. made for
Wesley Jessen on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen shares jumped nearly 14 percent. Novartis said the
combined CIBA-Wesley Jessen would be the world's second largest
contact lens company, with pro forma sales last year of $1.4
billion and a combined work force of 8,900.
</P>
<P>
   Approving of CIBA's cash offer of $38.50 a share in cash, Wesley
Jessen broke off its proposed merger with Ocular Sciences Inc. and
paid the contact lens company in South San Francisco a $25 million
termination fee.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb's ''best and final'' bid of $35.55 a share in cash
had been set to expire Wednesday. But the eye-care company, which
has strength in premium disposable lenses, cited the definitive
agreement between Wesley Jessen and CIBA in withdrawing its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive William Carpenter said ''we considered the
acquisition of Wesley Jessen to be strategically appropriate ...
but only at a price that is attractive to the Bausch &AMP; Lomb
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen controls about two-thirds of the highly profitable
cosmetic color-lens market. It had $311.7 million in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The CIBA offer represents a premium of about 17 percent over the
closing price of Wesley Jessen's shares Friday. It is a 55 percent
premium over the closing price March 22, the last trading day
before Bausch &AMP; Lomb announced its original, $34 a share bid for
Wesley Jessen.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was expected to be completed in the third quarter. It
would be subject to 51 percent of the Wesley Jessen shares being
tendered as well as other regulatory and customary conditions,
Novartis said.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Wesley Jessen rose 13.75
percent, or $4.187, to $37.375 a share. Shares of Bausch &AMP; Lomb
fell 31.3 cents to $71.625 on the New York Stock Exchange, where
shares of Novartis fell 6.25 cents to $37.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen has postponed indefinitely its annual shareholder
meeting, which was scheduled for June 23.

<HEADLINE> INS Official Convicted of Espionage  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official was found guilty of
espionage Tuesday for revealing secrets to a friend with ties to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, 54, a naturalized U.S. citizen who came from Cuba
as a teen-ager, took the stand in his own defense last week to say
that he had ''made a mistake'' when he passed classified
information to his lifelong friend, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   The federal court jury also convicted him of converting
government property, in this case secret information, to his own
use, lying on a national security form by saying he had no foreign
business ties and lying about his contacts with a Cuban official.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 jurors began deliberating Thursday on the charges, which
carry up to 10 years in prison. They were off Friday through
Monday, and returned their verdict after about three additional
hours of work Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, 54, was an acting deputy director of the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service in Miami when he was caught in an FBI
sting calling friend and business partner Pedro Font with the name
of a Cuban who was allegedly about to defect.
</P>
<P>
   He had been warned the classified information was secret; in
fact, it was a phony story made up as part of the sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors relied on surveillance tapes to prove their case,
while the defense challenged the assertion -- required for a
conviction -- that Faget intended to hurt the United States or help
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mariano Faget was a government employee willing to betray the
trust of people he was sworn to serve,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Curtis Miner told jurors last week. ''He disclosed classified
information for no better purpose than his own personal reasons,
his own personal gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Edward O'Donnell called Faget ''an honest
government servant who made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Faget was close to retirement after 34 years with the INS. He
and Font formed America Cuba Inc. to pursue business in Cuba if the
U.S. trade embargo against the communist-led country is ever
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Faget testified that he tipped off his friend because Font was
meeting with a Cuban diplomat that day. Faget said he feared Font
would be harmed if Cuban officials thought he was involved with the
defection.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor ridiculed Faget's assertion that he didn't
think telling Font about the defection would hurt national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took it out of the realm of control of the United States
government and gave it to someone else, to use however they
wanted,'' Miner told the jury in his closing.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 128; Nasdaq Up 144  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today as investors
returned from a three-day weekend ready to look for bargains.
Technology and telecom stocks led the gains.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 128.85 at 10,428.09.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 144.90 at 3,350.01, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 24.64 at 1,402.66.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are in a buying mood,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. ''At the close of
trading last week, the Nasdaq was 37 percent off its record high,
and many investors believe that there are bargains to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, volume was light, suggesting that investors remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications sector received a lift from the news that
France Telecom is buying Britain's Orange from Vodafone Air Touch
PLC for about $37.6 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom shares rose $7 to $138 on the New York Stock
Exchange, and Vodafone Air Touch rose $4.063 to $46.063.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raised speculation that more global mergers will follow
in the telecom industry. Alcatel rose $5.625 to $54.625.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of high-tech industry leaders also rose. Sun Microsystems
rose $3.438 to $76.688 and Cisco Systems rose $3 to $57.938.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $5.063 to $122.625 after Lehman Brothers analyst Dan
Niles, who joined the firm from BancBoston Robertson Stephens,
launched coverage with a ''buy'' rating and called Intel one of his
favorite stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many high-profile technology stocks have been under pressure in
recent weeks as investors have wondered whether their future
earnings will justify their relatively high share prices. Most
analysts expect rising interest rates to eventually take a toll on
corporate earnings as it become more expensive to borrow money to
finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies could be hurt if their old-economy clients
curb spending on technology while they weather rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee edged up $0.063 to $18.625 after the company announced
plans to tighten its focus by selling all or part of several
businesses including Coach leather goods and Champion athletic
wear.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee officials said the restructuring will enhance longtime
earnings but could slow growth over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose despite an economic report that suggested six rate
increases by the Federal Reserve in the past year have not yet
sapped consumer sentiment. Consumer confidence jumped sharply in
May, approaching the all-time high it reached in January, the
Conference Board said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide Potomac River Fight  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to referee a
dispute between Virginia and Maryland over the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   The justices allowed Virginia to sue Maryland in the nation's
highest court by invoking their ''original jurisdiction'' -- the
authority to resolve certain conflicts between states even before
any other court considers them.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Virginia's right to extend a drinking-water intake
pipe halfway across the river.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1632 land grant, Maryland owns the entire Potomac River
where it touches both states. Virginia's boundary ends at the
river's low water mark on the Virginia side.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 133 years, however, Virginia has had the right to
use Potomac River water. Today, some 1.2 million Virginians depend
on the Potomac for their drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The present water intake pipe, according to Virginia officials,
is situated too close to land to avoid sediment and other
pollutants. Officials say that by extending the pipe, which would
be submerged below the river's surface to avoid interference with
navigation, the state would save millions in water treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfax County (Va.) Water Authority applied for a
construction permit in 1996 but Maryland officials have not yet
issued one. Maryland officials have cited environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's appeal to the Supreme Court challenged Maryland's
authority to require a permit, and accused Maryland officials of
wrongly requiring Virginia to demonstrate a ''need'' for the
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on Maryland's past performance, there is every prospect
that, in large part for political reasons, Maryland will continue
to delay for years and ultimately deny Virginia its permit, and
that the Maryland courts will uphold that determination,'' the
Virginia appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no alternative forum that can provide a fair and
prompt resolution of this case,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland officials urged the justices to reject the appeal. They
noted that the dispute is before a Maryland administrative judge
who will issue an opinion by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland officials also contended that the dispute is not
really between two states, but instead is between Maryland and
Fairfax County. ''No controversy exists between Maryland and
Virginia other than the ... claims ... by one of (Virginia's)
political subdivisions,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening said last week he plans to sign
a bill that would allow Virginia to extend the intake pipe once the
Maryland Department of the Environment approves the project.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia officials contend Maryland does not have the
authority to reject the intake pipe's construction.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Byrnie, a spokeswoman for Glendening, reacted to
today's action by stating: ''Maryland has serious concerns about
the environmental impact of a new water intake pipe. The governor
is confident that the Supreme Court will recognize that Maryland
has taken reasonable and appropriate action to address those
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley said, ''Our ability to
provide clean water to our citizens, free from obstruction by
Maryland, is at the heart of this case. We ... are optimistic the
court will uphold our right to an adequate supply of drinking water
for the health and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Virginia vs. Maryland, 129 Original.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Soars 200; Dow Up 179  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared more than 200
points today as investors returned from a three-day weekend ready
to look for bargains. Technology and telecom stocks led the gains.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 200.05 at 3,405.16 and the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 178.88 at 10,478.12.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 34.38 at 1,412.40.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are in a buying mood,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. ''At the close of
trading last week, the Nasdaq was 37 percent off its record high,
and many investors believe that there are bargains to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, volume was light, suggesting that investors remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications sector received a lift from the news that
France Telecom is buying Britain's Orange from Vodafone Air Touch
PLC for about $37.6 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom shares rose $7.50 to $138.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange, and Vodafone Air Touch rose $4.25 to $46.25.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raised speculation that more global mergers will follow
in the telecom industry. Alcatel rose $5.875 to $54.875.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of high-tech industry leaders also rose. Sun Microsystems
rose $4.563 to $77.813 and Cisco Systems rose $4.188 to $59.125.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $7.125 to $124.688 after Lehman Brothers analyst Dan
Niles, who recently joined the firm from BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, launched coverage with a ''buy'' rating and called Intel
one of his favorite stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many high-profile technology stocks have been under pressure in
recent weeks as investors have wondered whether their future
earnings will justify their relatively high share prices. Most
analysts expect rising interest rates to eventually take a toll on
corporate earnings as it become more expensive to borrow money to
finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies could be hurt if their old-economy clients
curb spending on technology while they weather rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee edged up $0.063 to $18.625 after the company announced
plans to tighten its focus by selling all or part of several
businesses including Coach leather goods and Champion athletic
wear.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee officials said the restructuring will enhance longtime
earnings but could slow growth over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose despite an economic report that suggested six rate
increases by the Federal Reserve in the past year have not yet
sapped consumer sentiment. Consumer confidence jumped sharply in
May, approaching the all-time high it reached in January, the
Conference Board said.
</P>
<P>
   On a weaker day, the robust report could have prompted a
selloff. Today, eager investors were choosing to gloss over the
consumer confidence report and look ahead to a pair of reports due
out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a reflection of Wall Street's manic depressive state,''

<HEADLINE> NU, ConEd negotiate consumer benefits of merger  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Negotiators are trying to put more
consumer benefits into the proposed merger of Northeast Utilities
and Consolidated Edison Inc. so the deal will look sweeter to
Connecticut regulators.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are rate cuts, job protections, corporate donations,
land preservation and other benefits for customers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have been going on for a month. The utilities faced
a Tuesday deadline to file a settlement, ask for regulatory
proceedings to resume or ask to continue talks.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Utilities said it would notify the Department of
Public Utility Control of its next step Wednesday. The DPUC can
reject or alter any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't closed the door yet. We wish that something would
be worked out,'' NU spokesman Frank Poirot said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies started negotiating after consumer advocates and
even one DPUC commissioner berated the utilities for offering
little or nothing to Connecticut consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The $7.5 billion merger would create the country's largest
electric and gas distribution company, with more than 6.4 million
customers in New York and New England.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Glenn Arthur urged ConEd and NU to offer more
benefits to customers, saying the original proposal was ''not a
dead ringer for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The original proposal did not include rate cuts for Connecticut
consumers until 2006, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal
complained.
</P>
<P>
   NU responded that its customers already enjoy a 10 percent rate
cut under the state's electric deregulation law. The companies
pledged more savings once the combined companies found ways to
streamline operations.
</P>
<P>
   Job losses are expected, but the companies said they would try
to reduce their combined work force through attrition and
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed merger, the headquarters of the combined
company would be in New York. Berlin would remain the headquarters
of Connecticut Light &AMP; Power Co., and NU's other subsidiary
utilities in New Hampshire and Massachusetts would keep their
current headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates seek stronger job protections and want to
keep more jobs in Connecticut. Environmental groups are concerned
that the merger would lead to the sale of thousands of acres owned
by NU.

<HEADLINE> Modern-day witches charmed by Harry Potter  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- He's a charmer, that Harry Potter. The
adolescent hero of J.K. Rowling's series rides a broom, owns an
Invisibility Cloak and a magic wand and has cast a spell over young
readers the world over.
</P>
<P>
   He's got modern-day witches enchanted, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''For once, the witches aren't ugly old hags,'' said Michael
Darnell, a 39-year-old computer programmer from Winnipeg, Canada,
who has been a practicing witch for 25 years. ''For once they're
the protagonists rather than the villains.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell is one of the thousands of North American adherents of
Wicca, a faith linked to witchcraft. In the United States, Wicca
was recognized in a 1986 federal appeals court decision giving it
tax exempt status. No one knows how many people practice Wicca, but
estimates run anywhere from 300,000 to more than 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its followers describe Wicca as a nature-based belief system
that existed in Europe before Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   But witchcraft has always had a darker image in popular culture,
often linked to devil worship and decried by some Christians as an
affront to God.
</P>
<P>
   From Shakespeare to Salem, witches have usually been portrayed
as evil, curse-casting troublemakers. Not in Harry's case. He and
his friends go to school to learn witchcraft and have all kinds of
magical adventures along the way. In his world, the non-witches are
the weird ones.
</P>
<P>
   That's a welcome change for witchcraft practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ''If somebody wants to write about us as being fun, interesting,
magical people, we don't mind that at all,'' said Jane Raeburn, 35,
a writer in Wells, Maine, who has been practicing Wicca for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Considering what the image was 400 years ago in Salem, it's
quite a switch,'' said Michael Thorn, 44, of Mastic, N.Y., who has
been a witch since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Salem, Mass., was the setting for a number of infamous witch
trials in the spring and summer of 1692. Nineteen men and women
were convicted of being witches and hanged, and numerous others
were harassed or jailed. Those suspected of witchcraft were accused
of making ghostly visits to torture people and causing livestock
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The Potter books -- the fourth volume is scheduled for release on
July 8 -- don't actually deal with the philosophical precepts of
Wicca or any specific religious tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Harry and company fight the good fight against the
forces of evil aided by the stereotypical pop culture notions of
witchery -- flying brooms, magical instruments, spells.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself has been enough to concern some Christian
parents. Last year, the series topped the list of books that
parents or certain groups tried to have taken off shelves,
according to the American Library Association. The books were
removed in some schools after parents raised concerns that the
series was promoting witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day witches find that laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're fairy tales, they're not religious discourses,'' Thorn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have anything to do with Wicca,'' said Patricia
Allgeier, 57, a witch in Springfield, Mo. ''It's this generation's
version of 'The Wizard of Oz.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say witches don't have any concerns about the
books. Anything that promotes stereotypes, even positively, can
make it more difficult for Wiccans to deal with non-Wiccans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It portrays witches in positive ways ... but it does not
portray my religious beliefs,'' said Chad Anctil, of the Witches'
League for Public Awareness.
</P>
<P>
   A self-avowed big admirer of the Harry Potter books, Anctil
loves them for their well-written, entertaining stories. But ''it
is difficult for the religion to be taken seriously when books like
this portray it as magic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes witches like the books are the same things that
appeal to non-witches: Author Rowling has created an engaging
series that explores the difficulties of growing up and has kids
dealing with issues of right and wrong -- and standing up for what
they believe.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you're talking about are the choices people make,'' said
Christina Aubin, parenting coordinator for the Clearwater,
Fla.-based Web site The Witches' Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Her 10-year-old daughter is a huge Harry Potter fan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It teaches her to think for herself,'' Aubin said. ''I don't
think that's a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, any parent, witch or not, can't help but be
excited about books their children can't wait to read. That's the
case for Michael Darnell's 9-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really set fire to his reading,'' Darnell said. ''We'd
tried to get him toward thicker books, but he wanted to only read
picture books.''
</P>
<P>
   So there is a kind of magic involved with Harry Potter, Darnell
admits.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what these books do, they become reading for
entertainment,'' he said. ''That's a spell. ... the spell of
reading, that's a good one.''

<HEADLINE> Justice May Block Gas Pump Deal  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department intends to file suit to
block a deal it said would eliminate competition in the sale of
pumps used in 90 percent of U.S. gas stations to transfer gasoline
from underground tanks to surface dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   The department said Tuesday its planned civil antitrust suit
would block a proposed joint venture between Franklin Electric Co.
Inc. and United Dominion Industries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would combine the assets of Franklin Electric's
subsidiary FE Petro and the petroleum related assets of United
Dominion's subsidiary, The Marley Co.
</P>
<P>
   The two subsidiaries now compete with each other and are the
only two companies that produce and sell submersible turbine pumps
in this country. The government said the Marley's ''Red Jacket''
turbine pumps have 60 percent of the market, compared to 40 percent
for FE Petro's pumps.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture would be 75 percent owned by Franklin Electric
and 25 percent by Marley. It would eliminate head-to-head
competition between the two companies, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposed joint venture would eliminate competition and
create a monopoly in the sale of submersible turbine pumps in the
United States, resulting in higher prices, less innovation and
lower quality service for customers,'' Assistant Attorney General
Joel I. Klein said. ''This is the classic kind of competitive
problem that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.'''
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in Bluffton, Ind., Franklin Electric reported 1999
sales of $293.2 million. It's FE Petro subsidiary produces
submersible turbine pumps at a plant in McFarland, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   A wholly owned subsidiary of United Dominion Industries Limited,
United Dominion is headquartered in Charlotte, N.C. United Dominion
Industries Limited is a Canadian corporation with sales of $2.15
billion in 1999. Its Marley subsidiary produces the pumps at a
plant in Davenport, Iowa.

<HEADLINE> VA Seeks Better Patient Safety  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a groundbreaking program, the nation's
veterans hospitals hired NASA on Tuesday to do for medical safety
what it does for airline safety: Set up a system where errors can
be reported without fear of penalty and use the information to make
everyone safer.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA-run program that lets pilots report near misses is widely
considered so successful at improving aviation safety that the
Department of Veterans Affairs wants a similar program to combat
medical mistakes. It would let doctors and nurses report problems
that, if fixed, could improve care in the VA's 172 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning report by the prestigious Institute of Medicine last
year concluded that medical mistakes kill 44,000 to 98,000
hospitalized Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the institute's biggest recommendations was to copy the
aviation industry to improve safety. In a move health experts have
called innovative, the VA has worked for months to do just that.
Now the question is whether the three-year, $8.2 million experiment
will work.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an experiment followed with great interest,'' said
Dr. Nancy Dickey, past president of the American Medical
Association, who leads that group's own safety-improvement work.
</P>
<P>
   Many medical errors are preventable if hospitals would analyze
patterns of problems and install safety nets. Health workers often
do not disclose errors, however, for fear they could be sued or
fired.
</P>
<P>
   The VA already requires employees to report certain serious
errors. The new voluntary, anonymous program aims to uncover more
problems, especially the near miss that didn't hurt a patient but
might the next time.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't know about it, you can't fix it,'' explained Dr.
Thomas Garthwaite, the VA's acting undersecretary for health.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, any VA health worker can report medical
mistakes they make or witness. Just as in the pilots' program, no
doctor or nurse would be held personally at fault. After
questioning the health worker for more details, NASA will strip
identifying information from its database so bosses cannot tell who
reported what.
</P>
<P>
   Then NASA-hired medical experts will analyze how an error
happened and seek protections to prevent it from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of reporting is absolutely essential,'' said Dr.
John Eisenberg, who heads President Clinton's health quality task
force. ''If to err is human, it seems (that) to do nothing about
our medical errors is inhumane.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to install safeguards against mistakes instead of
laying blame, said Dr. James Bagian, the astronaut and physician
credited with installing escape hatches to make the space shuttle
safer and who now is trying to make the VA health system safer.
</P>
<P>
   An example: A nurse hands out a wrong pill, because its name and
package closely resemble a drug next to it on a hospital's pharmacy
shelf. The patient isn't seriously harmed, and thus no one else
notices the mistake; should the nurse risk a reprimand by revealing
her gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   With the new system, she wouldn't have to. Reporting the mistake
into the confidential database could prompt NASA to highlight
confusing medications so VA hospitals could prevent future mix-ups.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System, run for the Federal
Aviation Administration, receives 35,000 reports a year of close
calls or aviation mistakes. A team of retired pilots and air
traffic controllers, plus a computerized program that automatically
searches for patterns of errors, hunts solutions to make future
flights safer. The program sends out about 20 safety alerts a month
to the FAA or other industry groups highlighting potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 24 years, the system has never breached a pilot's
confidentiality, said system director Linda Connell. That
confidentiality will be key to health workers trusting the new
program enough to report problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagian said NASA, which formally agreed Tuesday to run the VA
program, should receive the first error reports from VA employees
by January.

laying blame, said Dr. James Bagian, the astronaut and physician
credited with installing escape hatches to make the space shuttle
safer and who now is trying to make the VA health system safer.
</P>
<P>
   An example: A nurse hands out a wrong pill, because its name and
package closely resemble a drug next to it on a hospital's pharmacy
shelf. The patient isn't seriously harmed, and thus no one else
notices the mistake; should the nurse risk a reprimand by revealing
her gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   With the new system, she wouldn't have to. Reporting the mistake
into the confidential database could prompt NASA to highlight
confusing medications so VA hospitals could prevent future mix-ups.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System, run for the Federal
Aviation Administration, receives 35,000 reports a year of close
calls or aviation mistakes. A team of retired pilots and air
traffic controllers, plus a computerized program that automatically
searches for patterns of errors, hunts solutions to make future
flights safer. The program sends out about 20 safety alerts a month
to the FAA or other industry groups highlighting potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 24 years, the system has never breached a pilot's
confidentiality, said system director Linda Connell. That
confidentiality will be key to health workers trusting the new
program enough to report problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagian said NASA, which formally agreed Tuesday to run the VA
program, should receive the first error reports from VA employees
by January.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Lung Sealant  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cancer patients who have tumors cut from their
lungs frequently suffer air leaks that surgeons have trouble
plugging, but doctors now are getting a possible solution: A
glue-like sealant to patch leaky lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the FocalSeal on
Tuesday. It's a two-step process, where chemicals are squirted onto
the leak and then ''activated'' with a beam of light to form a
gelatin-looking seal that moves as the lung breathes.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that by better sealing up air leaks, lung cancer
patients might get out of the hospital faster, said Dr. Stephen
Yang of Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, who tested
the sealant in a study sponsored by manufacturer Focal Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Air leaks is the Achilles heel of lung surgery,'' Yang
explained. ''There's really been nothing effective to minimize''
them.
</P>
<P>
   Stitching up delicate lung tissue after cancer surgery can seal
the lung so it properly inflates again. But sometimes stitches
don't seal well enough. Doctors have tried other surgical glues,
but none would adhere to the moist, moving lung, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   If the air leak is bad enough, patients need tubes in their
chests to pump out the air, which keeps them hospitalized longer.
</P>
<P>
   In a study at four U.S. hospitals, 125 patients had air leaks
treated with standard stitching plus FocalSeal while another 55
patients had air leaks treated with standard methods alone.
</P>
<P>
   Adding FocalSeal helped 39 percent of patients be free of air
leaks at hospital discharge, while only 11 percent of patients
treated with standard methods were free of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not prove that FocalSeal treatment, which will
cost patients about $500, truly decreased hospitalization time,
cautioned the FDA's Dr. Celia Witten.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a concern: Thirteen of the 125 FocalSeal-treated
patients had their cancer return during the study, as opposed to
only four of the 55 patients not treated with FocalSeal.
</P>
<P>
   That difference is not statistically significant so, following
the advice of the government's scientific advisers, the FDA decided
the concern wasn't enough to stop FocalSeal's sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that you can draw any conclusions that there's a
problem,'' Witten said. Yang added that it's possible the
explanation is patients with worse cancer wound up getting
FocalSeal. To settle the issue, the FDA ordered the manufacturer to
continue tracking the patients who tested FocalSeal to see if
cancer recurrence is a real problem or not.
</P>
<P>
   FocalSeal is made partly of the same materials as biodegradable
stitches, so over time the body will absorb the lung patch.
</P>
<P>
   Lexington, Mass.-based Focal Inc. will begin selling the sealant
immediately.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 254; Dow Up 228  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street's traditional summer rally began
right on cue today, with the Dow Jones industrials and the Nasdaq
composite index gaining more than 200 points apiece as investors
returned from the Memorial Day weekend in search of bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and telecommunications shares led the gains as
investors sought out stocks that have been battered in the past few
weeks. But volume was light, suggesting that investors remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will the rally stick? I wish I could say yes, but with this
surprisingly low volume, I'm not sure it will be extended through
the rest of the week,'' said Robert H. Stovall, market analyst at
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 254.18 points, or 7.9 percent,
to close at 3,459.29. It was the largest percentage gain ever for
the index and the second largest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.23 points to close at
10,527.47.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 44.43 to 1,422.45.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,035 up, 934 down and
457 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 816.59 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
719.92 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 14.73 to
472.77.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are in a buying mood,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. ''At the close of
trading last week, the Nasdaq was 37 percent off its record high,
and many investors believe that there are bargains to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications sector received a lift from the news that
France Telecom is buying Britain's Orange from Vodafone Air Touch
PLC for about $37.6 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom and Vodafone Air Touch shares rose on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raised speculation that more global mergers will follow
in the telecom industry. Alcatel rose.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of high-tech industry leaders also rose. Sun Microsystems
and Cisco Systems gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose sharply after Lehman Brothers analyst Dan Niles, who
recently joined the firm from BancBoston Robertson Stephens,
launched coverage with a ''buy'' rating and called Intel one of his
favorite stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's gains, along with several other semiconductor stocks
that Niles said he will cover at Lehman, helped the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange's Semiconductor Index to its biggest gain in more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Many high-profile technology stocks have been under pressure in
recent weeks as investors have wondered whether their future
earnings will justify their relatively high share prices. Most
analysts expect rising interest rates to eventually take a toll on
corporate earnings as it become more expensive to borrow money to
finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies could be hurt if their old-economy clients
curb spending on technology while they weather rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee edged up after the company announced plans to tighten
its focus by selling all or part of several businesses including
Coach leather goods and Champion athletic wear.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee officials said the restructuring will enhance longtime
earnings but could slow growth over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The market's rally surprised analysts, because it came on the
heels of an economic report that suggested six rate increases by
the Federal Reserve in the past year have not yet sapped consumer
sentiment. Consumer confidence jumped sharply in May, approaching
the all-time high it reached in January, the Conference Board said.
</P>
<P>
   On a weaker day, the robust report could have prompted a
selloff. Today, eager investors were choosing to gloss over the
consumer confidence report and look ahead to a pair of reports due
out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a reflection of Wall Street's manic depressive state,''
Skrainka said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the National Association of Purchasing Management
will issue a report on activity in the industrial economy during
May. And on Friday, the Labor Department will issue its May
employment report.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Reunite at Border  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOHEIRA, Lebanon (AP) -- Palestinian relatives who'd never met
stretched hands through swirls of barbed wire at the Lebanon-Israel
border Tuesday, making introductions and asking whatever happened
to loved ones in each other's land.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder, my dearest, where is Abu Khaled?'' Najah Fahd, a
resident of the Israeli town of Tamra, asked cousins on the
Lebanese side.
</P>
<P>
   She gripped the fence between them and broke into tears. Soon
others gathered and, at the urging of an Israeli soldier, the woman
was escorted back without an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon is home to 350,000 Palestinian refugees, forced from
their homes by the creation of Israel in 1948 and the 1967 Middle
East war. And of Israel's 6 million people, about 1 million are
Arabs who continued to live in the former Palestine after the
creation of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians on each side have been separated for years by
the Israeli occupied zone in southern Lebanon. With Israel's troop
withdrawal from the border zone last week, reunions between
relatives on both sides of the fence have become possible.
</P>
<P>
   From refugee camps and towns across Lebanon, about 100
Palestinians -- infants and elderly -- made their way 300 yards up a
rocky hill and steep slope Tuesday to squeeze onto the narrow
gravel strip along the barbed wire fence that divides Lebanon and
Israel. Those who came hung on to the border fence for balance as
they squeezed past others on the border ledge. No Lebanese
authorities were present.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, three Israeli soldiers made halfhearted
efforts to keep about 175 relatives behind coils of barbed wire 10
feet back from the fence. But they tolerated approaches as long as
reunions were brief and too many people didn't cluster at once.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is your brother's daughter. Her name is Umm Khalid,'' a
woman on the Lebanese side said as two women -- an aunt and a niece
from opposite sides of the fence -- reached out to shake hands for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, a
peaceful border that relatives could pass through for visits
remains a long way off. And many on the Lebanese side complain that
current Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are unlikely to include
their return to their homeland. For now, word-of-mouth arrangements
are being made for fence reunions between people hoping to fill in
the 52-year gap in family histories.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side of the fence Tuesday, Ali Suweidan stood and
spoke to a young man across the way in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am their uncle -- tell your neighbors to come Saturday
because I am coming back,'' he said. ''Give them my regards and
tell them to come back Saturday,'' he said again as an Israeli
soldier shooed him back from the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Suweidan comes from what used to be the town of Basa, six miles
inside Israel. The town -- whose Arab residents fled in 1948 -- no
longer exists, and the industrial zone of the Israeli community of
Shlomi is now located on the site. Suweidan lives elsewhere inside
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Zuhair Merei, 22, who lives in Zrariyeh village near the
southern Lebanese town of Tyre, pointed through the fence to two
teen-age girls on the Israeli side. The girls, whose families also
come from Basa, sucked yellow popsicles. They smiled back and
waved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are my cousins,'' Merei said. Then he blushed and asked
them again who is Amal and who is Sahar.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Sabah, 72, rested on a cooler, holding his cane and
sipping a cup of Arabic coffee from a pot passed through from the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   Sabah, originally from Amka village in the Galilee in Israel,
now lives in the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon. He said
relatives carried him up the hill to the border fence.
</P>
<P>
   There, he visited briefly with some of his wife's family on the
Israeli side and looked into the land he left 52 years ago as a
refugee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if this is the last day of my life, I'll accept only
Palestine as my homeland,'' Sabah said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Soldier Poisoned by Comrades  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A Canadian soldier who returned from Croatia with
mysterious ailments was poisoned in 1993 by his fellow troops, a
military investigator said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of identified soldiers did, in fact, place substances
such as naphtha, antifreeze, anti-irritant eye drops ... and boot
blackener in coffee intended to be consumed by Matt Stopford,''
said Russ Grabb, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer who
conducted the military investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The alleged motive for these acts was to temporarily render
him unable to carry out his position of command,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Grabb said a three-year statute of limitations prevented the
military from charging anyone in the poisoning case.
</P>
<P>
   Stopford, who served as a warrant officer in Croatia, is blind
in one eye and suffers from unexplained bleeding and joint
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Similar ailments among other peacekeepers raised accusations
that they were exposed to toxic waste or other hazardous material
in Croatia. A separate military inquiry found no hazardous material
in soil samples taken last summer from the areas in Croatia where
the Canadians served.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Begins Trip to Europe  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Standing on shores where explorers
launched voyages of discovery five centuries ago, President Clinton
opened a week-long European journey Tuesday saying, ''We have a few
stormy waters still to navigate.'' He looked ahead to his first
summit with Russia's new president and added Middle East
peacemaking to his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was told that Russian President Vladimir Putin has not
softened his opposition to changing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to allow the United States to deploy a national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who will go to Moscow on Saturday, was briefed on
Putin's views by Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, who
returned Monday from talks with the Russian president and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Guterres said Putin spoke ''in a very frank and open manner''
about everything from missile defenses to the war in the rebellious
Russian republic of Chechyna, U.S. officials said. But they said
there was no change in Russia's oft-stated opposition to U.S.
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not alone in its concern about America's proposed
defense system. European allies fear it could divide NATO and
prompt Russia and China to bolster their nuclear arsenals. Clinton
is to decide before the November elections whether to deploy the
missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Near the entrance to Lisbon's harbor, Clinton was welcomed by a
21-gun salute from a Portuguese frigate. Dozens of Portuguese
soldiers wearing camouflage fatigues, berets and white gloves stood
in review before Clinton and Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio at
the bleached limestone, 16th century Tower of Belem. The monument,
with Moorish-style watch towers and battlements, marks the place
where Ferdinand Magellan, Vasco de Gama and other explorers set
sail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here at this historic point of embarkation, from which
Portuguese explorers led an entire continent to see beyond the
horizon, we find ourselves again ... on a new voyage of
discovery,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he toured a science and research center and said that
prosperous nations have an obligation to help Africa, Asia and
other developing areas combat diseases like AIDS, malaria and
tuberculosis. ''These diseases can ruin economies and threaten the
very survival of societies,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said global health crises will be at the top of the
agenda when he meets Wednesday with leaders of the 15-nation
European Union. ''We have got to make sure that today's revolution
in science and technology serves all humanity, helps us to fight
hunger, to mitigate natural disasters, to reverse the tide of
global warming, to grow our economies without damaging the
environment,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Trade issues also will be discussed, but U.S. officials said
they did not expect any breakthrough on disputes over beef and
bananas. The United States is trying to force the European Union to
comply with World Trade Organization rulings and remove barriers to
the import of bananas from American companies and U.S. beef grown
with hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States will join Portugal to help the
former Portuguese colony of Sao Tome and Principe combat a unique
malarial epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit Portugal since
Ronald Reagan in 1985. The trip was intended to celebrate
Portugal's transition from a dictatorship to democracy 26 years ago
and its emergence as a prosperous country.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed an ''open skies''
agreement with Portugal. The United States now has signed such
agreements with 46 countries, providing greater access to foreign
routes for American carriers and to U.S. routes by foreign
carriers. Albright and Foreign Minister Jaime Gama also signed
agreements dealing with deportation and enforcement of child
support and alimony orders.
</P>
<P>
   From Lisbon, Clinton will travel to Berlin for informal talks
with more than 15 world leaders. The president set aside time for a
meeting Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who
skipped a planned visit to Washington two weeks ago after violence
in Palestinian-controlled lands and heavy fighting in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both the president and the prime minister believe it is
important for them to meet at this time to discuss prospects for
reaching an Israeli-Palestinian framework agreement ... and assess
the situation following Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon,''
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Toasting Clinton at a state dinner, Sampaio hailed the U.S.-led
NATO alliance as the ''indispensable guarantor of European
security.'' Clinton celebrated two centuries of good relations with
Portugal. ''Today we are proud to stand with you as partners,
allies and friends,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, Clinton is expected to meet privately Friday with
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose reputation has been
tarnished by his admission that he accepted $1 million in secret
campaign donations in the early 1990s. Clinton also plans to pay a
courtesy call in Moscow Monday on former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Enzyme Blamed As Cause of Lupus  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   German scientists have provided the first direct
evidence that a
key enzyme's failure to mop up dying cells contributes to lupus, a
potentially fatal immune disorder.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The study, published in the June issue of the journal Nature
Genetics, involved only mice. However, researchers said the immune
reactions are very similar to what occur in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''These mice add strong support to the hypothesis that
impairment of the normal disposal of cellular debris predisposes
the development'' of lupus, said Mark J. Walport of London's
Imperial College.
</P>
<P>
   Lupus is a disorder that causes the body's own defenses to
mistakenly attack the DNA and proteins within healthy cells.
Complications include arthritis, blood vessel inflammations and
kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe lupus is rooted in many subtle genetic
abnormalities. One of many suspected factors is a mutation that
disrupts the body's waste disposal mechanism in cells.
</P>
<P>
   A special enzyme known as DNase1 is supposed to eliminate what
scientists call ''garbage DNA'' and other cellular leftovers by
biochemically chopping them into tiny fragments for easier removal.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers turned off the gene that encodes DNase1 in
specially bred mice. The mice appeared healthy at birth. After six
to eight months, up to 73 percent of the mice without the DNase1
gene were showing lupus symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by researchers in laboratories in Essen and
Bochum, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Lupus patients often have low levels of DNase1. Laboratories
already manufacture a synthetic version of DNase1 for other medical
uses.
</P>
<P>
   Walport and other researchers said it is not known whether
supplementing the single enzyme would help lupus patients because
DNase1 is only one factor in the complex disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Because the illness is more common among women, other studies
are exploring whether imbalances of certain hormones contribute to
lupus. Environmental and workplace exposures also are suspected
triggers.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Won't Deploy Army in South  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAQOURA, Lebanon (AP) -- Israel's army blew up more outposts and
leftover material Tuesday in its fallback to the Lebanese-Israeli
border as U.N. teams worked on restoring the frontier to lines
prior to the 1978 Israeli invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Several explosions echoed in spots just inside Lebanon, and a
cloud of white dust shot into the sky in the early afternoon. The
Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said one explosion was part of
the deployment to the border, while Israeli military sources said
two blasts near the army's former Tziporen position just inside
Lebanon were part of the disposal of concrete blocks and other
leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions were all part of an Israeli move to complete its
pullback from an occupied zone it set up in southern Lebanon in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army finished withdrawing last Wednesday, and since
then it has been moving some border outposts because the positions
were inside Lebanese territory. The exact location of the pre-1978
border became muddled during the long Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. verification of the Israeli withdrawal is a requirement for
the deployment of a 4,500-member U.N. peacekeeping force in the
former occupied zone all the way to the international border.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. envoy Terje Roed Larsen, who is arranging for the
deployment of the peacekeepers, on Tuesday said the Israelis have
vacated the interior of southern Lebanon and are working
''intensively'' to move positions out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years, Israel has built a considerable amount of
security-related infrastructure on the Lebanese side of the border.
... The United Nations has made very clear that no Israeli presence
can remain in Lebanon,'' Larsen said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he traveled to the border area to follow up the work
of U.N. teams marking the international frontier. U.N.
cartographers led by a de-mining unit and accompanied by soldiers
carrying paints and brushes have been laboring with details of maps
and geography to redraw the international border.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen said Monday that ''barring unexpected complications'' he
hoped the marking of the border would be completed in the ''next
few days.'' On Tuesday, Israel TV reported that Larsen and Danny
Yatom, a security adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
agreed in a meeting on the placement of the entire border. Barak
spokesman Gadi Baltiansky refused to comment and a spokesman for
U.N. troops in Lebanon said he did not know what went on in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, meanwhile, said it is not yet time to send its army to
areas vacated by Israel. The U.N. must first verify the Israeli
withdrawal and deploy peacekeepers in its area of operations, Prime
Minister Salim Hoss said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim guerrillas moved into the zone after Israel's pullout,
and Christians in the south say they fear for their safety. There
have been reports of looting and break-ins in areas inhabited by
Christians, some of whom allied with Israel during its long
involvement in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of policemen have been sent to the former
Israeli-occupied areas but the government has refused to send the
army, saying its military will not act as a border guard for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the border, Israelis have been worrying
about their security situation now that the Israeli army is no
longer serving as a buffer in Lebanon. The town of Metulla has
begun distributing M-16s and automatic rifles to residents worried
about possible guerrilla attacks, since the border now runs only
yards from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are distributing weapons because people want to feel more
secure,'' said the head of security in Metulla, Amir Shoshani. Only
residents who have served in the army and have licenses are
permitted to receive the automatic weapons, he said.

<P>
   Also Tuesday in Israel, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk
said the United States is releasing $50 million in military aid to
let Israel beef up security along the tense border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The sum does not constitute additional aid to Israel, said Larry
Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. The decision
means Israel will be able to spend the money locally instead of in
the United States, Schwartz said.

<HEADLINE> Some in White House Gone, Packing  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a few hundred White House aides, many of
whom have worked for Bill Clinton since 1991 or 1992, this is like
senior year: time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's advisers and retainers are taking an
early slide while others work on their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I basically grew up there,'' said David Leavy, who took a job
with Clinton one day out of college in 1991 and left the White
House as the senior foreign policy spokesman this year at age 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a really wonderful and once-in-a-lifetime experience,
but a narrow one,'' Leavy said. ''Come Year 8, it was really time
to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, something else was a big public relations job for the
parent company of the Discovery channel. Doug Sosnik, one of
Clinton's most trusted strategists, also left this year for a
senior management job with the National Basketball Association.
Longtime spokesman Barry Toiv joined a Washington public relations
firm.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known of Clinton's top aides, press secretary
Joe Lockhart, has told colleagues he is leaving this fall. There
are loud whispers that senior foreign policy adviser Jim Steinberg
is leaving, along with deputy chief of staff Steve Ricchetti.
</P>
<P>
   Other recognizable faces left long ago -- among them adviser
George Stephanopolous and press secretaries Dee Dee Myers and Mike
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Some are secretive about their job searches, others only too
happy to leak word that they're available.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the beginning of the end of the administration, there is
a presumption that people are leaving,'' said one senior staffer
who left last year and spoke anonymously. ''You need to be careful
about actively negotiating while you're still there,'' to avoid
conflicts of interest, but there are few other restrictions, the
former aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to Europe this week will be the swan song for at
least two assistants, including the president's personal aide and
card partner, Kris Engskov, who is joining a Seattle venture
capital firm. Press assistant Mark Bernstein is off to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Many other junior aides will leave this summer for graduate
school or law school, and some will not be replaced. Hardly a week
passes without a goodbye party, which range from catered spreads
and champagne toasts down to pretzels and ginger ale.
</P>
<P>
   But several current and former White House aides said they are
surprised by how many ''lifers'' are still around, and how many
intend to stay to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of staff John Podesta will likely stay on, along with
legislative strategist Joel Johnson, economic adviser Gene
Sperling, national security adviser Sandy Berger and domestic
policy adviser Bruce Reed, White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public expectation and public perceptions might be that staff
would be leaving in great numbers in the eighth year, and that has
not turned out to be the case,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer
Palmieri, who intends to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the further we get into the eighth year, the more
people have realized the responsibilities of these positions are
such that most of the senior people are going to want to and need
to stay until the end,'' Palmieri said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they can't start looking for the job they will
take next January, however.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton alluded to the mass job hunt in his remarks last month
at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm working hard on this resume deal,'' Clinton joked. ''I've
been getting a lot of tips on how to write it, mostly from my
staff. They really seem to be up on this stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Test Popular Diets  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Worried that Americans are doing the wrong
thing to lose weight, the government has decided to test two of the
nation's most popular diets -- low-carbohydrate and lowfat -- to see
which is the more effective and safer way to drop the pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want to do something about being overweight, and from
what I've seen, they're willing to try just about anything,''
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Tuesday. ''Why these
weight-loss diets remain so popular remains a source of extreme
curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans have tried one of the diets or several
variations of them, including the wildly popular, high-protein,
low-carbohydrate regimen developed by cardiologist Robert Atkins
that lets people at omelets, bacon and bun-less burgers.
</P>
<P>
   A rival diet promoted by internist Dean Ornish, an outspoken
critic of Atkins, is ultra lowfat and virtually vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we have millions of dollars being spent on these
diets and everyone is throwing rocks at each other over what is the
best diet,'' said Cyndi Thompson, a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association and a nutrition expert at the University of
Arizona. ''If obesity is the number one (health) issue, then we
need to put our money there and figure out what works.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers with the Agriculture Department plan to put two
groups of people on prototype diets that are similar to those
Atkins and Ornish are pushing and measure how much weight they lose
and what effects the plans have on their health. Some medical
experts say the Atkins diet could damage the kidneys or bones, a
claim he disputes.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of scientists will develop a protocol for the USDA
studies later this year. The studies will be directed by USDA's
nutrition research center at the University of California-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they do the diet correctly, it will change the basic eating
patterns of Americans,'' Atkins said. ''It will be the greatest
step forward that has ever taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman announced the research plans at a national summit of
health and nutrition professionals, the first such conference the
government has held in 31 years. The top issue at the 1969 summit
was hunger, and the conference led to a huge expansion in federal
feeding programs, including the Women, Infants and Children program
that subsidizes meals for pregnant women and new mothers and their
babies.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the top issue is obesity. About 55 percent of
Americans are believed to be overweight, more than double the
percentage in 1969. Meanwhile, about one-quarter of American adults
are obese, according to recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may have dramatically reduced hunger in America, but now we
have a serious weight problem,'' said Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is measured by a person's weight in relation to his or
her height. At 6 feet, a person is considered overweight at 185
pounds and obese at 220. Someone who is 5-foot-6 would be
overweight at 155 pounds and obese at about 185.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government's latest dietary guidelines, which
are revised every five years to reflect the latest developments in
science, the best way to control weight is by exercising regularly
and eating a balanced diet that includes a lot of whole grains,
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala has lost 15 pounds since 1996, proof that one can lose
weight without severely restricting calories or food choices, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to crash diets and fad diets, the guidelines are
clear: Stop doing them. They won't last. Instead, take the weight
off slowly and steadily through a powerful combination of sensible
eating and physical activity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with obesity in children, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention released new pediatric growth charts Tuesday
that doctors and parents can use to track kids' weight and height.
The charts have been updated to include body-mass measurements that
can help identify weight problems in children as young as 2 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The old CDC charts included a measurement of children's' weight
according to their height, but the new BMI chart is a more accurate
tool for measuring whether youngsters are overweight, especially
children at the high and low end of the spectrum, CDC officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Sea-Based Missile System Eyed  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is spending $7 million to study
the feasibility of adding a sea-based element to a national missile
defense system that currently includes only land-based weapons,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, required by Congress and now more than a month
overdue, comes as President Clinton prepares to decide -- probably
by November -- whether to go ahead with a defense against ballistic
missiles of the type that North Korea is developing.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the administration
believes the only way to develop a national missile defense by the
target date of 2005 is to exclude sea-based elements, which require
more technical work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our feeling is that a sea-based system requires more
development and would take more time and possibly cost more money
than a land-based system,'' Bacon said. ''But we are examining
that.'' He said the Pentagon is spending about $7 million ''to look
at the pros and cons of a sea-based system and what it would
require to make a sea-based system work or to give us a sea-based
element to a land-based system.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon would not comment directly on a Washington Post report
that the Pentagon has concluded that sea-based national missile
defenses could be built with existing technology and would improve
the proposed land-based system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we are concentrating primarily, in fact almost
exclusively, on developing a land-based system,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Missile defense has become a topic on the presidential campaign
trail. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican
nominee, said in a speech last week that the United States should
develop ''all options'' for missile defense, and that a U.S. system
should be capable of defending allies as well as U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the expected Democratic nominee, favors
the current administration's approach, which would be a land-based
system that protects all 50 states -- but not allies -- against
long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In a television appearance Sunday, Defense Secretary William
Cohen invited Bush and his national security advisers to the
Pentagon for briefings on the nation's nuclear arsenal and missile
defense plan.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that Bush's proposal for building a larger missile
defense than the administration's limited one would force the
Russians and others, including China, to increase their own
offensive nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday whether the Bush campaign had responded to Cohen's
invitation, Bacon said, ''The only response we've seen is in the
press, and that was, they said they didn't need such a briefing. So
the secretary considers the issue finished in that they have
rejected the invitation.''

<HEADLINE> Two Beheaded in Saudi Arabia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia beheaded two drug
traffickers and an armed robber on Tuesday, bringing to 49 the
number of people executed in the kingdom this year, the Interior
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Zainallah Khan Argon Khan, a Pakistani, was found guilty of
smuggling an undisclosed quantity of heroin into the Middle Eastern
country. He was beheaded in the capital, Riyadh, a ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Haji Staro Yousef, a Nigerian, was convicted of smuggling
cocaine into the kingdom, and was beheaded in the Red Sea port city
of Jiddah.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Jiddah, Filipino Manuel Brona was executed after being
found guilty of attempted murder, the statement said. He and an
accomplice, Ronilio Braido, lured a Saudi man to a deserted area,
where Brona stabbed him repeatedly while Braido held him down. The
man escaped and was rescued by passers-by, while his assailants
stole his car and fled, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Braido was sentenced to an undisclosed number of lashings and an
unspecified jail term.
</P>
<P>
   At least 99 people were executed in Saudi Arabia in 1999.
Punishments in the Arab country follow a strict interpretation of
Islamic law, entailing execution for murder, rape, sodomy, drug
trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are carried out with a
sword in a public square.

<HEADLINE> US Weighing Sanctions Against Peru  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Troubled by Peru's authoritarian turn, the
Clinton administration is expected to loosen official ties with
that country but will withhold final decisions until after a
meeting with other countries in the region, a State Department
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration backpedaled from an official
statement Sunday in which the victory of Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori was described as ''invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Philip Reeker limited himself to an
expression of deep regret that Peru decided to proceed with the
election despite findings by an Organization of American States
observer mission that conditions did not exist for a fair
democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States is awaiting a Wednesday meeting of the
OAS permanent council before deciding on future steps.
</P>
<P>
   As for unilateral U.S. action, officials said the administration
is reviewing its policies toward Peru in international lending
organizations. Bilateral aid programs, both military and
non-military, also are being examined, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official acknowledged that an across-the-board aid cut is
not being considered because of the impact that would have on
Peru's majority poor population.
</P>
<P>
   ''This money does not go into Fujimori's pocket,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   He added that it would be difficult to cut back on the U.S.
counterdrug program in Peru because that issue is a high
administration priority.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has been an ally in the drug war. The latest State
Department report on the drug situation worldwide, issued in March,
says Peru ''has made enormous strides toward its goal of
eliminating illegal coca cultivation.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. counterdrug assistance for fiscal year 2000 is estimated at
$48 million. The administration hopes to maintain that level in the
next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Total outlays for U.S. Agency for International Development
programs for Peru, including child survival and food assistance,
are $120.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   While reluctant to suspend aid programs to Peru, the
administration is worried that failure to take strong action
against Peru could tempt anti-democratic forces elsewhere in the
region to move against constitutional governments.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's special OAS meeting, delegates will hear a report
from Eduardo Stein, who headed the OAS observer mission that left
Peru two days before the vote after failing to win agreement for a
delay in the presidential runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The mission wanted a delay because it was not convinced that
electoral authorities had the technical capacity to ensure an
honest vote count.
</P>
<P>
   Stein was meeting Tuesday afternoon with officials of the OAS
democracy promotion unit.
</P>
<P>
   Under a resolution approved in 1991, the permanent council is to
meet in special session if there is a ''sudden or irregular
interruption'' of democratic processes in member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said OAS delegates may decide on Wednesday to refer
Peru's situation to the regular annual meeting of OAS foreign
ministers, set to begin on Sunday in Windsor, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The same 1991 resolution authorizes foreign ministers to ''look
into events collectively and adopt any decisions deemed
appropriate,'' in accordance with the OAS charter and international
law.

<HEADLINE> Canyoning OKd in Swiss Stream  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Adventure sports organizers can resume
canyoning trips in an Alpine stream where 21 people drowned in a
flash flood last summer, Swiss authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   National and local officials turned down a proposal by relatives
of the victims for the whole of the Saxeten brook to be turned into
a memorial park.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bern authorities understand the feelings of the victims'
relatives, but maintain that their project is impracticable,'' the
statement said. However, a small memorial park should be created,
it added.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen tourists, many of them Australian, and three employees
of the Adventure World organizing company died in the July 27
accident in the Central Swiss Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure World shut down earlier this month following the death
of 22-year-old American Matthew Coleman in a bungee jumping
accident. He was killed instantly when he slammed into the ground
after being attached to a cord that was too long.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the company's staff and directors are under
investigation for negligent homicide in relation to the two
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Interlaken-based Alpin Raft, which was not involved in the trip
last July organized by local rival Adventure World, will restart
activities in the Saxeten brook later this week, the Bern canton
(state) government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   New guidelines to improve safety for canyoning, drawn up in the
wake of last year's accident, are ready for this summer, the Swiss
government says.
</P>
<P>
   Canyoning involves sliding, jumping and rappelling down ravines
and into rivers without a raft.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Rick Lazio stood amid a roomful of cheering
supporters at a meet-the-candidate luncheon Tuesday and declared
''we have 150 days, as the world looks at us, to prove who we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate candidate who promised earlier in the day to go
''block by block, house by house'' to earn the support of New
Yorkers could have started with the little dry cleaning store that
shares a storefront with the luncheon site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't heard of him,'' said Suzanna Mancuso, who was
vacuuming the store while the Long Island congressman geared up
next door to accept his party's nomination for the U.S. Senate
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Tooles was equally in the dark about the man who stepped
in 11 days earlier to replace New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
in the race against Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who he is,'' Tooles said while chaining his bike
to a parking meter at a bank down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had the support of passer-by Chris Weinert -- not for who
he is, but for who he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll vote against Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' Weinert said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a start.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio filled his day, before and after accepting the GOP
nomination, with a handful of campaign stops, where he worked to
spread his message and name among crucial upstate voters.
</P>
<P>
   He started by talking economics over cherry danish with about a
dozen Buffalo-area residents at a Greek restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Relating to a father whose son had moved away after college,
Lazio said he has the same concerns for his own first- and
second-grade girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worry about them, whether they'll stay close to me, whether
they'll get a job to be able to stay in the area,'' he said, citing
the need for lower taxes and more well-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To several potential voters yet unfamiliar with Lazio's
politics, his strongest attribute appeared to be his status as a
New York native, a point he stressed often.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is the fact that he's a New Yorker. He wants to
keep a New Yorker in office. So do I,'' said Sam Filippone, who was
among those who had breakfast with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton was probably all right when she was in
Arkansas,'' Filippone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a good place for her,'' chimed his brother, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this is New York,'' Sam Filippone finished.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, it was on to lunch with the ''Women for
Lazio,'' where he shook hands and traded small talk at the
$25-a-plate luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Nickola hadn't heard much about Lazio before he replaced
Giuliani, but she liked what she saw so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's come out swinging,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio made another lunchtime visit to an event sponsored by
another New York congressman, Amo Houghton.

supplies -- nine years after the Legislature ordered those rules to
be in place.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations, which will be the subject of a public
hearing Friday, would stop industries located on or near aquifers
from using certain chemical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   They would also prohibit companies that use those procedures --
such as dry cleaners, gas stations, automotive repair shops and
chemical manufacturing plants -- from moving or expanding near the
underground drinking water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses now located near the aquifers wouldn't be shut down,
but they would be subject to frequent inspections and forced to
adopt stricter operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 companies would be affected by the regulations, said
Fred Banach, assistant director of water management for the
Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about evil people doing evil things,'' said Curt
Johnson, spokesman for the Connecticut Coalition for Pure Water.
''It's about recognizing that chemical spills happen and accidents
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said 54 public water wells that supplied about 300,000
people with drinking water have been chemically contaminated during
the past two decades. Six of the wells are still closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DEP officials say they expect the regulations to go on the books
by the end of the year. If they do, the rules will come nearly 10
years late.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly voted in 1989 to pass the Aquifer
Protection Act, aimed at preventing toxic waste from polluting
public drinking supplies that serve at least 1,000 people. Under
the law, those regulations were to take place in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But devising a list of regulations that the DEP, businesses and
towns could live with took longer than expected, Banach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to take a major step back three years ago and come up
with a far more streamlined version of regulations,'' he said.
''We're not satisfied with the pace of getting everything done, but
there were a number of issues that had to be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the current proposals won't ensure the safety
of Connecticut's drinking water, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some towns that are home to many aquifers and rely
heavily on an industrial tax base say the new regulations are too
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Southington Town Manager John Weichsel said the prohibitions
will prevent many businesses from moving to the town's ''enterprise
zones'' -- areas the state has designated for industries to locate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This goes like a dagger through those enterprise zones,''
Weichsel said. ''No one wants to have their own drinking supply
infected. But no state in the nation has laws this strict.''
</P>
<P>
   But DEP officials say businesses could work to conform to the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to chase existing businesses out of these
areas,'' Banach said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Brown, director of the environmental policies council for
the Connecticut Business &AMP; Industry Association said he expects the
regulations to become more business friendly by the time they're
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are they exactly where we want them now? No,'' Brown said.
''But they're a lot better than where they were three years ago.
And we're optimistic that revisions will still be made.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: Education Department test results misleading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- One way the state Education Department
reports students' test results gives a misleading picture of how
youngsters are actually performing, a state legislator is
contending.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs his
chamber's education committee, said the state numbers distort how
many students are taking and passing the all-important state
Regents examinations, the New York Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Students for the first time this year are being required to pass
the English Regents test in order to get a high school diploma. In
the future, more Regents exams will have to be passed by graduating
students.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is objecting to the ''average grade enrollment''
statistic gathered by the Education Department. It records how many
students passed the English Regents, but he said it is misleading
because it does not take into account how many fellow students are
dropping out or failing grades. Nor does the data allow officials
to accurately track students in specific classes as they progress
through the educational system, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders made his complaints in a letter to state Education
Commissioner Richard Mills, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders urged the Education Department to use ''cohort'' data to
track high schoolers' achievement on Regents tests. Under those
statistics, which the department has started to compile, students
are tracked through their high school years to their performances
matched against their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ray, Education Department spokesman, said the ''cohort''
data will eventually be compiled for students on all five Regents
tests the state will require for high school graduation by 2003. It
is currently being compiled for student performance on the math and
English Regents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray defended the value of the ''average grade enrollment'' data,
however. He said when students' passing averages on the Regents
tests are compared with the percentage of students taking the
tests, a clearer picture emerges of how students in various schools
are doing on the Regents test.

<HEADLINE> Pie Hurled at Agriculture Secretary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman wanted to
make a point about nutrition. An animal rights vigilante wanted to
make a point about meat.
</P>
<P>
   The two met Tuesday in a cream-pie collision.
</P>
<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said one of its
members, Arathi Jayaram of Mansfield, Ohio, ran onto the stage at a
government nutrition summit and heaved a tofu cream pie, yelling:
''Shame on you, Dan Glickman, for pushing meat and promoting animal
cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   PETA's beef with Glickman, said spokeswoman Dawn Carr, is that
he won't ''acknowledge that a meat-based diet is killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman took the public smear with good humor and a bad feel
for filling, telling reporters he thought it had been an apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   Carr said Jayaram was taken into police custody.

<HEADLINE> Court Expands Clean-Air Study  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court drew gasps from
environmentalists and praise from industry representatives Tuesday
by expanding its review of a major clean-air dispute. The justices
said they will decide whether anti-pollution regulations must take
the costs of compliance -- not just health effects -- into account.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is air quality nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a bedrock principle of the Clean Air Act that the
amount of pollution allowed in the air should depend on how it
affects the health of our children and the elderly,'' said Vickie
Patton, a lawyer with the group Environmental Defense. ''A decision
by the court to change the long-standing clean air policy would tip
the scales away from public health concerns and toward the economic
concerns of major polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower court rulings dating back to 1980 interpreted earlier
versions of the Clean Air Act to bar the Environmental Protection
Agency from considering compliance costs when setting
anti-pollution standards. Costs routinely are considered later in
the process, when implementation plans are formed.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Conrad, a lawyer for the U.S Chamber of Commerce, called
Tuesday's action ''terrific news.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The public health is not going unprotected,'' she said. ''The
clean-air standards at issue here are beyond what is needed to
protect the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost-benefit analysis, Conrad said, could force federal
regulators to make principled decisions on air quality, and prevent
adoption of unneeded and unfeasible standards.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court last week agreed to review a ruling
that blocked the EPA from enforcing rules it adopted in 1997 to
reduce smog and soot. The justices had granted a Clinton
administration appeal that said the dispute ''carries profound
implications for the health of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce, American Trucking Associations,
National Association of Manufacturers and other industry
representatives who successfully challenged the new standards in a
federal appeals court filed a cross appeal raising the
compliance-costs issue.
</P>
<P>
   The cross appeal attacks those portions of the appeals court
ruling that freed the EPA from taking costs into account and
rejected the industry groups' contention that the air-quality
standards were based on incomplete or poor science.
</P>
<P>
   The industry groups were joined in their challenge to the new
standards by three states -- Michigan, Ohio and West Virginia. Two
states -- Massachusetts and New Jersey -- sided with the EPA in
support of the tougher air-quality standards. The two states, among
others in the Northeast, contend that prevailing winds carry
Midwest pollution to them.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled by a 2-1 vote last year that the agency
overstepped its authority. The appeals court panel said the EPA had
interpreted the 1990 Clean Air Act ''so loosely'' that it
unlawfully usurped Congress' legislative power.
</P>
<P>
   The full appeals court voted 6-5 in October against reviewing
the panel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The revised air standards limited the allowable level of ozone,
an essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of
the 0.12 parts per million under the old requirement. And states
for the first time were required to regulate microscopic
particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and other sources
down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the width of a human
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stakes in this case are very high for the lives and health
of millions of Americans,'' said Howard Fox, a lawyer for the
American Lung Association, which supports the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''A difference in standards could mean thousands of deaths and
millions of days in lost work and school absences,'' Fox said. ''We
would be concerned if the court considered opening up the Clean Air
Act to consideration of nonhealth standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases granted last week and Tuesday will be argued together
next fall. The court is expected to rule next year.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans May Vote To Boot Navy  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico predicted
Tuesday that residents of the tiny Puerto Rican island of Vieques
will vote to expel the U.S. Navy from its training range there.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an arrangement that enabled the Navy to resume
training on Vieques this month, the Navy agreed that a referendum
would be held on whether it could continue to operate its bombing
range. The referendum is to be held as early as August 2000 or as
late as February 2002, with the date to be set by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, in a meeting with reporters, said he hoped the
referendum would be held before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the outcome of the referendum will be one that will
support in a very solid manner the termination of the presence of
the Navy in Vieques,'' the governor said. He said that would be his
personal preference, too, although there would be no organized
Puerto Rican government campaign for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a decision that has to come from the people of
Vieques,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the vote goes against the Navy, it would be compelled to
leave by May 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy agreed to hold the referendum in the belief that by the
time of the vote it would have demonstrated through safe management
of the training range that Vieques would benefit from a continued
Navy presence. The Navy has used the island as a bombing range for
more than 50 years and has said no proposed alternate site in the
region can provide the same realistic training for the Atlantic
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said he believes the Navy has miscalculated, and that
the islanders will vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of the strong feeling of some on Vieques, about
30 U.S. veterans from the island turned in their military ribbons
and discharge papers on Memorial Day to protest the Navy's use of
the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   ''In protest and for peace in Vieques,'' the veterans said
during a ceremony at the Veterans' Memorial in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment over the Navy's presence on Vieques boiled over in
April 1999, when a jet dropped two 500-pound bombs off-target,
killing a civilian security guard at the bombing range. The Navy
called a moratorium on bombing, and it was not lifted until
President Clinton worked out a deal with Rossello that included the
promise of a referendum and the Navy's agreement to use no live
ordnance on Vieques until after the vote.

<HEADLINE> Fallen financier loses another courtroom fight, but spared eviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A judge ruled Tuesday that money disgraced
financier Robert E. Brennan made from the sales of his mansions in
Brielle, N.J., and Saratoga Springs, N.Y., must be surrendered to
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second legal setback for the former penny-stock
tycoon in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 56, was spared immediate eviction from a condominium in
Juno Beach, Fla., however, when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kathyrn C.
Ferguson decided she needed more evidence to determine its fate.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities question the legitimacy of Brennan's sales of the
three properties.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson acted on motions from the court-appointed trustee for
Brennan's now-dissipated empire. The trustee is conducting a global
hunt for Brennan's assets to satisfy the Newark native's creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the creditors are the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, which are
seeking over $120 million for investors they maintain were swindled
by Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   The Brielle and Saratoga homes sold for about $3 million each.
Some of the money has been used for Brennan's legal fees and upkeep
on the Juno Beach condo, including two servants, said Robert K.
Malone, a lawyer for the bankruptcy trustee.
</P>
<P>
   He could not immediately say how much money remained, but SEC
lawyer Judith Starr estimated the amount at several million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 56, did not speak in court and declined to speak to a
reporter afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Juno Beach residence, Brennan still has use
of an apartment at Due Process Stables and Golf Course in Colts
Neck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan relinquished his horse farm-turned private golf club on
Thursday in a deal to gain 60 days to decide whether he can turn
over the assets of foreign financial accounts that Malone has said
are worth more than $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Malone valued Due Process at more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   That deal came as Brennan appeared for a contempt hearing before
U.S. District Judge Richard Owen in Manhattan. It is now set for
Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he doesn't bring (the overseas money) back, we will ask the
court to throw him in the slammer,'' Starr said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Owen ruled in 1995 that Brennan cheated investors and ordered
him to pay what is now more than $78 million to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan last year settled a lawsuit brought by New Jersey by
agreeing to pay $45 million to investors.
</P>
<P>
   But the SEC and New Jersey authorities say Brennan has
consistently sought to hide his assets overseas, leading to the
contempt action.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC case stems from Brennan's flagship operation, First
Jersey Securities Inc. He appeared in its television commercials in
the 1980s, stepping off a helicopter and urging viewers to ''come
grow with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC charged Brennan employed ''boiler room'' tactics at
First Jersey and manipulated the market in shares of little-known
companies to fleece people called cold by a high-pressure sales
force.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey charged that after closing First Jersey in the late
1980s, Brennan secretly controlled two other brokerages to run
similar scams with low-cost, high-risk stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan denied wrongdoing, but consented to a finding that he
used ''substantial influence'' at the two brokerages to make
''unreasonably excessive profits'' in stocks in which he held an
undisclosed interest from 1988-95.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has barred Brennan from re-entering the securities
industry.
</P>
<P>
   He also once controlled two race tracks and was chairman of
Seton Hall University's governing Board of Regents.

By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- His fresh face marred by a fat lip, Rep.
Rick Lazio pledged to take ''our message of hope, opportunity and
responsibility'' across the state as his Republican Party's
leadership nominated him Tuesday to battle Hillary Rodham Clinton
in New York's high-profile U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   To the cheers of more than 400 delegates and hundreds more in
attendance, Lazio was declared the unanimous pick of the party's
state convention.
</P>
<P>
   With the ''Rocky'' theme blaring from loudspeakers, the bruised
congressman from Long Island took the stage to declare: ''I am the
underdog in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent is better financed and better known. She comes to
New York with the support of every left-wing special interest, from
Washington insiders to the Hollywood elite,'' Lazio told the
delegates in a more than 25-minute speech. ''But as I've said
before, 'Bring 'em on.' Because when it comes to representing the
needs, concerns and values of the people of New York, I have one
advantage she'll never have -- I can be myself. I am a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   While not criticizing Clinton by name, Lazio accused ''the
opposition camp'' of practicing the ''politics of division ... It
is a bleak, angry place, built of fear. And I will not go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the congressman
had ''offered the people of New York recycled insults and rhetoric
that doesn't match his record. Time and time again Rick Lazio has
voted against New York's working families in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton has been running an inclusive campaign since
day one and fighting for children and families for thirty years,''
Wolfson added. ''New Yorkers will always be able to count on
Hillary to stand up for them in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lazio, 42, the nomination marked the culmination of a dream
that seemed dashed just nine months ago when Gov. George Pataki
convinced the congressman to suspend his fledgling Senate campaign
in favor of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's expected run.
</P>
<P>
   The dream was reborn on May 19 when the New York City mayor
announced he was leaving the Senate race because of prostate
cancer. Pataki and other Republican leaders quickly rallied around
the little-known Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Republicans have been dismissing the first lady's
star power advantage, maintaining the race would now become one of
issues and experience, rather than celebrity. They also took note
of the New York City's mayor's testiness and seeming lack of
enthusiasm for the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy was certainly better known than Rick is, initially, but
with that were a lot of pluses and minuses,'' state GOP Chairman
William Powers said before Tuesday's convention began. ''Rick seems
to have all of the pluses and not as many of the minuses.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed that the mayor wanted the office but he didn't
really want to campaign for it,'' said Larry Staub, vice chairman
of the Monroe County GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio arrived in Buffalo as a wounded warrior. He tripped Monday
during a Memorial Day parade on Long Island, hitting the ground and
splitting his lip. It required eight stitches to close.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, expecting a tough race against Clinton and seeking
to dispel any notion the stumble could be a metaphor for the GOP
campaign, made light of the wound.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be the first of a few,'' Powers remarked.
</P>
<P>
   To the delegates on Tuesday, Lazio said: ''I've heard of
pounding the pavement, but this is ridiculous. I want a rematch.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after yet another round of applause interrupted his
speech, Lazio warned the Republicans, ''I keep smiling like this,
I'm going to bust all my stitches.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the state Democratic convention in Albany where
more than 10,000 people gathered in a cavernous sports arena two
weeks ago to witness the first lady's nomination, with President
Clinton at her side, the Republican delegates gathered in the
ballroom of a Buffalo hotel, along with about 1,000 party
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was not among the guests, choosing to stay away rather
than upstage his newly minted replacement. The two did campaign
together Monday at a parade in Queens, their first joint appearance
since Lazio jumped into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to do everything I can to help him get elected,''
the New York City mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls, even before the Giuliani withdrawal, have
shown Clinton hovering in the mid-40 percentage range, giving
Republicans hope that Lazio can copy the giant-killer role played
by Pataki in 1994 when, as a little-known state senator, he toppled
three-term Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pataki, Lazio is from the suburbs surrounding New York City
and is considered a moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the race, Lazio has been stressing his New York
roots, a none-too-subtle reminder that Clinton only moved into the
state in January. And, he has pointed to his record as a four-term
congressman who helped overhaul the nation's public housing system,
worked to protect the environment and voted to raise the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp, on the other hand, has been portraying Lazio
as a conservative out of step with mainstream New Yorkers. Clinton
aides have repeatedly pointed to Lazio's support for eight out of
10 proposals from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ''Contract
with America.'' She has also taken her rival to task for saying
he's a supporter of abortion rights, noting he has regularly voted
to cut federal Medicaid funding for poor women's abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton and Giuliani, Lazio has also come out in favor of
banning the late-term abortion procedure that critics called
''partial-birth abortion.'' That has cleared the way for him to
pick up the endorsement of the state's Conservative Party. No
Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974 without
Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
   Emulating Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign
and Sen. John McCain's failed run for the White House this year,
Lazio left the convention for a three-day bus trip across the state
on a customized cruiser dubbed ''The Mainstream Express.'' McCain
had called his bus ''The Straight Talk Express.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinian TV, Radio Stations Shut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian police raided the offices of a TV
station and a radio station before dawn Tuesday, closing them in an
apparent crackdown on media expression, the stations' director
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police gave no reason for the raid, and director Ammar Musa
Ammar said he did not know what prompted the closures, which in the
past have followed broadcasts that aired criticism of either the
Palestinian Authority or the peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The stations, based in the West Bank town of Ramallah, were shut
down for airing programs that violated Palestinian broadcasting
law, a Ramallah police official said on condition of anonymity. He
would not elaborate, but said a statement would be released later
Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The private al-Nasr TV station and al-Manara radio station have
each been closed three times after airing political messages that
the Palestinian Authority opposed, Ammar said. He said five
policeman raided and closed the stations Tuesday morning without
showing a written order.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian human rights group MIFTAH accused the
Palestinian Authority of showing an ''ongoing disregard for
Palestinian human rights and civil law,'' and suggested the
crackdown was prompted by Israeli pressure to rein in opposition to
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Two More Die in Zimbabwe Violence  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Two people were killed and scores of
others injured in the continuing political violence raging across
Zimbabwe ahead of parliamentary elections, police and independent
monitors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the violence has killed at least 26 people, most
of them opposition supporters attacked by ruling party thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Tuesday reported the death of a ruling party campaign
manager who was shot in a dispute with suspected supporters of
another ruling party official.
</P>
<P>
   Messiah Kufandaedza, who lost a bid to run as a candidate in the
June 24-25 parliamentary election, was shot in the stomach Saturday
near Marondera, 45 miles east of Harare, police spokesman Wayne
Bvudzijena said.
</P>
<P>
   He died Sunday, Bvudzijena said, adding that one suspect was
under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Police also reported the death Monday of a man attacked by
unidentified assailants in the Honde Valley district near
Zimbabwe's eastern border. Neighbors said the man was forced to
sing ruling party slogans before being beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The political violence began after the government lost a
constitutional referendum in February that would have strengthened
President Robert Mugabe's powers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against the proposed constitution was led by an
alliance of opposition and civic groups, who presented Mugabe with
his first serious challenge since he led the country to
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the violence, armed ruling party supporters began
illegally occupying white-owned farms. More than 1,400 farms are
now occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Bennett, a white farmer who fled his occupied eastern
Zimbabwe property two weeks ago after death threats, planned to
return to his farm after police promised to protect him from
violence and stop crimes on his farm, said Topper Whitehead, an
associate of Bennett's.
</P>
<P>
   Police had arrested and were to charge about 10 illegal
squatters for theft of farm equipment and livestock, Whitehead said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though police in Chimanimani for the first time had vowed to
fight occupiers' crimes, they also said they were too powerless to
force the squatters to leave, Whitehead added.
</P>
<P>
   White farm leaders said Tuesday that ruling party militants
continued to pressure their farm workers to denounce the opposition
and attend ruling party meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical incident last week, two women were beaten and their
babies were thrown to the ground for not attending a rally, said
the Amni trust, an independent group monitoring the violence.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign rally in Glendale, 50 miles north of Harare,
ruling party officials held a ''roll call'' Sunday of the area's
white farmers and sent militants to farms suspected of not sending
enough managers or workers to the meeting, the Commercial Farmers
Union said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Is Up 254; Dow Ends Up 228  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street's traditional summer rally began
right on cue Tuesday, with the Nasdaq composite index staging its
best day ever as investors returned from the Memorial Day weekend
in search of bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and telecommunications shares led the gains as
investors sought out stocks that have been battered in the past few
weeks. But volume was light, suggesting that investors remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will the rally stick? I wish I could say yes, but with this
surprisingly low volume, I'm not sure it will be extended through
the rest of the week,'' said Robert H. Stovall, market analyst at
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite rose 254.37 points, or 7.9 percent, to
close at 3,459.48. It was the largest percentage gain ever for the
index and the second-largest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.89 points to close at
10,527.13.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 rose 44.43 to 1,422.45.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are in a buying mood,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. ''At the close of
trading last week, the Nasdaq was 37 percent off its record high,
and many investors believe that there are bargains to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications sector received a lift from the news that
France Telecom is buying Britain's Orange from Vodafone Air Touch
PLC for about $37.6 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom rose $8.563 to $139.563 and Vodafone Air Touch
shares rose $4.438 to $46.438 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raised speculation that more global mergers will follow
in the telecom industry. Alcatel rose.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of high-tech industry leaders also rose. Sun Microsystems
gained $6.75 to $80 and Cisco Systems gained $4.937 to $59.875.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $8.187 to $125.75 after Lehman Brothers analyst Dan
Niles, who recently joined the firm from BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, launched coverage with a ''buy'' rating and called Intel
one of his favorite stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's gains, along with those by several other semiconductor
stocks, helped the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's Semiconductor
Index to its biggest gain in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Many high-profile technology stocks have been under pressure in
recent weeks as investors have wondered whether future earnings
will justify their relatively high share prices. Most analysts
expect rising interest rates to eventually take a toll on corporate
earnings as it become more expensive to borrow money to finance
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies could be hurt if their old-economy clients
curb spending on technology while they weather rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee edged up $0.313 to $18.875 after the company announced
plans to tighten its focus by selling all or part of several
businesses including Coach leather goods and Champion athletic
wear.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee officials said the restructuring will enhance longtime
earnings but could slow growth over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The market's rally surprised analysts, because it came on the
heels of an economic report that suggested six rate increases by
the Federal Reserve in the past year have not yet sapped consumer
sentiment. Consumer confidence jumped sharply in May, approaching
the all-time high it reached in January, the Conference Board said.
</P>
<P>
   On a weaker day, the robust report could have prompted a
selloff. But Tuesday, eager investors were choosing to gloss over
the consumer confidence report and look ahead to a pair of reports
due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the National Association of Purchasing Management
will issue a report on activity in the industrial economy during
May. And on Friday, the Labor Department will issue its May
employment report.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.01 billion shares, compared with
867.32 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 19.33 to
476.70.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average slipped 0.1 percent.
Telecom stocks boosted European indexes; Germany's DAX index gained
1.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 2.3 percent, and France's
CAC-40 rose 1.9 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- A second visit by a U.S. technical team to a
suspected nuclear site in North Korea yielded no evidence of
disturbing activities, the State Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The team found conditions unchanged since the first visit a
year ago in May 1999,'' spokesman Philip Reeker said. ''It remains
an unfinished site, the underground portion of which is an
extensive empty tunnel complex.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the team reported that the North Koreans cooperated
fully and provided unhampered access for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has said, according to Reeker, that the site was
intended for unspecified national security purposes but is willing
to consider other uses for the site, including commercial uses.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that bilateral talks with North Korea last week in
Rome were ''conducted in a serious and constructive manner, and we
made progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the two sides agreed to hold new negotiations on
implementation of a 1994 agreement under which North Korea agreed
to forgo development of nuclear weapons in return for two nuclear
reactors with limited plutonium production capability.
</P>
<P>
   the two sides will meet Wednesday, Reeker said, to lay
groundwork for the next round of missile talks. No date has been
decided for the actual talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been attempting to wean North
Korea from its missile program in exchange for more normal
diplomatic relations and economic benefits.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Civilian Rule Celebrated  </HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Lamenting the continued ethnic and
religious violence in his country, Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo says the ''bloodletting has to stop,'' newspapers reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came in an address marking the anniversary of the
restoration of civilian rule. Obasanjo was sworn in one year ago to
end 15 years of military rule in Africa's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bloodletting has to stop,'' Obasanjo said in the speech
broadcast Monday on national television and published in Tuesday
newspapers. ''We are going to make sure it stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is sharply divided along ethnic and religious lines.
Thousands have been killed since Obasanjo took office May 29 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, fighting between Christians and Muslims killed up to
300 people in the northern city of Kaduna, about 100 miles north of
the capital, Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting revived the religious bloodletting in Kaduna of
February, when 2,000 died in clashes triggered by plans to
implement Islamic law, or sharia, in some northern Nigerian states.
</P>
<P>
   The government will resist the temptation to resort to the
military tactics of the past to resolve the crisis, Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I shall continue to pursue the course of dialogue without for
a moment abandoning my responsibility to the constitution and my
oath to uphold the laws of the land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo acknowledged that rebuilding the country has only
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is one of the world's poorest nations despite billions
of dollars in oil wealth. The country's infrastructure barely
functions, and corruption has infected nearly every level of
society.
</P>
<P>
   The government has recovered $1 billion in illegally acquired
cash and assets, Obasanjo said, and $2 billion has been frozen in
overseas bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of reconciliation, Obasanjo said the Ibo soldiers
dismissed 30 years ago for fighting against the government during
the Biafra civil war will be rehabilitated and treated as retired.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ibo people feel as marginalized today as when they seceded
in 1967. More than a million people died in the war, which ended
with Biafra's surrender in 1970.

<HEADLINE> Death penalty phase begins in trial of shopkeeper's young killer  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- Grimly trying to understand why,
relatives and friends of a thrift shop owner who was slain during a
robbery listened in court Tuesday as new details of her last
moments were revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Some wept openly and others grimaced, their heads bowed, as
prosecutors played a tape-recorded confession in which Derek
Lecompte, 20, described how he stabbed Linda Thomas and then
returned to the scene three times in the ensuing hours to find her
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to believe that someone could be that callous with
life,'' said Douglas Thomas, 37, the victim's husband. ''It's just
beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lecompte, of Toms River, could face the death penalty for the
May 4, 1999, slaying of Thomas, 42, owner of The Garage Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was stabbed 40 times by Lecompte in a robbery that netted
$375 in cash and some secondhand stereo equipment. The killing was
captured on videotape by a surveillance camera in the store, but it
has never been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Lecompte, who was 19 at the time, turned himself in the day
after the slaying. He pleaded guilty in March to felony murder,
knowing and purposeful murder, robbery and unlawful possession of a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the penalty phase of his trial began. In it,
Executive Assistant Ocean County Prosecutor John J. Mercun will try
to persuade Superior Court Judge Edward J. Turnbach to sentence
Lecompte to death while his lawyers plead for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ''His conduct is worthy of death,'' Mercun told the judge
Tuesday at the start of the two-day proceeding. He said Lecompte
entered the store intending to rob it and to kill Thomas so she
couldn't identify him as the thief.
</P>
<P>
   ''I beg you to please accept Derek's remorse for his actions,''
said Helen Szabo, Lecompte's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lecompte bore the scars of domestic violence: His
mother's boyfriends beat her and him and he was shuffled from
guardian to guardian during his childhood, eventually taking up
residence in a broken-down car while he was still in high school,
Szabo said.
</P>
<P>
   In a tape-recorded confession given to Dover Township police
Detective Guy Murray, Lecompte calmly described how he intended to
push Thomas away from the store's cash register but stabbed her
with a paring knife instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''She screamed out, 'What are you doing? Why are you doing this?
I have a disabled daughter at home,''' Lecompte said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit Lecompte with a shelf and tried to kick him before
her stab wounds dropped her to the floor, Lecompte said. But she
was able to get up and come after her attacker again, hitting him
and struggling to get the knife, Lecompte said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the stab wounds -- to the chest, arms, abdomen, back,
neck and ear -- felled her for good and she lay on the floor, saying
''I just want to go home,'' said Lecompte.
</P>
<P>
   He sat ashen-faced, his head bowed, as he listened to his words
echo through the courtroom Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lecompte said he returned to see if she was alive and each time
found her conscious and talking -- but did nothing to help her. He
found the surveillance system VCR, though, and took the
videocassette tape that was inside.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was found a day later, along with Lecompte's bloodied
clothes, in the Dumpster of an apartment complex.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Lunch Program Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has asked his administration
to consider establishing an international school lunch program
similar to the federal one that subsidizes meals in American
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. George McGovern, U.S. representative to the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization, proposed the feeding program to
Clinton last week at a meeting with Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman and other administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton heard McGovern's pitch, ''We were instructed to go
and flesh the idea out,'' Glickman said Tuesday at a nutrition
conference. ''The president gave us a green light to go out and
develop this program.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300 million children in Africa, Asia and Latin
America suffer from malnutrition, including 150 million, mostly
girls, who don't go to school, McGovern said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department subsidizes lunches for 27 million
U.S. children, including 15 million who get meals for free or at
reduced prices. The program cost $6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of free lunches would improve nutrition
overseas, attract kids to school who otherwise would get no
education and provide an outlet for surplus U.S. farm commodities,
McGovern said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody has been able to find a better way to get them to
school than to offer them lunch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern was a leading advocate for federal nutrition programs
while serving in the Senate from South Dakota in the 1960s and
1970s. He ran for president three times, in 1968, 1972 and 1984.

<HEADLINE> Melanoma Treatment Holds Promise  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A new combination drug therapy for skin cancer
could modestly extend the lives of melanoma patients, a study
found.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that the improvement was most marked in
patients with advanced melanoma, especially those in which the
cancer had spread to their livers. Those people are usually not
given long to live.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year study, whose findings are to be presented at a
cancer symposium in Pittsburgh later this week, found higher
survival rates among melanoma patients who combined interleukin-2,
a substance that bolsters immune systems, with histamine
dihydrochloride, which makes certain cancer cells more receptive to
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was led by the Melanoma Center at the
University of Pittsburgh and involved 56 medical centers, was
sponsored by the makers of Maxamine, Maxim Pharmaceuticals Inc. of
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John M. Kirkwood, director of the Melanoma Center, said
there is no treatment that has been proven to improve survival
rates for patients in the advanced stages of melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Malignant melanoma is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers
in the world, with some 90,000 new cases each year. About 15,000
people die from melanoma each year in the United States, Europe and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Melanoma Center study, an added benefit of the
combination treatment was the ability to give less interleukin,
which is often given in toxic amounts and can result in a sharp
drop in blood pressure, fever, chills and blood leaking into a
patient's tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lower dosage, most of the 305 patients involved
in the study were able to give themselves the shots at home.
</P>
<P>
   For all the patients in the study, the combination therapy
resulted in a median survival rate of 272 days compared with 245
days for patients who received interleukin alone.
</P>
<P>
   Survival to two years occurred in 25 percent of the patients who
received the combination therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said published reports have indicated that the
24-month survival for patients treated with higher doses of
interleukin was 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for 129 patients entering the study with cancer that
spread to their livers, the combination treatment resulted in a
median survival rate of 283 days compared with 154 days for
patients receiving only the one drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a forum now in which we need to think about how to
extend the results,'' Kirkwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Hensing, a medical oncologist at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, said it remains to be seen if this or
another treatment may be determined to be the best. But he said the
study is a move in the right direction because it focuses on the
survival of the most serious cases of melanoma and the quality of
patients' care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is fairly exciting,'' said Hensing. ''I think it was a
well-done study.''

<HEADLINE> Environmental groups demand sprawl protection in transportation bill </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- With highway funding on a collision course
involving Republican powers at the Statehouse, environmental groups
renewed their pressure Tuesday to have the state's transportation
law address the sprawl they say is choking roads and people.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel and a host of
officials from other environmental groups said any new
transportation plan must include tough provisions to prohibit
projects shown to aggravate overcrowding or threaten rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey is a state where if two major highways cross, you
are going to get a mall. You run a highway out to a corn field, you
are going to get an office park,'' Tittel said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, however, the Senate Transportation Committee
wrapped up a quiet public hearing to fulfill a technical
requirement so Senate President Donald DiFrancesco's $4 billion
transportation plan can come up for a full vote.
</P>
<P>
   There was no agreement at the hearing on inserting any new
environmental provisions and the committee chairman, Sen. Andrew
Ciesla, R-Ocean, said he doubted any changes to the Senate bill
would be made later.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Trust Fund is the main system of funding
highway and rail projects, and a funding plan approved in 1995
expires this year. Technically, the fund will run out of money in
June. In reality it has money left over plus an extra $250 million
to work with from a referendum approved by the voters in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   How to pay for the fund after this year has provoked a test of
wills between DiFrancesco, Gov. Christie Whitman and Assembly
Republicans. With the divisions over school construction supposedly
resolved, the Transportation Trust Fund could become the most
divisive fiscal dispute as the state tumbles into June, the
deadline for a new budget.
</P>
<P>
   All agree on how to pay for the fund for the next 12 months with
a diversion from the state's wholesale petroleum and sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco wants to make this diversion permanent with a
constitutional amendment, and to use the revenue to renew the trust
fund for four years. The amendment was the subject of Tuesday's
Transportation Committee hearing, which Ciesla said should build
support and momentum for it.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman so far has opposed the permanent dedication and does not
want to divert state revenues beyond next year in the event of an
economic downturn, especially with the pending question of how to
finance $10 billion to $15 billion in new schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly GOP proposes to split the difference with a
two-year renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In all instances, Whitman's notion two years ago of raising the
retail gasoline tax by 4 cents appears dead.
</P>
<P>
   The demand by environmental groups, however, could add another
speed-bump.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat at Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Shirley Turner,
R-Mercer, said Democrats in the Senate minority would push to amend
DiFrancesco's bill to include anti-sprawl provisions. Tittel and
William Neil of the New Jersey Audubon Society said they would
press to find Republicans in the majority willing to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Tittel said in the 16 years since the Transportation Trust Fund
system has been in use, state officials have never employed binding
rules requiring an assessment of highway projects with an eye
toward their impact on growth or development. He said New Jersey's
continued congestion and loss of open land in those subsequent 16
years has made it clear this has been among one of the state's
worst mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without any safeguards or assurances at how that money is
going to be spent, we are going to keep repeating the mistakes of
the past, where roads that were designed originally for interstate
commerce became commuter roads, and then those commuter roads
filled up with traffic and we widened them,'' Tittel said. ''You
can't build your way out of traffic jams.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Eye Changing Media Rules  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission on
Tuesday proposed relaxing some media ownership rules, including a
ban on one entity controlling two networks and a restriction
against one company owning a broadcast station and daily newspaper
in the same market.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 telecommunications law required the FCC to periodically
review ownership rules in light of greater competition and other
changes in the industry. A report released Tuesday lays out
proposed modifications but will require the commission to
thoroughly examine each item before any changes are voted on.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard, noting that the majority of
Americans still get most of their news and public affairs
programming from broadcast stations, said it's important to keep a
range of voices on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, satellite TV companies, the Internet and
others sources have provided new competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that regulatory changes have allowed broadcasters in
large markets to respond to competitive dynamics, without
sacrificing our long-cherished diversity and competition
principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC proposed softening rules that ban the common ownership
of two networks so that one of the four major networks -- CBS, ABC,
FOX and NBC -- could merge with one of the so-called emerging
networks -- UPN or WB. The commission would retain a restriction
against any two of the four major networks combining.
</P>
<P>
   Such a modification would be welcome news to Viacom, which just
recently acquired CBS. That deal gave the merged business two
networks, CBS and the fledgling UPN network, which Viacom owns. The
FCC gave the companies one year to shed UPN, but a rule change may
enable them to hold on to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said there may be powerful arguments to support such a
change, but FCC Commissioner Gloria Tristani, who dissented in part
from the agency's action, warned that a modification would reduce
the outlets available to independent program producers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first duty is to manage the airwaves in a manner that
promotes the public's interest in competition and diversity,''
Tristani said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided against eliminating a rule that prohibits
ownership of a broadcast station and daily newspaper in the same
locale. But the FCC acknowledged that in some cases, depending on
the size of the market, the level of competition and type of paper
and station involved, the rule may not be necessary. The commission
said it would examine what situations would trigger a relaxing of
the restriction.
</P>
<P>
   The Newspaper Association of America, which has petitioned the
agency for years to get rid of the rule, called the FCC's action a
''mixed blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While it has some merit, we think the marketplace and the
diversity of voices that are out there now would easily sustain
full repeal of this outdated rule,'' said the association's
president John Sturm.
</P>
<P>
   An easing of the rule could impact Tribune Co.'s planned
acquisition of Times Mirror, which would give it newspapers in
cities where it already operates television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission decided against making any alterations to a
35 percent limit on the national TV audience one company can reach
through its stations. The networks had lobbied the agency to repeal
the cap, with Fox Television Stations Inc., filing an emergency
petition seeking such relief. On Tuesday, Fox said it would
challenge the legality of the limit in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The national TV cap . . . long ago outlived its rationale and
is now harming rather than promoting its original public interest
objectives of diversity, localism and competition,'' said Fox
Chairman Chase Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also concluded that it would not alter a rule
barring common ownership of a local cable system and television
station.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials expect to formally propose the individual rules in
coming months, after which they will be open for public comment
before any final decisions are made.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Prepares for More War  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   EGALI, Eritrea (AP) -- The tide of battle may have turned against
Eritrea, but its soldiers crouching in caves or under rock ledges
against incoming artillery said Tuesday they're prepared to fight
on.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ethiopians and Eritreans shelled each other over the
jagged mountains of southern Eritrea, talks began in Algeria to
bring an end to this border war.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming shells crashed against mountain ridges or thudded
harmlessly into the nearby parched plains, sending up plumes of
dust and smoke. Within seconds, the crack of outgoing artillery
resounded through the valleys below the soldiers' redoubt.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea's soldiers weren't oblivious to the start of peace
talks: They were just making it clear they were prepared to take
back by force what Ethiopian doesn't hand back across the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop Mount Egali surveying Senafe eight miles distant,
Col. Habtu Gebrendas, the commander of Eritrea's forces here, said
the choice was Ethiopia's.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they withdraw from out country, good. If they don't, we are
going to take the land back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea says it has withdrawn its forces from all territory it
seized after the start of the border war in May 1998. Ethiopian
troops, however, have pressed deep into Eritrea beyond the disputed
areas. On Tuesday, Eritrea prepared to push them back if peace
talks fail.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian forces captured Senafe on Friday. Since then, they
have battled toward Adikeyhe, 15 miles away. Mount Egali -- and
Eritrean forces -- now stand between them and their apparent goal.
</P>
<P>
   For many miles to the north of Adikeyhe, nearly all civilians
have fled with the region becoming a virtual military zone.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aircraft batteries absent just days ago sprouted from the
rocky landscape around Egali on Tuesday. Tank barrels poked from
camouflaged bunkers. Buses and trucks carrying fresh soldiers,
ammunition and other supplies plied the road.
</P>
<P>
   Four heavy guns arrayed across a valley floor fired thundering
rounds, their barrels flashing with fire and their recoil kicking
up clouds of dust that enveloped the gunners and soldiers loading
the Russian-made shells.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some men and women of Eritrea's army rested in the
crevices of Mount Egali, writing letters, sleeping and cleaning
their equipment. Along a road leading to the mountain, others
stripped to bathe with water they poured from plastic jugs.
</P>
<P>
   Robeil Abraha, a 22-year-old radio operator, said Eritrean
forces killed 1,200 Ethiopian soldiers and wounded 3,000 alone in
just one day of fighting. Only 30 Eritrean soldiers were killed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those claims couldn't be independently confirmed, but Abraha
said the Eritrean dead had been buried while the bodies of
Ethiopian soldiers remained on a ridge two miles away where they
fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are being eaten by eagles,'' Abraha said matter of
factly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fearing the onslaught that soon could engulf
Adekeyhe, some of the few remaining civilians in the town abandoned
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A man pushing a wheelbarrow packed with all his belongings
paused to catch his breathe under the searing midday sun as he
headed out of town. He wiped his brow with a handkerchief, grabbed
the handles of the wheelbarrow, and trudged on.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged woman with a bundle of belongings on her back and
an empty water jug in her hand tried to keep the donkey carrying a
metal chest from straying too far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Eritrean capital Asmara, 48-year-old Amanuel Tesfay,
part-owner of a print shop, worried about a war he fears will not
end soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm scared,'' he muttered, and turned away.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuser Business Audited  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The IRS is auditing the nursing home business
of a woman who accused President Clinton of sexually assaulting her
21 years ago, her lawyers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch, the conservative law firm representing Juanita
Broaddrick, filed a complaint with the inspector general of the
Treasury Department, the IRS' parent agency. The lawyers contend
the audit is related to Broaddrick's lawsuit against the Clinton
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Broaddrick contends the White House violated her right to
privacy by keeping an FBI file on her and allowing administration
officials access to its contents. The suit seeks copies of the
files.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attorney has called the assault accusations
''absolutely false.'' The IRS is prohibited by law from commenting
on tax audits.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch Chairman Larry Klayman said that anyone who
doubts a connection between the lawsuit and the audit should
''consult with the law of averages to determine whether these
matters are simply coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Broaddrick, who lives in Arkansas, claims she was sexually
assaulted by Clinton at a Little Rock hotel on April 25, 1978. He
was the state's attorney general at the time.

<HEADLINE> Van Halen To Have Cancer Treatment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Guitarist Eddie Van Halen, co-founder of the rock
band that bears his name, is to undergo preventative treatment at a
noted cancer center.
</P>
<P>
   The band's Web site said Van Halen, 43, visited the University
of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston on Thursday and
plans to begin outpatient treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Jane Brust said the California rocker does
not have cancer and has not had it. He will be treated as part of
an outpatient clinical trial to prevent tongue cancer, and may have
some risk factors for that type of disease, Brust said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Halen has been a longtime smoker.
</P>
<P>
   Van Halen, who's married to actress Valerie Bertinelli,
co-founded the band in 1974 with his older brother, Alex, on drums,
bass player Michael Anthony and singer David Lee Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Their 1978 debut album sold more than 10 million copies in the
U.S., and another big hit in 1984 with the album ''1984.'' Roth
left the group in the mid-1980s and was replaced by Sammy Hagar. He
left the band in 1996.

<HEADLINE> US Jews Help Lebanon Refugees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Major U.S. Jewish organizations have joined in
an emergency ''Bundles of Hope'' project to rush aid to Christian
refugees who have fled Lebanon for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to collect toiletries, toys and clothing was initiated
Friday by Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
Hoenlein said about 6,500 Christian refugees have left Lebanon for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the refugees were members of the now-defunct South
Lebanese Army militia who feared retaliation by Hezbollah forces
after Israel withdrew its occupation forces. They are currently
living at a base near the Sea of Galilee and locations in northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response has been tremendous,'' said Hoenlein.
</P>
<P>
   He said the response was so great that he halted the appeal for
goods after only one day, though Jewish organizations will continue
to raise cash to help the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were asked to deliver the goods to Jewish federation
offices in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   El Al airlines volunteered to ship all the collected goods to
Israel as soon as possible in any unused freight space, Hoenlein
said. The first of the shipments will be sent Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations participating in the campaign are the
Association of Jewish Family and Children's Agencies, Jewish
Community Center Association, Jewish Council on Public Affairs and
United Jewish Communities (a merger of the former Council of Jewish
Federations, United Israel Appeal and United Jewish Appeal).

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Accused of Targeting Kids  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The chief of the World Health
Organization accused the tobacco industry Tuesday of targeting
children to create a new generation of smokers destined for
premature death.
</P>
<P>
   WHO Director General Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland warned there
would be a global explosion in tobacco use without international
efforts to ban or limit advertising, raise tobacco taxes and
educate the young.
</P>
<P>
   Between 3.5 million and 4 million people die each year from
tobacco use, Brundtland said. ''This will increase to 10 million in
25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland's comments came a day before the launch of World
No-Tobacco Day to highlight what she called a ''lifestyle attack''
by multinational tobacco firms through global advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The companies increasingly target the developing world to get
teen-agers hooked on smoking before they are old enough to know
about the health risks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the WHO, there are around 1.15 billion smokers out
of a world population of more than 6 billion. Growing numbers are
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland said the WHO had chosen Thailand for the launch of
No-Tobacco Day because the country had demonstrated the political
will to implement effective anti-smoking legislation, including an
advertising ban since 1992. The number of smokers in Thailand has
dropped around 10 percent over the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the WHO launched a campaign for a legally
binding global convention aimed at promoting education,
implementing advertising bans and combatting tobacco smuggling. It
is due for completion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilson, regional manager of corporate affairs for
British-American Tobacco, which has a 15 percent share of the
global cigarette market, said Tuesday the industry was being
''locked out'' of negotiations on the planned Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson denied that BAT -- which markets one brand of menthol
cigarettes in 45 countries called ''Kool'' -- was targeting youths
in its marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day people on this planet do things they choose to do
that aren't terribly wise on reflection, just like driving a
motorbike taxi in Bangkok,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Arrive in Libya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan
arrived in Libya Tuesday, an Egyptian news agency reported,
praising the suspension of sanctions against the North African
nation after it turned over two men suspected in the 1988 bombing
of an American jet.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan arrived in the capital of Tripoli for talks with the
leaders of Chad, Liberia, Mali and Libya, according to the Middle
East News Agency. The agency did not say what the talks with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi would focus on, and Libyan spokesmen in
Cairo and Tripoli could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of Chad, Liberia and Mali also arrived Tuesday in
Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Farrakhan celebrated last year's suspension of
sanctions against Libya, which handed over two Libyans suspected in
the 1988 plane explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland. The explosion
killed 270 people. The suspects are on trial in the Hague,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan called for the sanctions to be lifted for good.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan, who suffered a bout of prostate cancer in 1999, has
often raised controversy with his close ties to Gadhafi. His
arrival in oil-rich Libya marked his sixth visit to the state in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has played host to many African leaders over the last year
as Gadhafi tries to assume the role of the continent's peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Libya, Chad, Liberia and Mali are all members of the Sahel and
Saharan group, set up in 1998 to combat economic problems facing
its member-states. The group also includes Sudan, Burkina Faso,
Eritrea, Niger and the Central African Republic.

<HEADLINE> 110 Women Freed in Nicaragua  </HEADLINE>
By FILADELFO ALEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A third of Nicaragua's female
prisoners walked free Tuesday in a bizarre amnesty enacted by
Congress in honor of Mother's Day -- celebrated here on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty covered about 110 of the 300 women in Nicaraguan
prisons, including many convicted of murder, peddling drugs and
theft.
</P>
<P>
   During their last night at a women's prison outside Managua, a
mariachi band serenaded the jubilant prisoners from outside their
cells. On Tuesday, the somber prison turned into a festive dance
hall as the prisoners celebrated their new-found freedom with live
music.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Maria Fernanda de Aleman bid them farewell, passing
out clothes and other household items to help them start their
lives again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going straight home to see my kids,'' said Sheila Marquez,
a mother of four who served one year of a five-year sentence for
allowing drugs to be sold out of her home. ''One of them has been
acting up and becoming more rebellious since this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Others headed straight to the Metropolitan Cathedral to thank
God.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are sure that they will never commit crime again,'' said
congressman Nelson Artola, president of the congressional human
rights commission.
</P>
<P>
   Artola said most of the women were ''victims of a society that
gave them no options.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We gave them their freedom because most were pushed toward
crime by poverty and unemployment,'' Artola said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the country's 6,000 prisoners, about 300 were women, the
majority single mothers, Artola said.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress denied the amnesty to the remaining women based on
the seriousness of their crimes and their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Eugenia Espinoza, 33, has served seven years for murder,
but was told she must complete her 12-year sentence. Cruz Angelina
Gamez Hernandez, a 36-year-old mother of five, will remain in
prison awaiting trial on charges of stealing a pig.

<HEADLINE> Outraged Florio denounces rival for hiring private investigator  </HEADLINE>
	   By JOHN P. McALPIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- U.S Senate hopeful Jim Florio lashed out at
Democratic rival Jon Corzine on Tuesday for using private
detectives in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Florio called the move
''deplorable and unacceptable'' and said it typifies the arrogance
of Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a disgrace to our democracy. He's already made a mockery
of it just with sheer spending,'' Florio said of Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   According to Federal Election Commission reports, Corzine could
spend up to $33 million on his campaign up to the June 6 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Florio claimed operatives hired by Corzine's private attorney
called several of the former governor's staff members asking for
personal information about him, his family and key advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about dirt. Give me a break. Everybody knows what this is
about,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine hired New York attorney Stanley S. Arkin earlier this
year after people were photographing his home and calling his
family, said Corzine campaign spokesman Steven Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did what seemed natural, which was to call his attorney,''
Goldstein said. ''Jon simply instructed his attorney to get to the
bottom of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine told reporters Tuesday that he was unaware Arkin hired
the private investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon thinks his attorney overreached, but his attorney had to
protect the interests of the Corzine family,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly angry Florio said hiring a private investigator is
beyond the bounds of the normal opinion research done by political
campaigns. Florio repeatedly denied using similar tactics and said
he never investigated the private lives of opponents or their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the way we do things in this country. It sounds
like the KGB,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Corzine's use of professional investigators is common on
Wall Street, but has no place in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''His spending is obscene and what he's spending money on is
despicable,'' Florio said. ''He apparently will say anything, pay
anything and now we find out do anything in order to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes Corzine unfit for office, Florio said. In the past,
Florio said he would back a Democrat for Senate if he were not the
nominee. On Tuesday, Florio would not say if he would support
Corzine in a November election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan on winning,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio admitted his campaign workers went to Christie Whitman's
home to photograph her property in the 1993 gubernatorial election,
Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   But those staff members were on a public roadway and they were
there to see if Whitman's property qualified for a Homestead
rebate, Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin's firm hired a private investigator who had been involved
with the campaign against tobacco company informant Jeffery Wigand,
Florio alleged. Arkin did not immediately return calls for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he found out about the private investigators three
weeks ago when he was contacted by a former employee. But Florio
waited to address the issue until Tuesday, the day after the
Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Corzine's campaign paid for the
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Rider University professor David Rebovich said the use of
private investigators is not uncommon. Widely available handbooks
tell campaign managers to hire them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual is the extent to which the Corzine campaign
appears to have used them, Rebovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a matter of proportionality,'' he said. ''It represents
overkill.''

<HEADLINE> Pricey pretzels for GOP in Philly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Two dollars for a Philadelphia pretzel may
seem like brotherly extortion, not brotherly love.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be worse for hungry delegates to the upcoming
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Their Democratic
counterparts will be paying even more for caramelized,
Kahlua-drizzled confections in a city where even the food has
attitude -- Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, it's heft that gets people humming.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dems dine on strawberry-peach soup, the Grand Old
Party can plop down $165 for a ''Snacks and Junk'' basket, and dig
into a dozen Tastykakes, a dozen soft pretzels, a bag each of
Oreos, chocolate chip cookies and potato chips, six Hershey's
chocolate bars and six bags of peanut M&AMP;Ms.
</P>
<P>
   You could buy the same snacks, minus the pretzels, at a downtown
grocery store for $47.33. Another 50 cents will get you a pretzel
on a South Philly street corner.
</P>
<P>
   If Republican delegates get really hungry at the convention,
$249 will get them a sandwich in the deal -- a two-foot-long Italian
hoagie, plus a quart each of pasta and potato salads, and another
dozen Tastykakes and dozen pretzels.
</P>
<P>
   Aramark, the Philadelphia-based food giant, won the exclusive
right to cater convention events at the First Union Center. The
company, the world's third-largest food-services company, handles
food sales at other First Union Center events and will also feed
21,000 people at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Convention prices will not differ much from the $5 beers, $2.25
pretzels and $2 cups of coffee that Aramark charges Flyers and
Sixers fans. An Aramark spokesman said the prices -- $25 for a dozen
pretzels, $30 for a gallon of coffee and $25 for 12 pieces of fruit
-- are normal for special events in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are providing a competitive price structure that's within
hospitality-industry and local-market standards,'' spokesman Chris
Hardwick said. ''There are unique and significant costs associated
with this type of event, including transportation, additional labor
and employee training costs, the construction of portable kitchens,
and other costs related to operating in a temporary work
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Aramark will also offer convention groups a ''Society Hill
Feast,'' at $30 per person, that feeds 100 people. The buffet menu
includes chicken marsala, roasted potatoes, chilled poach salmon
with dill sauce, vegetable lasagna, Caesar salad and cannoli.
</P>
<P>
   Aramark will also feed the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles.
Their $35 lunch features a main course of duck-salad on greens.
Dinner is penne pasta with goat cheese, farm-raised venison with
honey and red-wine figs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone tempted to skirt convention prices with a call to
Domino's should think again. For security reasons, all food
deliveries to the First Union Center will be made at night, when
guards will have more time to inspect the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just isn't practical to call Domino's and tell them to
deliver eight pizzas,'' said veteran convention organizer Mike
Miller, executive director of media operations for the GOP
convention staff. ''You'd never get the food.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one Philadelphia caterer is disappointed that an
exclusive contract was given to Aramark, which contributed to civic
efforts to land the convention and which gives a piece of its First
Union sales to Comcast-Spectacor, which owns the building.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Packard hoped her Manayunk business, Food for Thought
Catering, would secure an $8,000 to $10,000 job feeding members of
the media at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a KO punch,'' Packard said.

<HEADLINE> Study: N. America Polution Rises  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Industrial pollution in North America has
increased for the first time since it's been monitored under the
North American Free Trade Agreement, according to a report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA-created Commission for Environmental Cooperation found
pollutants increased 1.2 percent in the United States and Canada in
1997 compared to levels in 1995, when the monitoring began. The
pollution totaled 1.4 million tons, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The report monitored the pollution produced by 20,555
facilities, mostly in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   But the study didn't measure pollution in Mexico, where a
monitoring system is still being set up. And the figures did not
include information on electricity plants and coal mines,
considered major polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Ferretti, executive director of the commission, said the
three countries in NAFTA -- the United States, Canada and Mexico --
want to reduce the amount of air and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as a society are not getting where we need to go,'' she
said in a telephone interview. ''There's much more work that needs
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We, for the first time, are seeing an upward trend'' in the
total pollution, Ferretti said. She said the increase in pollution
transferred by companies for disposal or recycling was particularly
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Rang, one of the report's authors, noted a large increase
in pollutants released directly into the environment by metals
companies, including steel plants and aluminum refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Companies attribute much of the increase in pollution to
increased production and changing economics, citing lower costs for
onsite disposal compared to transferring offsite for recycling, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a company that used to ship off its waste for
recycling or disposal might now bury it in an onsite landfill. That
method is classified as a direct release into the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has monitored pollution figures for 1994-97, Rang
said. The figures for 1996 were considered intermediate, so the
1997 figures were compared to those of 1995, she said.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Emerges As Villain  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- A failed Fijian businessman has emerged as the
villain of the idyllic South Pacific, and thus far George Speight's
approach is getting him most of what he wants -- except support.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his rebel backers are holding Fiji's prime minister
and more than 30 other people hostage in the tiny island nation's
parliamentary compound in a crisis that has gone on nearly two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Speight (pronounced SPATE) insisted Tuesday that the
martial law regime set up a day earlier by Commodore Frank
Bainimarama lacks enough popular support to stay in control, it
remains unclear whether Speight will end up with much power in
Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody has done much to crack down on Speight -- indeed
officials have been quick to negotiate with him -- and such
treatment could bode poorly for Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful trading partners including the United States, Australia
and New Zealand are not happy about the prospect of a
democratically elected Fijian government being thrown out by a
small band of gunmen -- and they have threatened economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove painful to Fiji, which depends on timber, sugar
cane and tourism -- but analysts also worry that Speight could
benefit from his political piracy and therefore set a troubling
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the tragedy of Fiji -- Speights will keep rising,''
said Brij Lal, a history professor and Fiji expert at Australian
National University.
</P>
<P>
   Lal called Speight a ''political son of Rabuka,'' referring to
the leader of Fiji's two bloodless coups in 1987 -- army Col.
Sitiveni Rabuka, who ruled for 12 years after toppling a
democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight failed in business in Australia but counted on
connections back home in Fiji to help him get ahead. When his
political clout dried up, Speight struck.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Sam Speight, was a senior member of Fiji's previous
government, which appointed the younger Speight as chairman of Fiji
Pine Ltd. and Fiji Hardwood Corp. Ltd., two companies involved in
managing Fiji's lucrative timber trade.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was fired from both jobs last year after Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry's election.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt certain he wasn't going to do so well under the new
government,'' Lal said. ''He's a megalomaniac. He's erratic. He's
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight threw Fiji into crisis on May 19 by seizing Chaudhry and
30 other members of the government.
</P>
<P>
   He has sought to mobilize support among the nation's ethnic
Fijians by attacking the ethnic Indian minority that has succeeded
in business and gained greater rights under a 1997 constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Speight is of mixed heritage, with a Fijian mother and a father
who is Fijian of European extraction. But he claims to be
representing ethnic Fijians angered by Chaudhry's ruling coalition,
dominated by the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Among his goals are a new constitution that gives ethnic Fijians
more rights.
</P>
<P>
   Speight hasn't limited his attacks to Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer accused Speight
this week of threatening to kill one hostage, President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara's daughter, Adi Koila Mara, an ethnic Fijian
legislator.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours Fiji's military was running the country and Mara
was out as president -- one of Speight's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Mara, who stepped in to run Fiji after the hostages were taken,
had previously indicated Speight and his rebels might be granted
immunity once the crisis ended. The military government indicated
Tuesday it would go along with Mara's promise, according to a BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things Bainimarama did was to throw out Fiji's
1997 constitution -- another of Speight's demands, although it
remained unclear whether the military had acted in deference to
Speight's wishes.

<HEADLINE> Reform Not on Texas Ballot in Nov.  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Reform Party, with its roots in the
presidential campaigns of Dallas billionaire Ross Perot, will not
be on the statewide ballot in November.
</P>
<P>
   The party notified the state's elections division Tuesday that
it would not file a petition to place its candidates on the ballot
before the 5 p.m. CDT deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Abt, a member of the party's national committee from
Texas, said the two major parties made it too difficult for his
party, which has never been on the ballot, to get on this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats and the Republicans made the hurdles so high,''
he said, adding that Pat Buchanan, the party's likely presidential
nominee, registered as independent three week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our likely presidential candidate decided to go the
independent route because he came to the same conclusion,'' Abt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan registered as an independent candidate May 8 by
submitting 129,000 signatures to the Texas elections office, more
than twice the 56,116 signatures required.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Steele, the state Reform Party chairman, has blamed
Buchanan for the party's inability to get the 37,380 signatures
required to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Reform Party did not get a penny in assistance from Mr.
Buchanan,'' Steele said during the weekend. ''He would have been a
hero if he would have helped us, in the state that is the
birthplace of the Reform Party, to get on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Buchanan campaign was not immediately returned
Tuesday. Steele also could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Dees, a spokeswoman for the elections office, said the
Green Party had submitted 74,000 signatures and the National Law
Party had turned in 76,000 signatures. The Constitutional Law Party
submitted 2,200 signatures late Tuesday-- well short of the 37,380
required, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party is an offshoot of the United We Stand party,
founded by Perot, who ran for president as an independent candidate
in 1992 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Premier Nixes Orphan Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC (AP) -- Premier Lucien Bouchard rejected a petition
Tuesday calling for an increase in a compensation offer to children
forced to live in orphanages where they say they were beaten and
raped.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 3,000 so-called Duplessis orphans, many who were
born out of wedlock in Quebec and forced to live in Roman Catholic
church orphanages when Marcel Duplessis led the province in the
1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the orphanages were reclassified as mental health
facilities to make them eligible for government money. Many of the
Duplessis orphans claim they were abused at the institutions,
including that some were given electroshocks and confined to
straitjackets even though there was nothing wrong with them.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's government has apologized to the orphans and offered
$2 million in compensation. The orphans want $13,425 each, for a
total of more than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard said the government intended to give the orphans
compensation as a group, not individuals, and that society is
unable to revisit or correct all the wrongs of history.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church has refused to apologize to the
orphans, saying such an act would deny the important contributions
made by religious communities under difficult conditions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber Leader Arrives in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
arrived in Havana on Tuesday for talks on increasing business with
Cuba -- one of several visits this week by U.S. officials interested
in developing ties with the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   A Congressional Black Caucus delegation also was expected,
joining a third delegation of Arkansas lawmakers and farmers, who
arrived Sunday hoping to develop agricultural contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Craig Johnstone, vice president of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, follows last year's visit by Chamber President Thomas
Donohue -- the first made by a U.S. Chamber official to Cuba since
the 1959 revolution brought Fidel Castro to power.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber has been especially interested in Cuba's small,
nascent private sector. After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet
Union, Cuba's communist government instituted modest economic
reforms to ease severe financial crisis by allowing a small group
of Cubans to open small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas lawmakers, meanwhile, were more focused on possible
changes back in the states, as the House of Representatives
considers easing a four-decade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Blanche Lincoln and Rep. Marion Berry, both Democrats, said
they hoped the House voted next week to eliminate restrictions on
American sales of food and medicine to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Caucus members were planning to meet with Cuban
lawmakers, educators, physicians and clergy during their visit,
which is aimed simply at helping them understand the country
better.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is ever to be improved relations between Cuba and the
United States, there must be dialogue and exchange,'' Rev. Lucius
Walker said in a bulletin announcing the group's visit.

<HEADLINE> 'M:I-2' Cruises to Record  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Cruise and John Woo made millions
possible with ''Mission: Impossible 2'' as the spy sequel ushered
in a record Memorial Day weekend at the box office to kick off the
summer movie season.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise and director Woo's glitzy thriller took in $70.8 million
over the four-day weekend, pushing its total since opening on May
24 to $91.8 million, distributor Paramount said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That is $1 million less than Paramount had estimated a day
earlier, but its gross still was about $17 million more than
''Mission: Impossible'' took in during its first six days over
Memorial Day weekend in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With holdovers ''Dinosaur,'' ''Gladiator'' and ''Road Trip''
remaining solid and Jackie Chan's ''Shanghai Noon'' debuting
strongly, the overall weekend box office hit $183.7 million for the
top 50 films. That smashed the Memorial Day record of $147.9
million in 1997, when ''Jurassic Park: The Lost World'' opened.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend also was the best four-day holiday ever at the box
office, edging the $183.3 million gross for the top 50 films from
Thursday to Sunday over Christmas 1997, when ''Titanic'' was in
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The big weekend gave another boost to Hollywood's prospects for
a third straight year of record revenues. It also was a promising
start toward beating last year's all-time summer high of $3 billion
at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very skeptical that this summer could beat last summer
till I saw how strong this weekend was,'' said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Through Monday, movies had grossed $2.68 billion domestically
this year, up 10 percent from 1999, which set a box-office record
for the year of $7.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Funeral Services for Florida Teacher  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The teacher who was shot to death
in a middle school hallway last week was honored at a memorial
service Tuesday as a beloved mentor, coach and counselor who
reached out to others ''even to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, colleagues, family and friends of Barry Grunow, 35,
carried single carnations and roses as they filed into Good
Shepherd United Methodist Church. Others waited in the center aisle
to view a collage of snapshots of Grunow placed on an easel between
sprays of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The music of Jethro Tull, one of Grunow's favorite groups,
filled the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barry was reaching out with grace, even to the end,'' the Rev.
Bill Corristan said. ''Even to the young man with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-grader Nathaniel Brazill is accused of gunning down
Grunow in a hallway Friday at Lake Worth Community Middle School
just before the last bell of the last day of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old boy, an honor roll student with perfect
attendance, was dismissed early from school that day by an
assistant principal for throwing water balloons.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to school two hours later with a gun allegedly
stolen from his grandfather's house. When Grunow wouldn't let the
boy in his classroom to talk to two girls, Brazill pulled the gun
from his pocket and shot Grunow in the head, police said. A school
security camera captured it all.
</P>
<P>
   A regularly scheduled grand jury was impaneled on Tuesday and
was to begin hear evidence in the case in one to two weeks, State
Attorney's office spokesman Mike Edmondson said. State Attorney
Barry Krischer has said he wants Brazill tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow, who taught English and coached basketball, leaves behind
a wife, Pam, 5-year-old son, Sam, and an infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush called Grunow's wife, Pam Grunow, on Monday night
to express his sympathy and offer his support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of this teacher, this dedicated teacher who was
living in the community, riding a bike to school so his wife could
attend to the needs of their family ... those are real heroes,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   One West Palm Beach radio station, WRMF-FM, devoted its morning
call-in show Tuesday to raising money to help with funeral
expenses. Callers had pledged $10,000 by noon.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial, the pastor read a eulogy written by Kurt
Grunow, one of Grunow's four siblings. The brother said he was too
emotional to talk.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the kind of person his brother was, Kurt Grunow
recalled how when Barry was a little boy he'd go outside and catch
bugs in a jar. He'd then put pennies and nickels in the yard,
because he didn't want to be stealing the bugs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet With Barak  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, meeting Thursday in Berlin, are expected to plan for a
Camp David-style three-way summit with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The summit would be in the Washington area, along the lines of
the 1978 summit that President Carter held at the Camp David
presidential retreat to propel Israel and Egypt to their landmark
peace treaty the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Clinton and Barak are likely to discuss at Berlin
earmarking $50 million of Israel's $1.8 billion U.S. military aid
to shore up Israel's border with Lebanon. Israel estimates the
overall cost of a new defense line at $300 million to $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army pulled out of southern Lebanon last week,
erasing a buffer zone that had shielded northern Israel from
cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has provided diplomatic help, mostly
by repeatedly urging restraint by Syria, the dominant power in
Lebanon, and pressing Lebanon to use its army to fill the power
vacuum Israel's withdrawal left.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has not requested U.S. peacekeeping troops for the force
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan plans to augment this summer. The
Clinton administration has not volunteered American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   From Israel's standpoint, U.S. messages to Syria are vital to
maintaining order along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic sources said U.S. and Israeli officials are near
agreement on allowing U.S. military aid to be used for a new border
defense line, thereby sending a message that the United States is
committed to a tranquil frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's abrupt departure prompted skirmishes and rising
tensions along the border and on the West Bank, but the area has
quieted down in the last few days. While the disarray impeded
Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians -- they were suspended --
the current calm is considered a potential spur to positive
results.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has begun conditioning the Israeli public to establishment
of a Palestinian state. He has offered some territory near
Jerusalem to Arafat, who wants to establish his capital in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   However, vital subjects remain undecided including dimensions of
the Palestinian state, Jerusalem's future and whether refugees are
to be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Barak and Arafat have set their sights on an overall
settlement by Sept. 13, but February and May deadlines for a
framework settlement passed without results. Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators held preliminary talks Tuesday in Jericho,
on the West Bank, and plan to resume full-scale talks in the region
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Any framework agreement could range in significance from
statements of principle and good intentions to the outline of the
final settlement. In any event, Israel is unlikely to draw a border
on a map between Israel and the new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel is prepared to be positive and constructive in making
this process work,'' Mark Regev, the spokesman for the Israeli
Embassy, said Tuesday. ''But Israel isn't negotiating in a
vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our ability to negotiate is also a function of the
Palestinians' coming to the table with a degree of flexibility and
a willingness to compromise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had planned to meet May 22 with Clinton at the White
House, but the pullout from Lebanon caused him to stay home. The
meeting in Berlin is designed to make up for the postponement. In
the meantime, Clinton sent Sandy Berger, his chief national
security adviser, to Israel for separate meetings with Barak and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both the president and the prime minister believe it is
important for them to meet at this time to discuss prospects for
reaching an Israeli-Palestinian framework agreement ... and assess
the situation following Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday in Lisbon, Portugal, the
first stop on a weeklong visit by Clinton to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Barak already had planned to go to Berlin to participate with
leaders of other governments in a ''Third Way'' summit hosted by
the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder. It is designed to promote
new approaches to politics that are neither traditionally liberal
nor conservative.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Gordon ''Tex'' Beneke, a singer and sax
player who took over the Glenn Miller Orchestra after the band
leader's death during World War II, died Tuesday of respiratory
arrest. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Beneke died at the Assured Horizons rest home in nearby Costa
Mesa, said the facility's owner, Sheryl Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Beneke joined the orchestra in 1938 and his sunny Southern voice
helped make hits of Miller's ''Chattanooga Choo Choo, ''I Gotta
Girl in Kalamazoo'' and ''Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   When Miller broke up the band in 1942 to join the military,
Beneke played with other bands before joining the Navy during World
War II. Although he played in the Navy Band, he never played in
Miller's Air Force orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was killed in December 1944 after his plane disappeared
and in 1946, Miller's widow asked Beneke to take the Glenn Miller
Orchestra back out on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Post-war audiences went wild for the reconstituted group, which
scored a string of Top 10 records. However, the band's manager and
producer insisted Beneke keep the sounds faithful to Miller's
pre-war work. The frustrated Beneke left and formed his own band.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he billed the performance as ''Tex Beneke and His
Orchestra: Playing the Music Made Famous by Glenn Miller.''
Rita Longa:
</P>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban sculptor Rita Longa, whose bronze and marble
creations grace the capital's Bellas Artes Palace and the Tropicana
nightclub, died Monday of a heart attack. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Longa began her sculpting career in the 1930s, and won Cuba's
National Salon Award for Painting and Sculpture in 1938. She
received international recognition at the 1951 Gold Medal
Exhibition in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, she directed the Center for Monumental and
Environmental Sculpture, and received the National Award for Visual
Arts in 1995.
Stanley Joseph Novak:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Stanley Joseph Novak, an electrical engineer who
worked in NASA's Apollo space program, died May 23 of heart
failure. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Novak developed the backup guidance system that helped the
Apollo 13 spacecraft return safely to earth in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   While at Northrop Corp., Novak adapted his Apollo 13 guidance
system for use on boosters for the Delta series rockets, which were
used to deploy spy satellites for the Department of Defense. His
designs also were used in the missile guidance and stabilization
systems in Rockwell's B-1 bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently Novak worked for GTE Government Systems Corp.'s
Strategic Systems Division in Needham, and worked on highly
classified defense projects, known as the Star Wars initiative.

<HEADLINE> Accused Scientist Challenges Gov't  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The government's refusal to name the
foreign nation that a fired nuclear scientist allegedly sought to
aid is unfair, defense attorneys said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee is accused of transferring restricted data from
secure to unsecure computers at Los Alamos National Laboratory and
to computer tapes. To win a conviction, prosecutors must show that
Lee acted with intent to injure the United States or to help a
foreign nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a response filed with U.S. District Judge John Conway, Lee's
lawyers said prosecutors provided evidence of Lee's travels,
primarily on lab business, to China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But they said: ''None of the materials provides evidence that
Dr. Lee intended to secure an advantage to any of those
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to know the name of the country for which Dr. Lee
allegedly intended to 'secure an advantage,''' defense attorneys
Mark Holscher and John Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told Conway on May 24 that the law does not require
them to disclose what nation or nations stood to benefit from Lee's
alleged actions.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors said they need not provide a ''bill of
particulars'' to supplement the indictment, the defense lawyers
said they do not want a whole bill -- just one particular: the name
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecution's refusal to identify the 'foreign nation' to
which Dr. Lee allegedly intended to 'secure and advantage' smacks
of gamesmanship,'' they said, contending the prosecution refused
their request ''because it wants to keep the element of surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese-born naturalized U.S. citizen is being held
without bail pending trial Nov. 6. The government has not alleged
that Lee, 60, passed any secrets to anyone, and he is not accused
of espionage. He is charged with 59 counts and could face life in
prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Details Cuban Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Coast Guard released a videotape Tuesday
showing Cuban immigrants swinging a machete and knives and throwing
rocks, cans and bolts from a rubber boat as guardsmen tried to
intercept them.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 were among 51 Cubans repatriated Tuesday. All were among
five groups picked up at sea by the Coast Guard last week.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials detailed the May 24 confrontation during a
news conference calling for an end to violence by Cubans trying to
reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is becoming a frequent and frightening occurrence,'' said
Lt. Cmdr. Ron LaBrec before showing a 24-minute video of the
confrontation 50 miles off Key West.
</P>
<P>
   ''Migrants apparently believe this behavior will increase their
chances of reaching shore. That belief is unfounded and
dangerous,'' said LaBrec, spokesman for the 7th Coast Guard
District in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Guardsmen were given permission to use pepper spray on the
resisting immigrants after being rebuffed for more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The men on board the small boat, which was powered by an
automobile engine, were finally stopped and taken aboard the two
cutters.
</P>
<P>
   Several Coast Guard crew members suffered cuts, bruises and
scrapes from the attacks. The Cubans were not injured.

Inauguration Protest Urged in Peru
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru AP) -- Defeated opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo on Tuesday
called for a march of four million protesters in Lima to block President Alberto
Fujimori's inauguration. Speaking to foreign journalists, Toledo said he is
planning the protest for July 26 -- two days before the presidential
inauguration, which takes place on a national holiday -- ''if Fujimori is still
around on that date,'' he said. Calling Fujimori a dictator who was fraudulently
re-elected Sunday, Toledo spelled out a three-pronged strategy to keep the
president from extending his stay in power for a third, five-year term.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's new military leaders threw out the nation's
constitution Tuesday and began negotiating with armed rebels whose seizure of
the prime minister and other hostages has sparked ethnic and political turmoil
in this Pacific nation. Rebel supporters hurled rocks at cars as military
officials met with the rebels in Suva, the capital. Meanwhile, the 11-day-old
hostage standoff continued among the lush, tropical gardens and swaying palm
trees of Fiji's nearby parliament complex. The rebels want Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister from the ethnic Indian minority,
removed from power and Fijians of Indian ancestry barred from leading the
country again.

Canada in 1997 compared to levels in 1995, when the monitoring began. The

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Open Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopia opened talks with Eritrea
on Tuesday, saying it had already won most of its aims through war
and boasting that its 18-day offensive had forced its humbled
neighbor to seek peace.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia announced hours before the talks started in Algiers
that it was withdrawing from one front seized in the latest
flare-up of the Horn of Africa countries' 2-year-old border war.
But a rumble of artillery in the jagged mountains of southern
Eritrea indicated the conflict may not yet be over.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrean soldiers taking shelter behind stony outcroppings
against Ethiopian barrages insisted they would fight until their
neighbor gives back all undisputed Eritrean land taken in the
month's fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no nation that wants war. We cannot accept other
people on our territory,'' Col. Habtu Gebrendas said as his gunners
fired toward the now Ethiopian-held southern Eritrean city of
Senafe.
</P>
<P>
   The southern front in the past weeks has seen the fiercest
fighting of the sporadic war over the countries' poorly delineated
620-mile border. The conflict has cost two of the world's poorest
countries hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousand of
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier talks reached a peace accord, but broke down May 6 over
technicalities of implementing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia sent its artillery, aircraft and infantry into Eritrea
eight days after the talks failed -- pledging its forces would
withdraw only when they had reclaimed all land seized by Eritrea at
the outset of the war and broken Eritrea's military.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was at or near that point, Ethiopia declared Tuesday
it had withdrawn from Eritrea's regional capital of Barentu and
other captured territory in the west. The withdrawal could not
immediately be verified independently.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the Ethiopian government has reiterated on numerous
occasions, it has no interest in occupying sovereign Eritrean
territory and, having achieved its goals, it has withdrawn its
troops accordingly,'' Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome
Taddesse said in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of a ''humiliating and devastating defeat'' that had
Eritrea begging for new talks.
</P>
<P>
   The indirect talks underway Tuesday in Algeria are sponsored by
the Organization of African Unity with U.S. and European envoys in
attendance. Mediators are serving as go-betweens for delegations
led by the warring countries' foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea already agreed under an increasingly punishing assault
last week to withdraw from all disputed territory and return to the
negotiations without conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Ethiopian warplanes bombed a military airstrip at the
very edge of Eritrea's capital of 500,000 -- taking the offensive to
the central city of Asmara for the first time since the first weeks
of the war. The air raid suggested Ethiopia ''wanted to overrun
Eritrea,'' Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldentensae complained
to reporters in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Eritrea appeared keen to show its army remained a
fighting force even as its diplomats sought peace. Officials took
journalists to see the anti-aircraft batteries, tanks, artillery
and troops lined up against any Ethiopian advance through the
southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The whoosh of incoming artillery fire and white patches on the
stone peaks around the troops signaled Ethiopian troops still held
Senafe, eight miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, Ethiopian forces advanced 20 miles into Eritrea to
seize the city, emptied by the panicked flight of its 20,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to take it back,'' said Habtu, the Eritrean
commander, as the smoke of firing Eritrean artillery engulfed the
gunners, spotters and ammunition carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In Addis Ababa, Selome denied there had been any fighting at
that front for three days, despite what journalists saw and heard
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ragtag cordons of villagers displaced by the southern fighting
trudged toward safety on roads from the front -- joining an
estimated 550,000 people already displaced by the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10,000 Eritreans poured over the border into Sudan
Monday and early Tuesday, exhausted and in desperate need of food
and water, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in Geneva.

   Reid Cornelius took a shutout into the eighth inning, but
Pittsburgh scored on singles by pinch-hitter Adrian Brown and

the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Redman (4-0) gave up one run, struck out five and walked three

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, Royals 2  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- On a night when Boston beat the Kansas City Royals
8-2, Red Sox third baseman John Valentin appeared to seriously
injure a knee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon, Carl Everett and Mike Stanley homered to lead
Boston, but the injury to Valentin seemed to be the night's most
significant event.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin's left leg crumpled under him when he went to field
Carlos Beltran's ground ball in the second inning. Valentin was
taken to a hospital for tests, and no additional information was
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran, who was credited with a single, scored on Brian
Johnson's fielder's choice to make it 2-1 before Boston put the
game away in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who homered with two outs in the ninth inning to beat the
Yankees on Sunday night, received a 20-second standing ovation
before his first at-bat on Tuesday. He hit a 3-1 pitch over the
Green Monster in left field to give Boston a lead it never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero (6-1) allowed two runs and eight hits in 6 2-3
innings, striking out four to win his fifth consecutive decision.
Nomar Garciaparra was 3-for-4 with his first stolen base of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Suppan (2-5), who came up in the Red Sox farm system,
lasted just 2 2-3 innings, allowing six runs and eight hits and
four walks. He has allowed 15 homers in 70 innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Everett and Stanley hit back-to-back homers in the third to make
it 5-1. Troy O'Leary walked, took third on Jason Varitek's double
and scored on Suppan's wild pitch to make it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach doubled and scored in the fourth, and Nixon walked
and scored in the sixth to make it 8-1. Carlos Febles singled, took
third on Mike Sweeney's double and scored on Jermaine Dye's
groundout to make it 8-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Febles broke an 0-for-10 slump with a first-inning single.
... The Red Sox lead the major leagues with seven shutouts. ....
Boston won the season series 8-2 last year. ... The Royals are 17-7
at home and 8-18 on the road. ... The outing was Suppan's shortest
of the year, and it matched the most runs he has allowed. ...
Fassero won only five games all of last year.

<HEADLINE> Study: N. America Pollution Rises  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Industrial pollution in North America has
increased for the first time since it's been monitored under the
North American Free Trade Agreement, according to a report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA-created Commission for Environmental Cooperation found
pollutants increased 1.2 percent in the United States and Canada in
1997 compared to levels in 1995, when the monitoring began. The
pollution totaled 1.4 million tons, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The report monitored the pollution produced by 20,555
facilities, mostly in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   But the study didn't measure pollution in Mexico, where a
monitoring system is still being set up. And the figures did not
include information on electricity plants and coal mines,
considered major polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Ferretti, executive director of the commission, said the
three countries in NAFTA -- the United States, Canada and Mexico --
want to reduce the amount of air and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as a society are not getting where we need to go,'' she
said in a telephone interview. ''There's much more work that needs
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We, for the first time, are seeing an upward trend'' in the
total pollution, Ferretti said. She said the increase in pollution
transferred by companies for disposal or recycling was particularly
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Rang, one of the report's authors, noted a large increase
in pollutants released directly into the environment by metals
companies, including steel plants and aluminum refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Companies attribute much of the increase in pollution to
increased production and changing economics, citing lower costs for
onsite disposal compared to transferring offsite for recycling, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a company that used to ship off its waste for
recycling or disposal might now bury it in an onsite landfill. That
method is classified as a direct release into the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has monitored pollution figures for 1994-97, Rang
said. The figures for 1996 were considered intermediate, so the
1997 figures were compared to those of 1995, she said.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Put Meche on 15-Day DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Right-hander Gil Meche, who developed a ''dead
arm'' in his last start, was placed on the 15-day disabled list by
the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meche, 21, was disabled retroactive to Monday and the Mariners
recalled right-hander Kevin Hodges from Triple-A Tacoma to take
Meche's roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   Meche underwent tests, but doctors could determine only that
Meche's right shoulder had been strained.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that's come out of it is a dead arm,'' Meche
said. ''My arm is just tired. It's not a big concern for me because
it doesn't hurt. Hopefully, everything goes well in the next couple
of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche, who felt the injury Sunday in Tampa Bay, is supposed to
pitch a simulated game on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to treat this with caution,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ''Gil's got a great career ahead of him and we don't want to
do anything to jeopardize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche was 1-4 with a 4.21 ERA in 10 starts and 57 2-3 innings
this season. He was bothered by tightness in his right shoulder in
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners already have two starting pitchers, left-hander
Jamie Moyer and right-hander Freddy Garcia, on the disabled list.
Moyer is scheduled to come off the disabled list and pitch Friday
night against San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Padres Demote Hitting Coach Oglivie  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- After going nine seasons with the same hitting
coach, the San Diego Padres are going on their second one this year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling that some players weren't responding to his approach,
the Padres demoted Ben Oglivie to their Arizona Rookie League club
in Peoria on Tuesday. He will be replaced on Wednesday by Duane
Espy, manager of the Triple-A Las Vegas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   In other moves, left-hander Sterling Hitchcock, the Padres'
opening day starter, was put on the 15-day disabled list with a
sprained left elbow and left-handed reliever Matt Whisenant was
designated for assignment. Hitchcock, 1-6 with a 4.93 ERA, was hurt
Friday night and might require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves cleared roster space for the Padres to purchase the
contract of right-hander Adam Eaton from Double-A Mobile and recall
right-hander Rodrigo Lopez from Las Vegas. Eaton was to make his
big league debut Tuesday night against Milwaukee and Lopez is
scheduled to start Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, an eight-time NL batting champion and member of the
3,000-hit club, had Tuesday night off due to his degenerative left
knee and served as interim hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Oglivie got the job after Merv Rettenmund left for the Atlanta
Braves following last season, his ninth with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Towers said it was tough to reassign
Oglivie, and added that some players had told he and manager Bruce
Bochy that they weren't getting what they needed from Oglivie.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a good person, and I mean that a lot,'' Towers said. ''It
was a little bit of a lack of communication with players. I think
they all really liked the guy a lot as a person, but I just don't
know if they felt they were getting enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers said it became clear late in spring training that the
Padres would have to make a change, and they didn't want the
situation to linger the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ''This wasn't stat driven,'' Towers said. ''You make decisions
on this, it's based on improving not only the players who will be
coming but the current players on your big league club and wanting
them to get better and progress. Even though they're at the big
league level they need to continue to learn and get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were with Pittsburgh for sixth in the NL with a .272
team average.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who struggled earlier this season because of his knee,
said he got what he needed out of Oglivie.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really not his fault,'' Gwynn said. ''I just think that
for a lot of the players' taste he wasn't aggressive enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn said he had the same approach with Oglivie as with the
other hitting coaches he's had, and he expects to have the same
approach with Espy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to say, 'Duane, when I'm going good, this is what I
do; when I'm going bad, this is what I do. I want you to be my eyes
when I'm up here at the plate and if you see me doing the wrong
things, point it out to me and if I'm doing the right thing, you
don't have to say anything because I'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin, who's batting .328 with a team-high 13 homers and 39
RBIs, was surprised with the move.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said he gets as much help from Gwynn and Dave
Magadan as he does from the hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it probably sounds bad, but I honestly don't spend much
time with the hitting coach, except when I was in Anaheim because
of Rod (Carew),'' Nevin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even when Merv was here last year, supposedly the best hitting
coach in the game, I relied mostly on Tony and Magadan. Those guys
know my swing as well as anyone just because they've seen my swing
for a long time. It wasn't any different this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevin said Oglivie helped plenty of Padres batters, including
Ruben Rivera, who hit .195 last year but is now batting .262.
</P>
<P>
   Oglivie hit 235 homers in his 16-year major league career. He
had been a minor league coach with Milwaukee and Pittsburgh the
previous 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Franklin, the Padres' roving minor league instructor, will
become manager at Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Former Penn. Gov. Casey Dies at 68  </HEADLINE>
By PETER JACKSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Former Gov. Robert P. Casey, the
strong-willed Scranton Irishman who spoke passionately against
abortion and overcame 20 years of dashed hopes to become governor,
died Tuesday. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Casey suffered from a genetic condition called familial
amyloidosis, which forced him to undergo a rare heart-liver
transplant in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Casey was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent
radiation treatments. He had been in and out of the hospital
several times over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Casey died of a serious infection at Mercy Hospital in Scranton,
a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative Democrat, Casey relentlessly berated his party
and its 1992 presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, for abandoning
its traditional constituencies with what Casey called an
abortion-on-demand philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ''My party, the Democratic Party, should be the protector and
claims to be the protector of the powerless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to get back to what this country is all about,
protecting all of the powerless ... . And that includes unborn
children.''
</P>
<P>
   He made headlines in 1992 when he was denied a chance to speak
at the Democratic National Convention. And in March 1995, he formed
an exploratory committee to challenge Clinton for the 1996
nomination, only to drop the effort a month later, saying he was
not sure he could sustain ''the extraordinary energy level required
by a national campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He was elected governor in 1986 on his fourth try and re-elected
handily in 1990. He was ineligible to run for a third consecutive
term in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Casey prided himself on overseeing a frugal
government with a caring touch.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed through a health insurance program for children,
comprehensive car insurance reform, a multibillion-dollar program
to rebuild water systems and additional environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   His low points were losing a referendum in 1989 for tax reform
and signing more than $1 billion in new taxes in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Casey lacked arrogance even as he ascended the political
pinnacle. His shyness sometimes came across as stiffness. But he
made time for people, even taking time once to go to the Capitol
newsroom to congratulate a reporter for a decade on the job. He was
a faithful churchgoer and often could be seen at Sunday Mass at St.
Patrick's Cathedral near the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, Casey was a consummate politician, albeit a stubborn
one at times.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's gotten his head kicked in a couple times and he's kicked
in some other heads and he's come out of it with an amazingly
idealistic view of government, of people and just a tremendous
reservoir of positive attitude,'' his son Bobby said in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Once Casey achieved his dream of being governor, health problems
intruded. In office only nine months in 1987, Casey underwent
quadruple bypass surgery after doctors found he had suffered a
silent heart attack. He adopted a rigorous diet that transformed
his appearance from full-faced to drawn. Questions about his health
lingered and in 1991 rumors swept the Capitol that Casey had
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in July 1991, Casey announced that he had been diagnosed
with familial amyloidosis, a disease that causes proteins to invade
the heart and other vital organs. When he underwent the transplant
two years later, doctors said the replacement of his liver should
stop the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York City, Casey grew up in Scranton. He was
married to the former Ellen Harding and they had eight children.
</P>
<P>
   He started his public career in 1962 when he was elected to the
state Senate at age 31. A former scholarship basketball player at
Holy Cross College in Massachusetts, Casey had the athletic good
looks that helped make him an instant star with the statewide
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   He was endorsed for governor for the 1966 primary but lost. In
1968, Casey was elected state auditor general and in 1970 again
received the party nod for governor, but again lost the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite gaining a reputation as a watchdog for taxpayers while
auditor general between 1969 and 1977, Casey couldn't convert that
trust to a gubernatorial victory. He lost in the 1978 primary while
another Bob Casey, a Pittsburgh school teacher, apparently fooled
voters and won the lieutenant governor's primary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Casey finally exorcised the ghosts of primaries past
and defeated Philadelphia District Attorney Edward Rendell for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a then unknown political consultant, Casey used
a bittingly negative television ad to ensure a narrow gubernatorial
win that November. The consultant, James Carville, went on to help
Clinton win the presidency in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Priest To Obey Vatican on Gays  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN MANNING
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Catholic priest said Tuesday he will adhere
to a Vatican order that he not discuss homosexuality or the
decade-long process that led church authorities to end his ministry
to gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Nugent said he will abide by the decision issued
last week by the Vatican, silencing him and Sister Jeannine
Gramick. Nugent and Gramick established the New Ways Ministry in
Mt. Rainier in 1977 as a center for gay and lesbian Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Both were informed in July in a Vatican decision, known as a
notification, that they had to stop their ministry. However, the
two publicly discussed the process that led to the edict, and
continued to speak about homosexuality according to their
interpretation of the notification.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent and Gramick were summoned to Rome last week and informed
of the Vatican's latest decision by their respective religious
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am now prohibited from speaking or writing in the public
forum about the Notification itself, about the ecclesiastical
process that led to it or about the issue of homosexuality,''
Nugent said in a short statement sent to The Associated Press
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to his statement when reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gramick said last week that she would not follow the Vatican
decision, a move that could jeopardize her 40-year membership in
her order, the School Sisters of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic doctrine condemns homosexual acts but says that
gays and lesbians should not be shunned by the church.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Dean Palmer homered and drove in five runs, and
Brian Moehler won for the first time since April 11 as the Detroit
Tigers beat the Texas Rangers 7-4 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers won for just the second time in their last six games.
Detroit once again played without former Rangers star Juan
Gonzalez, who missed his second straight game with a strained left
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is 3-5 on a nine-game road trip that ends Thursday and has
lost five of seven since a seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer hit a three-run homer in the third. He also had a
sacrifice fly in the first and an RBI single in the seventh. His
homer was the Tigers' first with two on since Palmer did it April
17 against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler (2-3) gave up three runs and seven hits in 5 2-3
innings. He was making his third start since coming off the
disabled list from an emergency appendectomy April 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers hadn't scored any runs for Moehler in the other two
starts but jumped on Esteban Loaiza (3-3) for five runs after three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who had his last two starts, allowed five runs and 10
hits in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson, sent to Detroit in the nine-player deal that
included Gonzalez, pitched 2 2-3 innings and left after allowing an
RBI single to Chad Curtis in the ninth. Todd Jones got the final
out for his 14th save in 15 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight hits, including Bobby Higginson's RBI single, and
a sacrifice fly from Palmer gave the Tigers a 2-0 lead in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's 10th home run was one of five straight hits that made
it 5-0 in the third. Detroit didn't score more only because Rich
Becker, who started the inning with a single, was picked off first
by catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler was cruising with a three-hitter and had faced just one
batter over the minimum through five innings before the Rangers
knocked him out with a three-run sixth. Luis Alicea hit a two-run
double after a leadoff double from Mike Lamb and Royce Clayton's
single, and Rodriguez added a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer had an RBI single and Robert Fick a sacrifice fly as the
Tigers added two more in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tigers INF Gregg Jefferies is expected to miss at least a
month with a severe left hamstring pull he suffered legging out an
infield hit Monday. He went on the DL Tuesday and was replaced on
the 25-man roster by C Javier Cardona, who was recalled from
Triple-A Toledo. ... RHP Francisco Cordero was the first of the
nine players involved in the Tigers-Rangers trade to appear in the
series when he relieved Loaiza in the sixth. ... Palmer's
club-leading 10th homer leaves Minnesota as the only major league
team without a double-digit home run hitter. ... Moehler's only
other win this season was a 5-2 decision over Seattle in Comerica
Park's inaugural game.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 7, Yankees 4  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch hit a leadoff home run, but
later made yet another throwing error that let the Oakland
Athletics rally past the New York Yankees 7-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After two crisp and clean games at Yankee Stadium, this one was
messy from the start. Kevin Appier and Ramiro Mendoza combined to
walk 11 in the first five innings, and neither side was retired in
order until the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez hit solo home runs off
Appier (5-3). Oakland's bullpen shut out the Yankees in the final
four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde, who made an unassisted triple play and homered
for the Athletics a day earlier, had a double and single and walked
twice. He drove in a run, scored one and stole a base.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza (5-3), who shut out Chicago in his previous start, took
a 4-2 lead into the fifth but walked Velarde and Jason Giambi
starting the inning. Ben Grieve followed with a potential
double-play grounder to second, and Knoblauch had trouble getting
the ball out of his glove before making a low throw that pulled
Jeter off the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's throwing problems have been a constant source of
concern for the Yankees, and he recently said -- perhaps joking,
perhaps not -- that he would retire if they persisted. The one-time
Gold Glove winner had nine assists Monday against the A's, and
turned double plays in the first two innings Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After his poor throw loaded the bases, Olmedo Saenz had an RBI
grounder and Matt Stairs hit a two-run single for a 5-4 lead. That
finished Mendoza, who walked a career-high six.
</P>
<P>
   Appier was constantly pitching in and out of trouble. He escaped
bases-loaded jams in the second and third innings without any runs
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees stranded 11, and were just 1-for-11 with runners in
scoring position. Jorge Posada walked four times for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve hit an RBI double in the sixth for a 6-4 lead and singled
home a run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Appier left after giving up Knoblauch's leadoff double in the
bottom half, and T.J. Mathews, Jeff Tam and Jason Isringhausen
combined for scoreless relief. Isringhausen got his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch hit his 28th career leadoff home run. Jeter opened the
second with his first home run since April 18, but the inning ended
when Knoblauch grounded into a double play with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Hall of Fame has asked for the glove and ball Velarde
used for the triple play. ... The Yankees activated OF Felix Jose
from the 15-day disabled list and designated OF Lance Johnson for
assignment. ... Giambi has no RBIs in the last seven games, all on
the road. ... Indianapolis 500 winner Juan Montoya threw out the
first ball. He made a wild toss that two-hopped off the backstop.
... Jeter had three hits. He is 10-for-15 since coming off the
disabled list.

<HEADLINE> Expos' Irabu Has Torn Knee Cartilage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Montreal starter Hideki Irabu had an MRI test
Tuesday that found torn cartilage in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, who was scheduled to start Wednesday against the
Cincinnati Reds, instead will return to Montreal to meet with
orthopedic surgeon Dr. Larry Coughlin. Irabu could have
arthroscopic surgery Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu had soreness in the knee after his last start, on May 26,
an 8-2 loss in San Diego. He's 2-4 with a 7.58 ERA in 10 starts,
giving up 72 hits and 41 runs in 48 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos got Irabu from the New York Yankees on Dec. 22 as part
of a four-player deal that included right-hander Jake Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mike Johnson (0-0) will start in Irabu's place
Wednesday. Johnson has made nine relief appearances this season,
but started 14 games for the Expos over the last three seasons.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Military Tosses Constitution  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's new military leaders threw out the
nation's constitution Tuesday and began negotiating with armed
rebels whose seizure of the prime minister and other hostages has
sparked ethnic and political turmoil in this Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   As the hostage standoff entered its 12th day Wednesday, rebel
supporters armed with rifles, clubs and knives, vented their anger
by stoning cars, dragging out the drivers and robbing them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were ethnic Indians, members of the group
that rebel leader George Speight and his followers say should yield
power to ethnic Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed soldiers manning roadblocks throughout the
capital, Suva, did not immediately intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials met Tuesday with the rebels in Suva as the
hostage standoff continued among the lush, tropical gardens and
swaying palm trees of Fiji's nearby parliament complex.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and the more than 30 other
hostages -- many of them members of Chaudhry's government -- have
been held captive since May 19 by attempted coup leader Speight.
The rebels want Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister from the
ethnic Indian minority, removed from power and Fijians of Indian
ancestry barred from leading the country again.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full day in power, army leader Commodore Frank
Bainimarama revoked Fiji's constitution but said other laws still
apply subject to further decrees by his ''interim military
government.'' Bainimarama -- who took power Monday as President Ratu
Sir Kamisese Mara stepped down amid unrest in Fiji's streets -- told
the BBC he intends to grant Speight amnesty when the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a promise made by his excellency (Mara) and we intend
to carry that forward,'' Bainimarama told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   But Speight rejected Bainimarama's authority and said only half
the military supports him.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader said he would meet senior army officers for
negotiations to end the crisis but would not talk with Bainimarama.
Speight accused Bainimarama of remaining loyal to Mara, whose
resignation had been one of Speight's main demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Commodore Bainimarama is a lost cause,'' Speight told
a news conference. ''I think he is so blinded by his allegiances to
Ratu Mara that it clouds his ability to take the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, a delegation of four military officers met
Speight's representatives at a theological college near parliament.
Outside the meeting, rebel supporters threw rocks at cars.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bainimarama announced that Ratu Epeli Nailatikau
had been appointed interim prime minister in the new military
government. Nailatikau is a former army commander and husband of
former President Mara's daughter, Adi Koila Mara, who is among the
hostages inside parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The developments were the latest in a crisis that has sprung
from ethnic tensions in Fiji, which lies 2,250 miles northeast of
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Fijians of Indian ancestry make up 44 percent of the population
of 813,000, but control much of the commerce. For months, ethnic
tensions have been building between them and indigenous Fijians who
blame the 1997 constitution for giving too much political power to
the ethnic Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a member of the indigenous Fijian majority, had made
the scrapping of the constitution one of his demands. He also wants
his self-styled Taukei civilian government installed. Taukei is a
nationalist ethnic Fijian movement.
</P>
<P>
   A 48-hour curfew imposed in Fiji on Monday was lifted early
Tuesday, and the streets of Suva were generally calm and orderly,
with many people returning to work. But soldiers did not meet
Bainimarama's Monday promise to restrict access to the
parliamentary grounds. Several hundred rebel supporters gathered
inside the complex Tuesday, singing songs and holding traditional
lovos -- a type of barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and countries including Australia, New
Zealand and the United States have criticized Fijian forces for
failing to crack down on Speight and his allies. Sanctions have
been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer urged
the military to make way for civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the military as soon as possible -- and I don't mean by
that months later but as soon as possible -- to restore civilian and
democratic government,'' Downer told Australia's Nine Network
television company. He told parliament that Bainimarama has
indicated he will work toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   When the crisis began, Bainimarama's military took little
action. However, the day after a mob supporting Speight killed a
policeman and knocked Fiji television off the air, Mara agreed to
stand aside as president and the military declared martial law. The
policeman's death was the first in the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Downer, the Australian foreign minister, said Tuesday that Mara
had been put on a Fijian navy patrol boat sailing off the coast for
his safety.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Tuesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Angels-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: 3B Troy Glaus made his 13th error of the season in the
second inning, throwing wildly on a potential double play ball that
allowed the Indians to score two runs. Earlier in the inning, SS
Benji Gil made his 12th when he booted an easy grounder. The 25
errors is one more that the entire Cleveland team. ... With a steal
Tuesday night, the Angels have 38 steals in 52 games. They didn't
get their 38th steal last season until their 103rd game.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Indians LHP Chuck Finley will face the Angels for the
first time on Wednesday. Finley spent 14 seasons with the Angels,
and ranks first in club history in wins, games pitched, innings
pitched and starts. ''It's kind of weird,'' Finley said. ''It will
be strange when guys step into the (batter's) box and I'll have a
story with every one of them.'' ... The Indians sold the rights to
the fans' walkway in left field which is now known as the Pepsi
Home Run Porch. The porch made its debut on Monday when
coincidentally the Indians failed to homer for the first time in 20
games.
Royals-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Kansas City opened a nine game road trip on
Tuesday. In their only other nine-game trip this season, they went
0-9. ... The Royals are 17-7 at home and 8-17 on the road. ...
Tuesday's starter, Jeff Suppan, debuted with the Red Sox in 1995.
He was drafted by Arizona in the 1997 expansion draft and then sold
to the Royals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Trot Nixon, who hit the game-winning home run in
Sunday's epic victory over Roger Clemens and the Yankees, received
a 20-second standing ovation from the crowd before his first inning
at-bat. Nixon hit a two-run homer to give Boston a 2-0 lead. ...
The Red Sox lead the majors with seven shutouts. .... Boston won
the season series 8-2 last season. ... Boston leads the majors with
a 3.47 ERA. They have not led both leagues in ERA since 1914.
Athletics-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Jason Giambi began the night 4-for-24 with no RBIs
through the first six games of the Athletics' eight-game road trip.
... With Oakland starting interleague play Friday with a visit from
San Francisco, manager Art Howe is holding off on having his
pitchers work on their hitting. ''When we get home, we might let
the starters take batting practice. We don't want anyone getting
hurt. Kenny Rogers got hurt like that, didn't he?'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Indianapolis 500 winner Juan Montoya threw out the
first ball. Clearly, he feels more comfortable inside a car than on
the mound -- his pitch sailed wide and wildly over catcher Jorge
Posada and two-hopped off the backstop. ... OF Felix Jose was
activated from the 15-day DL and OF Lance Johnson was designated
for assignment. ... With the Yankees beginning interleague play
Friday with a series at Atlanta, Roger Clemens and the starting
pitchers took batting practice. ... Chuck Knoblauch hit his 28th
career leadoff home run, and first this season, on Tuesday. The
second baseman also turned double plays in the first two innings.
Orioles-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: C Charles Johnson and DH Harold Baines returned to
the lineup after sitting out the opener of the four-game series.
Johnson missed two games after being hit in the groin by a foul
tip. ... Manager Mike Hargrove will miss games Saturday and Sunday
at Montreal to attend his son's high school graduation. Bench coach
Jeff Newman will fill in. ... Will Clark, 6-for-26 in his first
eight games since being activated from the DL on May 18, batted
fifth for the second straight game. Baines usually bats in that
spot, but has been struggling (.240, four homers and 13 RBIs) and
shifted to the seventh spot.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: DH Greg Vaughn wasn't in the starting lineup for the
fourth straight day because of a strained right hamstring. He
pinch-hit in the eighth inning Monday and struck out. ... RHP Juan
Guzman, on the DL with a sore shoulder, made a rehab start Tuesday
for Class-A St. Petersburg at Lakeland ... Through seven games of a
10-game homestand, Tampa Bay relievers worked 36 2-3 innings
compared to 26 1-3 innings by starting pitchers ... The Devil Rays
have used 38 players this season. Of the current 25-man roster, 11
(44 percent) were not with the team on opening day.
Rangers-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers' 3-2 win Monday marked only the third time
this season that the club won with fewer than five runs. All three
have occurred in the past 11 days. ... RHP John Wetteland's save
Monday gave him 11 for May, breaking the previous one-month club
record of 10 set by Mike Henneman in May 1996 and matched by
Wetteland in August 1998. It also tied the AL record for saves in
May reached four times previously.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: LHP C.J. Nitkowski (2-7) has lost his spot in the
rotation. He leads the AL in losses, and his ERA (7.30), hits per
nine innings (13.3) and baserunners per nine innings (17.3) are
second-worst to Minnesota's Sean Bergman. Nitkowski's demotion
leaves the Tigers with no southpaws in their rotation. RHP Willie
Blair will take the fifth spot starting Monday at Pittsburgh.
Twins-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins have won just one season series (1996)
against Toronto in the past 10 years, going 38-72 in that span. But
Minnesota also won the most important series of all during that
span, beating Toronto 4-1 in the 1991 ALCS. ... Minnesota ace Brad
Radke will start against David Wells on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Marty Cordova played against his former team for the
first time since the Twins allowed him to leave as a free agent in
the offseason. Cordova was the AL Rookie of the Year in 1995. He is
Toronto's fourth outfielder and their DH against left-handers. ...
Tony Batista has played in 151 consecutive games. ... Toronto
pitchers took batting practice in preparation for their series
against Florida this weekend.
White Sox-Mariners
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Manager Jerry Manuel will leave after Tuesday's game
and fly back to Chicago to attend his son Anthony's graduation from
Sandburg High School in Orland Park, Ill., on Wednesday. Bench
coach Joe Nossek will manage the White Sox against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: RHP Gil Meche was placed on the 15-day DL with a
strained right shoulder and recalled RHP Kevin Hodges from Triple-A
Tacoma. Meche, 21, came out of Sunday's 14-4 loss by the Mariners
in Tampa Bay last Sunday because of ''a dead arm.'' In 10 starts
and 57 2-3 innings this season, Meche is 1-4 with a 4.21 ERA. Meche
was bothered by tightness in his right shoulder in spring training.
... In 13 games in Tacoma, all relief appearances, Hodges was 0-1
with a 1.77 ERA.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Braves-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: With RHP pitcher Greg McMichael on the DL, the Braves
purchased the contract of RHP Don Wengert from Triple-A Richmond.
Wengert, 30, is 14-29 with a 5.74 ERA in five seasons with Oakland,
San Diego, the Cubs and Kansas City. ''He's a veteran guy, he's
been around awhile,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. Wengert will
work out of the bullpen, but Cox said he doesn't have a specific
role. ... McMichael, on the DL with tendinitis in his right biceps,
will be examined Thursday. ... The Braves' two hits Monday were
their fewest in a victory since April 3, 1997, when they got two in
a 3-2 victory at Houston. ... Seven of Andres Galarraga's 13 home
runs have tied the game or given Atlanta the lead in the fifth
inning or later.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: With RHP Ismael Valdes still bothered by a hamstring,
Cubs manager Don Baylor gave RHP Ruben Quevedo the start against
the Braves. ''He tried to do some things to show me he was ready,
but after talking to the doctors yesterday ... I felt the best
thing to do was skip a turn,'' Baylor said. ... Quevedo, called up
from Triple-A Iowa before the game, was on the Cubs' roster earlier
this season, working five times out of the bullpen. He was 0-2 with
a 27.00 ERA in 3 2-3 innings. Since then, however, he has gone 3-0
with a 4.29 ERA in six starts at Triple-A Iowa. He struck out 10 in
his last outing. ... The Cubs have been plagued by a lot of bad
hamstrings this season, and Baylor said one reason might be all the
nutritional supplements players take. The same thing happened when
he was managing in Colorado, Baylor said. ''I saw it with Todd
Helton and Mike Lansing. They had hamstring problems with those
supplements so they had to stop taking them,'' Baylor said. Did he
ever use supplements when he was playing? ''Vitamin E,'' he said.
''A shot in the rear end every now and then.''
Marlins-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Manager John Boles said starter Vladimir Nunez's poor
performance against the Pirates on Monday was a matter of command.
''Even if the pitch was a strike, it wasn't where it was supposed
to be,'' Boles said. ... Luis Castillo voluntarily fined himself
after failing to get down a bunt over the weekend in Cincinnati.
Boles didn't want the money but came away impressed with Castillo's
attitude. ''I couldn't believe it,'' Boles said. ''That just shows
you how serious he is about the team and his performance.''
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates will not use fifth starter Jimmy
Anderson on this turn through the rotation because of Thursday's
open date. Anderson has struggled and manager Gene Lamont wants him
to get some sideline work with pitching coach Pete Vuckovich. Also,
Lamont wants to keep his other four starters working on their
normal four days of rest. Anderson's next start will be Tuesday
against Detroit. ... The Pirates have used six leadoff hitters in
the first 49 games. Warren Morris currently occupies that spot but
the job could go back to Jason Kendall, who had it at the start of
the season. Kendall remains the Pirates' best base-stealing threat
and he usually has the team's best on-base percentage.
Astros-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: There have been 95 home runs in 25 games at Enron Field
this season. In Houston's final season in the Astrodome last year,
there were 118 home runs. ... Scott Elarton, of Lamar, Colo., left
60 tickets for family and hometown friends.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Toby Harrah managed the Rockies while manager Buddy
Bell was in Cincinnati attending his daughter's graduation. ...
Larry Walker took extra batting practice and took his regular turn
in the cage during regular batting practice. ... John Thomson, on
the 60-day DL for a torn labrum injury suffered last season,
returned to Tucson after passing a physical in Denver to begin
light workouts. ... Colorado GM Dan O'Dowd said the Rockies
continue to be concerned about RHP Jaime Navarro, who had been
released by the Milwaukee Brewers and made two starts for Colorado
Springs.
Expos-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Shortstop Orlando Cabrera was back in the starting
lineup. He missed a weekend series in San Diego due to the death of
his father, Jolbert. ... The Expos were outscored 38-11 in the
first six games on their nine-game trip. ... Tony Armas, the Expos'
starter Tuesday, had never faced any of the Reds' hitters.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Pete Harnisch, on the DL with shoulder weakness,
began playing catch Tuesday. If all goes well, he could begin
throwing off a mound again in 10 to 14 days. ... Reliever Mark
Wohlers had a little stiffness in his forearm Tuesday, a day after
his return to baseball, but it wasn't a concern. Wohlers' pitched
one inning for the Reds' Class-A team on Monday, 11 months after he
tore a ligament in his elbow. He's scheduled to pitch for Dayton
again on Thursday. ... Backup shortstop Juan Castro agreed to a
two-year extension for $400,000 per year. ... The three Reds
regulars who have done the worst with runners in scoring position:
Pokey Reese (.174), Eddie Taubenseee (.182) and Ken Griffey Jr.
(.205).
Mets-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The broken left forearm three-time Gold Glove SS Rey
Ordonez sustained in Monday's 4-1 loss to the Dodgers will put an
even greater strain on a Mets' infield that has not played up to
its 1999 standards. The regular quartet of Ordonez, 3B Robin
Ventura, 2B Edgardo Alfonzo and 1B Todd Zeile have combined for 22
errors -- only five fewer than the entire season total of last
year's everyday foursome -- when the departed John Olerud was at
first base. ... Right-hander Rick Reed, who probably will miss
Friday's start at Shea Stadium against Tampa Bay because of a
strained abdominal muscle on his left side, is confident that he
won't need to be placed on the disabled list. ''I'm still a little
sore, but I think after another day's rest that I'll be able to

   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers have until Wednesday to decide what to
do about Carlos Perez. The temperamental right-hander, who reached
the five-year mark in major league service on May 6, had waived his
right of refusal on minor league demotions through the end of May.
The team wants him to extend it another month, but Perez has
refused. The Dodgers' only other options are to release him or
trade him, but GM Kevin Malone said releasing him is not an option,
and no other teams have expressed interest in him because of his
two-year, $15.6 million contract. ... Kevin Elster has approached
manager Davey Johnson and volunteered to play some third base while
Adrian Beltre is sidelined with a strained right hamstring.
''That's been my history -- of moving guys from shortstop to
third,'' quipped Johnson, who received flak as Baltimore's manager
when he changed Cal Ripken's position in 1996 after Ripken played
13 consecutive seasons exclusively at short. ... Mark Grudzielanek,
hit twice on the left elbow in a span of three days by Jason Boyd
and Al Leiter, started Tuesday's game wearing a protective device
on his arm. He is thinking about leaving it on even after he is
healed -- the way Houston's Jeff Bagwell and many others do. ''We'll
see how it feels and how comfortable I get with it, but there's no
question I've got to wear it for a while because I have no
choice,'' said Grudzielanek, who had been plunked a team-high six
times. ''I've taken two blows in an identical spot -- and if I take
another one, I could be out for a while.''
Cardinals-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Ray Lankford, who moved past Rogers Hornsby for fifth
in Cardinals career walks with 661, needs two homers to tie Hornsby
(193) for third in franchise history. ... LHP Jesse Orosco, coming
off an injured left elbow, joined Class-A Peoria on Tuesday and
threw 15 pitches at the start of his rehabilitation assignment.
Manager Tony La Russa said Orosco would throw again Wednesday and
then be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 3B Matt Williams and 1B Erubiel Durazo sat out the game
after having MRIs on their sore wrists. ... The Diamondbacks placed
RHP Todd Stottlemyre on the 15-day DL Tuesday because of tendinitis
in his pitching elbow and recalled rookie reliever Vicente Padilla
from Triple-A Tucson. ... First base coach Dwayne Murphy had
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and will be out at least
until June 9. Derek Bryant, the minor league outfielders
coordinator, will replace him in the box.
Brewers-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: RHP John Snyder, scheduled to start Wednesday night's
series finale, is 0-1 with a 14.63 ERA and has lost a career-high
seven straight decisions. This will be his third start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Right-hander Adam Eaton, 22, made his major league
debut on Tuesday against the Brewers. He was the clincher in the
deal that sent Andy Ashby to Philadelphia in exchange for three
pitchers on Nov. 10. The Padres purchased Eaton's contract from
Double-A Mobile, where he was 4-1 with a 2.68 ERA. ... The Padres
also recalled Rodrigo Lopez from Triple-A Las Vegas to start
Wednesday. To make room on the roster for Eaton and Lopez, the
Padres put opening day starter Sterling Hitchcock on the 15-day DL
with a sprained left elbow and designated LHP Matt Whisenant for
assignment.
Phillies-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: An MRI on the sprained left ankle of 3B Scott
Rolen was negative. Rolen, who was placed on the 15-day DL earlier
this week, has a moderate to severe sprain. Rolen hurt his ankle a
week ago in Houston when he turned it while rounding first base.
... The Phillies were 3-4 on their nine-game road trip heading into
Tuesday's contest at San Francisco. They've averaged 4.9 runs per
game during the trip but their pitchers have allowed 47 earned runs
for a 7.17 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: RHP Joe Nathan, eligible to come off the DL
Wednesday, will make one more rehab start instead with Class-A
Bakersfield. Nathan has been on the DL since May 17 with tendinitis
in his pitching shoulder. ''I'm sure he wants to get back as soon
as possible but we have to look at the big picture,'' San Francisco
manager Dusty Baker said. ''We want him to work on how he feels,
his pitch count, his breaking ball, all that stuff so when he gets
back, he's better than when he left.'' Baker said if he continues
to progress, Nathan would be reinstated in about five days when he
would take his regular turn in the rotation. In the meantime, Mark
Gardner will start Wednesday's game against the Phillies. ... RF
Ellis Burks was held out of the starting lineup because of sore
left leg. Burks was activated from the DL last week after being
sidelined for more than two weeks by a strained left quadriceps
muscle. ''This gives us a chance to rest him and play (Armando)
Rios,'' Baker said.

<HEADLINE> Mori Faces No-Confidence Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's upper house defeated a censure motion
Wednesday against Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, whose government is
plummeting in popularity just weeks ahead of elections.
</P>
<P>
   The 134-108 vote against the largely symbolic censure motion did
not end Mori's problems: the opposition planned to submit a
no-confidence motion later in the day in the powerful lower house.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's popularity has nose-dived in recent weeks over a series
of scandals, including his calling Japan a ''divine nation,'' which
has been widely criticized for conjuring memories of Japan's
wartime ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The nonbinding censure resolution accused Mori of violating the
constitutional separation of church and state by saying the emperor
was at the ''center'' of the nation. The motion demanded that Mori
and the rest of his Cabinet resign.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who took office on April 5 after his predecessor Keizo
Obuchi suffered a stroke, has seen his popularity ratings drop from
around 40 percent to less than 20 percent in just weeks, according
to newspaper polls.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble comes as the government and opposition are gearing
up for elections expected on June 25. An Asahi newspaper poll
published Tuesday showed Mori as the most unpopular prime minister
in decades to lead his party into elections.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of both the censure and the no-confidence motions was
expected, since the governing three-party coalition led by Mori's
Liberal Democrats hold majorities in both houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But that was little solace to the beleaguered government.
</P>
<P>
   While the Liberal Democrats' grip on power is not yet expected
to be vanquished in the upcoming election, speculation is strong
that Mori's unpopularity lead to losses in the lower house.

<HEADLINE> Former Pa. Gov. Casey Dies at 68  </HEADLINE>
By PETER JACKSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Former Gov. Robert P. Casey, the
strong-willed Scranton Irishman who spoke passionately against
abortion and overcame 20 years of dashed hopes to become governor,
died Tuesday. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Casey suffered from a genetic condition called familial
amyloidosis, which forced him to undergo a rare heart-liver
transplant in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Casey was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent
radiation treatments. He had been in and out of the hospital
several times over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Casey died of a serious infection at Mercy Hospital in Scranton,
a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative Democrat, Casey relentlessly berated his party
and its 1992 presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, for abandoning
its traditional constituencies with what Casey called an
abortion-on-demand philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ''My party, the Democratic Party, should be the protector and
claims to be the protector of the powerless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to get back to what this country is all about,
protecting all of the powerless ... . And that includes unborn
children.''
</P>
<P>
   He made headlines in 1992 when he was denied a chance to speak
at the Democratic National Convention. And in March 1995, he formed
an exploratory committee to challenge Clinton for the 1996
nomination, only to drop the effort a month later, saying he was
not sure he could sustain ''the extraordinary energy level required
by a national campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He was elected governor in 1986 on his fourth try and re-elected
handily in 1990. He was ineligible to run for a third consecutive
term in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Casey prided himself on overseeing a frugal
government with a caring touch.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed through a health insurance program for children,
comprehensive car insurance reform, a multibillion-dollar program
to rebuild water systems and additional environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   His low points were losing a referendum in 1989 for tax reform
and signing more than $1 billion in new taxes in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Casey lacked arrogance even as he ascended the political
pinnacle. His shyness sometimes came across as stiffness. But he
made time for people, even taking time once to go to the Capitol
newsroom to congratulate a reporter for a decade on the job. He was
a faithful churchgoer and often could be seen at Sunday Mass at St.
Patrick's Cathedral near the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, Casey was a consummate politician, albeit a stubborn
one at times.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's gotten his head kicked in a couple times and he's kicked
in some other heads and he's come out of it with an amazingly
idealistic view of government, of people and just a tremendous
reservoir of positive attitude,'' his son Bobby said in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Once Casey achieved his dream of being governor, health problems
intruded. In office only nine months in 1987, Casey underwent
quadruple bypass surgery after doctors found he had suffered a
silent heart attack. He adopted a rigorous diet that transformed
his appearance from full-faced to drawn. Questions about his health
lingered and in 1991 rumors swept the Capitol that Casey had
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in July 1991, Casey announced that he had been diagnosed
with familial amyloidosis, a disease that causes proteins to invade
the heart and other vital organs. When he underwent the transplant
two years later, doctors said the replacement of his liver should
stop the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York City, Casey grew up in Scranton. He was
married to the former Ellen Harding and they had eight children.
</P>
<P>
   He started his public career in 1962 when he was elected to the
state Senate at age 31. A former scholarship basketball player at
Holy Cross College in Massachusetts, Casey had the athletic good
looks that helped make him an instant star with the statewide
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   He was endorsed for governor for the 1966 primary but lost. In
1968, Casey was elected state auditor general and in 1970 again
received the party nod for governor, but again lost the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite gaining a reputation as a watchdog for taxpayers while
auditor general between 1969 and 1977, Casey couldn't convert that
trust to a gubernatorial victory. He lost in the 1978 primary while
another Bob Casey, a Pittsburgh school teacher, apparently fooled
voters and won the lieutenant governor's primary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Casey finally exorcised the ghosts of primaries past
and defeated Philadelphia District Attorney Edward Rendell for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a then unknown political consultant, Casey used
a bittingly negative television ad to ensure a narrow gubernatorial
win that November. The consultant, James Carville, went on to help
Clinton win the presidency in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Pediatric Growth Charts Revised  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in 23 years, the government
is updating the charts used to track children's growth and adding a
new formula to help identify weight problems in children as young
as 2.
</P>
<P>
   The charts, a staple in the offices of pediatricians and school
nurses around the country, now include the body mass index, or BMI,
a single number that compares weight to height. It's already used
to track obesity among adults.
</P>
<P>
   The new charts from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention also should more accurately reflect the average height
and weight of U.S. children from birth to age 3, because they are
based on more recent and much more comprehensive data than the old
charts for babies and toddlers. The changes are minor except for
the lightest and heaviest children, CDC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the first questions people ask new parents is 'How much
did your baby weigh?''' said Secretary of Health and Human Services
Donna Shalala. ''From that moment on, growth charts are a reference
point for health professionals and parents as their children grow
into adolescents and adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   The new research found babies and toddlers to be slightly
heavier than in the previous charts, and also found infants in the
first few months have larger head circumferences than the older
charts showed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a previous chart, a 3-year-old girl at the 50th
percentile -- or the chart's halfway point -- would be 32.6 pounds
and 38.4 inches in length. On the new chart, the 50th percentile is
33.3 pounds and 38.7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, pediatricians will classify more babies as
underweight and fewer as overweight, said officials at CDC's
National Center for Health Statistics, which published the charts.
</P>
<P>
   On the new charts, a 22.5-pound 2-year-old girl would be in the
5th percentile, which is considered underweight by many doctors
depending on how long the child measured. On the old chart, the
same child would have been in the 10th percentile, lean but not
necessarily underweight.
</P>
<P>
   The new BMI charts, which begin at age 2, are a more accurate
tool for measuring obesity than older charts that included a
measurement of weight according to height, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means parents have an opportunity to change their
children's eating habits before a weight problem ever develops,''
said Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-year-old boy in the 50th percentile, or middle range, would
have a BMI of 16.5. A boy with a score of 19.8 would be in the 95th
percentile -- meaning the vast majority of boys his age have a lower
BMI. Kids at the 95th percentile are considered overweight and
those at the 85th percentile are considered at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is a growing national health problem among both adults
and children. Nearly one in five American adults are obese and the
number of obese children has doubled in the past 20 years to about
4.5 million kids, or 11 percent of youngsters ages 6 to 17,
according to the latest government studies.
</P>
<P>
   Health professionals believe that catching the problem is
important in preventing children from going on to have weight
problems or becoming obese later in life.
</P>
<P>
   The new charts use government data from the last three decades
about formula- and breast-fed children from all racial and ethnic
groups. The old charts were based on a private study during the
1960s and 1970s that looked only at white, formula-fed children in
Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Slain Florida Teacher Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The teacher who was shot to death
in a middle school hallway last week was honored at a memorial
service Tuesday as a beloved mentor, coach and counselor who
reached out to others ''even to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, colleagues, family and friends of Barry Grunow, 35,
carried single carnations and roses as they filed into Good
Shepherd United Methodist Church. Others waited in the center aisle
to view a collage of snapshots of Grunow placed on an easel between
sprays of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The music of Jethro Tull, one of Grunow's favorite groups,
filled the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barry was reaching out with grace, even to the end,'' the Rev.
Bill Corristan said. ''Even to the young man with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-grader Nathaniel Brazill is accused of gunning down
Grunow in a hallway Friday at Lake Worth Community Middle School
just before the last bell of the last day of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old boy, an honor roll student with perfect
attendance, was dismissed early from school that day by an
assistant principal for throwing water balloons.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to school two hours later with a gun allegedly
stolen from his grandfather's house. When Grunow wouldn't let the
boy in his classroom to talk to two girls, Brazill pulled the gun
from his pocket and shot Grunow in the head, police said. A school
security camera captured it all.
</P>
<P>
   A regularly scheduled grand jury was impaneled on Tuesday and
was to begin hear evidence in the case in one to two weeks, State
Attorney's office spokesman Mike Edmondson said. State Attorney
Barry Krischer has said he wants Brazill tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow, who taught English and coached basketball, leaves behind
a wife, Pam, 5-year-old son, Sam, and an infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush called Grunow's wife, Pam Grunow, on Monday night
to express his sympathy and offer his support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of this teacher, this dedicated teacher who was
living in the community, riding a bike to school so his wife could
attend to the needs of their family ... those are real heroes,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   One West Palm Beach radio station, WRMF-FM, devoted its morning
call-in show Tuesday to raising money to help with funeral
expenses. Callers had pledged $10,000 by noon.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial, the pastor read a eulogy written by Kurt
Grunow, one of Grunow's four siblings. The brother said he was too
emotional to talk.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the kind of person his brother was, Kurt Grunow
recalled how when Barry was a little boy he'd go outside and catch
bugs in a jar. He'd then put pennies and nickels in the yard,
because he didn't want to be stealing the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, an estimated 1,000 people turned out for a
candlelight service in a town park. Hundreds of teachers and
students hugged each other and cried as a bagpiper played ''Going
Home'' and ''Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd waited quietly as National Education Association
President Bob Chase tried to steady his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just been too many of these,'' the teachers' union
leader finally managed. ''As educators, we bear the emotional scars
of caring for children in a world where violence is too easy, guns
are too available and adults are too cowardly to take action to
protect our students and our teachers.''

<HEADLINE> Yashin's Arbitration Hearing Ends  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- The arbitration hearing on whether Ottawa
Senators center Alexei Yashin can become a restricted free agent on
July 1 ended Tuesday night after 10 hours of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator Lawrence Holden has 30 days to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very civil and civilized process,'' said Senators owner
Rod Bryden, who testified for about 1 hour and 20 minutes. ''There
wasn't anybody all upset or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Yashin, who sat out the final year of his contract with Ottawa
this season, did not testify at the hearing held at the Corel
Centre and was not available for comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Bryden said he had a congenial conversation with Yashin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alexei and I have had a moment when we did not get along
well,'' Bryden said. ''I disagree with him on contracts but other
than that, he's a fine young man.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing began last week in New York and was expected to wrap
up last Thursday, but Bryden was unable to testify due to a meeting
scheduled for his WorldHeart firm. Both the NHL and the NHL
Players' Association agreed to come to Ottawa for Bryden's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no surprises today,'' NHLPA assistant counsel Ian
Pulver said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a typical day in grievance arbitration in the NHL
world,'' he added with a touch of sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing started at 11 a.m. and ended about 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL believes Yashin should owe the Senators the final year
of his $3.6 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   A second arbitration hearing is slated for July, maybe in
Toronto, over the league's contention that the Senators should
receive $7 million in damages because Yashin's refusal to report to
Ottawa hurt the club's performance on the ice as well as sales of
tickets and merchandise.

<HEADLINE> Teens Said Killed in Gulf War Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's official news agency reported
Tuesday that three teen-age boys were killed and two others were
severely injured when two bombs dropped on northern Iraq during the
1991 Gulf War exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred in the village of Rihaniya, 12 miles
south of Mosul, 250 miles north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The report couldn't be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, President Saddam Hussein decreed that Iraqis
whose homes are damaged by U.S. and British warplanes enforcing
no-fly zones over southern and northern Iraq be compensated,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made during a Cabinet meeting chaired by Saddam
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has challenged the no-fly patrols since December 1998,
prompting the warplanes to fire at Iraqi anti-aircraft ground units
when, according to U.S. and British spokesmen, they initiate
hostile actions.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Cemetery Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A jury Tuesday convicted an antiques dealer
accused of ordering statues, urns and other artifacts stolen from
ornate tombs in the city's above-ground cemeteries. Two others were
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques dealer Peter Patout was convicted of conspiracy and two
counts of possession of stolen property. Seller Aaron Jarabica and
antiques collector Roy Boucvalt were acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Patout's lawyer, Arthur Lemann, said the convictions would be
appealed. Patout faces up to 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the theft scheme stretched as far as Los
Angeles and New York, where some of the $800,000 in stolen items
were recovered. The artifacts included angels, urns and benches
taken from the historic cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   The trial included testimony of four graveyard robbers, who
pleaded guilty in exchange for reduced sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves were caught in 1998, after a worker jotted down the
license number of a van cruising among the rows of tombs at Lake
Lawn Metairie Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery is one of the fanciest in the city. Some of the
tombs are built like tiny chapels. One is a pyramid, with a small
sphinx in front. Another is a miniature cathedral.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs' Pitcher Goes on 15-Day DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks placed right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday after an MRI found
tendinitis in his pitching elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The banged-up Diamondbacks also didn't have Matt Williams and
Erubiel Durazo in the lineup against St. Louis on Tuesday night
because of wrist injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona recalled right-hander Vicente Padilla from Triple-A
Tucson, but Padilla is a reliever, and the absence of Stottlemyre
(8-3) leaves a hole in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to make that decision until Friday, so we'll try
to do what we can do to win baseball games until then, and then
we'll need a starter for Saturday,'' manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the candidates include right-handers Mike Morgan, a
starter most of his career, rookie Vicente Padilla or Nelson
Figueroa, who is still with Triple-A Tucson. The team recalled
Padilla from Tucson on Tuesday after an MRI found tendinitis in
Stottlemyre's pitching elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (8-3), tied for the National League lead in
victories, came out of Monday's game against St. Louis in the sixth
inning with soreness in his elbow. He was trailing 1-0, and the
Cardinals beat the Diamondbacks 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't any one pitch. Stottlemyre had an inflamed ulnar
nerve in his right arm before the game, and had been pitching
through the pain for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla will be making his second stint with the parent club
this season. He was 1-0, with a 1.00 ERA in five relief appearances
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Durazo had MRIs earlier Tuesday. Results were not
immediately disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hasn't played since he was hit on the left wrist by a
fastball Sunday. X-rays showed no broken bones, but the wrist was
swollen.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, who took the first-base job away from Travis Lee last
year, hurt his right wrist in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley Frias made his first start of the season at third, and
Greg Colbrunn played first.

<HEADLINE> Devils 7, Stars 3  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The defending Stanley Cup champion
Dallas Stars thought they were done seeing the Avalanche. Instead,
they ran into one in, of all places, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora scored twice in a four-point night and Ken Daneyko,
who has played every postseason game in Devils history, scored his
first playoff goal in five seasons as New Jersey's top line
embarrassed Dallas' stars in a commanding 7-3 victory Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora also assisted on Jason Arnott's two goals as the Devils,
attempting to become the first Eastern Conference team to win the
Stanley Cup since they did it five years ago, badly outplayed the
defending champions at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were flat and a step late all night,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ''I think our whole group really struggled in our
own zone with the quickness. I don't think we've played against a
group of forwards this quick before, and we made a lot of mistakes
because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, considered the underdogs just as they were when they
upset Detroit in four games in the 1995 finals, can take a 2-0 lead
in the best-of-seven series by winning Thursday night at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This puts a lot of pressure on us, but we know we're going to
play a better game,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The game was vintage Devils -- vintage 1995, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils followed still-new coach Larry Robinson's game plan
to perfection. They seized the critical early lead, dusted off the
neutral-zone trap that was so effective in '95 to shut down Dallas'
scorers and let goaltender Martin Brodeur stop the shots that
sneaked through their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some goals squeak through there for a change, and our
guys were skating well,'' Robinson said. ''But I don't consider
this a 7-3 game. I've seen Dallas come back before, and we're in
for a game Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' top line of Sykora, Arnott and Patrik Elias combined
for four goals and now have nine in the last five games. By
contrast, the Stars' Brett Hull and Mike Modano, the top two
scorers in the playoffs, went scoreless, with Brodeur making a key
save of Hull's shot less than a minute before the Devils took a 3-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas goaltender Eddie Belfour was no better than the forwards
in front of him. Belfour, who had allowed two or fewer goals in 12
of his previous 13 games, yielded six goals on 18 shots before
being replaced by Manny Fernandez with 16:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars allowed just 13 goals in the entire Avalanche series --
the fewest in 50 years in a seven-game Stanley Cup semifinal
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' oft-overlooked offense obviously ambushed a baffled
Belfour and the Stars, who looked fatigued and off their game
almost from the opening minute despite having three days off since
eliminating Colorado on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, known more for their give-no-ground neutral zone
trap, were the NHL's second-highest scoring team during the season,
but Robinson reshaped their game after succeeding the fired Robbie
Ftorek with eight games left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson sold the Devils on returning to their '95 style, in
which the trapping defense set up an opportunistic offense, rather
than vice versa. But even Robinson couldn't have expected this, not
against a determined, defense-driven team that Hitchcock said was
extremely focused on winning a second Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''This series, just like in 1995, we have a lot of respect for
the team we're playing,'' Brodeur said. ''We were scared of that
series in '95, they were supposed to beat us bad, and next thing
you know series is over. This time around, it's the same thing -- we
know they have a lot more to give.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have already fared worse than the last four defending
champions -- Detroit, Pittsburgh and two of Wayne Gretzky's Edmonton
Oilers teams -- who returned to the finals the year after winning
the cup. All four of those teams repeated as champion, and only one
lost even one game in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   After Arnott and Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor traded goals in
the first period, the game quickly got away from Dallas in the
second period. And the biggest goal of all was scored by perhaps
the least-likely player.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden won a faceoff in the Stars' end that bounced to
Daneyko, who didn't score a goal all season. Daneyko teed up a
knuckleball-type shot from the top of the left circle that somehow
eluded Belfour at 2:52 of the second for his first playoff goal in
49 games since June 5, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars should have known then they were done. And they were,
even if the Devils weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted (Daneyko's goal) to be the game-winner,'' Brodeur
said. ''He's been the heart and soul for New Jersey for the last 15
years, and it was great for him to score a goal like that in the
Stanley Cup final.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykora effectively finished them off at 10:28 with the first of
his two goals, grabbing Elias' blind pass from behind the net and
slipping it by Belfour, who began the game with a 1.88
goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't had too many nights like that,'' Hitchcock said of
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Scott Stevens, whose punishing hits left the Flyers'
Daymond Langkow and Eric Lindros with concussions in the Eastern
Conference finals, made it 4-1 at 16:04 with a soft wrist shot from
the left point, and the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   ''Individuals are playing well, and that means the team is
playing well,'' Stevens said. ''Everybody was expecting a boring,
slow game and I remember thinking, 'Man, this is a lot of
scoring.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sykora and Arnott scored again in the third period, and Sergei
Brylin added a goal, before the Stars' Jon Sim and former Devils
captain Kirk Muller scored meaningless goals 12 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who won all four games of the Eastern Conference
finals against Philadelphia in which they scored first, did so
again. Elias' wraparound attempt deflected off Belfour's glove to
Sykora, who swept a pass across the slot to Arnott at 7:22 for his
fifth playoff goal.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal in the first game of a Stanley Cup final can be
critical to determining the early momentum -- the Game 1 winner has
won the cup 79 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher left in the third period with a
slight hyperextension of his right knee, but Hitchcock expects him
to play in Game 2.
