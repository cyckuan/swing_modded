<HEADLINE> Tanzanian, Rwandan Officials to Discuss Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior Tanzanian and
Rwandan government officials will meet on Sunday in Biharamulo
District, Region, to discuss the expulsion of 1,800
Rwandans by Tanzania early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania people's Defense Forces Western Brigade
Commander, Brig. Gen. Ben Msuya, said the meeting will be
attended by senior officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs
and their counterparts in Rwanda, according to "The Guardian"
today.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Msuya declined to give details of the meeting but
sources in the neighboring Kigoma Region said the meeting will
focus on the expulsion early this year of 1,800 Rwandans who
settled in Kagera since 1959.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Rwandan government had been reluctant to
accommodate the expelled aliens claiming that some of them had
been sowing seeds of discord in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 1,800 expelled Rwandan aliens, some 188 were Hutus who
are disowned by the Rwandan government on reasons well known to
themselves," explained the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the crackdown on the Rwandan aliens was
necessary because some of them were found to be ring leaders who
organized several armed robberies in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand is that we were fed up with them because some of
them were armed bandits who terrorized residents in the region,
robbing them of money and property," the newspaper quoted the
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bandits in recent years have hijacked passenger buses and
killed a lot of Tanzanians in the Kagera Region, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Slips to 4.6 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide job growth
across a wide range of businesses helped lower the US unemployment
rate to a new, 24-year low of 4.6 percent in November, the Labor
Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rate of joblessness in November, a
further dip from 4.7 percent in October, was the lowest since
October 1973 when it also was 4.6 percent, the department said.
But the US lowest unemployment rate was recorded in March 1970,
when it was 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Employers added a seasonally adjusted 404,000 workers to their
payrolls, roughly a quarter of them in some retail establishments
such as department stores, gift shops, book stores and catalog
sales operations.
</P>
<P>
The jobs growth, even better than the robust 287,000 advance in
October, was the largest since February 1996 when workers were
streaming back to jobs temporarily interrupted by record snowfalls
in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
In retailing alone, the 105,000 increase was the most in nearly
three years.
</P>
<P>
However, the gains were not confined to retailing. Construction
employment rose 29,000 despite unseasonably cold weather.
Manufacturers increased 44,000 jobs, with the growth concentrated
at makers of electronic components, industrial machinery and
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Employment jumped 53,000 at temporary help firms, 15,000 in
engineering and management services, 13,000 in computer and data
processing services and 21,000 in health care.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have been concerned that labor shortages would
accelerate wage gains and stimulate inflation.
</P>
<P>
In November, average hourly earnings for non-supervisory
workers jumped 7 cents an hour to a seasonally adjusted 12.47
dollars, up 4.1 percent from a year ago. And the average workweek
grew by 0.3 hours to 34.8 hours.
</P>
<P>
November's unemployment rate for adult men fell to 3.8 percent,
from 4.1 percent in October. The rate held steady at 4 percent for
adult women. Among whites, the rate fell from 4.1 percent to 3.8
percent. Among blacks, it rose from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent and
among Hispanics it fell to 6.9 percent from 8 percent.

<HEADLINE> No Going Back on Land Acquisition: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe today
told over 5,000 delegates to the ruling party's third national
conference in Mutare of east Zimbabwe that there is no going back
on land acquisition plan for resettlement purposes.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is expected to get the full support of the
delegates to proceed with acquisition, hit back at critics of the
program.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government's plan to acquire about 1,500 farms
for resettlement purposes has raised local and international
outcry.
</P>
<P>
''Let the message be clear. There is no going back. It is
utter nonsense to argue that our people rely on the (white)
commercial farmers for their food and other products,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, ''land is the people's sovereign asset. It is
their home, economic resource, a social and cultural asset, their
religious shrine, their heritage and very livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
''How does it arise that a mere 4,000 (white) farmers control
more than half of the arable land. Is it sustainable
agriculture?'' he said, reminding the delegates that land
disparities caused by colonialism triggered the liberation war.
</P>
<P>
He added since Britain had renounced responsibility of funding
the acquisition exercise as agreed during the 1979 Lancaster
House conference, Zimbabwe would not beg for assistance.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Mugabe has tasked the ruling ZANU (PF) national
conference to ratify the decision of the central committee to
re-admit party members who were expelled for standing as
independents in local government and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the former rebels were required to confess and
publicly admit their wrong by contesting elections as
independents.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who criticized the weakness of the party's propaganda
machinery, appealed to the leadership to be involved in the data
registration exercise to ensure that the party was well organized
at lower levels.

<HEADLINE> Former Pak President on Constitutional Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Former president Farooq
Leghari said here today the recent constitutional crisis that led
to his resignation reflected "a conflict" between his "perceptions
of national interest" and those of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, who resigned Tuesday after refusing to sign a
reference against Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as required by the
Sharif government, said this in response to a letter from Sharif
Thursday in which he had offered to forget the past bitterness.
</P>
<P>
"The divergence in our perception of the issue at the center of
the recent crisis and the consequent bitterness that plagued out
relationship has no longer any relevance," Sharif said in his
letter to Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Leghari in his response wrote: "you are right in saying that
there was a divergence in our perceptions of the issue at the
center of the recent crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said he never harbored any bitterness against anyone during
these trying times.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, I tried my best to mediate the recent conflict in the
supreme interest of the law and institution," Leghari said, adding
"my consideration of the national interest is clearly different
from yours."
</P>
<P>
The former president pointed out that the recent events that
led to his resignation "reflected a conflict between our
fundamentally dissimilar perceptions and attitudes towards the law
and constitution, the concept of their supremacy, and the need and
importance of strengthening institutions of state rather than
pandering to the interest of the person."
</P>
<P>
"Both before and after my resignation, and thereafter, my views
remain the same," he added.

<HEADLINE> SAARC to Celebrate Charter Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will celebrate its 12th Charter
Day on December 8, said a press release issued today by the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC was established on December 8, 1985 with the signing
of its Charter by the heads of state or government from
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment, the SAARC has taken a number of
significant steps to expand the areas of cooperation including
socio-economic and poverty eradication which are utmost relevant
to the member countries, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Other issues high on the SAARC agenda include matters relating
to children, women and disadvantaged groups of society, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The most significant achievement of the SAARC in recent years
is the operationalization of the SAARC Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA) in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another important target has been set to achieve South Asian
Free Trade Area (SAFTA) by 2001, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
In order to further vitalize and enhance the effectiveness of
the organization in achieving its objectives, the ninth SAARC
summit held in May in Male, the Maldives has decided to establish
a Group of Eminent Persons to develop a long-range vision and
formulate a perspective plan of action including a SAARC agenda
for 2000 and beyond which will spell out targets that can and must
be achieved by 2020, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Cook Tables Precondition for EU Enlargement Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here today that the European Union (EU) would start
detailed membership talks only with those applicants that are
ready to join the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The EU enlargement talks are expected to start early next year
when Britain takes over the six-month rotating EU presidency in
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cook was quoted by the BBC Television as saying today that
Britain supported the ambitions of all 10 Eastern European
countries that have applied to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
"We support the ambitions of all of them. That's why during the
British presidency we will be calling them all to London for a
conference to exchange political dialogue and to work out how we
can best support all of them coming into the European Union," Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cook said that not all of them were ready now.
"Detailed negotiations can really only be held with those who are
ready for membership," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the European Parliament's suggestion for the EU to start
accession talks with all applicants, Cook said that it would not
do "any favors for those countries that are not ready for
membership, not ready to withstand the competitive pressures and
challenge of membership of the single market."
</P>
<P>
"It would be a much more sensible process, helping those
countries to get ready for membership rather than plunging them in
before they are ready," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU executive Commission's proposal, the EU will limit
its first wave membership talks with Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Up in October for 5th Consecutive Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The US factory orders rose
in October for the fifth consecutive month as a result of
increased demand for aircraft, autos, paper and food products, the
Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the commerce report, orders increased 0.3 percent
to a seasonally adjusted 337.2 billion US dollars following a 0.4
percent rise a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods, expensive items intended to last at
least three years, edged 0.1 percent lower, better than some
advance estimate of a 0.3 percent drop last week.
</P>
<P>
But strength in transportation equipment and instruments and
measuring devices wasn't enough to offset declines in primary
metals such as steel and metal products, industrial machinery and
electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Orders for non-durable goods rose 0.8 percent, the same as the
previous month. Food and paper products showed the largest
increases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipments of factory goods, a measure of current
production, slipped 0.1 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders rose 0.4 percent, the fifth
increase in six months. The increase in the backlog can indicate
that factories are too busy to keep up with their orders, an
inflation warning flag. Manufacturing inventories, up 15 of the
last 16 months, increased 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Vice-president Slams Disloyal MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice-president Simon
Muzenda today criticized legislators who publicly oppose bills in
parliament without consulting the party caucus and threatened to
have them discarded from the party.
</P>
<P>
"They may be intelligent, brave and rich but if they are
disloyal to the party they are of little value," he said in his
address to the ruling ZANU (PF) party's third annual conference.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians last week refused to pass the Finance No. 2
Bill to allow the government to impose on the controversial war
veterans levy of five percent of income tax of all workers with
effect from January next year.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda also said factionalism and indiscipline, which had
created independents within the party remained the biggest threat
to its supremacy over the country's weak opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that efforts by the leadership to end factionalism
were proving difficult.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda, who last year severely criticized members for
indiscipline, appealed for loyalty to the party constitution and
principles.
</P>
<P>
"Loyalty should start from the bottom and permeate all
structures. It is necessary to look at ourselves critically. Our
survival depends on our ability to organize ourselves, otherwise
we will be overtaken by other parties," he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Economy Hit by Peace Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The setback in the Mideast peace
process widely blamed on Israel's hard line policy has taken its
toll of the Palestinian economy, the Middle East News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Economic Unity Council being convened at the Arab
League this week said the real GNP in Palestinian self-rule areas
retreated by 2.9 percent in 1996 to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars
compared with 1995 when the economy posted a minus 4.9 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
The losses were caused by Israel's repeated and prolonged
closures of the self-rule areas for security reasons, the Council
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Council, per capita share
of the GNP in Palestinian areas dropped by 6.7 percent in 1996
compared with 1995. The years 1993 and 1994 witnessed a record low
of 12 percent on average in per capita share of the GNP, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1993 signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration
of Principles, per capita share of the GNP rolled back by 21.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Also, the report said that Palestinian foreign trade shrank by
10 percent in 1996, with export commodity value slashed from 2.23
billion U.S. dollars in 1995 to 1.811 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade constitutes 75 percent of Palestinian GNP.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank report released last week said that in 1996 the
Palestinian economy sustained losses far exceeding the total
international aid the Palestinians have received since the peace
process started.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in 1996 there were 180 "closure" days
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with a daily loss of 8-10 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since the Oslo accord, Palestinian economy has been drained of
3 billion U.S. dollars, said the report.

WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has given the Pentagon an open-ended mandate to continue U.S.
military training in Haiti, which was to expire by the end of this
month, a Pentagon spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
In extending the authorization earlier this week, Clinton set
no specific limit on time or troop numbers, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Joining the training dubbed as "New Horizon," the U.S. troops,
have been doing a variety of engineering work, construction,
medical training and other activities in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The number of U.S. troops there varies but typically totals 400
to 500, including about 100 support forces who provide logistical
and administrative help for the exercises.
</P>
<P>
A three-year U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti, performed by
Canadian and Pakistani troops, ended on November 30, leaving
U.N.-trained Haitian police in charge of the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
Clinton sent 20,000 U.S. troops to Haiti in 1994 to force out a
military regime and restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

<HEADLINE> Britons' Life Expectancy Variations Widening: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The gap in life expectancy of
the British people is widening sharply between the north and the
south, the poor and the rich, according to a latest study.
</P>
<P>
Citing a study in the Journal of Epidemiology &AMP; Community
Health, local press reports today said that although people in all
parts of Britain are living longer, those in the north and in
affluent areas are extending their life expectancy much more
rapidly than those in the south and in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that from 1984 to 1986, the difference between
the highest and lowest life expectancy areas was 5.2 years for men
and 4.3 years for women.
</P>
<P>
However, by 1992 to 1994 the gap had stretched to 6.7 years for
men and 4.7 for women.
</P>
<P>
The gap between life expectancies of the rich and the poor has
also widened. In the mid-1980s life expectancy in the most
affluent areas exceeded that in the most deprived by 2.8 years for
men and 1.6 years for women. Ten years later, the gap had
increased to four years and 2.4 years respectively.
</P>
<P>
The study, by the National Institute of Epidemiology at Surrey
University, suggested that more suicides, murders and accidental
deaths, among male residents of deprived areas are to blame,
together with higher rates of heart disease and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
It also indicated that health education messages are not
getting through to the poorest, with poor diet and heavy smoking
and drinking causing above-average levels of lung cancer and heart
disease.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Signs Convention Against Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is among the countries
that signed the convention against landmines, demonstrating its
sincere efforts to reduce tension and promote mutual confidence
on the island, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
After signing the document Thursday in Canada, Cyprus' Foreign
Ministry's Permanent Secretary Alecos Shambos said that the
Cypriot government decided to sign the convention as "it is fully
aware of the urgent need to remove all these weapons of death and
destruction from the island."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot official pointed out that the government decision
was taken despite the fact that Turkey continues to violate
international law and maintains over 35,000 troops on the island.
</P>
<P>
"My government sincerely hopes that the Convention on
Anti-Personnel Landmines will have a positive effect on our
efforts to stop more innocent lives from being lost so
senselessly," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. reports, there are 39 minefields and
booby-trapped areas inside the U.N.-controlled buffer zone
dividing the island, set up in 1964 when conflict between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities broke out.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that well over 16,000 landmines have been laid
in these areas since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and took
over the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Shambos stressed that "our signing must therefore be seen as a
gesture of goodwill on our part and as a unilateral contribution
to the objective of complete and eventual demilitarization of the
Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The demilitarization proposal, put forward by Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides in 1993, provides for the disband of the
republic's National Guard and handover of its arms to the
U.N. peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the proposal provides for the simultaneous
withdrawal of the Turkish occupation troops from the island and
the disband of the Turkish Cypriot armed forces.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Step Up Action on Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- With an emergency aid package
for the beef industry under consideration after protests by
farmers against cheap beef imports, the British government warned
them they were not above law.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, farmers from across the South-East marched on
Dover and blocked the entrance to the port, preventing all
vehicles from leaving or entering.
</P>
<P>
Scuffles broke out after police reopened the port to allow
ferries to leave, and four protesters were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The National Farmers' Union (NFU) blamed the government for the
blockade against Irish and Continental beef imports.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement with its Irish counterpart, the NFU said
the action was caused by the government's refusal to claims
compensation for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Sue Scott, the NFU spokesman, said, "Farmers have simply had
enough over the last 18 months. Negotiation has not worked and
they are frustrated and fed up."
</P>
<P>
There are reports that farmers also blockaded Seaforth in
Liverpool, Stranraer and Cairnryan in south-west Scotland, and
Holyhead and Fishguard in Wales.
</P>
<P>
Jack Cunningham, minister of agriculture, said the protesters
were short-sighted if they could not see the damage they were
doing to Britain's reputation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also warned farmers they were not
above the law in their protests against beef imports and said that
he understood the concerns but the government had to take a firm
line.

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Drop Constitutional Claim to Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern has confirmed that Ireland would change its constitution and
drop a constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in a bid to
promote the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ahern was reported by today's Financial Times as saying the
newly envisaged changes to Ireland's constitution "would get rid
of absolute claims of sovereignty over Northern Ireland by both
countries (Ireland and Britain)."
</P>
<P>
Ahern promised that the Dublin government would consider to
change the country's constitution to enshrine the right of a
majority of Northern Ireland to determine their future, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister also noted that he would be happy to
see David Trimble, Ulster Unionist leader, become head of a
"powerful" Northern Ireland administration as part of a "stable
settlement."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Sets Conditions for Executing Oil-For-Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said today that it will
not implement the third phase of the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal
until the distribution plan for this period is approved by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It also conditioned implementation upon the execution of all
the contracts that it has signed with other countries in the
previous two phases of the deal.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, a spokesman of Iraq's Foreign Ministry
blamed Thursday's resolution of the U.N. Security Council for only
considering the export of oil by Iraq, but neglecting the delivery
of food and medicine to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made just after the end of the second phase of
the oil-for-food deal which was started a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is under strict economic sanctions, which bars export of
oil, Iraq's main revenue earner, imposed by the U.N. in 1990 after
its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1995, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution
986 to allow Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy food and medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.N. Security Council resolution opened the third
phase of the oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the U.N.
according to resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that Iraq fully exported the amount
of oil in the first and second phases of the deal, but the food
and medicine contracts signed in the two phases have not been
totally implemented.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the second phase of the program, only a few
contracts have been approved, and the humanitarian goods arriving
in Iraq is far from enough to meet the needs.
</P>
<P>
He accused the United States and Britain of obstructing the
approval of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
All oil-for-food contracts must be approved unanimously at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee which includes the U.S. and Britain as
members.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls on French People to Face History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called on the French people to face history and again
recognized the responsibility of the French state during the Vichy
collaboration period for the deportation of thousands of Jews.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, France of the occupation (period) existed. Yes, the
arrests, the round-ups, the deportations were organized with the
assistance of the French administration," said Chirac during a
ceremony to place "Jewish files" of the Vichy period at the
Memorial of Unknown Jewish Martyrs in Paris.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Chirac since he became president in
May 1995 to publicly recognize the responsibility of France for
the death of thousands of Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the camps of internment and transit, such as Pithiviers,
Beaune-la-Rolande, Drancy, Compiegene and many others, were under
the responsibility of that (French administration of the Vichy
period), even the census and establishment of the files (on
Jews)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Le Monde said that Chirac made the statement
when some politicians of France's center-right oppositions are
closing in with the extreme-right National Front before the
regional elections to be held in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France should recognize the responsibility of
its past, not for "self-whipping with the past," but for
"inventing the present on the healthy and clear basis."
</P>
<P>
President of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic Philippe
Seguin said recently that France was "self-whipping" by putting on
trial former Vichy official Maurice Papon, accused of crimes
against humanity for deporting 1,690 Jews from 1942 to 1944.

<HEADLINE> 70 Minute Blackout in Many Parts of Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Electricity in many parts of
Sri Lanka had been shut down for 70 minutes tonight due to unknown
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The blackout hit Colombo this evening at around 8 o'clock local
time.
</P>
<P>
Electricity supply was restored 70 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bandalawela city in the central part of Sri Lanka
was also affected by the blackout.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources here said power supply to many other
parts of the country was also cut off.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said the blackout was due to technical reasons.
But the Ceylon Electricity Board, which is in charge of the
electricity supply throughout the country, was not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, a slight thunder storm was taking
place in the area.
</P>
<P>
There were high speculations among the citizens in Colombo that
there might be an LTTE background behind the incident.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Columbia Returns to Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The American space shuttle
Columbia returned to its home port in Florida this morning after a
16-day space science mission, ending the eighth and final flight
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Columbia and its six crew members swooped through a clear,
chilly sky and landed safely on the runway at the Kennedy Space
Center. Mission control officials greeted the the astronauts and
congratulated their successful journey which covered some 104
million-kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Among the achievements of the mission, two spacewalking
astronauts saved the runaway 10 million U.S. dollar Spartan
science satellite by catching it with their hands.
</P>
<P>
The two astronauts, NASA's Winston Scott and Japan's Takao Doi,
tested a new crane being developed for space station assembly and
to evaluate construction techniques in their second spacewalking.
</P>
<P>
Other crew members grew crystals, studied flames and cultivated
plants in orbit.
</P>
<P>
Although disappointed with Spartan, which failed to conduct
solar watching, NASA managers were pleased with the results of the
microgravity research and grateful for an extra, unplanned
practice spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
Astronauts Winston Scott and Takao Doi spent most of their
first spacewalk trying to snare the slowly tumbling Spartan after
it was sent spinning away from the shuttle by an inadvertent nudge
of the shuttle's robot arm.
</P>
<P>
In the second spacewalking, the two astronauts set up a small
hand-operated crane and practiced moving a simulated space station
component.
</P>
<P>
The spacewalks were NASA's last planned tests in orbit before
construction of the new station begins next year.

by the Italian aid agency, Commitato Servicio Voluntare(COSV).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 160 Million People Suffer from Diabetes Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- President of the Ethiopian
Diabetic Association Zeleke Wedajo said today that about 160
million people all over the world are suffering from diabetes,
one of the major killer diseases next to AIDS and cancer.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Zeleke when he was speaking at a
meeting here to observe the 1997 World Diabetes Day which falls
on today.
</P>
<P>
Zeleke said that over the past few years the incidence of
diabetes around the globe has been increasing at an alarming
rate.
</P>
<P>
He said, the International Diabetes Federation which was
organized in 1950 has now a membership of 126 states, adding that
medical care and treatment for diabetes are included in the
national health programs of 62 nations.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Ethiopian government to integrate diabetes
treatment and care in the national health program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Yirdaw Damtaw, public relations
officer of the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia, said that although
diabetes is a life-long disease with no cure, it is possible to
curb its progress through effective treatment and proper personal
care.
</P>
<P>
"The worst side of diabetes is that most of the victims do not
know that they have the disease," he said and called upon health
professionals and pertinent governmental bodies to raise the
public's awareness about diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Diabetic Association was set up 14 years ago
with a major objective of helping diabetics in every respect.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Farmers to Halt Beef Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair today urged British farmers to stop blockading ports in
protest at imports of cheap beef from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he sympathized with the farmers but they must stop
blockading ports. He insisted law and order must be upheld and
harbors and lorry routes kept open.
</P>
<P>
"We understand very well the distress and difficulty of British
beef farmers at the present time," Blair said at a ceremony
marking Britain's six-month stint as president of the European
Union starting in January.
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law must be upheld and we will ensure that it is,"
he said. "The scenes at some of the ports and harbors don't help
the farmers' case."
</P>
<P>
He also said taxpayers would pay 1.4 billion pounds (2.3
billion US dollars) in support of the beef industry -- a signal
that the government is not considering compensation for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Welsh farmers began blockading ports Monday in an attempt to
stop imports of cheaper Irish beef, and they have since been
joined by their Scottish and English colleagues. The farmers have
forced a number of trucks with Irish beef to turn back.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, some 250 farmers demonstrated at the
southeastern English port of Dover and three people were arrested
in scuffles with police as protesters tried unsuccessfully to stop
trucks leaving the docks.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations continued today despite government
assurances that officials were considering help for farmers.
Farmers say the government's latest ban on beef sold on the bone
is another blow to the beef industry when British consumer
confidence was beginning to recover.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid left here today on visits to United
Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran, which will highlight Islamic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid is expected to take part in the opening of an
Afro-Arab fair in Sharjah, UAE, in which a number of Arab and
African businessmen will take part with the aim of campaigning for
investment in Arab and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving here, The AL chief said that he will participate
in the summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)
in Iranian capital Tehran as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid, whose visit to Tehran will be the first of its
kind, voiced his hope that his meetings with Iranian officials
will lead to further development of the Arab-Iranian ties.
</P>
<P>
The league's chief said that he plans to have intensive talks
with Iranian officials on all major issues concerning the Arab
nation, including the territorial dispute between UAE and Iran,
especially as Abu Dhabi has expressed its readiness to resort to
the International Court of Justice to resolve their dispute.
</P>
<P>
Iran and UAE have been in a territorial dispute over the
sovereignty of three Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the greater and
lesser Tonbs.
</P>
<P>
He also described Egypt's participation in the OIC summit as "a
vital matter." Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa left for
Tehran today heading a delegation to ministerial meetings
preceding the summit.
</P>
<P>
He added that such a big Islamic gathering in Tehran attended
by heads of state or prime ministers of 54 OIC member nations will
have its own significance.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the 8th Islamic summit running on
December 9-11 are the status of Jerusalem and other occupied Arab
territories as well as the structural readjustment of the OIC.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also discuss conditions in Afghanistan and
Somalia, the territorial dispute between the United Arab Emirates
and Iran over the sovereignty of three islands and other issues in
Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based OIC, established in 1970 with a view to
rallying the ranks of the Islamic world, holds a summit meeting
every three years.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Calls EU Tobacco Advertising Ban "Incomprehensible" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The German government has called a
European Union ban on tobacco advertising "incomprehensible" and
threatened to take legal actions against it.
</P>
<P>
German government spokesman Peter Hausmann said today in Bonn
that the decision made by EU health ministers late Thursday to
phase out tobacco advertising and sports sponsorship by the year
2006 was "incomprehensible" to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated an early warning by German Health Minister
Horst Seehofer that Germany could launch a lawsuit to the European
Court of Justice if the EU decision was approved by the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ban also angered German tobacco and publishing industries
which said that it contravened the principles of freedom of
expression enshrined in the German constitution and would lead to
massive job losses.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates of the Central Association of German
Advertising Industry, the EU ban would cost Germany some 500
million marks (280 million U.S. dollars) in lost advertising
revenues annually.
</P>
<P>
The German Ufa cinema advertising company also predicted that
about a fourth of German cinemas would go bankrupt due to the ban.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of German health organizations, including the
Association of Doctors, welcomed the EU decision, describing it as
"a step in the right direction." They also called for further
measures to protect non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Austria were the only EU states voting against the
tabacco advertising ban Thursday. Spain and Denmark abstained.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African President Served with Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) today served a third subpoena on
former state president PW Botha, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
The subpoena, which was accepted by a security guard at
Botha's home, required Botha to testify on December 19 before
TRC, a special court authorized by the government led by the
African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The second subpoena served on Botha was legally announced
defective because it neglected to tell him an exact time of
testifying. Botha was originally required to testify at Friday's
public inquiry into the activities of the former National Party
government's state security council (SSC).
</P>
<P>
Botha's lawyer, Ernst Penzhorn, would not say whether his
client would ignore the third subpoena.
</P>
<P>
Botha has already refused to appear publicly before the TRC,
calling it a "circus".
</P>
<P>
The TRC first subpoenaed him in October to appear at the first
round of its inquiry into the SSC. However, the subpoena was
waived on the grounds of ill-health after Botha produced a
medical certificate.
</P>
<P>
Botha said today he had not made himself guilty of any serious
violations of human rights and was thus not prepared to apologize
for or ask for amnesty for any such deed.
</P>
<P>
In a long-awaited written submission of more than 1,700 pages,
Botha questioned the TRC's legitimacy and asked why he had been
subpoenaed to appear before it while Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who had rejected the commission
outright, had not.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Takes Measures to Stabilize Grain Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Grain Trade
Enterprise said that it has enough stock to stabilize the rise in
grain price, that may result from damage to this year's harvest
due to the untimely rain.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency today, the enterprise
which is responsible for grain trade in the east African country,
has pumped more than 10,000 tons of teff, the Ethiopian staple,
into markets in Addis Ababa, Mekele, Gonder, Nazret and several
other towns to control the rising price of teff witnessed over
recent months.
</P>
<P>
Feleke Wakjira, head of the Sale Department of the enterprise,
told local pressmen that a quintal of teff is sold at an average
price of 200 Birr (about 29 US Dollars) at the stated cities and
towns, while wheat goes for an average 150 Birr (about 22 US
Dollars), adding that the measures taken by the enterprise have
enabled to reduce grain price hike by about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Ethiopian Grain Trade Enterprise has the
financial capacity for the purchase and storing of up to 1
million tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise has finalized preparations to commence purchase
at 17 branches and 64 stations throughout the country to back up
existing stock, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement from the Disaster
Prevention and Preparedness Commission of Ethiopia, over 4.2
million people need relief food of 572,831 tons in 1998 due to
poor grain harvest this year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Voices Readiness to Solve Issues With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed Al-Sahhaf said here today that Baghdad is ready to solve
issues with Tehran, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf made the remarks in a meeting with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi on the sidelines of the foreign
ministers' meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC).
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said that Iraq considers the OIC summit, to be held
on December 9-11 following the foreign ministers' meeting, as very
important.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi expressed Iran's sympathy with the Iraqi
people for having endured tremendous hardship brought about by the
seven-year-old U.N. sanctions, adding that trust and confidence is
essential for solving regional problems.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Tehran and Baghdad will solve their
problems and move towards greater cooperation. The two foreign
ministers also discussed the issues of prisoners of the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Both sides stressed the need to accelerate efforts to settle
the issue of POWs (prisoners of war).
</P>
<P>
The issues of POWs and war compensation are the major barriers
on the way of the normalization of relations between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it has released 49,196 Iraqi POWs, of whom 10,000
have been released unilaterally by Iran. It also claimed that some
15,000 Iranian POWs are still being held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It accused the Iraqi government of making no response to
Iran's humanitarian measures of releasing Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi side repeatedly dismissed the allegation of
any Iranian POWs in Iraq. It claimed that Iran is still holding
18,000 Iraqi POWs.

PARIS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- France today called for the
maintenance of unity among the five member countries of the Group
of Contact for Bosnia: the United States, France, Britain, Russia
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that the unity of the Contact Group is essential for an efficient
international action to respond to a crisis in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"France has as an objective to constantly see to the
maintenance of the unity of the Group of Contact," said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She said that a number of decisions on the application of the
Dayton peace agreement have not been implemented and remain on the
table, such as the laws on citizenship and passports, the
functioning of the council of ministers, the common currency and
car registration plates.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the five countries will meet next week
in Bonn, which was described as "an essential step" by German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his French counterpart, Hubert
Vedrine, during their visit to Bosnia Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel and Vedrine have called on the three members of the
Bosnian presidency to implement a series of issues in the civil
part of the Dayton peace agreement, which always remains suspended

<HEADLINE> China's Revised Services Offer Wins Broad WTO Welcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's comprehensive revised
services offer was warmly welcomed by members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) as the Working Party on China's accession had
its sixth meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
"Members judged it to be an important document, one on the
basis of which they could build the future bilateral services
negotiations," said Pierre-Louis Girard, chairman of the Working
Party on China.
</P>
<P>
China's revised offer has been circulated among members since
November 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has spent five months, starting from last May,
revising the service schedule and has conducted concentrated
negotiations with some member countries on services, Long Yongtu,
China's vice minister of foreign trade and chief trade
representative, told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have given notice that during the morning session of this
meeting, many delegations gave a positive assessment to the
tremendous efforts of the Chinese side, and raised many requests
and proposals, to which we are very grateful," Long said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that our service offer has provided a basis
for future negotiations which will be conducive to the
comprehensive progress of market access negotiations and will
contribute to the final conclusion of the negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, as Girard said in his summing-up, members also
expressed concerns about "remaining horizontal and sector-specific
restrictions, many of these being core restrictions limiting the
geographic or quantitative service commitments."
</P>
<P>
"Members further noted that the offer was not as comprehensive
as they would have wished," Girard said. Certain service sectors
like the basic telecommunications sector were missing.
</P>
<P>
Responding to all those concerns, Long said that the Chinese
side is willing to "further clarify and explain the content of the
schedule through bilateral consultations."
</P>
<P>
No decision has yet been taken on a date for the next meeting of
the Working Party on China, but the multilateral process in Geneva
is expected to resume early next year.

<HEADLINE> UK New Car Sales Hit Record in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- New Car sales in Britain hit a
new record last month to stand at 153,323, up from 135,342 a year
ago and a 12.5 percent year-on-year rise, according to figures
released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT)
today.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT said that new car sales for the first 11 months of
this year have reached 2,086,091, a 7.1 percent rise on the same
period of last year and also above the previous third-highest
year, 1987.
</P>
<P>
However, the SMMT said that although there is still one month
left this year, it is not possible for this year's market to reach
the 2.2 million units of 1988.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were no other special factors for
last month's sale surge except for the stiff competition between
more than 50 companies.
</P>
<P>
Figures also showed that the market share of imports was also
one of the highest recorded, accounting for 65 percent of the
total number in November and 66 percent for the year.

<P>
ANKARA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzak
Mordechai will pay an official visit to Turkey next week to
tighten the bilateral defense ties which have already been
sensitive to the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai will be here between December 8 and 10, the Anatolia
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Mordechai is expected to meet with Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin and
Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold talks with his Turkish counterpart Ismet
Sezgin on issues of defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The increasingly closer Turkish-Israeli cooperation has greatly
disturbed the Arab countries, which accuse Ankara of forming
military alliance with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry, however, repeatedly stated that the
cooperation between Turkey and Israel is not directed against any
third country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed two defense and military training
agreements last year to allow joint warplane exercises in each
other's airspace.
</P>
<P>
Israelis also agreed to help upgrade some aged fighters of
the Turkish Air Force.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams Food-for-Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Only 10 percent of the
humanitarian supplies under the U.N. oil-for-food deal has been
distributed, an Iraqi minister was today quoted by Egypt's Middle
East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the news agency, Minister of Trade of
Iraq Mohamed Mehdi Saleh was complaining of the slow distribution
of food and medicine to the Iraqi people during the first two
phases of the deal.
</P>
<P>
He cited reports of the U.N. Children's Fund to confirm that
27.5 percent of Iraq's children under five are suffering from
malnutrition and that 1.2 million Iraqis have died due to the
U.N. sanctions imposed in 1990, which bars Iraq from exporting
oil, the main revenue earner.
</P>
<P>
To ease the hardship of the Iraqi people, the U.N. Security
Council adopted resolution 986 in April, 1995 to allow it to sell
2 billion dollars worth of oil every six months.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing oil-for-deal has been carried out for two phases
since a year ago. The Security Council Thursday approved to open
the third phase of the deal.
</P>
<P>
But a third of Iraq's revenues of oil sales goes to the U.N.
Special Commission monitoring Iraq's weapons system and to the
indemnities for the victims of the 1991 Gulf War, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of foreign currency to buy food and medicine has led
to millions of deaths, he concluded.

</P>
<P>
But both sides declined to disclose the outcome after the

</P>
<P>
Germany and France have apparent differences on a series of EU

<HEADLINE> S. African Business People Cautiously Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African
business community today expressed cautious optimism over the
prospects of the country's economic growth in 1998, the South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for complacency. We view the year ahead with
cautious optimism, anticipating that the 1997 trend of
consolidation will continue into the first half of 1998, with
faster growth thereafter," said Raymond Parsons, director general
of the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB).
</P>
<P>
Presenting an economic outlook for the next 12 months, he said
his organization forecast a GDP growth of 2.3 percent next year
against the 1.8 percent likely to be achieved this year.
</P>
<P>
The government had forecasted a GDP growth of two percent this
fiscal year and three percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, at 8.2 percent in 1997, is expected to continue its
downward trend to about seven percent in 1998, Parsons predicted.
</P>
<P>
He said a strong growth in manufacturing, construction and
electricity sectors would partly offset expected lower
agricultural and mining output.
</P>
<P>
"A great deal of this optimism will obviously depend on the
government's fiscal discipline and the credible implementation of
the GEAR (growth, employment and redistribution) macro-economic
strategy which remains the pillar of the current economic
performance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's economic performance in the new year
was also going to hinge on the world sentiments toward gold
which, although it contributes only six percent to South Africa's
GDP, employed more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
It also hinges on the extent of the East Asian financial
crisis and how other countries survive its effects.
</P>
<P>
Locally, the El Nino phenomenon was bound to hit economic
performance as much as the low gold prices and the low export
demand.
</P>
<P>
Crime, bank rate cuts are other factors, Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that the recent legislation of the Labor
Relations Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill would
effect flexibility in the labor market and stifle growth,
especially small and medium scale enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Employment is expected to fall by two percent in 1997 and 1.5
percent in 1998," said Parsons.

<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed Friday, with London surging to a six-week closing high
while Paris finishing slightly weaker.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London closed comfortably above the
5,100-point level on the back of gains in New York, with the FTSE
100 index 60.0 points higher at 5,142.9, a rise of 311.1 points
from last week.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street managed to shrug off a huge leap in US non-farm
payrolls despite its likely impact on U.S. interest rates, which
helped the London market to recover from its early afternoon dip.
</P>
<P>
The London market has seen a volatile day, with the FTSE 100
index see-sawing between a 34-point fall and 96-point advance.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that increased liquidity helped stoke the
traditional year-end rally.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, French shares closed the session firmer, but off
the day's highs, in quiet trade ahead of key U.S. jobs data, with
the DAX-30 index up 30.28 points at 4,170.08, 220.94 points higher
on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the CAC-40 index in Paris ended 4.36 points lower at
2,910.09, but still a rise of 50.90 from a week ago. Dealers said
that robust U.S. unemployment data unsettled French stocks
although the firm dollar provided some support.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Two black rhinos were
airlifted today from their home in South Africa to Seronera,
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The mother rhino and her calf, which got off a military plane
this afternoon, were received by the Ngorongoro District
Commissioner, Emos Mphuru, on behalf of the government of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the two rhinos is part of continental efforts
of Africa to conserve the endangered species, which has
diminished from 10,000 in number in 1960s to 2,400 today due to
merciless poaching.
</P>
<P>
Rhino horns have been used in making handicrafts, while other
parts of the animal have been used as ingredients in medicine.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts have said that there are less than 15 rhinos
in the Ngorongoro crater.
</P>
<P>
The calf, two and a half years old, has been named Thandi
Lushuge Rankoi, in honor of South African ambassador to Tanzania
who played very important role in bringing the two rhinos.
</P>
<P>
The veterinarian who accompanied the rhinos, Moris Kileo, of
the Tanzania National Park, said the mother rhino, called Ms
Phanton, is nine tons in weight and pregnant.

<HEADLINE> Hawkish Minister: West Bank Security Zones Vital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEITWELL (West Bank), December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister
of National Infrastructure Ariel Sharon said here today that it is
vital for Israel to set up security zones in the West Bank in
order to protect Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when explaining his plan of setting up
security zones in the West Bank to a group of foreign reporters he
organized today on a special tour of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is vital for Israel to set up security zones in the West
Bank, particularly the one parallel to the Jordan River Valley and
the other, east of the 1949 Armistice Line, said Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon is a key member of the cabinet, known for his tough
stand toward the Mideast peace accords, and one of the four-member
ministerial committee responsible for formulating the policies of
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 3,000, Beitwell is a Jewish village set up
on the top of a hill in 1981. The village is located just east to
the 1967 Green Line, not far from the Ben Gurion Airport in the
west.
</P>
<P>
Indicating the hills around the village, Sharon said most of
the areas along the Green Line are barren hills, but they have the
main water resources for Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must put these areas under its control and so I
suggested on December 2 to the cabinet ministerial committee to
set up a security zone of 7 to 10 kilometers wide east of
Armistice Line overlooking the coastal plain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Showing his strategic map of the West Bank, Sharon said that
from the security point of view, Israel should have the
20-kilometer-wide Jordan River Valley security zone, separating
Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) territories.
</P>
<P>
Within the West Bank, Sharon also mapped out several other
security zones surrounding the main cities under the management
of the PNA, as well as the Jewish settlements in the West
Bank. All these security zones will be linked with "strategic
roads" as he called them.
</P>
<P>
Most of these security zones inside the West Bank are
populated Palestinian areas and their security must be maintained
in the future by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), he said.
</P>
<P>
On the way to the Jordan River Valley, Jewish settlements can
be seen in many places and the constructions of "strategic roads"
are going on.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said these "strategic roads" are crucial for the IDF to
maintain security and will be beneficial to both the PNA and
Israel. Hospitals and schools will be built along these
"strategic roads" and the Palestinians can also use them in the
future, he said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the PNA of not doing enough in fighting terrorism,
which he said is the main reason hindering the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a cabinet member, he is opposed to the
formation of a Palestinian state, but it is impossible to ignore
the fact that the PNA has already been accepted by many countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "safe passage" will be built between Gaza and
the West Bank and it will be in the nature of "corridor."
</P>
<P>
Sharon's security zones cover about 50 percent of the West
Bank territories and he could not give a definite answer whether
the PNA will accept it or not.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his doubt about the Oslo Accords, saying some
amendments could be made to it if possible.
</P>
<P>
On the second-stage Israeli troop redeployment in the West
Bank, he said Israel will hand over some territories to the PNA,
mainly from the "Zone B," which are the 450 villages under the
PNA administrations but the securities are under the Israeli
control.
</P>
<P>
He said it will take some time for the committee to finish its
job on redeployment, but the government is firm on the security
issues in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Probe False Spy Data Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset
(parliament) will start to investigate next week the affair of
"false information" about Syrian attack on Israel, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Knesset subcommittee monitoring secret services is expected
to inquire an anonymous Mossad agent who has been proved to supply
bogus information, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
In summer last year, the Israeli intelligence service received
reports from the agent, who has long been considered dependable,
that Syria has intended to launch a lightning strike on the Golan
Heights, Syrian territory occupied by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The agent said the Syrians have planned to recover part of the
Golan Heights and will use it as leverage in negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The information reportedly made the Israeli government misjudge
Syria's policy toward Israel and raised tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nissim Zvilli, a member of the subcommittee, has called for an
examination of possible political motives behind the affair.
</P>
<P>
He has suspected whether politicians, who have been wishing to
see the deterioration of the Israeli-Syrian relations, are behind
the affair.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign Minister David Levy have
downplayed the effect of the misinformation on the government
decision regarding Syria.
</P>
<P>
They have said the decisions of such an important issue are
made according to many factors, not just one piece of information
or another.

<HEADLINE> HSBC On Impacts Of Lower Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- OPEC's decision to increase its
oil production ceiling effectively opened the floor under the oil
price prompting a drop from 19 U.S. dollars per barrel to 18
dollars per barrel, HSBC Holdings plc expected.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the output ceiling may seem irrelevant given
the fact that current output already exceeds the level.
</P>
<P>
However, for those countries which have spare capacity, such as
Saudi and the UAE, the increased quota will mean extra production,
said market experts in HSBC.
</P>
<P>
It was believed the decision will boost total OPEC oil
production from 27.9 million barrels per day currently to around
28.4 million b/d.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, prospects for growth in oil demand are not
particularly encouraging. There is a good chance that the oil
price could fall as low as 16 dollars per barrel by the first
quarter next year, they expected.
</P>
<P>
It was also estimated that a sustained fall to 16 dollars per
barrel in 1998 would shave 0.1 per cent off world inflation,
perhaps 0.2 per cent if the pass-through from costs to consumer
prices was particularly fast.

ANKARA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Ismet Sezgin said here today that Turkey will continue to
safeguard the rights and freedom of the Turkish Cypriots, Turkish
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with a visiting Turkish Cypriot delegation, Sezgin
said that Turkey's policy towards Cyprus will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ankara will continue its efforts to maintain
peace and stability in Cyprus though unstable factors are
increasing day by day.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriots-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin, also the defense minister, added that the Cypriot
government has no right to apply for the European Union
membership on behalf of the whole island.
</P>
<P>
Dervis Eroglu, a senior Turkish Cypriot official and head of
the visiting delegation, said that Turkish Cypriots will not give
up its struggle for equal status.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots believe that Turkey will, as always,
extend its full support to its brother on the divided island, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 the
establishment of "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is
only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the international community have been
striving to reunite the two communities, but so far no
substantial results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Cyprus worsened recently after Greece and Turkey
held frequent military exercises on the island and in the Aegean
Sea.

and social stability and cohesion, high educational level of the

and strong political, cultural and economic ties with Europe.
</P>
<P>
The president said Cyprus ranks the third in the Mediterranean
region in terms of per capita income, noting that it also enjoys
full employment and a balance of payments.

here this afternoon to prepare agenda and documents for the
eighth OIC summit to be opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural session, Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi said that the Islamic World must pave the way and
prepare the necessary grounds for it "to play a historical role
in founding the future international order and participate in

</P>
<P>
The eighth OIC summit is to be held at a critical and
sensitive historical and international juncture at the threshold
of the third millennium, he said, tumultuous developments are
unfolding in the world and the Islamic world is also undergoing
fundamental transformations.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi noted that today's world depends on the peaceful
coexistence, cooperation and collective participation of all
pluralities and varieties in an institutionalized manner.
</P>
<P>
"Endowed with rich culture, tremendous manpower, enormous
resources and reserves and strategic position," he said, the
Islamic world "is poised to assume a paramount historical role
in shaping the new world order."
</P>
<P>
However, Kharrazi said, the degree of the Islamic World's
success in playing an active, creative, constructive and
participatory role in the management of the pluralistic world is
"directly and palpably related to the pace of its own growth and
development."
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need to elevate the general level of
knowledge, learning, education and awareness, to institutionalize
the process of confidence-building, to consolidate Islamic
solidarity, to expand bilateral, multinational and regional
relations and to attain comprehensive and balanced sustainable
development in the broad sense through collective participation.
</P>
<P>
"It is of crucial and urgent importance for the Organization
of Islamic Conference to address and deal with the wide range of
issues and problems in front of us in a practical and
action-and-result-oriented manner," Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He named the issues of Palestine, Jerusalem, Afghanistan,
Bosnia-herzegovina as most serious problems in the Islamic
world, adding that it is also facing the challenge of promoting
political, economic, social and cultural cooperation among
Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called for collective efforts by the Islamic
countries during the OIC summit to solve the problems of the
Islamic World.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the participants in the meeting that Iran, as
the OIC chairman, would work "with all its disposal in the
course of the current session as well as through the next three
years" to realize the ideals and objectives of the OIC
organization and the eighth summit.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the inaugural ceremony, the foreign ministerial
meeting entered its closed session to discuss more than 140
resolutions concluded by the OIC experts meeting which ended
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the issues of relations between Islamic
countries and Israel would be the top topic for debates in the
coming two days.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Makes Continuous Efforts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Alleviating Poverty
</P>
<P>
By Hao Fusheng
</P>
<P>
DHAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- As one of the poorest countries
in the world, Bangladesh has made continuous efforts in past
decades in alleviating its poverty and gained some achievements in
this regard. But the task of poverty-alleviation in the country is
still very arduous.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's population reached 124.3 million at the end of
1996-97 fiscal year ending June 30 and the total area of the
country is only 147,570 square kilometers. The population density
is 842 per-kilometer. The heavy population pressure is one of the
reasons for the poverty.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP in 1996-97 fiscal year was 32.979 billion
U.S. dollars with a growth rate of 5.7 percent while the per
capita GNP was only 276 dollars. This shows that the economic base
is weak.
</P>
<P>
The poverty in the country is characterized by landlessness,
low investment, low income and low saving rate.
</P>
<P>
Over half the people in the country are living below the
poverty line, with over 80 percent of them live in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the past 26 years since the independence in 1971, the
burden of poverty has been pressuring this South Asian country
hardly to gasp for breath.
</P>
<P>
All previous governments of the country had attached
importance to the poverty alleviation work and made some
achievements in population control, calamity-combating,
infrastructural construction and foodgrain production, owing to
their continuous efforts.
</P>
<P>
But, however, observers here say that the achievements are
limited due to the weak economic base, bad natural calamities,
mismanagement and gradual reduction of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi governments have undertaken many projects such as
food production, income generation, employment, education as well
as infrastructural construction in a bid to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
However, these projects have not been successfully implemented
because of mismanagement, bureaucracy, lack of infrastructural
facilities and specially lack of a strong united leadership.
</P>
<P>
The speed of poverty alleviation is therefore very low. Based
on income measurement, the proportion of people living in poverty
fell from 57.5 percent in 1987 to 51.7 percent in 1994. This
represents roughly only one percent decline in poverty per year
during the period. If this trend continues, it will take over 50
years to eliminate the poverty in the rural areas, according to
Dr.Hossain Zillur Rahman of Bangladesh Institute of Development
Studies.
</P>
<P>
Both the previous and the present governments have claimed to
be committed to building Bangladesh into a country without poverty
and hunger. But neither of ruling and opposition parties stop
making constant harassment against each other, the political
situation in the country has always been in the state of
instability in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Some donor countries, international financial agencies and
foreign investors constantly warned both parties that if they do
not solve the disputes between them peacefully and continue to
confront with each other, they would reduce aid or to invest in
other places. The reduction of the foreign aids and investment
hinders the country from alleviating poverty at a faster space.
</P>
<P>
According to some experts from research institutes at home and
abroad, international donors group and Non-Governmental
Organization (NGOs), Bangladesh is a developing country with a
fine potential. It has fertile land, rich human and natural
resources, particularly rich gas and oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
The poverty, though it is a hard core to crash, can be
gradually reduced and finally eliminated so long as the Bangladesh
government takes a correct policy suitable for the actual
conditions of the country, both ruling and opposition parties take
the whole situation into account and try to create a favorable
environment for poverty alleviation.

<P>
FUZHOU, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Construction work of China's
seventh SOS Children's Village, a kind of orphanage, has started
in Putian City in east China's Fujian Province.

The village plans to adopt orphans from Fujian and the
neighboring provinces. The children live in groups referred to as
"families", which have unmarried or divorced women acting as
"mothers" to look after them and help them develop special skills
like singing and painting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gathering More Evidence Of Earliest Human Ancestors in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Stone tools discovered recently
in southwestern China seem to provide evidence to back up the
belief of some paleontologists that the ancestor of modern man
appeared in China some two million years ago, about a million
years earlier than what people have long believed.
</P>
<P>
Various sizes of crudely-chipped stone tools were discovered
over the last two months by a team of Chinese paleontologists.
Prof. Huang Wanbo, the team's leader, told Xinhua in his Beijing
office that, "The existence of early humans at that time can be
confirmed because, obviously, the stone chipping was done by hand."
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for Prof. Huang and his co-workers to
find evidence of the existence of the two-million-year-old Wushan
Man, a descendent of 'homo erectus', or men who stood erect, near
the southern bank of the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Huang regards the two finds as "a major challenge" to
traditional theories of human origin and evolution, which excluded
the possibility of a human ancestor in Asia prior any older than
one million years.
</P>
<P>
"Although we didn't find human fossils this time, there are
abundant fossils at the site, and I believe we'll find more
evidence in future," said Huang, who is with the Chinese Academy
of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology.
</P>
<P>
The site, named Longgupo, is located in Wushan County
administered by Chongqing Municipality, in southwestern
China. Many mammal fossils, stone tools, part of a jaw and a
single tooth of what they initially classed as H. erectus were
discovered during the first excavation work from 1985 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
However, there was some controversy about Wushan Man's
existence, which was questioned by some of Huang's colleagues at
that time because of a lack of convincing materials like human
fossils and stone artifacts.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of traces of Wushan Man may mark the beginning of
a massive hunt for fossils of much earlier ancestors, people who
lived two million to four million years ago, in the southwestern
part of China, the paleontologist says.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission is planning to fund
just such a program in future, Huang says, and notes that he and
his colleagues will establish a vertebrate paleontology and
paleoanthropology research center at Longgupo next year as part of
the same effort.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Union Threatens to Intensify Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Trade Union has
threatened that it will resume and intensify the general strike
Sunday if no agreement can be reached tonight with the Finance
Ministry, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Trade Union has asked its members to
obey the back-to-work orders issued by the National Labor Court
until Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
At the Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, workers have returned to
work today and allowed 13 flights of foreign airlines to land.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Union and the Finance Ministry are expected to
resume negotiations this afternoon, which were broken off
Thursday night on the instructions of Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein, who said there would be no talks with workers who
were in contempt of court order.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was launched Wednesday in protest against
government plans for wages reform and privatization, has
paralyzed the country by effectively shutting down airports,
seaports, banks, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, government offices
and state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
The strike was triggered by the remarks made by Finance
Minister Ya'acov Neeman Monday, who called the striking workers
"exploding bombs" and enemies from within.
</P>
<P>
In response to the assault, Trade Union Chairman Amir Peretz
declared the strike Tuesday night at an emergency gathering of
thousands of union members in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in the Trade Union's battle
against government economic reform plans, which have sparked
fears that worker's rights would be harmed.

<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A moderate snowfall last
night helped clean the air of Beijing without seriously disrupting
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The snow caused temporary traffic snarls when it started at 5
p.m. Friday, but didn't affect aircraft at Capital Airport, thanks
to over 300 workers and armed policemen who worked for 15 hours to
clean the two runways and 16 taxiways, with the help of
snow-movers and melting agents.
</P>
<P>
The snowfall turned to sleet in the early morning hours today,
and had melted in many parts of the city by this evening, and
municipal sanitation department sent several trucks out to spray
1,000 tons of saltwater on the streets to help melt the snow.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the Beijing area are down to nine or ten
degrees centigrade below zero.
</P>
<P>
Many people in Beijing didn't even get a chance to see the
snowy landscape because it melted so fast. One city bus employee
said that the number of passenger was not down noticeably from
ordinary weekends.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Calls on Workers to Contribute to Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a ranking Communist
Party of China (CPC) official today urged trade union leaders to
arouse workers' enthusiasm about reforms in state-run enterprises,
especially about turning losses into profits and to complete the
tasks set forth during the recent 15th Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the Fifth Session of the 12th Executive
Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU),
which opened here Friday, Hu, a member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said trade
unions should encourage workers to contribute to the development
of new products and technological improvements.
</P>
<P>
Finding jobs for laid-off workers is vital to the success of
state-run enterprise reforms, he noted, and trade unions should
provide more job opportunities and professional training for
laid-off workers, and encourage them to change their old ideas and
find new jobs themselves.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hu asked trade unions to give priority to the
protection of the workers' rights and interests, and to keep in
mind the concrete interests of workers as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that trade union officials teach workers to
safeguard their own rights by using the law, and the democratic
appraisal of enterprise officials should be part of the overall
appraisal of State-run enterprise officials.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the
ACFTU, presided over the session, which was attended by more than
200 members of the ACFTU Executive Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has said that new initiatives aimed at solving the
Cyprus problem are expected early next year, Cyprus News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of Cypriots living in London Friday
night, Clerides said various initiatives with the aim to resolve
the Cyprus issue are expected to be launched around March
immediately after the February presidential elections in the
government-controlled southern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
The president said one initiative will be launched by
U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke and
another by British Special Representative for Cyprus, Sir David
Hannay.
</P>
<P>
Clerides added that an initiative of the European Union will
also be launched.
</P>
<P>
"All these initiatives are within the framework of the
U.N. Secretary-General's good offices mission," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of direct talks between the two communities'
leaders were held under the U.N. auspices in July and August
this year, but no agreement was reached.

<HEADLINE> Burundi President Wants to Change Venue for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Burundi President Pierre
Buyoya said he wants the Arusha talks on Burundi to be shifted to
other African countries, a local report said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Uganda paper the New Vision, Buyoya
claimed that Tanzania has been biased and does not recognize the
Burundi government and has given its embassy in Dar es Salaam to
the rebels for fighting his government.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi president was quoted as saying that he wants a
neutral venue like Kampala, Harare or Addis Ababa. He also wants
former Tanzanian President Juilius Nyerere to be joined by a team
of other mediators.
</P>
<P>
But Buyoya's internal opponents, former presidents Sylvestre
Ntibatunganya, Jean Baptiste Bagaza, and Parliament Speaker
Leonce Ngendakumana said Tanzania is still credible and Nyerere
should continue to be mediator, according to the local report.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from Dar es Salaam said a consultative
meeting of all Burundi parties on the conflict would be held in
the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, but no date has been fixed
for the talks.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a Ugandan delegation ended a four-day
visit to Burundi on Friday after meeting Buyoya, who took power
in an army coup in July 1996, and opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mike Mukula, a member of the delegation, said the visit by six
parliamentarians was a private initiative, and that a report
would be later presented to Nyerere and Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni.

<HEADLINE> US Official's Visit Focuses on War in N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The guerrilla war in northern
Uganda will be one of the topics during the visit by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the New Vision paper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions concerning the visit Friday, Susan Rice,
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, said
Albright ''is very concerned about the Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA) and reports of new atrocities against civilians by the
rebels in the north.''
</P>
<P>
LRA is a rebel group of Christian fundamentalists operating in
the north and has some bases in southern Sudan. In its 11 years
of guerrilla war to topple the government led by President Yoweri
Museveni, hundreds of civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
But the effective strength of the LRA is in its dramatic
decreasing, from more than 2,000 fighters in previous years, to
about 700-800 soldiers including children fighters now this year.
</P>
<P>
Albright will visit Ethiopia, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic
of Congo and Zimbabwe, besides Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The US State Secretary will meet President Museveni for talks
also on the political and military situation in the Great Lakes
region, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Brings Rain, Winds to Southern California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES December 5 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rain and strong winds
swept across Southern California today. Weather officials said
the storm would continue until next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists have warned the public of El Nino's impending
influence for months. The phenomenon's occurrence succeeded by
diverting the storm toward California and the southwestern states.
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, heavy rain arrived just before noon
and winds across the region gusted up to 50 miles (80 kilometers)
per hour.
</P>
<P>
Five-day forecasts through next Tuesday called for up to 4
inches of rain in Southern California, nearly 2 inches in Arizona,
2.75 inches in Colorado and up to 1.5 inches over Southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
In advance of the storm, teams from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers worked to clear the Los Angeles River flood control
channel and swift-water rescue teams drilled in Southern
California. Homeowners in the flood-prone areas filled sandbags
supplied by emergency agencies.
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy rain and high winds earlier in the day and late
into the evening, no deaths or damages were reported.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a periodic weather-disrupting condition in the
tropical Pacific in which westward-blowing trade winds weaken,
allowing a mass of warm water to drive east to South America. The
name is Spanish for baby Jesus because the huge, warm pool usually
arrives around Christmas.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, El Nino will make itself known by the
"intensity, frequency and location" of winter storms expected to
lash the southern tier of states from California to Florida from
mid-December to January, meteorologists said.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Complains About Exporting Raw Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni is
unhappy with the export of raw materials, particularly coffee,
saying Uganda is being fleeced by developed countries, local
newspaper the Crusader reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Finance Minister Mayanja Nkangi, he mentioned a
cabinet meeting on November 3 when he showed three samples of
instant coffee: the first sample of 100 grams in a plastic
container of Uganda origin but processed abroad costs 14 U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The second of 100 grams from Colombia he showed in a glass
container costs seven U.S. Dollars in Britain, and the third of
250 grams in a paper container of Uganda origin costs seven U.S.
Dollars in France.
</P>
<P>
Uganda coffee is exported at a price of three Dollars a
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
In the letter dated November 12, the president told the
minister that developed countries earn 20 times more from the
processing than Uganda as the raw coffee exporter.
</P>
<P>
"We need to control this flabbergasting situation of value
lost" to the developed countries, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Museveni described the coffee deal as "massive robbery,"
adding that Uganda also loses employment opportunities and other
services "through this processing of coffee abroad."
</P>
<P>
"The so-called least developed countries are characterized by
massive under-diversification of export potential," the president
noted.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for an end to the "slavery role of Uganda," saying
Uganda must export processed goods and have related bilateral
arrangements with China, India, Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Museveni urged the finance minister to speed up work in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Can Avert Crisis by Stepping Up Reform: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Vietnamese banking
official said his country can minimize the impact of the Asian
currency crisis by stepping up its own economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Le Duc Thuy, deputy governor of the State Bank of Vietnam, made
the remark in a statement carried by today's "Vietnam News" daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Thuy's statement, issued after a two-day regional seminar on
the Asian currency crisis, said that "Vietnam has so far been
relatively little affected by the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Vietnam, the Central Institute for Economic
Management and the Asian Development Bank held the seminar this
week to review the crisis and assess its impact on Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
But Thuy added that Vietnam's policy makers are to meet various
challenges as the country carries on reform to liberalize its
economy and intergrate it further with the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The seminar's objectives were to analyze the background of the
regional currency crisis from a technical and policy perspective
and to exchange information and help Vietnam's policy makers order
the country's priorities on economic reform.

<HEADLINE> Dar es Salaam: Most Expensive African City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian capital of Dar
es Salaam has been listed as the most expensive African city, in
which prices may even higher than those of Paris, "Business
Times" said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the new world classification of the cost of
living published by the Swiss firm Corporate Resources recently,
Dar es Salaam is the most expensive city in Africa, with an index
of 106.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam is the 19th most expensive city in the world.
This places it above such cities like Paris (104), Zurich (104),
Rio de Janeiro (103), "Business Times" quoted the firm's report
as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey conducted in 100 cities earlier this
year, the most expensive city in the world is Tokyo with an index
close to 170 points. The least expensive is the Indian city of
Madras with an index of 60.
</P>
<P>
The city of New York is calculated with an index of 100. This
means that an American visitor finds Dar es Salaam nearly seven
percent more expensive than New York.
</P>
<P>
After Tokyo the most expensive cities are Hong Kong (153.20),
Moscow (1513.03), Osaka (147.86) and Beijing (140.92).
</P>
<P>
The survey "housewife's basket," conducted by the Swiss
company, includes 200 items like food drinks, clothes, equipment,
accommodation, health, transportation and entertainment.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Rejects Swazi Territorial Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Ambassador to
Swaziland Lopes Ndelane today rejected a claim that his country's
Maputo province should revert to Swaziland, South African Press
Association reported from Mbabane.
</P>
<P>
Ndelane was reacting to claims made in the Swazi parliament
last week by Senator Prince Khuzulwandle that Maputo province in
southern Mozambique was Swazi territory.
</P>
<P>
Khuzulwandle is chairman of a border adjustment committee
pursuing Swaziland's claim for the reintegration of territories
to which it is laying claim but are now part of adjoining states.
</P>
<P>
Khuzulwandle told the Senate last week that Maputo province
was Swazi land which was leased to Mozambique under an agreement
between the Portuguese and British colonial governments.
</P>
<P>
Ndelane said Mozambicans had fought the Portuguese to get
their land back and if Swaziland felt it had any claim to parts
of Mozambique, it should have joined in the independence war
against the Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
He said Swaziland was also a signatory to an Organization of
African Unity (OAU) charter which declared that countries'
borders should remain as they were at independence.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also rejected territorial claims of Swaziland
over part of South Africa's Mpumalanga province.
</P>
<P>
South African Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi also
cited the OAU charter, saying that the issue of boundaries has
been settled long ago.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes Harbor Engineering Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony in Beijing's Great
Hall of the People today marked the establishment of the China
Harbor Engineering Group.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong addressed the
ceremony, which was also attended by Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua,
saying that the ministry has made some progress in enterprise
reforms by turning transport and construction companies into six
large groups that can make these state-owned enterprises more
competitive, both domestically and internationally.
</P>
<P>
China Harbor Engineering Group is composed of the China Harbor
Engineering (Group) Company and ten subsidiary companies, with
assets of 17.2 billion yuan and at least 800,000 employees,
according to the company's president, Ye Huiran.
</P>
<P>
He said that all major coastal and river ports in China were
built by the company's subsidiaries and that they have been doing
business internationally since the '80s.
</P>
<P>
Their participation in the Macao International Airport Project,
as one of the major contractors, has made profits and earned an
international reputation.
</P>
<P>
The group works mainly in hydraulic engineering, dredging, and
manufacturing of port machinery, he said, but that it has become
more active in foreign trade, ship-building, transport, real
estate, financing, and investment.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Ye said, the engineering company has been on the
list of Top 225 International Contractors of the US's "Engineering
News Record" magazine, and it is one of the top 500 service
companies in China.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Election Envoys Come Knocking for Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The curtain rose on the first
Legislative Council elections in Hong Kong today as the actors
began their performance on the stage -- over 30,000 young election
ambassadors started knocking at voters' doors.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Tung Chee Hwa, officiated a ceremony this noon in
the Hong Kong Park to kick off the 1998 Legislative Council
Election Voter Registration Week.
</P>
<P>
Some 900 representatives of the five teams of over 30,000 Voter
Registration Ambassadors were sworn in at the ceremony by Tung by
taking the "Voter Registration Oath", saying: "I will do my best
in helping voters in registration."
</P>
<P>
Later, the electoral roll will be split into the five
geographical constituencies in the SAR -- "New Territories East,"
"New Territories West," Kowloon East, Kowloon West and Hong Kong
Island.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ambassadors will visit homes in their own
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The young envoys, teenagers, came from schools and universities
across the SAR.
</P>
<P>
"It's very good civic education for them. They can participate
in a way in managing Hong Kong affairs and learn something
about the electoral system," an official of the SAR government
said.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 voter registration supervisors, mostly teachers but
 also a small number of civil servants, are overseeing the work of
the ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Tung said: "The elections of the first
Legislative Council of the SAR is the first large-scale elections
in Hong Kong since it returned to the motherland on July 1, 1997.
We, the masters of our own affairs now, can and will make the
elections fair, open and right, so as to reflect the spirit of
'one country, two systems' and to realize the promise of 'Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong'."
</P>
<P>
He also urged all Hong Kong people to actively participate in
the registration process and, later, the final voting.
</P>
<P>
To lend support to today's event, a number of senior SAR
government officials, including Administrative Secretary Anson
Chan, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, Justice Secretary Elsie
Leung, Home Affairs Secretary David Lan and Constitutional Affairs
 Secretary Michael Suen, attended the ceremony and were on hand
to see off the ambassadors in their departure for their first
round of home visits.
</P>
<P>
Five ceremonial lions performed auspicious dances for the five
teams of ambassadors, who were also presented with colorful
banners.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the ceremony, Home Affairs Secretary Lan,
together with a team of the ambassadors, left the Hong Kong Park
for Yiu Tung Estate in Shau Kei Wan, Hong Kong Island, on board an
open-top bus to urge eligible residents to register for elections.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which aims to make the electoral roll as complete
as possible in time for next May's legislative elections, is "a
formidable task" in Hong Kong with more than two million
households, a SAR government official said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors, mobilized by the Home Affairs Department of
the SAR government, are scheduled to make about two million
door-to-door visits during the voter registration week starting
today to register as many voters as possible.
</P>
<P>
They will fill in the forms for the voters, who will have to
put their signatures on the bottom line. "Everything will be
completed at their doorstep," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The deadline of the entire registration process is the middle
of next January.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters, a bashful student-ambassador said: "I do
like the work, not only because Hong Kong is my home, but also
because I can learn much more in this campaign."

<HEADLINE> Macao-Taiwan Ocean Shipping Reports Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The ocean cargo shipping business
between Macao and Taiwan has reported profit for the first time
this year since it was launched in 1994, the Macao Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The profit was due to better management and Macao's higher
demand of Taiwan goods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Jointly run by the Ka-Ho Ocean Shipping Terminal, the Nam Kwang
Group Company and shipping companies from Taiwan, the Macao-Taiwan
cargo shipping service was launched in June 1994. But a total loss
of more than 10 million patacas (about 1.26 million US dollars)
had been made by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The company started a reshuffle in mid-1996 to cut its shipping
costs. It also stopped renting containers and bought its own, and
lowered its maintenance costs by more than 2 million patacas
(253,000 US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, the company has stepped out of
the red, and its profits began rising in July.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the company's ship sails five times a month,
carrying an average of 140 containers on each shipping. That is
above 70 percent of its shipping capacity. It carried only about
60 containers on each sail in the beginning.
</P>
<P>
The report said that shipping business grows because Macao's
demand for Taiwan products has risen over the past year. About 70
percent of the goods from Taiwan are for sale in Macao instead of
re-exporting to China's inland.
</P>
<P>
The future business growth, however, is not optimistic, the
report quoted experts as saying. Unless Macao's population has
sharp increase and the living standard in Macao and the
neighboring Pearl River Delta is remarkably improved, there will
be no big increase in shipping.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern China Region Becoming Leading Petrochemical Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 100 billion
yuan (12 billion US dollars) on exploration and development of oil
and gas resources in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
More than two million yuan (241,000 US dollars) will be used
for seven petrochemical bases producing chemical fiber, rubber,
plastics, nitrogenous fertilizer and methanol in Urumqi, Karamay,
Korla, Hami and other places.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has a third of China's oil and gas reserves, with 45
oil and gasfields having a combined proven reserve of 2.1 billion
tons of oil and 360 billion cu.m. of gas.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 oil and gasfields are now in operation, with a
combined annual production capacity of 17 million tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region will raise its annual oil output to 23
million tons and gas output to three billion cu.m. by the end of
the century, at which time the region's oil and gas will be 16
percent of the national output.
</P>
<P>
Its annual output of synthetic fiber and synthetic resin will
increase from last year's 500,000 tons to 1.47 million tons,
nitrogenous fertilizer, to 3.16 million tons, and tires, to 1.2
million sets.

<HEADLINE> S. African Estate Industry Emphasizes Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Estate
Agents Board (EAB) is considering re-introducing compulsory
examination for estate agents to improve its service, local daily
Saturday Star reported today
</P>
<P>
The EAB has proposed that the present system in which
candidate agents automatically obtain full status after a year
should also be abolished.
</P>
<P>
This follows a comprehensive review by the EAB of the current
education system for estate agents and its effectiveness in terms
of consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
EAB manager Andrew Harrison was quoted as saying that the
board did not want an exam system that is perceived as mere
compliance with a licensing requirement but one that is
recognized as a pro-active endeavor to provide meaningful
education to estate agents.
</P>
<P>
"We know that the proper education of estate agents is one of
the most important measures we have at our disposal in the
protection of consumers.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that education can only be meaningful if the
assimilation of knowledge and understanding is properly
examined," Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
Nationlink SA, the newest member of South African real estate
"big league" has wasted no time in establishing a heavy weight
training program.
</P>
<P>
In-house training is compulsory for, and free to, all
Nationlink agents, and the program is recognized as one of the
best and most consistent in the real estate industry, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
The program is intented to accommodate everyone from beginners
to highly experienced agents and starts with a three-day basic
course.
</P>
<P>
"After that, there are several modules to be completed,
including dealing with buyers, dealing with sellers, time
management and sole mandate. Next year we will be adding courses
on negotiation, marketing skills and, for agency principals,
management," training manager Hugo Steyn said.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed in 3 Train Explosions in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were
killed and 69 others injured in three powerful bomb explosions
that ripped through the compartments of three trains in India's
Tamil Nadu and Kerala states today, Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that three or five people were killed in
two blast incidents.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they suspected the hand of a religious
fundamentalist organization in the act.
</P>
<P>
Today is the fifth anniversary of the demolition of the
disputed mosque in Ayodhya of Uttar Pradesh in northern India by
the Hindu people. More than 1,000 people were killed in the
nation-wide violence following the demolition act five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 people were taken into preventive custody from
various parts of Tamil Nadu Friday as a precautionary measure to
ward off the trouble on the fifth anniversary of the Ayodhya
incident.
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders in the state had made an appeal on the same day
to observe peace during the anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners to Dominate Thai Finance Sector: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Finance Minister
Pisit Leeahtam has revealed that Thailand's financial sector will
be dominated largely by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He said on Friday that he was saddened that Thailand could no
longer take pride in the financial system it had built up over the
last 50 years, as mergers and takeovers of Thai finance firms by
foreign financial institutions at this stage have become
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Now it was time for Thai institutions to swallow their pride
and survive, Pisit said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is scheduled to announce on Monday the fate
of the 58 finance firms suspended by the Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
administration in June and August.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the 58 firms are expected to close
down, leaving no more than five to reopen.
</P>
<P>
The 58 finance firms were suspended because of their financial
mismanagement resulting in massive bad debts and a lack of
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
A few foreign takeover bids have been reported, but so far no
confirmation has been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police have been put on alert at the suspended
finance firms to prevent untoward incidents which might happen
after the announcement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A decision on the future of the 58 suspended companies has long
been seen as an important step in restoring public and investor
confidence.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's 12th Largest Conglomerate Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's 12th largest
conglomerate, Halla Group, was declared bankrupt Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Halla, with a gross asset of 326.2 billion won (about 282
million U.S. dollars), has piled up a debt totaling 6,476.4
billion won (5.6 billion U.S. dollars) borrowed from banks,
merchant banks, insurance companies and lease companies.
</P>
<P>
Halla's chief creditor Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) today
announced its decision to let the group go under, contributing its
failure to excessive investments in the newly-expanded
shipbuilding area.
</P>
<P>
The 16-affiliate Halla managed businesses in many fields
include chemicals, machinery, shipbuilding and construction.
</P>
<P>
Before the insolvency of Halla, the year 1997 had seen
liquidations of five other conglomerates which were among the
country's top 30. But it was the first bankruptcy since the
October financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
A top corporate official said the mounting deficits and debts
of Halla Heavy Industries dealt a heavy blow to the group. He
complained that after the October crisis, financial firms withdrew
their loans and suspended new loans.
</P>
<P>
The group narrowly escaped bankruptcy last Thursday after its
creditor banks provided an emergency loan to help it pay back
defaulted debts worthy of 241.2 billion won(about 209 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The group announced it will apply for court protection for
debt-rescheduling of two subsidiaries, Mando Machinery and Halla
Cement, Halla Construction while seeking court receiveship for
Halla's chief units Halla Heavy Industries and Halla Marine.
</P>
<P>
If creditors accept the group's debt rescheduling conditions,
Halla can be reshaped into a sound company through a tough
reshuffling program in three or four years, the group said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's largest conglomerate, Hyundai Group
ruled out the possibility of taking over the affiliates of Halla
Group despite the fact that owners of the two groups are brothers.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai had already done everything it could for Halla,
including the discounting of the group's bills and the purchasing
of commercial papers of its affiliates, an executive official in
Hyundai Group said.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai's financial units, Hyundai Merchant Banking and Hyundai
Securities which have lent Halla up to 800 billion won (about 692
million U.S. dollars), are considering of taking legal steps
toward the ill-fated group, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of South Korean large conglomerates said that the business
environment is rapidly worsening because it is obvious that
businesses in financial dilemma can no longer expect assistance
from the government or banks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poverty Alleviation, Hard Task for Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan, a South Asian
nation with a population of approximately 140 million, has made
great endeavors in recent years to reduce the proportion of its
poor people.
</P>
<P>
The government of Pakistan has taken the issue of poverty
alleviation as one of its top priorities.
</P>
<P>
The government initiated the Social Action Program (SAP) in
1992 to attend to the long-existing structural imbalance in
development.
</P>
<P>
The SAP, which included two phases, involves primary education,
basic health, population welfare and rural water supply and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of the program focused on enhancing its coverage
level and on improving the quality of services through sustained
increase in expenditures and specific policy measures in each area
the program covers.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the SAP between 1992 and 1996 produced
satisfactory results. Primary school attending rate rose from 84.8
percent to 89 percent for boys and from 53.7 percent to 57 percent
for girls, while life expectancy of women was improved from 61.2
to 62.9 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, contraceptive prevalence rate rose from 14 percent
to 22 percent in the first phase; infant mortality rate decreased
from 101 to 86 per thousand live births; rural water supply
coverage increased from 27 percent to 55 percent and that of rural
sanitation from 13 percent to 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has initiated the second phase of the SAP
(1996-2000) with an expected investment of 270 billion rupees (6.7
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the second phase, all indicators of primary school
attending rate, life expectancy for women, contraceptive
prevalence rate and rural water supply coverage are expected to be
improved further.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has set up a Federal Task Force on Poverty Eradication to
help improve its policy framework.
</P>
<P>
The task force has been entrusted to prepare a report on the
trends and magnitude of poverty, dimensions of a macroeconomic
policy and structural changes warranted for reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has time and again highlighted the
urgency to address policy issues such as investment in human
resources, institutional support packages for services, and
comprehensive training activities for both personnel and community
organizers engaged in poverty alleviation programs.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that to make the poverty alleviation
work more effective and fruitful, the government has to balance
the role of the public sector, non-governmental organizations and
donors from all sectors and the approved policy framework.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan now is the eighth most populous nation in the world.
Yet in terms of human development indicators, it ranks 134th among
174 developing countries, a fact which could hardly be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements made in the past few years in
alleviating poverty, the Pakistani government still faces a tough
challenge as about 28 percent of its population are still living
below the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> More Suspected H5N1 Cases Discovered in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Department of
Health today announced the discovery of two more suspected cases
of H5N1 influenza A.
</P>
<P>
The two suspected cases involved a 54-year-old man, who has
died and a 13-year-old girl, who is still in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory results were available Saturday morning, a
Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The laboratory specimens of the two suspected cases had been
sent urgently to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, United States for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
"The Hospital Authority has been informed of the initial
findings and has been advised to take appropriate surveillance and
prophylactic measures.
</P>
<P>
Investigation into the two suspected cases is being conducted,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Special Working Group on H5N1 set up by the Director of
Health has called an urgent meeting on Sunday and an announcement
will be made after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta will be arriving tonight to participate in the
investigation of the recent H5N1 cases.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman advised that the best way to combat influenza
infection was to build up body resistance by having a proper diet
with adequate exercise and rest.
</P>
<P>
"Good ventilation should be maintained to avoid the spread of
respiratory tract infection," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Estimated to Have 3.8 Million Problem Gamblers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A new study estimates that
3.8 million adults in the United States and Canada suffer from
serious gambling disorder.
</P>
<P>
It means an increase of more than 1.6 million since casino and
lotteries exploded across America two decades ago, said the study
conducted by Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
As if echoing the study, a survey released this week found that
gambling is the first concern of the Chinese American community
in San Francisco. Seventy percent of the 1,808 adults of Chinese
origin surveyed said that gambling is a big problem, which is
often connected with bankruptcy, loan-sharking and domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
All U.S. states except Utah and Hawaii offer some form of legal
gambling, from lotteries and horse lottery to slot machines and
blackjack. Casino gambling is legal in 26 states. Internet makes
it easier to bet from home on the computer.
</P>
<P>
Harvard researchers analyzed data on gambling addiction
published between 1977 and 1997. They estimated that almost 1.3
percent of adults who gamble are "pathological gamblers," up from 0.84
percent in 1993. It is believed there is a much greater number of
people with less-severe gambling problems.
</P>
<P>
The American Psychiatric Association describes "pathological
gambling" as an impulse-control disorder. More specifically, one
medical doctor says that compulsive pathological gambling is a
progressive disorder characterized by a continuous or periodic
loss of control over gambling, a preoccupation with gambling and
continuation of the behavior despite adverse consequences.
</P>
<P>
Describing his experience on Internet, a former gambler said
that compulsive gambling is something to the point where there is
no distinction between right and wrong, day and night or day to day.
</P>
<P>
According to the Harvard researchers, the growth in compulsive
gambling among adults is linked to the emergence of gambling as an
acceptable part of American's entertainment culture, where casinos
are advertised as family resorts and lotteries are touted by
governments as the path to easy millions.

<HEADLINE> Bumper Grain Harvest for Jiangsu Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province is expected to
reap a record-high 35 billion kilograms of grain this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest prediction shows that the province's grain output is to
total 35.64 billion kilograms, a rise of 2.5 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the achievements, counties which have an average of
400 kilograms of wheat per mu (15 mu equals to one hectare) and
townships which have an average of 500 kilograms of wheat per mu
have emerged for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials attributed the bumper grain harvest to
consistent government policy encouraging the development of
farming.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, the province had
injected 1.19 billion yuan (143.37 million US dollars) in
agriculture, a year-on-year increase of 98.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The application of new technology and scientific methods have
also been of great help to farming.

<P>
LAGOS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- About 15 people were feared dead
with tens of others injured in the latest clash between Ife and
Modakeke communities in west Nigeria's Osun state over the past
four days.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fightings were still going on in several areas as at
3:00 p.m. Friday afternoon, while the efforts of police to put
out the fire of burning houses continued to be frustrated by the
non-functional fire fighting unit, according to press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Commercial activities were completely paralyzed in the
communities as major roads were completed deserted.
</P>
<P>
While armed police were busy dispersing the militant youths
from the face-to-face battle, Osun state administrator Anthony
Obi was in the two communities Friday afternoon to monitor the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The new round of clash, in a series triggered off by the
relocation of local government headquarters from Madakeke to
Ike-Ogbo in Ile-Ife area earlier this year, broke out last
Tuesday.

<P>
On the same day, the state government said it would proceed
with the State House of Assembly polls due today in the feuding

<HEADLINE> 3 Lebanese Civilians Killed in Explosions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Three Lebanese civilians were
killed and another was wounded Friday night in a series of
explosions in south Lebanon, Lebanese radio Voice of the People
reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Maas, 55, a shepherd, was tending his flock on the
slopes of Wadi Salouqi, 400 meters below the village of Majdal
Slim, on the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon,
when he was killed in an explosion.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Alaeddine, 17, and Qassem Maas, both relatives of Maa,
were also killed in another series of blasts as they tried to
recover the shepherd's body. Rafiq Zahwa, who accompanied them,
was wounded.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether the explosions came from roadside bombs
or land mines.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese newspaper the Daily Star said that Wadi Salouqi is
an important route used by the resistance forces to infiltrate
into the central sector of the 1,200 square kilometers buffer
zone occupied by Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces regularly plant land mines and road side bombs
in the area to target the resistance fighters. Last summer two
children were wounded by land mines in the same area.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's (Party of God) southern commander Sheikh Nabil
Qaouk condemned the killings.
</P>
<P>
"We hold the Zionist enemy fully responsible for this crime
and everything that will follow it," he told reporters.
"The event will not pass without severe punishment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Flexible Policy Helps Zhangjiajie Attract Funds to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Zhangjiajie, a major tourist
city in central China, has attracted about five billion yuan
(602.4 million US dollars) in building tourist facilities thanks
to flexible policies.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province is famous for Wulingyuan Scenic
and Historical Site Area-- a unique mountain resort which is on the
world heritage list of UNESCO. However, development of tourist
facilities were constantly delayed or interrupted in the past by
lack of funds, partly due to a rigid investment policy practised
by the government.
</P>
<P>
As the reform deepened, the local government has become more
flexible in absorbing investment, including overseas financing.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it only took 11 months for a Hong Kong investor to
add a 80 million-yuan (9.638 million US dollars) cableway on the
scenic Tianzi Mountain.
</P>
<P>
Another investor from Hong Kong spent 30 million yuan to build a
high-grade highway, which opened to traffic in August, linking two
major scenic areas.
</P>
<P>
The local government also leased the Baofeng Lake Park to a
Malaysian investor, who has turned the previous money-loser into a
profit-maker by investing 25 million yuan in it.
</P>
<P>
As a major fund-raising breakthrough, the city has successfully
listed the scenic area on the domestic stock market. The public
listing marked the first stock of China's travel industry.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Hopes Better Ties with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has expressed the hope that the relations between Cairo
and Tehran would reach the highest level, local daily Iran News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I hope mutual relations between Iran and Egypt will reach
their highest level," Moussa said Friday upon his arrival here
for the foreign ministers' meeting of the eighth Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) to be opened this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt and Iran maintained their contacts and
consultations despite the fact that there are no diplomatic
relations between the two Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed diplomatic ties with Egypt soon after Egypt
signed the David Camp peace accords with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that grounds existed between the two countries
for understanding and for dialogue, adding that the existence of
differences between the two countries was natural and it does not
necessarily mean the existence of tension or negative attitudes
between Cairo and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic about the future," he said, stressing that
"as I have repeatedly said, relation with Iran is very important
for us."
</P>
<P>
With the deadlock of the Middle East peace process due to the
hardline policies of the Israeli Likud government, Iran and Egypt
are getting closer in recent months and there is some speculation
here that it is possible for the two countries to resume ties in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies and some Iranian officials expressed the hope
that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would be able to attend
the OIC summit to be opened Tuesday, paving the way for the
rapprochement between the two countries.

wonders of the world" and the Forest of Steles in Xi'an, the
provincial capital, travelers can go to and live in a cave
dwelling of a local farmer, not only to enjoy coolness in summer
and warmth in winter, but also to discover a mysterious oriental
culture extending several thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 kilometers northwest of Xi'an, near the mausoleum of
Wuzetian, an empress of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and the only
empress in China's history, one can find a folklore culture
village jointly built by investors from China and the Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Covering 26,000 square meters, the attraction offers a chance
for visitors to participate in local crafts such as paper-making
and weaving.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Police Urged to Preserve Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Elsie Leung Oi-sie, secretary
for justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government, today called on the police to continue to contribute
to Hong Kong's top priority of preserving the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government is committed to the rule of law which
dictates that no one is above the law, Leung said at the police
passing-out parade ceremony held at the Police Training School
today.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the wide powers given to police officers to enable them
to carry out their duties must be exercised in strict accordance
with the law.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the rule of law is that legal powers must not
be exercised arbitrarily, or be the subject of improper influence,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"The decisions that you make, as police officers, must be based
on the merits of the case, not on who is involved, or how rich, or
influential or well-connected he or she may be," she said.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that police officers could not successfully carry
out their duties without the support and confidence of the
community.
</P>
<P>
The growing involvement by the community in fighting crime is a
reflection of the esteem in which the Police Force is held.
</P>
<P>
She called on the force not to undermine this support by
behavior that would alienate members of the public and every
member of the force must strive to meet the rising expectations of
the community.
</P>
<P>
The Police Force can earn the respect of local people only when
they are polite, helpful and patient, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly true for Police officers, who are
constantly dealing with members of the public, often in stressful
situations," she said.
</P>
<P>
She praised the Police Force who has earned its reputation for
excellence through the dedication and professionalism of its
officers, and its commitment to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
She called on the graduating officers to help preserve that
reputation and pledged the continued support of the Department of
Justice to the Police in the maintenance of law and order.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 inspectors and 101 police constables graduated at
today's parade.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Calls for Cooperation in Flood Forecasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Water Resources
Minister Abdur Razzak has called on neighboring countries to
cooperate in facilitating flood forecasting and warning in the
region, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
He made the call here Friday at a two-day international seminar
attended by about 40 water and flood forecasting experts from
Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Bhutan, France, the United Kingdom and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The four South Asian countries especially want to seek
cooperation in forecasting floods in the Ganges, the Brahmaputra
and the Meghna river basins, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, which was organized by the Bangladesh
National Committee of International Commission on Irrigation and
Drainage, Abdur Razzak urged the countries in the basins to work
together to improve their present system of flood forecasting and
warning.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to regular and often
devastating floods, the minister said. "It needs to protect its
people and property from this continual hazard."
</P>
<P>
On flood management, he said the question to be solved by the
planners now is what degree of protection is practicable,
affordable and justifiable in terms of structural and
non-structural measures.
</P>
<P>
He said another aspect that demands due consideration is the
prospect of reducing flood intensities in the downstream of the
three rivers through regulating flood flows in their upper
catchments.
</P>
<P>
The minister said such regulation through upstream storage of
monsoon flows would significantly augment the dry season flows of
these rivers to ease the water availability situation in the
critical dry months in all the countries in the basins.

topped 192,500.
</P>
<P>
This is also a 86 percent year-on-year rise for the province,
ranking first in the country. The province's tourism industry
flourishes because of the Huangshan Mountain, a famous tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
The province earned 38 million US dollars from overseas
tourists in the first nine months, an increase of 60 percent.
</P>
<P>

MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
announced today that his country will extend emergency assistance
to drought-hit Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued here, Ramos directed the
Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare and
Development to extend immediate medical and food assistance to
Papua New Guinea, which is now in the throes of an acute food
shortage as a result of a long dry spell induced by the El Nino
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that the Philippine assistance to Papua New Guinea
should not be less than 10,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Ramos, the Philippine Embassy in Port Moresby
said that at least 100 people have died from starvation and up to
250,000 people are without food right now in Papua New guinea,
where thousands of Filipinos have been working for many years.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican police has detained
in Machaze, south of Manica province, a lorry with South African
license plate which was loaded with 15 engines for military
planes including MIG bomber and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper reported today that the lorry which
belongs to South Africa's Gauteng province was detained on
Thursday when it was trying to cross the border from Machaze to
South Africa, about 400 km from the provincial capital Chimoio.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the engines on the lorry are not
new, and they are estimated to have been dismantled and stolen
from Beira Air Base, the biggest military airport in central
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
A white South African was detained for this but his name was
not revealed by the police.
</P>
<P>
During the 16-year-long civil war in Mozambique, the former
Soviet Union had provided Mozambican government army with many
military planes including MIG planes.
</P>
<P>
These planes had long been out of use due to lack of
maintenance as a result of money shortage.

<HEADLINE> Medical Care Reform Eases National Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- All provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions in China have introduced a reform scheme
under which State subsidies only pay part of people's medical
expenses, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
For example, since October 3, patients in Beijing who had been
enjoying free health care can only prescribe from 1,156 types of
medicines. Cost of medicines not on the list will not be
reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
The central government in 1951 declared free health care for
people. This covered nearly all urban residents.
</P>
<P>
More than four decades later, the free health care system has
become a major financial burden for the government and State
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem is the rapid rise of costs for free medical
care, although it was not purely "free" because patients have been
required to pay five to 20 percent of medical costs since the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
"The medical care reform now undergoing in China is expected to
ease the heavy burden nationwide," an official said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Slows Designing Long-legged 777 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Boeing has slowed design
work on the new 10,000-mile-nonstop model of its 777 airliner
because it has received no firm orders after six months of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
Another proposed model, the Boeing 747-500/600, was dropped
early this year.
</P>
<P>
The company began seeking customers for the 200-seat,
two-engined jetliner, called the 777-200/300X, earlier this year,
and hoped to launch development by the end of the year and deliver
the first aircraft in late 2000.
</P>
<P>
So far only Malaysian Airlines Systems (MLA) has expressed its
intention of buying the new model. But the Malaysian government's
planned spending cuts might affect the purchase.
</P>
<P>
Many of the potential buyers of the new model are airlines in
Asia, where economic problems are slowing traffic and profits.
</P>
<P>
In addition, rival Airbus Industries has captured commitments
for about 50 of its new four-engine A340s to go into service in
2002 or 2003. The new plane is priced at about 150 million
U.S. dollars and its engines are already in service, which makes
it cheaper than the 777X.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing long-range model, expected to be sold at a price of
up to 170 million dollars per airplane, will require new and
larger engines. The company has to consider reducing costs of both
manufacturing and operations.
</P>
<P>
President of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, Ron Woodard,
said earlier this week that a launch of the new 777 model remains
a possibility. "It's up for the customers to say where we are," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Calls for Preparations for Tougher Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai deputy prime minister
Bhichai Rattakul has urged the Thai people to prepare for even
tougher times in the next three to six months, predicting that the
country's economic crisis will bottom out after that period.
</P>
<P>
"We will face more hardship in the next three to six months
because the situation has not reached its low-point," the Nation
newspaper today quotes Bhichai as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The people will have to be more patient," he said, adding that
the government will eventually be able to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
He blamed external factors for the Thai currency's all-time low
last week.
</P>
<P>
Up to December 4, the baht had lost a staggering 65 percent of
its value against the dollar in five months since its float on
July 2. On Wednesday, it dropped to 43.05 against the dollar, and
dealers will not rule out a further decline in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai expressed the belief that the people will be fully
cooperative with the government in its efforts to revive the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, top officials of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and deputy prime minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who
oversees the country's economy, expressed similar optimism about
the bottom-out. However, private sector analysts, including
commercial bank executives, believe that it will take at least two
years for the country's economy to see an upturn.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Ukraine to Build Strategic Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said today that the Ukrainian-Russian treaty on friendship and
partnership signed in May would lead to a strategic partnership
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that he believed the treaty he signed with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin would be approved by the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet Alexander Moroz held
talks in Moscow this month with leaders of Russia's Duma (the
lower house) and federal council (the upper house) on an early
approval of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that Russia and Ukraine should set up closer
relations in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said that obstacles between the two countries had brought
great loss to the bilateral economic relations. Since Russia
imposed a dual value-added tax upon imports from Ukraine in May
1996, Ukraine's trade had suffered a loss of three billion hryvnas
(about 1.596 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Kuchma and Yeltsin agreed that Russia would
exempt imports from Ukraine from dual value-added tax as from
January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said a short and long-term cooperation plan would be
signed between the two countries during his coming visit to
Russia. It would be a detailed and practical one covering
economy, science and technology and culture.

BELGRADE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The coming meeting in Bonn
over the Bosnian situation must treat equally the two political
entities and three nationalities in Bosnia, the Serbian member of
the Bosnian Presidency said this evening.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik made the remarks in Pale after talks with
United States ambassador in Sarajevo, Ricard Kauzlaric, and Jakov
Gerasimov, Russian charge d'affaires. They discussed the Bonn
meeting of December 9 to 10 of the committee that oversees
implementation of the Dayton peace accords in Bosnia.
</P>

Krajisnik said the Bonn meeting should not change the Dayton
Accord.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of giving more power to the NATO-led
multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR) was unacceptable for
Serbians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbia Republic would fulfill its obligations under the
accord, he stated.
</P>
<P>
But it would harm the peace and stability in Bosnia if somebody
tended to force anything not mentioned in the Dayton accord on
others, he added.

(CCEA) and the idea is to enumerate all enterprises engaged in
economic activities except the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
The census, which will cover both urban and rural enterprises,
will collect information on enterprises and their location, type
of activity and nature of operation. The survey will provide
information for planning and policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
The economic census will also draw a sample frame for detailed
surveys of unorganized activities. These sample surveys will
provide information on investments, capital structure, employment,
input consumption, product output, services and other economic
characteristics like the ratio of entrepreneurial activities in
the unorganized sector.

<HEADLINE> Indian to Open Green Channel for Electronic Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 6 (Xinhua)-- The Indian government has
decided to open a green channel for exporters of electronic goods
by simplifying import and export clearance procedures to help them
execute orders at short notice, a government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new facility, Indian exporters of electronic goods
can avoid delays by opting for "self declaration" with regard to
the quantity, value and the duty rate of goods imported.
</P>
<P>
The exporters could therefore clear their import consignments
quickly, send them to the production line and ship their export
consignments without any delay.
</P>
<P>
This facility is necessary for boosting electronics sector
exports as Indian exporters import most of the components for
manufacturing hardware. The "self declaration" option will be
available in the case of export clearance too.
</P>
<P>
To check misuse, the Customs Department will conduct random
audit and verify if exporters are evading customs duty.
</P>
<P>
The facility will be introduced on an experimental basis first.
If it works properly, the procedures will be put in use on a
long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
Electronics is the first sector set to benefit from the "real"
green channel facility, which would also be introduced to the
garments sector if it proves to be successful.
</P>
<P>
Exporters from various sectors have complained that procedural
hassles take up much of their time and delay execution of export
orders. They have demanded a streamlining of procedures.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Software Programmers to Lose Overtime Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. state of
Washington has made a new labor law that could save companies such
as Microsoft and Boeing millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, time-and-a-half pay for thousands of
software-industry professionals working under hourly contract
would be eliminated, reported the Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
Software companies and other corporations such as Boeing often
hire temporary workers for short-term projects which require large
amount of overtime on jobs. It is estimated that Microsoft alone
hires about 5,000 contract workers, nearly one-third of its Seattle
work force.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will only apply to higher pay ranks. As written,
the rule would exempt from overtime "any employee who is a
computer system analyst, computer programmer, software developer
or other similar skilled worker" who has experience and
theoretical knowledge of computers.
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Labor and Industries has set February 1
as the tentative date for implementing the change.
</P>
<P>
Those affected employees would be paid "straight time" for
extra hours, while those earning under $27.63 per hour would still
receive the overtime premium. Most software programmers earn 40
or 50 dollars an hour.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal law was changed in 1995 to exempt software
professionals from overtime rules. Most other states already have
adopted the change, which gives employees and employers more
flexibility in scheduling work hours.
</P>
<P>
Usually, employers like to let contract employees work 60 or 70
hours at a stretch and then take a few days off, a work pattern
some employees also prefer.
</P>
<P>
But there are contract workers who do not have security of
benefit such as health insurance. Overtime pay is actually a
tradeoff for them.

<HEADLINE> 30 Clearing, Forwarding Firms Suspended in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Revenue Authority
(KRA) has suspended the operations of 30 clearing and forwarding
agents in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa in fight with imports
under the name of transit goods, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agents have failed to account for the transit goods they
cleared in the past eight months and their operating licenses
will not be renewed until they pay the outstanding customs duty,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Most of these companies listed cleared goods including cars,
second-hand clothes and electronics which are believed to be in
the local market although they left the port as transit cargo in
order to avoid paying customs duty, said the authority.
</P>
<P>
So far these agents have not confirmed to the revenue body
that the goods actually left the country as indicated on the
entry form.
</P>
<P>
However, Owen Magotti, a director of Lions Export and Import
Agencies Ltd., which is on the list of the suspended companies,
said he would take the KRA to court for suspending his
operations.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the clearing and forwarding agents were not to
blame for the non-payment of duty, and accused the go-down owners
of releasing the goods to their owners without the knowledge of
the clearing agents.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 40 falcons
confiscated from smugglers were released back to the wild in
Beijing Mangshan National Forest Park yesterday, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Only one of them failed to fly away and will be cared for by
the park. Most of others are expected to return to their home in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time of wild release this year by the
Beijing Forestry Bureau (BFB) and Beijing Customs. On the first
occasion, a number of falcons were released in the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Yang Dehong, senior official at BFB said more seized falcons
will be released when they are fit enough.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Customs have seized 94 smuggled falcons since late
August, including 32 discovered in a case last week. They are
temporarily being taken care of by the Beijing Zoo and the Beijing
Endangered Animal Breeding Center.
</P>
<P>
Smugglers, some from abroad, started their activities earlier
than normal this year, commencing in mid-August rather than
October as in the past, according to Wang Minzhong, vice-director
of the bureau's Wildlife Protection Station.
</P>
<P>
They have also broadened their channels and adopted more
duplicitous measures to smuggle the falcons, classified as rare
birds under State class two protection.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Medicare Reform Appointees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
named his appointees on Friday to the 17-member commission on
keeping Medicare -- the federal health insurance program --
solvent beyond baby-boomer retirements.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Republicans in Congress are now stuck in a
stalemate over naming a chairman.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan panel, by statute, was to have been in place by
December 1.
</P>
<P>
Of the candidates mentioned for the chairman of the commission,
Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, has surfaced as the leading
contender, Republican aides said. House Republicans remain
concerned about a Democrat taking the chairmanship and are
insisting on a Republican co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
Under the statute that created the commission, the chairman is
to be decided by the mutual consent of Clinton, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his appointments outside the Oval Office, Clinton
said: "I look forward to their proposals to keep Medicare at the
core of the American dream in the new century.
</P>
<P>
"We have an obligation to strengthen it for the next century,
to ensure that it is as strong for our children as it has been for
our parents and to ensure that the baby boomers have access to
quality, affordable health care when we retire."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republican Senator Phil Gramm said: "I hope we can
conclude quickly that raising taxes to rescue Medicare just won't
work."
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt made the
final two appointments.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Gingrich and Lott announced their eight
members. Gingrich asked each of his four appointments to promise
not to consider tax increases as a way to rescue the health
insurance program that covers about 37 million elderly and
disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton did not extract such a commitment from his
nominees, spokesman Mike McCurry said, because he didn't want to
tie the hands of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Medicare is expected to begin running deficits as the baby boom
generation begins retiring in about a decade.

<HEADLINE> Russia Suggests Increase in Iraqi Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia is advocating that the
amount of the Iraqi oil exported, in exchange for humanitarian
food and medical supplies over another six months, should be
raised to four billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Gennady
Tarasov, made the observation at a news conference after the
United Nations passed the Number 1143 resolution, which extended
the oil-for-food plan for another six months.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said the report UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan,
submitted to the Security Council, showed that the Iraqis had been
living without enough food, basic medicines and medical equipment,
and the death rate had risen.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government paid great attention to the serious
crisis in Iraq, Tarasov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia regarded the Number 1143 resolution as a interim
one, which could provide the possibility of improving the
humanitarian plan. It was also the prelude for discussing the
implementment to the oil-for-food deal by the end of 1998, Tarasov
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Hits Record Low of 4,020 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah breached
the 4,000 level against the U.S. dollar for the first time in
afternoon trade on Friday in response to the latest slump in
regional currencies, dealers here said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, Bank Indonesia, stepped in several times to
provide some support to the rupiah, but failed to reverse the
trend as the South Korean won tumbled and the Japanese yen
followed, said the dealers.
</P>
<P>
They said the drop in the rupiah was not only driven by a
combination of regional weaknesses but also by an increasing
dollar demand from the indebted local corporations.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which opened at 3,930/50, touched a new historic
low of 4,020 against the dollar in spot market during a lunch
break despite a market intervention by the central bank in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
The currency recovered slightly to close at 3,970/90 following
a rebound in the Malaysian ringgit, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah against the dollar has dropped by about
50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the stock market was unperturbed, jumping 3.2 percent
to close at 414.78 points -- its second straight day of gain.
</P>
<P>
Brokers described Friday's gain as a short-term technical
rebound, supported by the rise of the regional stock markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects involved in the
bombings of the stadiums in Stockholm and Gothenburg were formally
charged on Friday and will stand trial next week.
</P>
<P>
The bombing happened in August this year when the city was
launching a bid for the 2004 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Chief prosecutor Eva Regner said that the men, both Swedes,
were on charge of "preparing to devastate public property".
</P>
<P>
The men were likely to be sentenced to two to eight years, but
on this lesser charge the court is at liberty to impose a lower
penalty.
</P>
<P>
A little-known group called "We Who Built Sweden" claimed
responsibility for the bombings, insisting that money should be
spent on social programmes rather than hosting sports events.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 Games were awarded to Athens of Greece.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation to Remain Below 6 percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite the current financial
crisis and the devaluation of the peso, the Philippines' inflation
rate in 1997 could remain below 6 percent, said a senior finance
official.
</P>
<P>
The country is assured of a manageable price situation by
year-end despite the mild increase in the inflation rate from
October to November, Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Cielito
Habito said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
That was "consistent with expectation," Habito said, because
the November rate of 6.5 percent has brought the January to
November average to less than 5 percent, and is certain to keep
the full-year average at "well below our projected average of 6 to
6.5 percent."
</P>
<P>
Even the 0.6 percent month-on-month rise is consistent with the
average projected for the period, which is 0.6 to 0.7 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office, the country's
inflation rate in November rose to 6.5 percent year-on-year,
compared to 5.7 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Habito's view was supported by Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson, who said the "whole year average inflation rate would be
less than 5.5 percent even if the December inflation rate rises to
12 percent."
</P>
<P>
The recent increase in oil prices and the 35 percent
devaluation of the peso in the last five months resulted in the
higher inflation rate in November, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Lessons From Southeast Asian Financial Crisis (1)  by Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1997 will be
remembered as an unfortunate one for both individuals and
governments in Southeast Asia, as the region has been devastated
by an unexpected financial crisis in the year.
</P>
<P>
For many individuals, their fortunes built up over many a year
crumbled before their eyes because of currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
For most governments, their economic achievements made in the
last decades were eliminated overnight by market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Since the crisis began to hit the region in July, the
currencies of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Singapore have depreciated between 10 and 35 percent. Stock
markets have also fallen to their lowest in years.
</P>
<P>
Economists painted a bleak picture of Southeast Asian
economies, which, they said, are likely to grow around 5 to 6
percent for this year and next, 2 or 3 percentage points lower
than last year.
</P>
<P>
The economic pains have triggered political instability in some
parts of the region, where protests against price hikes, bank
closures and layoffs have been frequent in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Amid strong protests against his government's failure to check
the crisis, Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh resigned in
November.
</P>
<P>
The shock wave also raged beyond the region. From Hong Kong to
Australia, from Japan to the United States, stock markets
experienced dramatic ups and downs in October. Now, South Korea
and Japan have been dragged into the crisis with market
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
What has happened to these "economic tigers" and why?
</P>
<P>
Some people, including government leaders, point the finger at
currency speculators. But many economists argue that common
financial risks created for many years in the region are the main
cause of the crisis though speculators should also be blamed.
</P>
<P>
From the crisis, policy makers, bankers, investors, businessmen
and economists can draw valuable lessons, which may help prevent
the recurrence of such crises.
</P>
<P>
According to economic analysts, a poorly managed and regulated
banking sector could aggravate financial risks by lending for
consumption and speculative purposes or by financing a structure
boom.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Southeast Asian banks enjoyed lending booms
while their loan-loss provisions fell. From 1994 to 1996, lending
by Philippine banks shot up 38 percent while provisioning for loan
losses dropped from 3.3 percent of total loans to just 1.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to boost profits, Southeast Asian banks extended
excessive loans to the property sector. Indonesian banks' exposure
to the property sector accounted for nearly 20 percent of their
total loans, Thailand and Malaysia about 18 percent and the
Philippines over 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The over-exposure to the property sector resulted in the
over-supply of office and residential buildings and a huge amount
of non-performing loans, which will peak through 1998 at 73
billion dollars in the region.
</P>
<P>
Financial risks created by non-performing loans forced Thailand
to close 58 financial institutions and Indonesia 16 commercial
banks during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
A lesson from the crisis is that as banks dominate financial
intermediation in developing countries, strict banking rules must
be worked out and implemented. Otherwise, these countries could
meet the same fate as Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Lessons From Southeast Asian Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another important lesson drawn from the crisis is that
developing countries must adopt a flexible exchange rate system,
which should keep abreast of the economic development and
globalization in the world.
</P>
<P>
Before the crisis, Southeast Asian countries fixed exchange
rates for their currencies, which were pegged to the U.S. dollar.
But when the appreciation of the dollar vis-a-vis the Japanese yen
started in 1995, Southeast Asian countries did not change their
policy and instead kept the peg.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the dollar's appreciation led to the rapid
appreciation of Southeast Asian currencies, contributing to a
slowdown in exports of several Southeast Asian countries in 1996
and 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to World Bank economists, Thailand experienced a real
appreciation of 17 percent between 1995 and June 1997 compared
with 20 percent for the Philippines, 10 percent for Malaysia and 8
percent for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
During this period, Thailand saw the sharpest deterioration in
export performance. Thailand's exports in dollar terms were flat
in 1996 and the first half of 1997 while export receipts increased
by 5 percent annually in Malaysia and 9.5 percent in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline in exports pushed up the current account
deficits of Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia to a
range of between 4.6 percent and 9 percent of their gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
The third lesson from the crisis is that the economic structure
of developing countries should always be adapted to the changes of
the world market and economic growth cannot be sustained by
relying on the export of a single product.
</P>
<P>
But the economic structures of Southeast Asian countries are
too vulnerable to the constant changes of the world market as
these economies depend heavily on the export of electronic
products.
</P>
<P>
As electronic products accounted for around 40 percent of the
total exports in the region, the lower demand for electronics in
the United States and Europe last year cut down steeply the export
revenues of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that if Southeast Asian countries fail to
undertake economic adjustments, including the change of their
economic structures, they could suffer again whenever changes take
place in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
They called on countries in the region to develop more
high-tech products so as to bolster their economic
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the poor quality of investments in the region also
led to financial risks over the last few years. And this is the
fourth lesson for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, Southeast Asia was the fastest growing
region in the world, but countries in the region borrowed heavily
abroad to finance their development.
</P>
<P>
At present, foreign debts make up 40 percent of GDP for
Thailand, around 50 percent for the Philippines, 47 percent for
Indonesia and 39 percent for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Of their foreign debts, about 25 percent are in the form of
short-term borrowings, most of which are speculative in nature.
</P>
<P>
Their reliance on foreign funds, and short-term debts in
particular, not only increased current account deficits but also
resulted in financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the worst of the financial crisis in Southeast
Asia seems to be over, at least for now. The valuable lessons from
the five-month-old crisis may help both Southeast Asian nations
and other developing countries in avoiding financial risks in
their future development.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks Warned of Destabilizing Factors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investment firm Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. has warned Philippine banks of the destabilizing
factors in the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In its November issue of Asian Fixed Income Monthly, the firm
said: "The turbulence in Southeast Asia generally and the
volatility in the peso continue to weaken the Philippine economy
and, in its wake, the operating environment for the banks."
</P>
<P>
The Philippine stock market has dropped more than 35 percent
since January, making it one of the worst performing stock markets
in the world this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that political concerns regarding the May 1998
elections in the country were also an "unsettling force."
</P>
<P>
"This combination of factors is increasing the systemic
instability in the Philippine banking sectors," Merrill Lynch
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that these factors led to the significant slowing of
loan growth, deterioration in asset quality and greater premium of
defending balance sheet liquidity among Philippine banks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. firm estimated that the country's bank loans will
expand by only 20 percent to 25 percent this year from a high
growth of 52 percent in 1996 and 43 percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Cancels Visit To Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has decided to cancel a trip to Tehran, Iran, after being advised
to take a full 10-day rest because of fatigue, a senior official
announced here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"The president's medical experts team has advised him to take a
rest," Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said, adding that
President Soeharto has thus decided to cancel his planned
participation in the upcoming summit of the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) to be held in Tehran on December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
"The president has asked Foreign Minister Ali Alatas to
represent him at the OIC summit," Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that President Soeharto is in good health. "The
presidential doctors team is of the opinion that the health of the
president is in very good condition," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Moerdiono, President Soeharto's decision to take a
rest was made after a strenuous 12-day, three-continent trip that
included visits to Namibia, Canada and Saudi Arabia, where he
performed the minor haj (umroh) together with his children and
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto traveled a total of 28,500 kilometers on
this trip, Moerdiono said, adding: "This shows how strenuous the
president's trip has been."
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the president would rest at his residence in
Jakarta and that he would continue to carry out state functions
from his Jalan Cendana residence. Only the most important
documents and correspondence would be forwarded to the president,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day rest will allow President Soeharto to attend the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, between December 14 and 16.
</P>
<P>
However, Moerdiono declined to confirm the president's
attendance at the ASEAN summit, saying "at the appropriate time, I
will give the information."
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who is widely expected to be reelected for a seventh
five-year term of office in a presidential election in March 1998,
underwent a thorough medical checkup in Germany in July last year,
and his doctors there gave him a clean bill of health.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Call for Increase of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Many developing
countries have called for an increase of their representation in a
reformed Security Council of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Asian, African and Latin American countries made such appeal in
the debate on the reform of the Security Council of the 52nd
Session of the U.N. General Assembly this week.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahamd said the reform of
the Security Council should be based on the principles of
equitable geographical representation and sovereign equality of
states.
</P>
<P>
Representative of Egypt Nabil Elaraby, who spoke on behalf of
the Non-Aligned Movement, said the Movement is of the view that
the reform and expansion of the Council should be considered as
parts of a package that takes account of the sovereign equality of
states and the principle of equitable geographical distribution.
</P>
<P>
"The gross underrepresentation of the Non-Aligned states in the
Council should be corrected by its enlargement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the reform of the Council should not be
limited to an increase in permanent seats for the developed
countries at the expense of the less developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's representative Issac E. Ayewah urged a correction of
non-African representation in the Council's permanent membership,
while pointing to the fact that Africa has the largest number of
U.N. member states which constitute almost one third of the U.N.
membership.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's representative Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the
Council's reform should guarantee representation for the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Any reform and expansion should be carried out based on the
principles of transparency, sovereign equality of states and
equitable geographical distribution in accordance with the U.N.
Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's representative Volodymyr Yel'chenko said the Council
needs a more representative character, more support from member
states and a higher level of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine supports increased representation of the
developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The eastern European countries should also have an additional
non-permanent seat, he said.
</P>
<P>
Several countries rejected the so-called "quick fix" proposal
to admit several countries first into the Security Council without
wide consideration by member states.
</P>
<P>
"The enlargement (of the Council) should not have strict time
limits," Yel'chenko said.
</P>
<P>
Less than 60 countries spoke at the debate which stated on
Thursday. A draft resolution on the Council's reform has been put
before delegates for consideration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Surpasses 130-yen Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar reached its
third 5-year high against the yen this week and rose against other
major currencies Friday after a strong U.S. employment report.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 130.20 yen,
up from 129.39 late Thursday. It was the first time the U.S.
currency crossed the 130-yen level since May 1992.
</P>
<P>
The dollar surged in the morning session after the government
reported that a burst of job growth pushed the U.S. unemployment
rate to a 24-year low of 4.6 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The bond market took an opposite response on the data, fearing
the Federal Reserve might feel the need to raise interest rates to
cool inflationary pressure. Investors drove bond prices down, but
that boosted the dollar by pushing interest rates higher.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was changing hands at 1.7830 marks, up from
1.7715. In addition, the U.S. currency climbed to a six-week high
against the British pound, which stood at 1.6573 U.S. dollars, up
from 1.6669 U.S. dollars on continued reaction to the Bank of
England's decision not to raise interest rates Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the currencies of South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore
and Indonesia all dropped against the dollar Friday.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday: 1.4400 Swiss francs, up from 1.4318; 5.9641 French
francs, up from 5.9260; 1,744 Italian lire, up from 1,736.70; and
1.4238 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4299.

<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Zamalek claimed the title
of the Afro-Asian Football Tournament as the club's golden boy
Mohammed Sabri scored the winner in a nail-biting match on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zamalek beat Yohang 1-0, avenging its 1-2 loss to the best
South Korean club team during their previous encounter in Seoul,
the capital of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the kickoff, the young Pharaohs dominated the
pitch and their relentless offensive turned out several
near-goals, leaving the Korean guards scrambling to keep the gate
clean.
</P>
<P>
In the 12th minute, Sabri turned a long pass into a strong
right kick outside the penalty area. The ball flew to the left of
the net and Korean goalie failed to pluck it out.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the South Korean team turned up the heat
and organized a string of fast offensives in front of the gate,
but failed to get an equalizer.
</P>
<P>
Zamalek, the African football club championship title-holder,
is Egypt's best football club after Ahli.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Rise Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Stocks rallied on Wall Street
Friday, setting new highs for the first time in nearly two months,
as a surprisingly strong economic report eased worries about weak
profits.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.97 points to 8,149.13,
just 110 points shy of its all-time best close at 8,159.31 on
August 6.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index and the New York Stock
Exchange composite index set new highs. The two broad-market
measures closed at record highs for the first time since October 7.
</P>
<P>
For the week, the Dow gained 326 points, or more than 4 percent,
giving it a 26 percent gain for 1997 with less than a month to go.
The S&AMP;P 500 and the NYSE composite are both up more than 30 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
In a report that normally would have pulled down the market, the
Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate sank to a
24-year low of 4.6 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The report did, in fact, affect the inflation-sensitive bond
market. As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
rose as high as 6.16 percent before settling at 6.09 percent. That
compares with late Thursday's 6.04 percent and late Wednesday's
6.01 percent, which was the lowest finish since January 1996,
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume slowed from the hectic
pace seen Wednesday and Thursday, but still totaled a brisk 556.93
million shares.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 10.69 to 983.79, beating its
previous best finish of 983.12. The NYSE composite rose 4.87 to
514.31, moving past the prior record of 514.21.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues
believed most vulnerable to the turmoil in Asia, rose 20.48 to
1,633.90, but still sits more than 100 points from record
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.15 to 438.06,
and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite
index rose 4.47 to 670.27.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Americans Want Legal Intoxication Level Lowered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A survey released Friday
finds nearly seven in 10 Americans favor lowering the legal blood
alcohol content level below the current limits in most states,
according to a holiday season survey released Friday by Mothers
Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 53 percent of respondents ranked drunken drivers
as the nation's No. 1 highway safety problem, followed by people
who drive too fast, the survey by Mothers Against Drunk Driving
(MADD) said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sponsored by the Allstate Insurance Co., is part of
a push for legislation introduced in Congress, that would require
states to lower their legal blood alcohol content levels to 0.08
percent or risk losing some of their federal highway aid. The
measure has not advanced out of House and Senate committees.
</P>
<P>
"We are... calling on our government here in the nation's
capital and in every state capital to take swift and decisive
action to combat this major public health and safety problem,"
Katherine Prescott, MADD national president, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia enforce 0.1
percent blood alcohol levels, while 15 states already have the
lower 0.08 percent limit. According to the survey, 69 percent of
respondents would like to see the level lowered to 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 31 percent of people admit they have driven
after drinking too much.
</P>
<P>
But Rick Berman, general counsel of the American Beverage
Institute, which represents thousands of restaurants, said
"Clearly, drunk driving, though it is a problem, is not one of the
biggest problems on the national roadways."
</P>
<P>
Berman said speeding and overly aggressive driving were more
serious.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 1,000 Americans was conducted by the
Market Facts research firm November 3-5. The margin of error
is approximately plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: No Date Set for New Force out of Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States and its
allies have not decided whether to fix a deadline for a new
peace-keeping force in Bosnia to get out of the region, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said today.
</P>
<P>
The subject was controversial in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and in the U.S. Congress, which must approve
funding for any U.S. participation in further peacekeeping in
Bosnia, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary made the remarks on way back from his
Europe tour, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
"There is great division on this subject matter still on the
Hill (Capitol Hill). There was a division among the European
members" of NATO, Cohen said of discussions at an alliance defense
ministers meeting in Brussels this week.
</P>
<P>
"There was no consensus at the meeting about whether there
should be a specific end date or end state," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There was, I think, a general feeling, however, that specific
time lines and dates were generally not advisable. We have said
that ourselves."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies will pull out all their 30,000 troops
of the so-called Stabilization Force (SFOR) based in Bosnia and
are considering a smaller follow-on force to continue the
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Paris
that any follow-on force to SFOR should be kept under review for
possible pull-out rather than be given a fixed date to get out.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tsunami Warning Center
in Alaska canceled a tsunami warning and watch for parts of Alaska
and British Columbia issued after a strong earthquake in
Kamchatka, Russia's Far East earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred at 7:27 a m. (1127 GMT) and was registered
7.7 on the Richter scale. The center said it was centered 130
kilometers off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula in
northeastern Russia that just into the Bering and Okhotsk seas.

Soon after the quake, the Alaska tsunami center issued the
warning for the coastal area of the U.S. state, from Attu to Dutch
Harbor, and a watch covering the northern tip of Vancouver Island,
British Columbia, to Dutch Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Kamchatka officials as saying that
there was no tsunami and no damages reported.

<HEADLINE> Official: China Has Positive Results in Bilaterals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Positive results have been
achieved in China's bilateral market access negotiations with
members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), a senior Chinese
trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China has conducted bilateral market access negotiations with
35 WTO members so far, and the bilateral negotiations with more
than 20 members have approached the final stage, said Long Yongtu,
China's vice minister of foreign trade and chief trade
representative.
</P>
<P>
China has signed bilateral agreements with the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, New Zealand, and Slovakia, Long
said at the one-day meeting of the Working Party on China's
accession here today. Two or three more countries will signed
bilateral agreements with China in the following weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government highly appreciates the positive and
practical spirit demonstrated by these countries in the bilateral
negotiations, and is grateful for their understanding and support
to China's WTO accession," Long said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that with political will and a practical and
flexible attitude, bilateral negotiations with even more members
will be concluded in the near future," he added.

<HEADLINE> Long Urges WTO Members to Accelerate China's Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's chief trade
representative Long Yongtu today urged members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to speed up negotiations over China's accession
to the organization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day meeting of the WTO Working Party on China
here today, Long reminded the members to bear in mind the ultimate
objective of China's 11-year-long negotiation as the year 1997
comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the objective of China's WTO accession, on the
one hand, is to commit China to the WTO rules," Long said. "On the
other hand, it is to gradually bring China's opening up of its
market in line with the level of the majority of the WTO members."
</P>
<P>
"The earlier China accedes to the WTO, the earlier China will
implement its commitment to the WTO rules," he pointed out. "To
prolong the negotiation process is, in fact, to delay China's
implementation of its obligation in the WTO."
</P>
<P>
Long hoped that China would join the WTO no later than the end
of 1999. "According to the built-in WTO agenda, the next round of
negotiations on trade in services will begin on January 1, 2000,"
he explained. "We hope that China could participate in this round
of negotiation as a full member of the WTO."

<HEADLINE> U.S., EU Leaders Discuss Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met with leaders of the European Union (EU) today on a broad range
of issues, including differences between the U.S. and EU on
environment protection and trade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met in the Oval Office with European Commission
President Jacques Santer, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude
Juncker, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, and EU
Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.
</P>
<P>
"Today's summit is giving us an opportunity to review progress
in the transatlantic relationship at the conclusion of
Luxembourg's presidency of the EU," State Department spokesman
James Foley.
</P>
<P>
"Our leaders have been renewing our commitment to the U.S-EU
new transatlantic agenda and continuing their discussions on a
wide range of critical issues," Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
As part of the one-day summit, which is held biannually, the EU
and the U.S. agreed to make it easier to exchange information in
science and technology research.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a first-ever U.S.-EU Science and
Technology Agreement and also agreed to a pathfinding joint
statement on electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Although officials of both sides stressed the spirit of
cooperation in the talks, there were still some serious
disagreements.
</P>
<P>
Following the end of the Cold War, splits between EU and the
U.S. have been increasing as their common enemy, the Soviet Union,
does no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have differences in areas ranging from trade to
security, such as Bosnia issues and EU grievances over U.S. laws
that threaten to penalize companies that invest in Cuba, Iran or
Libya.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also focus on their differences on limiting
greenhouse gas emissions that makes the planet warmer.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials stressed that the talks were not a negotiating
session to resolve an impasse between Europe and Washington over
limiting greenhouse gas emissions, but Clinton told reporters he
was guardedly optimistic a compromise could be reached at talks
under way in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"We want this to be the beginning of a process which eventually
will have everyone in the world involved in dealing with this
issue," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the chances that we can get an agreement are
reasonably good if everybody there really wants an agreement and
we want to see countries bound to targets which will lead us to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Clinton said. "That's the real
test."
</P>
<P>
More than 160 countries are meeting in Kyoto until Dec. 10 to
discuss ways to curb a series of gases that scientists say
threaten to cause global climate changes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposes reducing emissions to the levels that existed
in 1990 within the next 10 to 15 years while EU champions a 15
percent reduction below 1990 levels.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Chances Exist to Reach Agreement at Kyoto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today here that there were opportunities to reach a global
agreement in reducing greenhouse gases at a world climate meeting
in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the chances that we can get an agreement are
reasonably good if everybody there really wants an agreement,"
Clinton told reporters before meeting European Union leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We're working in Kyoto to try to get an agreement and we'll
see if we can. We hope we can," Clinton said. "We want to see
countries bound to targets which will lead us to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. That's the real test."
</P>
<P>
The EU has pledged a 15 percent reduction on 1990 emissions of
three greenhouse gases by 2010 while the U.S. wants to stabilize
emissions at 1990 levels by 2008-2012.
</P>
<P>
The United States said it was difficult to promise more than
that concerning economic costs. U.S. Vice President Al Gore said
earlier this week Washington was willing to walk away from any
pact that it does not believe is workable.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said it was not impossible to make compromises on
the issue "if everybody wants an agreement."
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that it's a global issue. We want to get
global involvement and we want this to be the beginning of a
process which eventually will have everybody in the world involved
in dealing with this issue."
</P>
<P>
At the conference, developing nations asked the United States
and other industrial nations to take tougher actions to lead the
world in the fight against greenhouse gases emission as they are
the major gases producers.
</P>
<P>
Scientists fear that greenhouse gases will cause climate change
in the form of more fierce, frequent storms, regional flooding,
droughts and melting of polar ice caps.

<HEADLINE> Asia Crisis Slows Down World Economic Growth: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Facing with the wide-spread
financial crisis in Asia, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
said today the chaos may soon be tamed but has already cut nearly
one percentage point off world economic growth next year.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing held at its headquarters here, IMF Deputy
Managing Director Stanley Fischer and other officials made the
latest prediction, a day after the IMF's 24-member executive board
gave its green light to a 21 billion U.S. dollar loan program for
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The IMF loans will be part of a international package for South
Korea that is expected to top 60 billion dollars, making it the
largest bailout in IMF history, surpassing the 50 billion dollar
program for Mexico in earlier 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Summer this year, Thailand received approval for a 17.2
billion dollar bailout package and again in October, Indonesia was
provided with a 40 billion dollar bailout package soon after they
were rocked by plunging currencies, stock market declines and
spreading bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
Fischer pointed out that it was essential for these Asian
nations to follow the stiff reform programs they agreed to in
return for the IMF bailout assistance so that they can stabilize
the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident these programs will succeed if fully
implemented," he said. "We are confident that doing so is the best
way to restore growth of the miracle economies of Asia."
</P>
<P>
However, Fischer also noted the fallout from the turmoil, which
resulted in the biggest one-day point loss in Wall Street history,
has already taken a toll on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF has revised its estimate for economic growth to
3.5 percent for 1998, down from its 4.3 percent forecast just last
September.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have predicted that growth in the United States
is likely to be reduced by one-half percentage point next year,
reflecting slower growth in U.S. exports to the troubled Asian
economies and higher imports from those countries because their
weaker currencies will make their products cheaper in the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that at one point South Korea was perhaps only 10
days away from "financial catastrophe" because of the dramatic
drain on the country's reserves.
</P>
<P>
But Fischer said in recent days there have been a number of
encouraging signs that the worst of the South Korean crisis has
passed. The currency and the stock market have both risen in
recent days and the huge drawdown on reserves has slowed.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Governor Indicates Intention to Run for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Al Gore,
already facing the prospect of competition for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000, will have another potential
Democrat rival -- Vermont Governor Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
Howard Dean, the head of the Democratic Governor's Association,
told Gore Wednesday that he was running for president, said
several Democratic sources in Washington and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
Senator Bob Kerry of Nebraska, head of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, and House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, are also making early plans to challenge Gore. President
Bill Clinton has said he wants Gore to succeed him in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Dean's press secretary, Stephanie Carter, confirmed that the
governor met with the vice president, but would not say what the
two men discussed, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Aides said Gore was not surprised by Dean's revelation. The
Vermont governor said last month he was thinking about running for
president, but would put off a decision until next year.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, though, he met with Gore at the vice president's
West Wing office and said his presidential bid is serious,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Dean, as chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, has
been traveling heavily this year seeking to recruit Democratic
gubernatorial candidates for next year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economic Growth Slows Down in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African Reserve
Bank has cut its economic growth predictions for 1997 as clearer
evidence has shown that the economy is not producing at full
capacity, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its December quarterly bulletin that the
economy should grow at between 1.5 and two percent in the 1997
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals had expected gross domestic
product (GDP) to grow by around 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economy expanded three percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Although a technical analysis could not provide conclusive
evidence of a downward phase of the business cycle, the economy
was definitely not producing at full capacity," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said output growth clearly did not match the economy's
growth potential in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a similar move by Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said on Tuesday at the launch of the government's
three-year budget plan that he forecast GDP growth at two percent
for the 1997/98 financial year, lower than an initial estimate of
2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The South African Chamber of Business today also cut its
prediction to 1.8 percent for 1997, against a previous downgrade
to two percent just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
It also cut its growth forecast for 1998 from three to 2.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Central Statistical Service figures showed that growth slumped
to only 0.3 percent in the third quarter of the year.

<HEADLINE> Conference on European Expansion Opens in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The two-day conference of
"European enlargement and southeastern Europe" opened here today
to discuss the expansion of the European Union (EU) and its
affects on southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The conference, with the participation of 34 representatives of
political parties, institutes from Balkan and European countries
is being organized by the Institute for Strategic and Development
Studies. It also focuses on the political and economic situation
in southeastern Europe, the institutional reconstruction of Balkan
states, minorities and a civil society, as well as multicultural
Balkan societies within national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, European Parliament Vice President
Paraskevas Avgerinos said today that he was sceptical about
whether the EU budget would be able to meet the requirements of
expansion. He also expressed fears as to the cost to southern
states.
</P>
<P>
As for the proposed European conference for states wishing to
join the EU, Avgerinos insisted that the majority of members of
the European Parliament were against holding such a conference,
preferring that only "democratic states" be invited.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says New Ideas Needed for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
said on Friday the Middle East peace process should be pushed
forward with "some new ideas".
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters at the White House, Clinton said
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had brought these ideas to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat when she met Netanyahu in Paris on Friday and
Arafat in Geneva on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have some new ideas at least about the process, about
where to go from here, at least different approaches and we hope
that it will move the ball forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the president did not elaborate what new Ideas they were.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Netanyahu and Arafat, Clinton said: "I think
they both understand that this is a time when something needs to
be done to show concrete progress. I'm encouraged ... we'll just
have to see what happens."
</P>
<P>
Albright held about three-hour talks with Netanyahu in Paris
earlier on Friday and reports said there was no breakthrough in
reviving the stalemated peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, which suspended in March as a result of Israel's
decision to build Jewish housing units in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the Paris talks, Albright said
time was pressing for both Israelis and Palestinians to take
hard decisions to break the nine-month deadlock in their
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have to put their shoulders to the wheel and
understand that time is of the essence," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright was pressing the Israeli leader to set a timetable
for the redeployment of the Israeli troops on the West Bank, but
Netanyahu rebuffed her pressure, saying: "We've had our problems."
