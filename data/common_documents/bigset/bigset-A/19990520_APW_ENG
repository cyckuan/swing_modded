<HEADLINE> Dutch Queen Meets With Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A day after the Dutch government  
collapsed over a constitutional dispute, Queen Beatrix met with 
political leaders at her palace Thursday to survey the wreckage of 
the former ruling coalition and decide the country's future. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen appointed a special adviser to look into the  
possibility of rebuilding the three-party coalition led by Prime 
Minister Wim Kok that resigned after splitting over whether to give 
citizens the right to vote in referendums. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers had rejected a push by the junior coalition partner,  
the centrist Democrats 66, to let citizens vote. Because its bill 
was not passed by Parliament, the party decided to step out of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	After hours of closed-door meetings, the two larger coalition  
partners -- the right-leaning Liberal Party and Kok's left-of-center 
Labor Party -- decided that resigning and beginning anew was the 
only solution. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of the Cabinet leaves the country with a weakened  
leadership thrust into a caretaker role. It comes at an awkward 
time, with Dutch troops participating in NATO's air campaign 
against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But acting Foreign Affairs Minister Jozias van Aartsen said the  
crisis won't influence the Dutch position or contribution to NATO 
actions. ``It has absolutely no impact on our Kosovo policy,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the current Cabinet will stay on temporarily, the  
acting government does not have the power to pass new legislation, 
only to settle pending issues and deal with matters of national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	If the coalition cannot be rebuilt, the queen's other options  
are to let Labor and the Liberals form a two-party government or to 
call parliamentary elections, which are usually held every four 
years and were held just a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Elections appeared to be the most probable scenario because the  
Liberal Party and the Labor Party have indicated they prefer not to 
govern together without the Democrats 66 on hand to smooth out 
their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading opposition party, the Christian Democratic Alliance,  
also has been named as a potential member of a new coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The government collapse was prompted by a lone Liberal Party  
lawmaker in Parliament's upper chamber who voted against the 
referendum bill. It fell one vote short of gaining the two-thirds 
majority needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Referendum voting rights, a longtime goal of the Democrats 66,  
would have permitted the public to vote on social and economic 
decisions already approved by Parliament, with the exception of 
issues involving taxation or the military. Opponents said they 
feared it would give citizens too much power over government 
policy.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Around lunchtime every Friday, Mohammad Abdallah  
left his sales job in suburban Lincolnshire for the 20-minute drive 
to his mosque. There, he removed his shoes, faced east toward Mecca 
and followed his spiritual leader, his imam, in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Muslims, Friday is the holy day,'' the 30-year-old  
Abdallah explains. 
</P>
<P>
	The service took him away from work for about an hour and 15  
minutes, including the 30 minutes he counted as lunch. ``I would 
make up the time I missed by coming in early or working late,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly observance, however, eventually cost the  
Jordanian-American his job. He took his case to the U.S. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission and won a $49,000 settlement in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of worshippers are pursuing workplace  
complaints: among them, Muslim women who refuse to remove 
head-scarves at work; evangelical Christians who bring religious 
objects to the office; and Jews who oppose working on the Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Kamp, an attorney in the EEOC's Chicago office, says it's  
unclear to what extent an employer has to accommodate an employee's 
religious beliefs, and so the agency is giving priority to such 
cases in hopes the courts will provide answers. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1998, the EEOC considered 1,786 allegations of  
religious discrimination, compared with 1,584 two years earlier. In 
1998, 325 had outcomes favorable to the complainants, compared with 
165 in fiscal 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers are much smaller for some other types of cases  
before the EEOC. In fiscal 1998, for example, there were 24,454 
complaints of sex discrimination, and $58.7 million in payments to 
complainants. That compares with $2.6 million for religious 
discrimination cases. 
</P>
<P>
	What does the law provide where workplace needs and religious  
practices collide? 
</P>
<P>
	Abba Cohen, Washington counsel for Agudath Israel of America, a  
national Orthodox Jewish organization, says employers are legally 
required to accommodate a religiously observant person unless doing 
so would cause what the law calls an ``undue hardship.'' And the 
courts have found it has to be only ``a little bit more than a 
minimal amount of hardship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago attorney Michael Karpeles, who has represented  
businesses in religion discrimination cases, said employers must 
try to balance workers' religious interests with their companies' 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If all the employer has to do is to make modest or minimal  
adjustments, they probably are wise to make those adjustments and 
work things out with the employee,'' Karpeles said. ``If they get 
to the point they are having so many requests and it's hard to 
accommodate all of them, they can feel comfortable drawing the line 
and saying, 'We've done all we can reasonably do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cases involving religious beliefs, however, aren't always  
clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdallah's former employer, W.W. Grainger Inc., said it allowed  
his midday absences during his 15 months there until a co-worker 
died, leaving the staff stretched. 
</P>
<P>
	Grainger labor counsel Hank Galatz said Abdallah refused to  
temporarily suspend the absences. Abdallah, however, says 
short-staffing wasn't the real issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had it been temporary, I would have been more than happy to  
accommodate them,'' Abdallah said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, seven Muslim women who said they were fired for  
refusing to remove their head-scarves while working security jobs 
at Dulles International Airport near Washington learned last month 
that they could return to work. The agreement was part of a 
settlement reached with Atlanta-based Argenbright Security Inc. to 
avoid an EEOC complaint. The company contended the women were never 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims who strictly interpret their religion consider it  
obligatory for women to cover their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the EEOC accused the University of Chicago  
Hospitals of discriminating against an evangelical Christian 
employee. Victoria Levya, who recruited entry-level employees such 
as janitors, contends her supervisor told her not to hire people 
from her church and prohibited her from keeping religious objects, 
such as a church clock and inspirational calendar, on her desk. Her 
case is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesman John Easton denies Levya's claim of religious  
discrimination and said she was told not to recruit only people of 
a particular religion. ``There was concern that the prominent 
display of religious items in the employment office could be 
perceived as discrimination against candidates with other 
religions,'' Easton added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Karpeles believes it's better for employees and employers  
``to try to work these issues out'' rather than resort to lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Theologian Martin Marty, whose studies include religion in  
public life, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hunch is that many of these things used to get settled in  
the backyard,'' he says, ``or a walk down to the coffee shop ... 
and now immediately end up in court. If both sides would lower 
their voices ... we'd be better off.''

<HEADLINE> Thai Exchange Will Delist Alphatec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Troubled Thai computer chip maker  
Alphatec Electronics will be delisted from the Stock Exchange of 
Thailand, a statement from exchange officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankrupt firm will be delisted on Friday. Under its  
rehabilitation plan, the company must write off almost all its 
existing capital, which would bar its stock from being traded by 
the rules of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Alphatec was once considered the cornerstone company in  
Thailand's nascent attempts to forge a high-technology 
manufacturing sector. But a scandal erupted in 1997 when its 
chairman was accused of embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite reporting stellar earnings, Alphatec was, in fact, in  
deep financial trouble. It became a symbol of the shady accounting 
practices and poor transparency that can make companies in emerging 
markets such as Thailand risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rehabilitation plan approved by Alphatec's creditors  
in February, U.S. insurance giant American International Group and 
Sweden's Investor AB are to invest $40 million to take 80 percent 
of a new company, Alphatec Holding. Creditors of the old company 
are to hold the remaining 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Alphatec Holding owns 100 percent of Alphatec Semiconductor  
Packaging Co., a newly incorporated company that took over the 
computer-chip assembler's assets, personnel and operations in 
Thailand on April 22.

<HEADLINE> Autopsy Reveals Wynette Death Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An autopsy performed on the exhumed body  
of Tammy Wynette showed the country singer died of heart failure 
caused by damage from repeated blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
	The role drugs may have played in Wynette's 1998 death is  
impossible to determine because the autopsy took place a year after 
she died, Nashville Medical Examiner Bruce Levy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traces of Versed, a sedative, and Phenergan, which is used for  
nausea and as a sedative, were found in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhumation and autopsy were prompted by a $50 million  
wrongful death lawsuit filed by Wynette's four daughters. They 
allege their mother could have lived longer but her health wasn't 
monitored closely enough, and that she was given too many 
painkillers prior to her death. 
</P>
<P>
	But Levy said that if called to testify, he would say Wynette  
died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My belief is that the heart failure happened probably through  
a combination of natural disease and maybe or maybe not contributed 
to by the drugs,'' Levy said. ``There's no way to be able to 
determine that for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit originally named Wynette's fifth husband George  
Richey and her doctor, Wallis Marsh, of Pittsburgh, as defendants. 
Richey was later dropped from the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh, who practices at the University of Pittsburgh Medical  
Center, has denied any wrongdoing. Calls to Marsh's office were 
referred to an attorney who was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Richey said the widower was ``elated.''  
</P>
<P>
	``In his opinion, it shows she died of natural causes as he's  
said all along,'' spokesman Fred N. Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Yarbrough, attorney for Wynette's daughters, said Levy's  
findings support the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that a blood clot was not the operative cause of  
death,'' he said. ``And it now appears Dr. Levy is saying there is 
some sort of heart problem that should have been addressed by Dr. 
Marsh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, who died at age 55 and had 20 No. 1 hits, including  
``Stand By Your Man,'' endured many health problems for much of her 
life and took various drugs to quell her pain.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 25.66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly today amid fresh evidence  
that the U.S. economy is growing at a steady but not inflationary 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
25.66 at 10,913.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also posted slim gains. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 2.42 at 1,346.65, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 0.38 at 2,577.78. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good looking day,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst  
at Prudential Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders took their cues from a Philadelphia Federal Reserve  
survey that indicated inflation remains in check. Stock and bond 
markets have been highly sensitive to signs of inflation since last 
Friday, when the government reported an unusually steep jump in the 
consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve hinted that more signs of  
inflation could prompt an increase in interest rates some time this 
year. Since then, the market has struggled to break out of a narrow 
range as investors weigh the impact of higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense of relief from the Philly meeting,'' Wachtel  
said. ``Things are calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan maintained that sense of calm as he  
kept his remarks to the House Banking Committee focused on the 
global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The market took two government reports today in stride. The  
Commerce Department said the nation's deficit rose to a record high 
in March, led by a widening gap with Japan. Meanwhile, the Labor 
Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for 
unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 last week to 299,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mergers provided some extra activity in the market today.  
Healtheon soared for a second straight session as it announced it 
will merge with WebMD Inc. to create an Internet-based health care 
services company. It was up 41 to 121 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck was among the Dow's biggest gainers, rising 1 5/16 to 71  
13/16 as analysts anticipated it will soon receive approval for a 
new painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 339.6 million shares, 
slightly behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.90 at 641.44, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 4.24 at 792.60.

<HEADLINE> Easing Unilateral Sanctions Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A debate over Cuba forced a House committee to  
abandon an attempt to lift sanctions on food and medicine exports 
to terrorist states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nonsense not to lift these sanctions,'' said Rep. George  
Nethercutt, R-Wash., contending that the prohibitions injure U.S. 
farmers already struggling with low prices and lagging exports this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nethercutt's effort to repeal the sanctions failed on a  
28-24 vote Wednesday among members of the House Appropriations 
Committee. Many lawmakers were concerned the measure would aid the 
Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that the agriculture community in the United  
States is going through difficult economic times,'' said Rep. 
Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who was born in Cuba. ``But I do not 
think taxpayer-financed trade with terrorist states is an 
appropriate way to try to help U.S. farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration last month opened the way for the  
sale of food and medical items to Iran, Libya and Sudan. The sales 
of certain items are already permitted to Iraq, North Korea and 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1992 law allows sales of medicine and medical supplies to Cuba  
with certain limitations. And in January, the Clinton 
administration also began allowing some regulated trade with Cuba 
in some food items and pesticides.

<HEADLINE> Internet Provider Sues Over Spam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A lawsuit alleges a mortgage company flooded an  
Internet service provider with misleading junk e-mail in violation 
of a state law against so-called ``spam'' messages. 
</P>
<P>
	The $6 million lawsuit, filed in Skagit County Superior Court in  
Mount Vernon, is against CTX Mortgage, a subsidiary of Dallas-based 
Centex Corp., a company on Fortune magazine's list of the country's 
500 largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The first few lawsuits filed under the state's anti-spam law  
were filed against much smaller, sometimes elusive, operators. 
</P>
<P>
	The law makes it illegal to send unsolicited commercial e-mail  
with misleading subject lines, phony return addresses and false 
headers hiding the messages' origin. 
</P>
<P>
	A $1,000 penalty can be assessed for each illegal e-mail sent  
through an Internet service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady Johnson, Seattle attorney for Connect Northwest, the Mount  
Vernon-based company that filed the lawsuit, said CTX overwhelmed 
Connect Northwest's network by sending 5,800 unsolicited e-mail 
messages April 8 and 9 advertising home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject line for the messages contained the phrase ``a gift  
for you,'' and the e-mail's return address was phony, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The flood of messages disrupted Connect Northwest's mail servers  
and shut down service to customers for a short time. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, CTX said it was investigating the  
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have learned is that the e-mails in question represent  
an isolated incident involving an outside vendor,'' the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``CTX takes the anti-spamming laws seriously and immediately  
stopped the activity pending investigation of this matter,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson brought the state's first lawsuit under the law on  
behalf of four individuals last year. The alleged spammer, a Los 
Angeles man, dropped out of sight, and couldn't be served with the 
suit. But Johnson said Wednesday that a private detective found the 
man and he will soon be served. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Paula Selis, who has brought two  
lawsuits under the law and is close to bringing a third, said the 
law ``is doing what it's meant to do if it can be effectively used 
by private individuals or, in this case, by an Internet service 
provider to protect its own private network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the local lawsuits has yet gone to trial. Johnson said  
he hopes the CTX case, because it involves a large company that 
will defend itself, will help resolve some of the questions about 
the law.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Accused of Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Five black vacationers who went to Daytona  
Beach for its Black College Reunion sued their hotel, claiming they 
were singled out as security risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday, alleges the Adam's Mark Hotel made  
black guests wear orange wristbands and used security guards to 
intimidate them during the annual spring break weekend last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also alleges the hotel gave black guests rooms without  
phone service and basic housekeeping. Pictures were stripped from 
hotel room walls, and minibars were kept locked, according to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is yet another wake-up call to white America and white  
folks who don't think discrimination happens,'' said John Relman, 
an attorney for the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights 
and Urban Affairs, one of the groups representing the hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel officials declined to comment on the lawsuit but said they  
had always supported Black College Reunion and maintain a racially 
diverse workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adam's Mark Hotels have a corporate-wide commitment to  
diversity not simply because we believe it's the right thing to do, 
but because it makes good business sense,'' the hotel said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Relman's committee and the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People are seeking class-action status for 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs -- mostly professionals in their 20s-- also claimed  
they were overcharged for rooms, refused valet parking, and were 
limited in the number of people they could have visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been arrested, never been in jail, but wearing the

<HEADLINE> Charity Rescued by Gates Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Valley's main United Way  
chapter, nearly destitute for lack of donations, suddenly has all 
the money it needs, thanks to the very deep pockets of Bill Gates 
and other high-tech leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made it,'' United Way of Santa Clara's chairman, Michael  
Fox, said after the charity's coffers swelled by $7 million 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft tycoon and his wife, Melinda, donated $5 million,  
and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation contributed $2 million. 
Other high-tech leaders and foundations earlier gave $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes my heart sing that the `haves' are stepping up to the  
plate,'' said Mary Ellen Chell, executive director of Cupertino 
Community Services, which provides clothing, food and shelter to 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	United Way had told its 104 member agencies last fall not to  
expect about $11 million in funding starting July 1. Mismanagement, 
and a lack of donations from technology workers with soaring stock 
portfolios, were blamed.

<HEADLINE> Software Maker To Take on Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A tiny software maker that once did  
business with Microsoft is taking on the maker of Windows next 
month in a trial some say could break new ground in antitrust 
challenges against Bill Gates and company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Technology Inc., a Danbury company with just 70  
employees, is scheduled to go to trial June 2 in a lawsuit that 
claims Microsoft is improperly withholding software code that 
Bristol says is vital for its survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is not directly related to the larger lawsuit filed  
against Microsoft by the U.S. Department of Justice and 19 states. 
However, it has a similar theme. 
</P>
<P>
	The government suit contends that Microsoft illegally wielded  
the power of its dominant Windows computer operating system to 
expand into new markets, such as Internet software, and thus crush 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol contends Microsoft is abusing the market power of its  
Windows NT business software, which runs powerful corporate 
machines that direct networks of smaller personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about here is the brain and the central  
nervous system of corporations,'' said Ed Black, president of the 
Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association, a trade group. ``So 
one of the concerns beyond pure economics is that all of those 
central nervous systems of many companies wind up potentially 
dependent upon, reliant on and subservient to the wishes of a 
powerful monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another small software maker, Orem, Utah-based Caldera, also has  
a suit pending against Microsoft alleging abusive business 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry  
Association, said the outcome of both cases, while uncertain, could 
have implications for the larger antitrust lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the Bristol and Caldera cases explore novel issues  
related to the responsibility of the dominant operating system 
vendor in working with independent software vendors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs  
such as word processors and spreadsheets written to work with 
Windows to be converted to run on computers with different 
operating systems such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	Unix is sold by a number of companies including Sun  
Microsystems, an arch-foe of Microsoft. It is a major competitor to 
Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to make Wind/U, Bristol needs access to the source code  
-- the programming blueprints -- for Windows NT. Bristol had a 3-year 
licensing agreement for Windows NT source code with Microsoft, but 
that expired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, Bristol claims Microsoft is illegally preventing  
it from obtaining the Windows source code, in effect severing 
Bristol's customers from the latest Windows technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denies the allegations and says Bristol's lawsuit is  
merely an attempt to negotiate a more favorable licensing 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Tom Pilla said his company was able to  
negotiate a licensing agreement with Mainsoft, one of Bristol's 
competitors, under the same terms it offered Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bristol turned down those terms, then hired an economic  
expert, a public relations firm and a legal team to sue Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Bristol's attempt to use the court system to obtain  
something that isn't theirs in order to obtain an unfair advantage 
over Mainsoft,'' said Pilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Chief Executive Keith Blackwell dismissed Microsoft's  
claim that his lawsuit is a strong-arm negotiating tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really just ridiculous,'' he said. ``That would be a very  
time-consuming and expensive negotiating ploy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will square off in court just as the Microsoft  
antitrust trial in Washington, D.C., is expected to resume after a 
three-month recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera's antitrust suit against Microsoft claims the company's  
pricing practices and marketing techniques effectively destroyed 
the market for a desktop computer operating system its sells called 
DR-DOS, while building a monopoly for Microsoft's MS-DOS, the 
precursor to Windows. That case is scheduled to go to trial in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft dismissed any comparisons between the Bristol and  
Caldera cases and the Department of Justice case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that these cases are linked in any way,'' Pilla  
said.

	People Shot at Ga. High School  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Several people were shot today at a high  
school as students were gathering for the day, but none of the 
injuries is believed to be life-threatening, said a spokeswoman for 
Rockdale County schools. The shootings happened about 8 a.m. at 
Heritage High School, near Conyers, a town east of Atlanta. 
``Somebody arrived with a gun and some people have been hit, maybe 
four or five,'' spokeswoman Bonnie Knight said. She did not know if 
the injured were students or teachers. The person who fired the 
shots was taken into custody almost immediately. The shooting comes 
exactly a month after the April 20 slaughter at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo.

High School retraces sadly familiar terrain for the president, who 
traveled one year ago to Oregon and another high school ravaged by 
gunfire. In the Oregon incident, two students were killed and 22 
injured during a rampage by a 15-year-old suspect also accused of 
killing his parents the day before and leaving their home rigged 
with bombs. The president and his wife, Hillary, will meet with 
victims' relatives at Littleton's World Roman Catholic Church,

Albania, and he called for the United Nations to play a key role in 
resolving the Kosovo conflict. Annan walked around two camps in 
Kukes, a town that is the temporary home to about 100,000 of the 
800,000 ethnic Albanians who have fled Kosovo. In Yugoslavia, NATO 
jets pounded Belgrade and its suburbs early today, directly hitting 
a hospital and killing at least three people. NATO is seeking a

return of the refugees, and a well-armed international force to

<HEADLINE> Barclays To Cut 6,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Barclays Bank PLC plans to slash 6,000 jobs,  
almost 10 percent of its work force, in a cost-cutting move aimed 
at countering sagging profits and widespread doubts about the 
future of Britain's third-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Barclays said Thursday it hopes the job cuts will help it save  
more than $320 million a year. The cuts will come mostly in the 
form of voluntary resignations and retirements by workers in its 
retail branches and corporate lending areas, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors bid the bank's share price up 3.9 percent in midday  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Barclays plans to computerize and centralize  
more of its operations in a restructuring program set to cost 
almost $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The object of this is to produce a simpler, less complex  
structure that makes it easier to bank with us and to reduce our 
costs at the same time,'' chairmen Sir Peter Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barclays has been struggling to shore up profits after its 1998  
earnings dropped 20 percent due to losses in developing countries 
by its investment banking unit, Barclays Capital. It also has been 
without a chief executive since last November. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's problems have raised concerns among analysts that it  
lacks firm direction and have fed speculation that Barclays is ripe 
for a merger or takeover. Among those rumored to be interested in 
such a union are The Royal Bank of Scotland and the Abbey National 
and Halifax building societies. 
</P>
<P>
	Barclays currently employs more than 60,000 people. The job cuts  
come as the bank is seeking to offer customers more options for 
handling their finances, such as cash machines and banking by 
telephone or the Internet, Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conservative Party's shadow trade secretary lamented the  
move as ``another body blow'' for British business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Government is over-taxing and over-regulating,'' John  
Redwood said. ``Today, Barclays' staff are paying the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barclays Chief Executive Martin Taylor resigned last November in  
what was widely believed to have been a dispute over the future of 
Barclays Capital.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia Asks End of Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- As Europe's biggest takeover battle nears a  
climax, Telecom Italia on Thursday accused hostile suitor Olivetti 
of rigging its tender offer and urged regulators to suspend the 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations came as Olivetti appeared poised to meet its  
goal for pressing ahead with its upstart bid for the former 
state-owned phone monopoly that is five times it size. Olivetti's 
$65 billion offer expires Friday, and analysts said most 
shareholders would wait until then to decide whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has said it needs at least 35 percent of Telecom's  
ordinary shares to proceed with the takeover. At midweek it had 
just over 9 percent of Telecom shares. It hopes to win 67 percent, 
enough to give it a controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's bold offer, which has convulsed the clubby world of  
Europe's former government-run phone companies, appears to be 
gaining support even as Telecom Italia's proposed defensive merger 
with Deutsche Telekom seems increasingly remote. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom and its German counterpart announced their plans for a  
friendly merger in April, but the deal has encountered resistance 
from the Italian government and skepticism from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom accused Olivetti of leaking false information about the  
number of shares already tendered by Telecom shareholders and 
threatened legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's move underscored the importance of public perception  
in determining the outcome of the struggle. As more people are seen 
to be tendering their shares to Olivetti, the offer gains popular 
acceptance and other shareholders may decide to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Italian news agency Radiocor quoted an adviser  
to Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno as saying Olivetti 
had already won more than 35 percent of Telecom's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's market regulator, Consob, warned Olivetti afterward to  
``abstain from spreading information about the bid which is not 
backed up by hard data, isn't verifiable, and is only based on the 
calculations of analysts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's chief Franco Bernabe accused Olivetti officials of  
acting ``without any respect for authority or rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti denied releasing any such information. Calls seeking  
further comment were not immediately returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some industry analysts said Thursday that they expected  
Olivetti to achieve its minimum targeted number of shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the consensus is that they're likely to get 35  
percent. Whether they'll get as much as 50 percent is difficult to 
tell,'' said Denis Gross of Williams De Broe, a London brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross noted rumors that Olivetti had already amassed more than  
42 percent of Telecom shares. However, the outcome was still 
unclear because many large shareholders were ``fence-sitting'' 
until Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe made a last attempt to reassure investors on Wednesday,  
emphasizing his plan to spread Telecom's wealth by buying back 10 
percent of the company's shares at a premium to the price offered 
by Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they  
were not persuaded by Bernabe's pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe also tried to play down the effectiveness of Olivetti's  
offer, saying that Italian fund managers told him they were 
relinquishing no more than half of their Telecom shares to 
Olivetti, the Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
this meant that Italian fund managers were giving up no more than 7 
percent of the total number of company shares. 
</P>
<P>
	If Olivetti garners more than 35 percent but fewer than 50  
percent of Telecom's shares, the outlook becomes cloudier still. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom officials say that under company bylaws, unless Olivetti  
gets at least half of Telecom's shares, it won't be able to control 
more than 3 percent of the voting stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti disputes this interpretation of Italian law, making a  
court battle a near certainty under this outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom ended trading Thursday in Milan down 2 percent at the  
equivalent of $10.32 a share, while Olivetti shares lost 2 percent 
to close at $3.51.

<HEADLINE> Shot Daughter, Mother Make Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A paralyzed woman who won the right to be  
allowed to die made peace with her mother, who is accused of 
shooting her, a few hours before she was removed from life support, 
the mother's attorney says. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgette Smith spoke to her mother during a videotaped  
deposition from her hospital bed Tuesday, one day before Ms. Smith 
was removed from a ventilator at her own request. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very emotional. They were at peace with one another,''  
the mother's attorney, Bob Wesley, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Egan, 68, is charged with attempted murder in her  
daughter's shooting, and the charge could be changed to 
manslaughter or murder now that her daughter is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesley said he didn't believe a grand jury would indict Egan for  
murder once they saw the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan, who has emphysema and is blind in one eye, is accused  
of shooting her 42-year-old daughter in March after overhearing her 
discuss putting her in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet hit Ms. Smith's spinal cord, paralyzing her and  
leaving her unable to speak without effort and incapable of 
swallowing or controlling her bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	In asking a court for permission to be taken off life support,  
she said she could only wink and wiggle her nose and tongue, and 
added, ``I can't live like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith died Wednesday after a court granted her wish. Ms.  
Egan supported her daughter's decision, but Wesley fought it to 
avoid the charge being upgraded to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesley said Ms. Egan didn't mean to shoot her daughter and  
didn't want to see her suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith was sedated before the ventilator was removed  
Wednesday night. Ms. Egan was told of her daughter's death by a 
chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a traumatic night for her,'' Wesley said.

<HEADLINE>  Gen. Shelton Renamed to Top Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton nominated Army Gen. Henry H.  
Shelton to serve a second two-year term as chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top military position. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Rose Garden announcement Thursday with Shelton in uniform  
at his side, Clinton praised the four-star general as ``critical to 
our efforts in Kosovo and indeed to our entire national security 
program.'' As chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Shelton is the senior 
military adviser to the president and the secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation is fortunate that this critical post will continue  
to be filled by someone of his experience, ability and character,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must confirm Shelton for a second term, but there is  
no known opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he and other members of his national security team,  
meeting in the Oval Office, had jokingly voted on whether Shelton 
should be kept in the job. All voted for it except ``he voted 
against it. But we overruled him and he's going to serve another 
term,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton, 57, became the 14th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff on Oct. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-5-inch North Carolina native, Shelton is a decorated  
Vietnam combat veteran and former commander of the U.S. Special 
Operations Command, which oversees the Army's Green Berets, the 
Navy's Seals and other elite outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Shelton has a leading  
voice in the U.S. role in NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, 
although he has no direct command of troops. He and the rest of the 
Joint Chiefs met in the Pentagon on Thursday with Gen. Wesley 
Clark, the top NATO commander and architect of the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton, in a statement issued at the Pentagon, said: ``It has  
been a particular privilege to represent our nation's soldiers, 
sailors, airmen and Marines during a period of great international 
uncertainty and an unprecedented pace of military operations.''

<HEADLINE> Coppola Defends Lucas Prequel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The critics are out in force against George  
Lucas and the ``Star Wars'' sequel. At least his old friend Francis 
Ford Coppola is standing by him. 
</P>
<P>
	``George worked very hard on it. I know he's gotten some bad  
reviews, but he didn't slough it off or anything,'' Coppola said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonetheless, it's going to be an extraordinary success. It's  
all-out `Star Wars.' I don't think people really will be 
disappointed,'' said the Academy Award-winning filmmaker whose 
works include ``The Godfather'' trilogy and ``Apocalypse Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men go way back: In 1969, Coppola established American  
Zoetrope, an independent production company in San Francisco, with 
Lucas as his vice president. Coppola produced the Lucas-directed 
``THX-1138'' and ``American Graffiti.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened Wednesday  
to less-than-stellar reviews but enthusiastic fan response. Coppola 
told The Associated Press he understands the mania. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes sense. People who are in their 30s were 8 years old  
when they saw `Star Wars,''' he said. ``It was something they had 
never seen before. Now ... they can see it again.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Hits 2 Slams in Doubleheader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Robin Ventura became the first major leaguer to  
hit grand slams in both games of a doubleheader, doing it for the 
New York Mets on Thursday night against the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura hit his first slam against Jim Abbott in the first  
inning of the opener. He hit a 3-2 pitch high down the right-field 
line, just over the outstretched glove of Jeromy Burnitz, in an 
11-10 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura came up with the bases loaded in the fourth inning of  
the nightcap. He again worked the count full before hitting another 
high fly down the right-field line off Horacio Estrada that Burnitz 
couldn't jump for. 
</P>
<P>
	The two slams gave Ventura a total of 12 in his career, one  
behind Harold Baines for the active lead. Mark McGwire and Ken 
Griffey Jr. also have 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also became the first player ever to twice hit two slams  
in a day. He had two slams in a game for the Chicago White Sox at 
Texas on Sept. 4, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third time this season a player has hit two slams in  
one day. Ventura joined St. Louis' Fernando Tatis, who did it in 
one inning against Los Angeles on April 23, and Boston's Nomar 
Garciaparra, who did it May 10 against Seattle.

<HEADLINE> GOP Bill Kills Gore Space Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's vision of putting an  
Earth-viewing satellite in orbit has been brought down to Earth by 
House Republicans who say the idea is wasteful and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Wednesday approved a three-year $42 billion NASA  
authorization bill that, over the protests of Democrats, 
effectively kills a Gore-inspired plan to launch a satellite that 
would put 24-hour views of the Earth on television and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The $32 million originally set aside for the Triana project is  
less than 1 percent of the proposed National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration budget, but Democrats and the White House suggested 
the legislation might be subject to a presidential veto if the 
money is not restored when the Senate takes up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said it was part of the GOP campaign to trip up Gore's  
run for the presidency next year. ``I can think of no reason for 
the elimination of this particular program except partisan 
politics,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Triana spacecraft, named for the sailor who first spotted  
the New World on the journey with Christopher Columbus, was to have 
been launched by NASA in December next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House Science Committee, on a party-line 21-18 vote last  
Thursday, transferred all the money for the program to life and 
microgravity research. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Weldon, R-Fla., chief sponsor of the amendment,  
argued that views of the Earth are already available on the Weather 
Channel and NASA-TV and he considered it an ``insult'' that some 
600 people were being laid off at the Kennedy Space Center at the 
same time the agency was ``finding tens of millions of dollars to 
fulfill a vision for the vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because the new Star Wars movie is opening today doesn't  
mean we have to spend $30 million on a far-out boondoggle,'' said 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But NASA and the White House argued that the satellite would  
transmit an image twice as clear as new high-resolution television 
sets and would be unique in presenting a full-Earth view. 
</P>
<P>
	Triana was subject to rigorous peer review, the White House  
said, and would provide the scientific community with valuable data 
on the Earth's climate and solar flares. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking Democrat on the Science panel, Rep. Bart Gordon of  
Tennessee, said NASA had already spent $40 million on the $75 
million project, and the government would lose more by killing it 
than by completing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats did not propose an amendment to revive the program,  
saying they would press the Senate to do so when it takes up the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope they will change their mind,'' said Dave Steitz,  
spokesman for NASA. ``We would like them to base their decision on 
the science of the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also provides $7 billion for the U.S. portion of the  
international space station, $7.8 billion for space shuttle 
operations and $4.2 billion for earth science programs. 
</P>
<P>
	As in past years, Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., led a move against  
the space station, but with that program moving into the 
construction phase he got little support for amendments that would 
have capped funding, killed the program altogether or removed 
Russia as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The House defeated, 313-117, Roemer's amendment that would have  
ended Russian participation, relegating the Russians to 
subcontractors in future work on the 16-nation project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians repeatedly have been behind schedule in completing  
their work, driving up U.S. costs by as much as $5 billion. Rep. 
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the Science Committee, 
said the Russians were ``a miserable failure in being a partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others warned the amendment could undermine fragile  
U.S.-Russian relations and kill a project that is finally making 
headway. The first component of the station, the U.S.-funded, 
Russian-built Zarya module, was launched last November. NASA 
followed in December with its Unity module. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the House by voice vote accepted an amendment by Rep. John  
Sweeney, R-N.Y., requiring NASA to certify within 15 days that any 
proposed future agreements with China would not improve the missile 
or space launch capabilities of China.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Face Tough Task Against Spurs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- After letting an opportunity at the  
Alamodome slip away, the Los Angeles Lakers were back home Thursday 
facing a harsh reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 2-0 to the San Antonio Spurs, they now must win four of  
five games from a team that has gone 35-6 since the beginning of 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just the beginning.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs are 4-1 in the playoffs after winning 12 of their  
final 13 regular-season games; they've won their last five road 
games and seven of their last eight, and they haven't lost two in a 
row since setbacks to Seattle and Utah at the end of February left 
them 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've proven themselves time and again this season,''  
Lakers' forward Rick Fox acknowledged. ``To say we share the same 
urgency would be reaching a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've made a commitment, you can sense a commitment from  
this side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Games 3 and 4 in the best-of-7 series are Saturday and Sunday at  
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in tennis, they held serve,'' Fox said. ``We come home now  
to our home fans, home cooking. We can do what we do best, play 
Laker basketball, go back to San Antonio tied 2-2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared in the final minute of Game 2 on Wednesday night  
that the Lakers might come home tied 1-1, but it wasn't to be. 
</P>
<P>
	First, with the Lakers leading 76-75 thanks to a 3-point shot by  
Kobe Bryant with 36.9 seconds remaining, Bryant missed two free 
throws with 18.9 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bryant stepped to the line, he had scored 28 points in Game  
2 and made 23 of his 25 foul shots (92 percent) in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, San Antonio's Tim Duncan, being guarded by J.R. Reid, made  
a short jump-hook from the right baseline with 8.4 seconds left to 
put the Spurs ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were supposed to come down and double-team him right  
away,'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said of Duncan. ``That was one 
thing we didn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also should have fouled Duncan, since the Lakers had one to  
give. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I didn't do a real good job in telling them,'' Rambis  
said. ``I did say we have a foul to give.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis said he assumed his players would use that foul before  
Duncan could shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was obviously incorrect in my assumption,'' he said. ``Once  
(Duncan) started getting in that low deep position, that was the 
time to foul him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers called their final timeout, after which Derek Fisher  
was unable to handle Bryant's inbounds pass. It ricocheted off 
Fisher's head, and San Antonio's Mario Elie came up with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie was immediately fouled -- the foul the Lakers had to give --  
and the Lakers then fouled Sean Elliott, who made two free throws 
with 5.3 seconds left to complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a timeout, Bryant took the inbounds pass downcourt and  
missed a desperation 3-pointer that could have tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kobe hit a big shot, but we executed in the end and that's  
what veteran teams do down the stretch, they make plays,'' Elie 
said. ``Going to Utah and Portland and winning close games earlier 
in the year gave us confidence. We've learned to keep our cool in 
close games down the stretch. We didn't do that early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a tough game. This is a tough series.''  
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it is -- for both teams.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at almost like a textbook scenario of how to  
play defense,'' Rambis admitted of what the Spurs have done so far. 
``That to me is the key to their success, it's not what they've 
done offensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have done an especially effective job of bottling up  
Shaquille O'Neal, holding him to 21 points in an 87-81 victory in 
Game 1 and 16 points in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal averaged 26.3 points during the regular season and 29.5  
points in a first-round playoff series against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams that win the way the Spurs have won all year, it's not a  
fluke,'' Fox said. ``We didn't give them two games, they took two 
games. You've got to give them credit.''

<HEADLINE> Relations in Space Similar to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When space travelers leave on voyages to  
distant planets, their baggage will include the same anger, 
rivalries and jealousies that mark relationships on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	After months in tight confines, leadership erodes, cliques  
develop and everybody gets mad at Mission Control, says a 
psychiatrist who studied astronaut and cosmonaut crews aboard the 
Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Outbursts of emotion are inevitable in outer space, said Dr.  
Nick A. Kanas of the University of California, San Francisco. He 
and other experts are searching for ways to control those emotions 
and teach space travelers how to cope. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to train the crews before they go up, so they will be  
aware of what is happening and can apply some self-correction to 
prevent onboard tension,'' said Kanas, a speaker at the annual 
meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger in space, by astronauts and cosmonauts, has been common  
since early in the manned space program. Some Apollo crews in the 
1960s griped at Mission Control even during short-duration 
missions. On Skylab missions that lasted up to 84 days in the 
mid-70s, astronauts regularly ranted about their workload and 
malfunctioning equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers also flashed occasionally aboard Mir, the Russian space  
station where astronauts and cosmonauts spent months in an aging 
craft prone to breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Kanas said, he expects anger and tension to be a part of  
missions to the International Space Station in the next decade, and 
again on the two- to three-year missions to Mars expected in the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to live with two or three people in space for  
months,'' Kanas said. ``If you have a fight on Earth, you can go 
out to a movie or something and it is all better. But in space, you 
can't go anywhere. You are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Research on the Mir suggests that highly professional space  
travelers do well for several months, working smoothly and 
compatibly, Kanas said. But eventually, tempers flare. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians believe it starts after just a few months. Kanas'  
research suggests it takes up to four months before emotions boil 
to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens, he said, is that crew compatibility breaks down,  
with some members ganging up on others. The dynamics of onboard 
leadership may change in subtle ways. And the crew develops a 
tendency to blame Mission Control for all problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a feeling that things are tough on board and nobody  
cares on the outside,'' Kanas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In severe cases, the powerful emotions affected sleep, attention  
to work and even caused physical weakness. Experts are still 
searching for answers, but Kanas said studies have established some 
fundamentals: 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of people in a crew is crucial. ``Three is the most  
difficult number for a crew. With three, somebody is excluded. You 
have a majority and one is a loner,'' said Kanas. ``Eleven and nine 
are good numbers. For instance, you might have a majority of six, 
but those in the 'out' group still have somebody to talk to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--A variety of people may be better than a crew of one sex, one  
race or one nationality. ``There is a school of thought that 
diversity during a long-term space mission might be a positive, 
because it keeps them interested in each other longer,'' Kanas 
said. ``I would guess that the first trip to Mars probably will be 
multicultural with at least two languages and include at least one 
woman.'' Studies suggest, he said, that crew members who are well 
traveled, sophisticated and able to speak different languages ``are 
used to working with other people and will be less tense and more 
cohesive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The compatibility of crew members can be evaluated in advance.  
Russians, the world's leaders in long-term space flight, pay much 
attention to how cosmonauts get along and base crew selection, in 
part, on compatibility. Crew members work together for a year 
before launch, and if tensions develop, are broken up. In the 
United States, crew members are excluded for ``obvious 
psychopathology,'' but selecting for compatibility ``is not well 
developed,'' Kanas said.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Man Gets Beating Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- A 72-year-old man allegedly beaten by  
supermarket security guards who mistakenly thought he had 
shoplifted two packs of cigarettes will get $290,000 in a 
settlement with Safeway Stores and the security company. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement between Richard Joy Clay, Safeway and Monument  
Security was reached shortly before Clay's case was to go to trial 
Wednesday. Neither company admitted any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clay was confronted last fall by two Monument security guards as  
he walked outside the supermarket after buying the cigarettes. The 
retired carpenter had put the receipt in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed the guards called him a thief, threw him to the  
ground and jumped on him with their knees, breaking five of his 
ribs. He said he was handcuffed and dragged back into the store, 
where a cashier told the guards they had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it was all said and done, a poor old man got the heck  
beaten out of him,'' said Doug Bosco, Clay's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the guards was fired and is awaiting trial on assault and  
elderly abuse charges. Charges against the second guard were 
dismissed.

<HEADLINE>  Guatemala Military Logbook Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House urged Guatemalan authorities  
today to protect anyone associated with release of a military 
logbook that dramatically documents nearly 100 killings by 
Guatemalan agents in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Mike Hammer said there is no reason to  
believe the book is not authentic. Human rights groups displayed 
the musty document for the first time at a Washington news 
conference on Thursday, saying it was smuggled out of the Central 
American country's military archives. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups declined to say exactly how they obtained the book  
but vouched for its authenticity and said it came into their 
possession after someone was paid an undisclosed sum for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The book lends further support to the conclusion of a Guatemalan  
truth commission in February that the military was responsible for 
extensive human rights abuses in the 1980s, Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call on the government of Guatemala to protect anyone  
associated with this document who may be put at risk because of its 
publication and we further believe the government of Guatemala 
should take this new evidence of wrongdoing seriously,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammer also recommended action against those responsible for  
committing crimes during the period and protection of any other 
documents that may exist in the military archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu, the country's chief  
human rights prosecutor, and the army asked that the logbook be 
returned. ``This document is valuable for five investigations I am 
carrying out. ... I am going to ask that it be entered in our case 
files,'' said human rights prosecutor Julio Arango Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
	The book includes photos and information about 183 people who  
were arrested, mostly in Guatemala City. Entries in the book 
indicate that about 100 of them were killed in captivity, the human 
rights groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	The book provides key evidence as well as first word of deaths  
for the families of some of the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guatemalan truth commission, looking into the deaths or  
disappearances of more than 200,000 Guatemalans during the 
country's 36-year guerrilla war, concluded that more than 700 
massacres occurred, with most blamed on the army or armed civilian 
patrols formed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``This chilling document is the death squad equivalent of an  
annual productivity report, an account from inside the secret files 
of Guatemala's killing machine,'' said Kate Doyle, director of the 
National Security Archive's Guatemala Project. The organization is 
a private human rights research group. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle spoke at a news conference at which the logbook was shown  
to reporters. The 53-page book is in a hardcover binder held 
together by three screws.

<HEADLINE>  Gen. Shelton Renamed to Top Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton nominated Army Gen. Henry H.  
Shelton to serve a second two-year term as chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top military position. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Rose Garden announcement Thursday with Shelton in uniform  
at his side, Clinton praised the four-star general as ``critical to 
our efforts in Kosovo and indeed to our entire national security 
program.'' As chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Shelton is the senior 
military adviser to the president and the secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation is fortunate that this critical post will continue  
to be filled by someone of his experience, ability and character,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must confirm Shelton for a second term, but there is  
no known opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he and other members of his national security team,  
meeting in the Oval Office, had jokingly voted on whether Shelton 
should be kept in the job. All voted for it except ``he voted 
against it. But we overruled him and he's going to serve another 
term,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton, 57, became the 14th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff on Oct. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-5-inch North Carolina native, Shelton is a decorated  
Vietnam combat veteran and former commander of the U.S. Special 
Operations Command, which oversees the Army's Green Berets, the 
Navy's Seals and other elite outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Shelton has a leading  
voice in the U.S. role in NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, 
although he has no direct command of troops. He and the rest of the 
Joint Chiefs met in the Pentagon on Thursday with Gen. Wesley 
Clark, the top NATO commander and architect of the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton, in a statement issued at the Pentagon, said: ``It has  
been a particular privilege to represent our nation's soldiers, 
sailors, airmen and Marines during a period of great international 
uncertainty and an unprecedented pace of military operations.''

<HEADLINE> David Duke Questioned About Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- David Duke has been called before a grand  
jury investigating a $150,000 payment the former Ku Klux Klan 
leader received from Gov. Mike Foster during the 1995 gubernatorial 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men say the payment was for a list of Duke supporters and  
they have done nothing wrong. But the high price for the list has 
raised questions about whether the money was for something else. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have suggested the money was a payoff to keep Duke out of  
the race, which Foster won. When asked about it, Duke responded: 
``Ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I already had decided to get out of the race'' before the list  
was sold, Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster also denied it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I didn't pay him to stay out of the race,'' said  
Foster, who said he had not been summoned before the grand jury but 
would cooperate with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke decided not to run in the 1995 governor's campaign,  
surprising many observers who thought he might try to capitalize on 
his strong support in the predominantly white New Orleans suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the grand jury Thursday, Duke exercised his Fifth Amendment  
right against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions. 
He contends the investigation is a smear effort on Foster 
orchestrated by U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan on behalf of Congressman 
William Jefferson, who is running against Foster for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Jordan and Jefferson are black and worked in the same law  
firm at different times. Jordan refused comment, citing grand jury 
secrecy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson said he had never talked with Jordan about the case  
and called on Foster and Duke to produce ``some straight talk'' 
about the payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling mailing lists is common during political campaigns.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke said a similar list was sold to state Rep. Woody Jenkins  
for $82,500 during Jenkins' unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 
1996. Jenkins said the payment included money for computer 
equipment that maintained the list and automatically dialed names 
on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Ryder, the governor's deputy chief of staff, said Foster  
bought the list with his personal money and never used it in the 
campaign so it was never reported on campaign finance forms. Ryder 
said $100,000 was for exclusive use of the list and another $50,000 
to renew the exclusive use. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke said he did not personally sell the lists but went through  
a broker, Impact Mail Inc., of Metairie. Duke said he believed the 
company received a 10 percent commission. Duke said he did not own 
any part of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has not been given immunity and he has not been labeled a  
target of the investigation, said his attorney, James McPherson. 
However, McPherson advised Duke not to answer questions on grounds 
of self-incrimination, saying Duke had nothing to gain by 
testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Duke ran for Congress when Bob Livingston  
resigned, finishing third in the May 1 primary. Duke has won only 
one election -- in 1989, to the state House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Mailing lists have figured into Duke's past. He left the Klan in  
1980 when he was accused of selling secret membership lists. He 
then founded the National Association for the Advancement of White 
People.

<HEADLINE> Computer Chip Maker To Give Bonuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Another successful year, another  
huge $20 million bonus to be shared by the 1,000 employees at 
computer memory-chip firm Kingston Technology Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenure and performance determine how much each employee gets out  
of the bonus. ``It's a huge range,'' company spokeswoman Heather 
Jardin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have always said they would do profit sharing. It goes  
along with Kingston's philosophy. It's a real family thing,'' Ms. 
Jardin said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston manufactures memory-chip modules for personal  
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Company co-founders John Tu and David Sun told employees in  
memos that the big payoff will come in July. The company paid a $38 
million bonus to employees in 1997 and $20 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's bonus wasn't as large 1997's because prices have  
dropped for the chip modules, which plug into personal computers 
and store data. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place is an amazing place to work,'' said Ms. Jardin, who  
bought a house with her first bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	When the bonuses are handed out, a tent is erected at the Orange  
County firm and Sun encourages employees to spend wisely. 
</P>
<P>
	``He says pay off your mortgages, put it in the bank, pay off  
your debts or put a good down (payment) on something,'' Ms. Jardin 
said. ``This is a big chunk of money for people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One year, employees were besieged by Mercedes-Benz and BMW  
salesmen. As a joke, one worker drove to work in a Porsche he 
borrowed from a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Employee Tim Westland was constantly approached by strangers  
looking for work when he wore his Kingston T-shirt around town. 
There were so many job applicants the company posted ``Not Hiring'' 
signs on its doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tu and Sun each received about $750 million when Softbank Corp.  
bought the company in 1996 for $1.5 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Talk of restoring the pope's authority in the  
Church of England has proven that the controversies of the 
Reformation burn on, and may not easily be extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, which has  
been exploring the terms of a possible reunion since 1970, said in 
its latest report that the pope's authority should be received as a 
``gift'' to all Christian churches. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, made up of representatives appointed by the  
Vatican and the Anglican Communion, only has the power to make 
recommendations for the churches to consider. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proposed gift of papal authority was not gladly received  
in all quarters of the Church of England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too much too soon,'' said The Church of England Newspaper,  
which reflects the Evangelical point of view in England's state 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper balked at union with a Roman church that regards  
Anglican ordinations as invalid and refuses to allow Anglicans to 
receive the Eucharist in Catholic services. 
</P>
<P>
	It also expressed reservations about Pope John Paul II's deep  
devotion to the Virgin Mary and his revival of ``indulgences,'' or 
a remission of penalties, for pilgrims coming to Rome next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of indulgences, of course, is what drove Martin Luther  
to nail his 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenberg, Germany, 
and set Europe on the road to Reformation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bruce Ruddock, a close observer of Anglican-Catholic  
dialogue as director of the Anglican Center in Rome, suggests that 
papal authority will be hard for Anglicans to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current style of papacy sits uncomfortably at times with  
Anglican models of leadership,'' Ruddock observed in the current 
issue of the center's journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whilst for many people Pope John Paul II is 'the man of the  
century' whom God has used to change the world for the better, he 
is also head of a church that seems to be hardening its heart on 
many issues,'' said Ruddock, who nonetheless professed great 
admiration and affection for the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting the pope's authority would be a huge step for the  
Anglican communion, a collection of independent national churches 
that stem from the Church of England, including the Episcopal 
Church in the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Authority has been one of the most difficult issues in the  
Anglican-Roman rapprochement that started in 1966 when Michael 
Ramsay, then the archbishop of Canterbury, called on Pope Paul VI 
in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Since King Henry VIII installed himself as the head of the  
church in England, the two churches developed very different styles 
of authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic church remained a global operation, while  
Anglican churches in various countries were independent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1867, just three years before the first Vatican Council  
proclaimed the doctrine of papal infallibility, the archbishop of 
Canterbury modestly asserted his authority by inviting -- he had no 
authority to order -- primates of other Anglican churches to the 
first Lambeth conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Those conferences continue, but have no power to set doctrine or  
policy for the church as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the Episcopal Church is governed by the  
General Convention, a bicameral legislature with a House of Bishops 
and a House of Deputies made up of equal numbers of clerical and 
lay delegates. But the National Conference of Catholic Bishops must 
defer to the bishop of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	For both churches, the Bible is authoritative. Both churches  
also recognize the authority of tradition, though Anglicans have 
been skeptical. One of the 39 Articles, a summary of Anglican 
doctrine adopted in 1562, affirms that councils of the church ``may 
err, and sometimes have erred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anglicans have prided themselves on their toleration of  
difference, though that has been severely strained by the 
ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the national churches now ordain women as priests,  
and the United States, Australia and New Zealand also have women 
Anglican bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	An Anglican Commission headed by Archbishop Robin Eames, the  
Anglican primate of Ireland, recently considered whether the 
communion needed to build up its own central authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Questions are asked about whether we can go on as a world  
communion with morally authoritative, but not juridically binding, 
decision-making structures at the international level,'' that 
commission reported two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In dealing with the issue of infallibility, the new report said  
that the bishops as a whole ``in specific circumstances ... may 
together come to a judgment which, being faithful to Scripture and 
consistent with apostolic Tradition, is preserved from error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Hebblethwaite, a liberal Catholic journalist, commented  
in The Guardian newspaper that this was just one example of 
``sleight of hand'' in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, for Roman eyes, what the ... agreement says about  
bishops does not apply to Anglican bishops, because they are not 
really bishops at all,'' she wrote. ``Both sides can agree on a 
teaching about bishops, sign it, and go away drawing different 
conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Right Rev. Mark Santer, Anglican bishop of Birmingham and  
co-chairman of the commission, stressed that the churches had still 
not agreed on the authority of the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather,'' he said, ``the commission is addressing itself to  
the conditions necessary for the restoration of communion between 
Christians. It believes that, if Christian people are to find that 
unity which is God's will, this will entail acceptance of a 
particular ministry for the maintenance of unity, to be exercised 
by the bishop of Rome.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Denies Shooting Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- White officers who fatally shot a black woman  
did not celebrate or use racial epithets at the scene but rather 
hugged each other in grief, a lawyer said in response to a lawsuit 
filed by the woman's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Bill Hadden denied accusations by lawyer Johnnie  
Cochran that the officers were racist and slapped high-fives after 
shooting Tyisha Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverside officers were ``hugging each other and  
commiserating with each other because they hadn't been killed,'' 
Hadden said Wednesday. ``To say they high fived is absolutely 
false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights suit filed Tuesday by a legal team headed by  
Cochran named five officers and the city of Riverside -- 60 mile 
east of Los Angeles -- as defendants and alleged ``racial animus'' 
as the motive for killing Ms. Miller, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers fired 23 shots at Ms. Miller, hitting her 12 times, on  
Dec. 28 after she was found in her locked car with a gun in her 
lap. Police, who responded to a 911 call, say she suddenly reached 
for the weapon when an officer smashed the car's window. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadden said the officers were convinced that Ms. Miller, who did  
not respond to banging on the car windows or shouting, needed 
urgent medical attention and they were willing to risk their lives 
to help her. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought she was dying,'' the attorney said. ``If the  
officers sat back and did nothing, Johnnie Cochran would be saying 
a bunch of racist cops didn't value a black life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverside County District Attorney, while critical of the  
officers handling of the situation, declined to file criminal 
charges against them.

<HEADLINE> Selleck, Rosie Spar Over Gun Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- So much for a peaceful discussion about gun  
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosie O'Donnell and Tom Selleck got into a verbal tussle over  
the issue on her show Wednesday. The actor has filmed a commercial 
for the National Rifle Association, while O'Donnell has been a 
frequent critic of the NRA since the Columbine High School 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said he believed gun control legislation wouldn't have  
done anything to prevent the tragedy, and that it was wrong to 
legislate against guns during a period of national mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	When O'Donnell complained about NRA opposition to efforts to ban  
assault weapons, Selleck said he couldn't speak for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say `I will not take responsibility for anything the  
NRA represents' if you're doing an ad for the NRA. You can't say 
that. Do you think you can?'' O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said it was ``an act of moral vanity'' for O'Donnell to  
assume that someone who disagrees with her cares any less about gun 
control. He said he felt attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come on your show to have a debate,'' he said. ``I  
came on your show to plug a movie. That's what I'm doing here. If 
you think it's proper to have a debate about the NRA, I'm trying to 
be fair with you. This is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An exasperated Selleck looked out on the silent audience.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly entertaining,'' he said. ``Look at the  
audience, laughing and having a great old time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a serious subject,'' O'Donnell shot back. ``I don't think  
it's something to laugh about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceding the debate hadn't gone well, O'Donnell apologized to  
Selleck, saying she wasn't making a personal attack. Selleck, 
looking down at the floor, didn't accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's your show,'' he said, ``and you can talk about it after I  
leave.''

	Stocks End Down; Dow Off 20.65  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower in late trading today as  
lingering concerns about leading technology companies sapped the 
market's modest gains. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 
20.65 at 10,866.74. Broader stock indicators were lower. The 
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 34.98 at 
2,542.42. For several days, stocks have traded in a narrow band as 
investors struggled to determine whether a recent rise in inflation 
will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an 
effort to slow the runaway economy. Today the Philadelphia Federal 
Reserve offered fresh evidence of steady but not inflationary 
economic growth.

	Trade Deficit Hits Record High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States monthly trade deficit hit  
its third monthly record in a row in March -- $19.7 billion. It was 
up 2.9 percent from the record $19.1 billion in February. The 
deficit with Japan shot up to the highest level in more than four 
years, the Commerce Department said today. So far this year, the 
U.S. trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $222.6 billion, 
nearly one-third higher than the all-time high of $169.3 billion 
set last year as the global financial crisis continues to wreck 
havoc with America's trade performance.

	Vitamin Makers To Pay $725M Fine  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two giant foreign companies agreed today to  
pay $725 million in fines for plotting to raise and fix the prices 
of vitamins used in virtually every American home and added to 
bread, milk and breakfast cereal. The $500 million fine to be paid 
by Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., a Swiss pharmaceutical company, is the 
largest federal criminal fine ever imposed in any type of case, 
Attorney General Janet Reno said. A German firm, BASF AG, agreed to 
pay a $225 million fine for its role in the conspiracy to increase 
vitamin prices in the United States and around the world. Both 
companies pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Dallas. Reno and 
aides said Americans paid hundreds of millions of dollars in 
illegally inflated prices for vitamins and food staples such as 
vitamin-enriched bread.

	Software Maker To Take on Microsoft  
</P>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A tiny software maker that once did  
business with Microsoft is taking on the maker of Windows in a 
trial some say could break new ground in antitrust challenges 
against Bill Gates and his company. Bristol Technology Inc., a 
Danbury firm with just 70 employees, is to go to trial June 2 in a 
lawsuit that claims Microsoft is improperly withholding software 
code that Bristol says is vital for its survival. The case is not 
directly related to the larger lawsuit filed against Microsoft by 
the U.S. Department of Justice and 19 states. However, it has a 
similar theme. Bristol contends Microsoft is abusing the market 
power of its Windows NT business software, which runs powerful 
corporate machines that direct networks of smaller personal 
computers.

	eToys' Stock Shoots Higher in IPO

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of eToys more than quadrupled on their  
first day of trading today after the Internet toy merchant raised 
$166 million in a much-anticipated initial public offering. The new 
stock was priced at $20 a share, but soared as high as $85 before 
closing at $76 9/16 on the Nasdaq. While the IPO came amid some 
weakness in Internet stocks in recent weeks, the offering exceeded 
most expectations and signaled that Wall Street hasn't abandoned

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Healtheon Corp. and WebMD Inc. are merging in an

company offering health care services and information for 
consumers, doctors, insurers and drug makers. Healtheon's shares 
soared on the news, rising 20 1/4 to 100 1/2. The market's enthusiastic 
reception may have reflected the support the venture from industry 
leaders like Microsoft Corp. which will invest $250 million in the 
combined company. WebMD is privately held.

	Merrill Lynch Charged in Copper Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today charged Merrill Lynch  
&AMP; Co. with allegedly helping a commodities firm to manipulate the 
world copper market and artificially force prices higher in late 
1995. Geoffrey Aronow, the enforcement director for the U.S. 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said today's action capped a 
three-year investigation of ``one of the most serious worldwide 
manipulations'' of a commodity in 25 years. Merrill denied the 
allegations and said it will defend itself. The CFTC also announced 
charges against the commodities firm, Global Minerals and Metals 
Corp., its president and chief executive officer and its chief 
copper trader. The CFTC filed a civil complaint against the 
companies and individuals, asking for a hearing before an 
administrative law judge at the agency to determine if the charges 
are true and what penalties may be appropriate.

susceptible to future Asian-style currency crises. Greenspan and

into place guidelines that will discourage these countries from 
taking too many risks when they borrow money.

	Guilty Plea in Floor Broker Case

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The owners of a Wall Street brokerage that  
allowed New York Stock Exchange floor brokers to execute personal 
trades ahead of orders for their customers pleaded guilty today to 
securities conspiracy. The case marked the first time federal 
prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission have brought 
charges against anyone for making personal trades on the floor of 
the exchange. William Killeen, Thomas William Bock, their company 
Oakford Corp., and four other stockbrokers entered their pleas 
before U.S. Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Manhattan. Killeen, 39, of Colts 
Neck, N.J., was the president of Oakford, a now defunct brokerage 
firm which opened in 1992. Bock, 46, of Garden City was the vice 
president.

<HEADLINE> Global Patent System Backed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Patent officials meeting in Tokyo discussed the  
creation of a ``global patent'' system that would allow copyrights 
issued in one country to be recognized in all others, an official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeshi Isayama, commissioner of the Japanese Patent Office,  
said establishing such a system should be a goal of future world 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	He and the heads of patent offices from the United States,  
Europe and Canada, who wrapped up two days of talks on Thursday, 
agreed to the idea in principle, Isayama said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted significant differences remain.  
</P>
<P>
	One is the standards used in granting patents. The United States  
and European countries, for instance, are at odds over whether to 
give patents to the original inventor or the first person who shows 
up at the patent office. 
</P>
<P>
	Isayama also stressed the importance of including third world  
countries in an agreement. To accomplish this, developing countries 
must demonstrate the reliability of their patent issuing procedures 
and enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence must be built in the patent systems of other  
countries,'' Isayama said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Talks to Littleton Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- On a day of more school bloodshed,  
President Clinton consoled grief-stricken families in the town 
where a murder-suicide rampage by two teen-agers a month ago left 
15 dead and shocked the nation. ``What happened to you has pierced 
the soul of America,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something profound has happened to your country because of  
this,'' the president told Columbine High School students, parents, 
faculty and community members. He said that when Columbine seniors 
graduate in two days, ``America will be cheering you on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2,000 people packed Dakota Ridge High School gymnasium to  
hear the president. The audience cheered, whistled and applauded at 
word that two wounded youths had left their hospital beds to be at 
the speech -- Sean Graves and Patrick Ireland, who was pulled from a 
second story window by police the day of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Littleton's suffering and bravery have touched the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can help us to build a better future for all of our  
children, a future where hatred and distrust no longer distort the 
mind or harden the heart, a future where what we have in common is 
far more important than what divides us, a future where parents and 
children are more involved in each other's lives,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his wife Hillary spent nearly two hours at  
Light of the World Catholic Church, going from table to table to 
shake hands with the families of those killed. A month ago, 
counselors had worked at the church with survivors of the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shoels, whose 18-year-old son Isaiah was killed, said  
Clinton put his arm around him. ``He gave us his true condolences 
and I really do believe him,'' Shoels said. ``It went great.'' He 
said he gave Clinton a letter suggesting what should be done now. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks later at the high school, Mrs. Clinton said she was  
impressed by the community's strength and ``your refusal to let 
violence and hatred win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the latest shootings in Conyers, Ga., in which six  
students were injured Thursday morning, before he left Washington, 
were ``deeply troubling to me as it is to all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident again should underscore how profoundly important  
it is that all Americans come together in the face of these events 
to protect all of our children from violence,'' the president said 
at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Hammond, superintendent of Jefferson County School, said  
that Littleton has ``been a symbol of the worst nightmare that you 
could imagine with the loss and injuries of our students and staff 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will also be a symbol to the nation of strength, of  
dedication, of commitment and resilience as we pull together as a 
community with Columbine at our core,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To a community still searching for answers, the president said  
in his remarks here, ``These dark forces that take over people and 
make them murder are the extreme manifestation of fear and rage 
with which every human being has to do combat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Dakota Ridge gymnasium before Clinton spoke, a  
handful of Columbine students talked of breaking into tears when 
they heard the news of gunfire at the Georgia school. 
</P>
<P>
	It was exactly one month ago that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris  
terrorized Columbine, killing 12 classmates and a teacher before 
shooting themselves dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Student body president Heather Dinkel tugged at her dress, took  
a deep breath and hugged her mother as they waited for the Clintons 
to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about it,'' she said when asked about the  
presidential visit. ``It's been so overwhelming the last few 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her twin brother Mike, also a Columbine senior, said the  
Clintons could ``make some people here see that their problems are 
something that even big people like the president are going to help 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbine High School shootings April 20 also had an effect  
on the nation's debate on gun control, softening Republican 
opposition in Congress to tougher measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest step came Thursday as the Senate, after angry calls  
from constituents, approved a Democratic plan to require background 
checks for firearms buyers at gun shows and pawnshops. Vice 
President Al Gore cast the deciding vote; Clinton called him from 
Air Force One with congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seizing on the Columbine shootings, Clinton has begun a national  
campaign against school violence, urging more gun control and less 
violence in movies, music and video games.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 20.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Thursday as lingering concerns about  
high-tech companies sapped the modest gains of a market still 
struggling to find a direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.65 to close at  
10,866.74. The index of blue-chip stocks was higher for much of the 
session, and the decline was concentrated in the final half-hour of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
dipped 5.40 to 1,338.83, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index fell 35.17 to close at 2,542.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have traded in a narrow band for several days as  
investors struggle to determine whether a recent rise in inflation 
will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an 
effort to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Federal Reserve offered fresh evidence Thursday  
that the economy is growing at a steady but not inflationary rate. 
The group reported that manufacturing growth eased slightly in 
April, which calmed an anxious market and set the stage for some 
mild, broad-based gains. 
</P>
<P>
	For a fourth consecutive day, light volume indicated that many  
market players want a clearer picture of the U.S. economy before 
they return to active trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the markets are still paying attention to interest  
rates and to unemployment, said Robert Freedman, chief investment 
officer for the John Hancock Funds in Boston. ``People are still 
wondering whether the inflation scare is really something to worry 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a definitive answer, analysts said investors began  
moving their money from some big-name technology companies that are 
seen as somewhat risky. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer, which disappointed analysts earlier this week  
with a profit report that merely matched expectations, fell again, 
dropping 1 9/16 to 38 1/4 and pulling other computer stocks down with 
it. IBM, one of the Dow stocks, dropped 3 to 232 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks suffered as well. Amazon.com dropped 3 7/8 to 135  
11/16 after the company said it plans to sell $2 billion in stocks 
and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said many investors, in search of security, are  
just moving their money to other sectors. Utility stocks, often 
seen as a safe haven, have mostly risen in recent sessions. 
Investors were also seeking bargains in the long-neglected 
small-capitalization stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer products companies, which are seen as relatively immune  
from the economy's ups and downs, also rose Thursday. Procter &AMP; 
Gamble, a Dow component, rose 1 11/16 to close at 96 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money isn't leaving this market,'' said Larry Wachtel, a  
market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mergers set the stage for some gains Thursday. Healtheon soared  
20 3/8 to 100 5/8 as it announced it will merge with WebMD Inc. to create 
an Internet-based health care services company. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck was among the Dow's biggest advancers, rising 1 1/2 to 72 as  
it nears approval for a new painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Paper and forest products stocks rose after Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter raised earnings estimates for the group. International Paper 
rose 13/16 to 54 13/16, and Georgia Pacific rose 1 9/16 to 91 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was room for at least one successful new issue. EToys  
soared from its initial price of 20 to 76 9/16 in its Nasdaq debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.12 to 639.42. The American Stock  
Exchange composite index rose 3.67 to 792.03, and the Russell 2000 
index of smaller companies rose 1.88 to 448.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 905.9 million shares, 
slightly behind Wednesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume will most likely increase Friday, analysts said, as the  
market faces a ``double witching'' day. Stock and index options are 
both set to expire, which traditionally stimulates volume as 
traders settle their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.45 percent.  
European markets were mostly higher, as Germany's DAX index rose 
0.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.6 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 closed up 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Recalls Softball Bats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc. is recalling about  
45,000 aluminum softball bats because of safety concerns, company 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Rawlings have  
received 16 reports of the top of the bats shearing off. No 
injuries have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is limited to aluminum slow-pitch softball bats. The  
bats include an end weight that is screwed in, which officials 
believe is creating the stress that causes the bat to break. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled bats are model numbers SBZ2, SBZ3, SBZ4, SBB3,  
SBB4, SBB5, SBB6, SBB7, SPT-PK2, and DUAL-E. ``Rawlings'' and the 
model numbers can be found on the barrel of each bat. The bats are 
adult-sized, and come in various colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Major retailers, including Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, and  
sporting goods stores nationwide sold the bats from September 1997 
through May 1999 for between $40 and $200. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may call Rawlings at 800-367-3455, or write the  
company at P.O. Box 22000, St. Louis, Mo., 63126.

<HEADLINE> H.S. Gunman Described As Quiet Teen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The boy who shot six students in his high  
school Thursday is a quiet, middle-class 15-year-old sophomore 
whose grades had slipped recently and whose heart was broken when 
his girlfriend dumped him, friends and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	One other thing stood out to those who know the teen-ager: there  
were a lot of guns in the basement of his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed them to me and my brother one time. I don't know  
much about guns, but I think they were like, hunting guns,'' said 
15-year-old Brad Morgan, who lives two houses away from the suspect 
and rode the bus with him to Heritage High School in suburban 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Said sophomore Chris Dunn, a friend of the suspect: ``He had  
lots of guns. They were his parents'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some classmates said the teen-ager had boasted in recent weeks  
of shooting people at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been saying he's been wanting to do this all year  
long,'' said 15-year-old Katie Bir. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, like Katrima Barton, said they didn't take it seriously.  
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager, whose name was not released by authorities, lived  
with his mother, stepfather and 13-year-old sister at the end of a 
cul-de-sac of $275,000-plus homes with manicured lawns. His home is 
nestled on a large, wooded lot with a basketball hoop at the end of 
a winding driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	The family moved to Conyers two years ago from South Carolina.  
The boy's mother works as a secretary for a veterinarian. The 
neighbors were unsure where the stepfather worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were people that really kept to themselves,'' said  
Morgan's father, Allan, who sometimes drove the suspect to summer 
school last year in the neighborhood carpool. ``He was a quiet kid, 
but I just chalked it up to him being shy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, reporters swarmed the neighborhood and detectives  
searched the boy's home, carrying boxes in and out. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors described the teen-ager as someone who was quiet but  
had a few close friends. His family went to the local Catholic 
church, and the teen-ager had attended the church youth service as 
usual Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty quiet, but around me and other people he would  
laugh and joke around,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said the teen-ager's grades had fallen recently, and  
they weren't sure why. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't even trying anymore, which I was kind of concerned  
about,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friend and classmate Nathaniel Deeter, 15, said the suspect was  
``really upset'' about the breakup with a girl he had dated for 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I have no reason to live anymore.' And I told him he  
was crazy. I thought he was just feeling sorry for himself because 
a lot of kids feel like that,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deeter said the suspect gave no clue about his shooting plans  
when Deeter spoke to him 10 minutes before the spree began. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Morgan said the suspect didn't say or do anything unusual  
at the bus stop Thursday morning. ``He was acting just like any 
other day,'' Morgan said.

<HEADLINE> Greenberg Named McDonald's Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. on Thursday named Jack  
Greenberg, who has been credited with helping the fast-food chain 
make a sharp turnaround in recent months, its chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg, who had been the company's president and chief  
executive officer, becomes only the fourth chairman since 
McDonald's was founded in 1955. His promotion was announced at 
McDonald's annual shareholders meeting and is effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have praised Greenberg for steering the chain in the  
right direction over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of struggling sales and declining market share, the  
chain last year gained market share and boosted sales at stores 
open at least a year, in part because of such successful promotions 
as Beanie Babies and Monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say McDonald's has experienced a remarkable turnaround  
as it decentralized its domestic operations to give grumbling 
franchisees more say in developing their menus and planning 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has benefited from increased expansion  
overseas, particularly in Europe, where revenues soon will exceed 
domestic sales despite having far fewer restaurants per capita. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg replaces Michael R. Quinlan, who will remain a member  
of McDonald's board and chairman of its executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg has served as McDonald's president and chief executive  
officer since April 1998. He joined the company in 1982 as 
executive vice president and chief financial officer.

<HEADLINE> Dolan Brothers May Buy New York Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan and his  
brother, Larry, were said to be leading contenders to buy the New 
York Jets, according to Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
	People familiar with the team's situation were cited today as  
sources for the report in the newspaper, which did not identify the 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources also confirmed earlier reports that the NFL club's  
late owner, Leon Hess, had stipulated in his will that the team be 
sold upon his death. Hess died May 7 at 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets spokesman Frank Ramos said today the team would not comment  
on whether it is entertaining offers. ``We're not making an 
announcement today'' regarding any potential sale, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision is a major player on the New York sports scene as  
majority owner of Madison Square Garden, the NBA's Knicks and the 
NHL's Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable television company announced today it would become a  
partner with the New Jersey Devils in their plan to build a new 
arena in Hoboken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision would bear half of the $206 million cost to  
construct the new venue above the Hoboken commuter rail station, 
Devils president John McMullen told The Star-Ledger in today's 
editions. He was not available today for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolan brothers made an unsuccessful bid to buy the Cleveland  
Browns expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Shula, retired coach of the Miami Dolphins, could be part of  
the Dolans' effort to acquire the Jets, according to Newsday. He 
was part of their bid for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel free to comment on that,'' Shula said when asked  
about his possible involvement in the move to buy the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he enjoyed his relationship with the Dolans when they  
tried to get the Browns' franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been estimated that the Jets may sell for about $500  
million. The NFL finance committee voted this week to recommend 
that the Washington Redskins be sold to Daniel Snyder for $800 
million, but that deal would include the team's new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets play at Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands sports  
complex in East Rutherford, N.J. That complex also has the 
Continental Airlines Arena, home of the Devils and the NBA's Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other possible buyers for the Jets was New York Mets  
principal owner Nelson Doubleday.

<HEADLINE> Senator Questions SEC's Levitt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Lindsey, the head of market regulation  
at the Securities and Exchange Commission, was planning to leave 
the government for private industry. And he had a list of half a 
dozen Wall Street firms for whom he'd like to work. 
</P>
<P>
	After Lindsey gave the list to his boss, SEC Chairman Arthur  
Levitt, Levitt put in a call for him. Problem was, he phoned the 
chief executive of Bear Stearns Cos. -- a big securities firm being 
investigated by the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	That January phone call has shined a spotlight on Washington's  
revolving-door tradition of agency heads helping their subordinates 
find jobs in private industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The call troubles Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior  
Democrat on a Senate subcommittee that deals with government 
ethics. Levin believes the call by Levitt, the government's top 
securities regulator, to a firm under investigation creates the 
appearance of a possible ethical breach, an aide to Levin said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of appearance,'' said the aide, who spoke on  
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Levin is looking at drafting legislation that would  
clear up gray areas in the rules covering the kinds of help agency 
heads could offer in getting people jobs at companies that have 
business before the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	An agency head responding to a query about a subordinate from a  
prospective employer or providing a reference is quite different 
from initiating a phone call to a company, the aide suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private meeting, Levin told the SEC chief he was troubled  
by the phone call, which was first reported by The Wall Street 
Journal in Wednesday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Lindsey left the market watchdog agency to become a  
senior managing director of New York-based Bear Stearns. He assumed 
the newly created No. 2 position at Bear Stearns Securities Corp., 
the company's clearing division that processes trades for brokerage 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns' clearing operations have been under investigation  
by the SEC and criminal prosecutors, who have been examining 
whether the company ignored signs of fraudulent activity at the 
small firms for which it clears transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt would have no comment on the Lindsey matter Wednesday,  
said a spokesman, Duncan King. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Deputy General Counsel David Becker, speaking on Levitt's  
behalf, told The Journal that there was nothing improper about the 
phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt, who came to Washington from Wall Street after heading a  
major brokerage firm and the American Stock Exchange, often 
recommends his SEC colleagues to industry executives for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure of his call on Lindsey's behalf comes at a time  
when high-level enforcement attorneys and auditors have been 
leaving the SEC at a worrisome pace for lucrative jobs in private 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest departure, the agency announced Wednesday that  
Henry Klehm, senior associate enforcement director in the SEC's 
Northeast regional office, was leaving to become chief regulatory 
officer for Prudential Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	King said Levitt did not help Klehm get the new job.  
</P>
<P>
	Levitt heads a relatively small agency with 3,000 employees and  
has a management style that emphasizes personal relationships. His 
relations with Congress have generally been smooth, but he did get 
into an ethics flap nearly two years ago with Rep. David McIntosh, 
R-Ind., chairman of a House oversight subcommittee that 
investigated his travel for 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's majority Republican staff concluded that Levitt  
didn't break any laws but said he ``loosely'' followed federal 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the inquiry, the SEC told the panel it would  
change its travel policy to allow only first-class travel that is 
authorized by federal regulations and periodically audit all agency 
travel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks to Littleton Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- On a day of more school bloodshed,  
President Clinton consoled grief-stricken families in the town 
where a murder-suicide rampage by two teen-agers a month ago left 
15 dead and shocked the nation. He said the Columbine High School 
killings had deprived students of ``a certain kind of innocence'' 
that no youngster should lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the latest shootings in Conyers, Ga., in which six  
students were injured Thursday morning before he left Washington, 
were ``deeply troubling to me as it is to all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those arranging to see the president were two wounded  
youths who left their hospital beds for the occasion -- Sean Graves 
and Patrick Ireland, who was pulled from a second story window by 
police the day of the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	En route here, the president scribbled a message he intended to  
deliver when he met privately with survivors of the Columbine 
bloodletting and their families. Press secretary Joe Lockhart read 
the president's notes to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had this message:  
</P>
<P>
	``You have suffered terrible losses in the deaths, injuries,  
horror, heartbreak and a certain kind of innocence no young person 
should have to part with so soon or so suddenly. All of you are 
left with searing scars and unanswered questions that must be 
healed, answered or dealt with as best you can. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two days from now is Columbine's commencement. I know it will  
be bittersweet, not everything you hoped it would be when you first 
walked through the doors as freshmen. But even your rivals at 
Chatfield (High School) will be cheering you on. When you hear 
them, think of them as the voice of all Americans cheering you on 
and asking for your help. In that help, you will speed your own 
healing and that of your country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, he had called five Columbine students who  
are still hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conyers shootings occurred shortly before Clinton left for  
Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident again should underscore how profoundly important  
it is that all Americans come together in the face of these events 
to protect all of our children from violence,'' the president said 
at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbine High School shootings April 20 also had an effect  
on the nation's debate on gun control, softening Republican 
opposition in Congress to tougher measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest step came Thursday as the Senate, after angry calls  
from constituents, approved a Democratic plan to require background 
checks for firearms buyers at gun shows and pawnshops. Vice 
President Al Gore cast the deciding vote; Clinton called him from 
Air Force One with congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, joined by his wife Hillary, talked privately with  
families of victims of the Columbine massacre. They met at Light of 
the World Catholic Church, where counselors had worked with 
survivors of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was embraced by several family members when he walked  
in. Others shook his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The families were seated at 14 tables in the church. The  
Clintons went from table to table, sitting and talking. There were 
about 75 people in all. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton joined the president after a morning trip to the  
Grand Canyon. Her plane had problems that caused her to arrive here 
a half-hour late. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has stepped forward many times to try to heal a  
community's pain, after floods, tornadoes, an earthquake, the 
Oklahoma City bombing and a school shooting in Oregon a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Seizing on the Columbine shootings, Clinton has begun a national  
campaign against school violence, urging more gun control and less 
violence in movies, music and video games.

<HEADLINE>  Ortiz, Nathan Emerging as Fixtures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Russ Ortiz was an aspiring closer. Joe  
Nathan played shortstop most of his life. Both have pulled off 
pitching transitions for the San Francisco Giants with startling 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz, just two years removed from being considered the top  
relieving prospect in San Francisco's farm system, has emerged as a 
top-flight starter. And Nathan, pitching above Double A for the 
first time this season, already has made an overpowering impression 
in the rotation and the bullpen with his 97 mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have been central to San Francisco's solid start,  
figuring in eight of the team's 23 wins. Their success also has 
helped San Francisco withstand an injury to opening day starter 
Mark Gardner and the ongoing struggles of Shawn Estes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, who have played the past month without Barry Bonds,  
began Thursday tied with Arizona for first place in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at them as young pitchers but they're pitching like  
they've been around a long time,'' outfielder Stan Javier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz has gone 5-2 with a 2.53 ERA, both ranking near the top of  
the league. He has won his last four decisions, a career best, and 
the Giants have wins in 11 of his last 14 outings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun for me to see younger guys do well and prove they can  
play up here,'' said Ortiz, who has his first career complete game 
in a 7-2 win over Colorado on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just throwing better pitches and getting my breaking  
pitches over for strikes. Last year, I would throw the fastball and 
not even worry about location.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Ortiz used to throw a  
fastball almost exclusively, which was one of the main reasons he 
mostly worked out of the bullpen in the minor leagues and in 
college at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz split time between the bullpen and rotation and between  
San Francisco and Triple-A Fresno last season but settled into a 
starting role after filling in for the injured Estes much of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	His ability to diversify his pitching style accelerated his  
transition from reliever to starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the biggest factor in his last 5-6 starts is when  
he makes a pitch, he's not overthrowing,'' Perranoski said. ``Right 
now, he's got the hot hand and he's our most consistent pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan, though, rates as an even bigger surprise for the Giants  
than Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
	He began as an infielder in San Francisco's minor league system  
but Giants scouts were dubious about his hitting prospects and 
intrigued by his powerful throwing arm and suggested he switch to 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a tall skinny kid at shortstop but he had a great  
arm,'' Perranoski said. ``We thought he could be a pitcher and as 
it turned out we were right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan agrees now but he wasn't sold on the idea at first,  
leaving the organization and returning to State University of New 
York-Stony Brook for a year to complete his degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding to give baseball one more shot, he rejoined the Giants  
in 1997 and rose to become one of the Giants top pitching 
prospects, nearly making the team out of spring training prior to 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants recalled Nathan after shoulder problems forced  
Gardner on the disabled list and Nathan responded by pitching seven 
scoreless against Florida on April 21 to win his major league 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to think too much about what's happened because I  
don't want to change anything in what I've done to get where I 
am,'' Nathan said. ``Basically, I've just tried to keep things 
simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won his next start against Montreal by allowing two runs in  
eight innings, becoming the first Giants pitcher since Osvaldo 
Fernandez in 1996 to win his first two starts. He just missed 
becoming the first San Francisco pitcher since Juan Marichal in 
1960 to win his first three starts, leaving a May 3 contest at 
Pittsburgh with a 6-4 lead but the Pirates rallied for a 9-8 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, he moved to the bullpen as Gardner returned  
from the disabled list to reclaim his starting spot and setup man 
Julian Tavarez, suffering from pneumonia, went on the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday at Houston, Nathan worked a scoreless 11th inning,  
fanning Jeff Bagwell for the final out, to pick up his first major 
league save. 
</P>

	``It was great because he had never been in that situation  
before at any level and it was a big game for us,'' Javier said. 
``When you have a 97 mph fastball and you throw it past Bagwell, 
that's something.''

<HEADLINE> Coppola Defends Lucas Prequel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The critics are out in force against George  
Lucas and the ``Star Wars'' sequel. At least his old friend Francis 
Ford Coppola is standing by him. 
</P>
<P>
	``George worked very hard on it. I know he's gotten some bad  
reviews, but he didn't slough it off or anything,'' Coppola said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonetheless, it's going to be an extraordinary success. It's  
all-out `Star Wars.' I don't think people really will be 
disappointed,'' said the Academy Award-winning filmmaker whose 
works include ``The Godfather'' trilogy and ``Apocalypse Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men go way back: In 1969, Coppola established American  
Zoetrope, an independent production company in San Francisco, with 
Lucas as his vice president. Coppola produced the Lucas-directed 
``THX-1138'' and ``American Graffiti.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened Wednesday  
to less-than-stellar reviews but enthusiastic fan response. Coppola 
told The Associated Press he understands the mania. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes sense. People who are in their 30s were 8 years old  
when they saw `Star Wars,''' he said. ``It was something they had 
never seen before. Now ... they can see it again.''

<HEADLINE>  Ortiz, Nathan Emerging as Fixtures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Russ Ortiz was an aspiring closer. Joe  
Nathan played shortstop most of his life. Both have pulled off 
pitching transitions for the San Francisco Giants with startling 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz, just two years removed from being considered the top  
relieving prospect in San Francisco's farm system, has emerged as a 
top-flight starter. And Nathan, pitching above Double A for the 
first time this season, already has made an overpowering impression 
in the rotation and the bullpen with his 97 mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have been central to San Francisco's solid start,  
figuring in eight of the team's 23 wins. Their success also has 
helped San Francisco withstand an injury to opening day starter 
Mark Gardner and the ongoing struggles of Shawn Estes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, who have played the past month without Barry Bonds,  
began Thursday tied with Arizona for first place in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at them as young pitchers but they're pitching like  
they've been around a long time,'' outfielder Stan Javier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz has gone 5-2 with a 2.53 ERA, both ranking near the top of  
the league. He has won his last four decisions, a career best, and 
the Giants have wins in 11 of his last 14 outings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun for me to see younger guys do well and prove they can  
play up here,'' said Ortiz, who has his first career complete game 
in a 7-2 win over Colorado on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just throwing better pitches and getting my breaking  
pitches over for strikes. Last year, I would throw the fastball and 
not even worry about location.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Ortiz used to throw a  
fastball almost exclusively, which was one of the main reasons he 
mostly worked out of the bullpen in the minor leagues and in 
college at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz split time between the bullpen and rotation and between  
San Francisco and Triple-A Fresno last season but settled into a 
starting role after filling in for the injured Estes much of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	His ability to diversify his pitching style accelerated his  
transition from reliever to starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the biggest factor in his last 5-6 starts is when  
he makes a pitch, he's not overthrowing,'' Perranoski said. ``Right 
now, he's got the hot hand and he's our most consistent pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan, though, rates as an even bigger surprise for the Giants  
than Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
	He began as an infielder in San Francisco's minor league system  
but Giants scouts were dubious about his hitting prospects and 
intrigued by his powerful throwing arm and suggested he switch to 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a tall skinny kid at shortstop but he had a great  
arm,'' Perranoski said. ``We thought he could be a pitcher and as 
it turned out we were right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan agrees now but he wasn't sold on the idea at first,  
leaving the organization and returning to State University of New 
York-Stony Brook for a year to complete his degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding to give baseball one more shot, he rejoined the Giants  
in 1997 and rose to become one of the Giants top pitching 
prospects, nearly making the team out of spring training prior to 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants recalled Nathan after shoulder problems forced  
Gardner on the disabled list and Nathan responded by pitching seven 
scoreless against Florida on April 21 to win his major league 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to think too much about what's happened because I  
don't want to change anything in what I've done to get where I 
am,'' Nathan said. ``Basically, I've just tried to keep things 
simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won his next start against Montreal by allowing two runs in  
eight innings, becoming the first Giants pitcher since Osvaldo 
Fernandez in 1996 to win his first two starts. He just missed 
becoming the first San Francisco pitcher since Juan Marichal in 
1960 to win his first three starts, leaving a May 3 contest at 
Pittsburgh with a 6-4 lead but the Pirates rallied for a 9-8 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, he moved to the bullpen as Gardner returned  
from the disabled list to reclaim his starting spot and setup man 
Julian Tavarez, suffering from pneumonia, went on the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday at Houston, Nathan worked a scoreless 11th inning,  
fanning Jeff Bagwell for the final out, to pick up his first major 
league save. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great because he had never been in that situation  
before at any level and it was a big game for us,'' Javier said. 
``When you have a 97 mph fastball and you throw it past Bagwell, 
that's something.''

<HEADLINE> Malcolm X Diary Off Auction Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Investigators are trying to figure out how  
the bloodied diary of Malcolm X ended up at a West Coast auctioneer 
who agreed not to sell it while authorities determine where it 
should go. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was taken off the auction block Thursday after the  
family of the slain civil rights leader charged it had been stolen 
and threatened to sue to halt the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, a San Francisco auction house, said  
it will hold on to the diary until attorneys for the city of New 
York or the person who consigned the book direct them to send it 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best thing that can happen at this time,'' said  
Joseph Fleming, the attorney representing the six daughters of 
Malcolm X. ``Certainly they'd like to have this done with and over, 
but the first step was to have the sale halted. This is in line 
with what we hoped and anticipated would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction house would not identify the person who consigned  
the book, but spokeswoman Catharine Williamson said the collector 
is a reputable person who has dealt with Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The red, 146-page diary, pierced by three bullet holes, was  
found in the left breast pocket of the suit Malcolm X was wearing 
when he was assassinated Feb. 21, 1965, in New York. It was used as 
an address book and lists names and telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is worth an estimated $30,000 to $50,000, and was last seen  
when it was used as evidence in the trial of three men convicted of 
his assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield spokesman Levi Morgan said the auction  
house office was approached a few months ago by the collector, who 
said he acquired the diary from someone who obtained it in a court 
evidence purge. It was scheduled to be displayed in Los Angeles on 
Friday and be auctioned in San Francisco on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleming said that even if the court file was purged, Malcolm X's  
relatives should have been offered any personal materials it 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
	New York investigators have worked since last week to learn how  
the book disappeared from 5,000 pages of documents turned over to 
the city's Municipal Archives in 1993. Only an empty envelope 
labeled to contain the diary was there, said archive director 
Kenneth Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't offered to the family in 1965, it certainly  
should be now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither G. Foster Mills, managing attorney for the counsel of  
the City of New York, nor a spokesman for the New York Police 
Department returned calls seeking comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Missile Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation approved Thursday by the House and  
sent to the White House would commit the United States to an 
anti-missile national defense system. President Clinton was 
expected to sign the measure, which the Senate modified to meet 
administration objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed 345-71, states that it is the policy of  
the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, 
an effective system capable of defending U.S. territory against 
limited ballistic missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	It also states there will be continued negotiations with Russia  
on arms reductions. Russia has opposed construction of a U.S. 
missile defense system, saying it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said it will not decide until June 2000  
on firm plans for an anti-missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed similar legislation in 1995. He also opposed an  
earlier House version passed March, saying it did not make clear 
that the defense system would be limited and focused against 
threats from rogue states rather than existing nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate changed the bill to reflect those concerns and the  
House agreed to the revised version Thursday, despite some 
reluctance by supporters of the original House plan 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy with the legislation,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon,  
R-Pa., chief sponsor of the House version. The changes, he said 
``are simply cover for liberal Democrats who don't support missile 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weldon and Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House  
Armed Services Committee, said it should be clear that when the 
president signs the bill he is changing U.S. policy and committing 
the nation to a national defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of ballistic missile attack is real, and it is here  
today,'' Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, a leading Democratic  
defense expert, cited military testimony that it will be at least 
2005 before tests can determine whether a credible defense system 
can be build. ``We ought to be very sober about any of these 
exhortations ... from people who want to wish this into 
existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has budgeted $10.5 billion between 1999 and  
2005 to develop a limited national missile defense system. It 
became more positive toward eventual deployment of such a system 
after North Korea last year tested missiles that flew over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The system envisioned by both Congress and the White House is a  
scaled-back version of the space-based Strategic Defense 
Initiative, or ``Star Wars'' program, proposed by President Reagan 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan's plan was aimed mainly at stopping an attack from the  
former Soviet Union, while current research is designed more to 
stop a limited attack from a rogue or terrorist state. It would not 
be space-based.

<HEADLINE> Golfer's Request To Use Cart Denied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday denied a  
disabled golfer's request to use a cart in a local qualifier for 
the U.S. Open, ruling it would fundamentally alter the nature of 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In denying Ford Olinger's request under the Americans with  
Disabilities Act, U.S. District Judge Robert Miller wrote in his 
ruling that athletic competition presents a different concern for 
the ADA than the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of an athletic competition, in contrast, is to  
decide who, under conditions that are about the same for everyone, 
can perform an assigned set of tasks better than (not as well as) 
any other competitor,'' Miller wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger, a golf pro in Warsaw, successfully sued the USGA last  
year to use a cart in a local qualifier for the Open. But he did 
not qualify for the sectional, shooting a 12-over 83. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims a degenerative hip disorder makes walking 18 holes  
nearly impossible for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller agreed with the U.S. Golf Association's contention that  
walking is a fundamental aspect to competitive golf, and that 
allowing Olinger to ride a cart would provide him an unfair 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy in the sense that we've said all along all the  
players in the competition should be treated under identical rules 
and that giving one player a cart would create an unfair advantage, 
and that's exactly what the judge found,'' said USGA spokesman 
Marty Parkes. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller made clear in his ruling that his decision does not  
affect Casey Martin, who won the right last year to ride on the PGA 
Tour under the ADA. Martin has a circulatory disorder in his right 
leg that makes it painful for him to walk long distances. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's case is on appeal before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wrote in a footnote that he did not consider the Martin  
case in making his ruling because it was in a different circuit 
court. He also wrote that the two cases differ because Martin's 
suit sought the right to use a cart on the PGA Tour, not just a 
single event. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ruling, Parkes said the USGA will still honor its  
agreement with Martin to allow him to ride in this year's Open 
while his suit against the PGA is on appeal. Martin is exempt from 
the local qualifier this year but has to play in the Cleveland 
sectional last month to qualify for the Open championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger, who was playing golf when he heard the news, told local  
radio show Sports Talk he probably would appeal the decision, 
though he hadn't discussed it with his lawyers. He said he would 
announce at a news conference Friday whether he would attempt to 
qualify for the Open without a cart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that I'm of the caliber that I can compete for the U.S.  
Open championship,'' he said. ``I continuously shoot low 70s and 
high 60s, so it's not like I'm out there shooting 90, 95 and just 
trying to get in the Open that way.''

<HEADLINE> Rescue on Mt. McKinley Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Three British climbers, one of them  
injured, were stuck high on Mount McKinley on Thursday in a 
wind-lashed spot with little food or other supplies, the National 
Park Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Tranel, a park service spokeswoman in Talkeetna, said the  
climbers were stranded at 19,000 feet on the West Rib route of 
North America's highest peak. They radioed a mayday at about 3 
a.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Names of the three men were not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers have had limited radio contact with the climbers,  
either because of transmission problems or dying batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the climbers was hurt too badly to descend on his own.  
</P>
<P>
	Tranel said they were traveling with little gear, apparently to  
make a quick trip to the 20,320-foot summit and back down to their 
camp at 15,700 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were in an area without much protection from McKinley's  
notorious winds, which Tranel said were blowing up to 50 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Other climbers with a radio were moving up the mountain toward  
the stranded men. Poor visibility made rescue by helicopter 
untenable. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year two British military climbers were plucked from almost  
the same place after being stranded by fierce blizzards for more 
than three days without food or shelter. One suffered badly 
frostbitten feet, while the other had only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service was forecasting partly cloudy  
conditions on Friday, Tranel said, so an aerial rescue attempt 
might be possible.

<HEADLINE> New 'Star Wars' Succeeds Visually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It is 22 years later now, an entire generation  
after a thunderous space opera set a long time ago in a galaxy far, 
far away changed the look of the cinematic future forever. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, George Lucas and his young crew at Industrial Light &AMP;  
Magic introduced a new sci-fi epoch -- one of shiny, white-uniformed 
storm troopers, a shiny black-helmeted overlord and a vision of 
space like none before. But it also presented a novel vision of 
well-worn spaceships, dented droids and no shortage of grime. An 
old-style story with an altogether new look. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, with two decades of staggering technological innovation  
at his command, Lucas' encore poses a vexing challenge: telling a 
fresh ``Star Wars'' story that unfolds a generation before his 
initial trilogy -- yet still manages to dazzle a post-''Blade 
Runner,'' post-''Terminator,'' post-''Matrix'' audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Visually, he has succeeded. When it comes to production design  
and special effects, ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' 
which opened Wednesday, is as far from the original ``Star Wars'' 
as an iMac is from an Apple II. 
</P>
<P>
	As it must be. A sci-fi epic, after all, is made or broken by  
the way it looks, and the sophisticated eye of the multiplex 
moviegoer would settle for nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
	```Star Wars' broke through the envelope, and every subsequent  
picture has built on that,'' says Paul M. Sammon, author of 
``Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Phantom Menace,'' the effects of the past 20 years of  
moviemaking are evident. Though it riffs off the original trilogy 
in music and plot, the new film is a sweep of images and props and 
tableaux that could barely have been imagined, much less executed, 
in the summer of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-generated star ship dogfights ring far truer than their  
motion-controlled model ancestors. Shadows are everywhere, thanks 
to crack computer graphics and plotting. Tatooine's Sahara-like 
landscape (Tunisia, actually, with visual nods to Cecil B. DeMille) 
is far more textured and layered and gritty than it was in the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
	The other worlds conceived by design director Doug Chiang and  
production designer Gavin Bocquet -- the regal, Ottoman-like capital 
of Naboo and the futuristic urban-sprawl planet of Coruscant, a 
latter-day vision of Fritz Lang's silent classic ``Metropolis'' -- 
are the film's highlight. And the Galactic Senate, a 
mushroom-shaped arena where each planet's representatives glide to 
the center in hovercraft to speak, is an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new footage reminds you how old the old `Star Wars' is,''  
Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia, wrote in Newsweek this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars,'' arriving nine years after Stanley Kubrick's  
groundbreaking but intentionally sterile ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' 
was in many ways the first film that created a spacefaring society 
where items aged and rusted and got dirty. Not so the original 
``Star Trek,'' Gene Roddenberry's utopian vision of space, where 
the USS Enterprise sparkled and dust rarely reared its head, even 
on strange new worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	But here was the Millennium Falcon, a bucket of bolts that  
seemed to reach warp speed with only spit, chewing gum and Han 
Solo's arrogance. Here was the Death Star's garbage chute, replete 
with gooey leachate and a bottom-sucking beastie. And here was 
R2-D2, a dented, scuffed droid that Luke Skywalker bought from a 
Jawa junk heap like an old AMC Pacer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Empire Strikes Back'' (1980) intensified the visual  
richness, concocting an ice-encased rebel base and a bayou-like 
planet that was home to the Jedi master Yoda. ILM was refining its 
techniques, and it showed: Scenes were drenched with color, and the 
battle between Luke and Darth Vader in the gray reactor core of 
Lando Calrissian's otherwise dazzling Cloud City was awash in 
shadow and silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
	``Return of the Jedi'' (1984) added the Ewoks' forest planet and  
Jabba the Hutt's seedy lair. By then, many of the creatures had 
taken on a decidedly Muppet look and some of the Ewok abodes 
resembled parts of Walt Disney World's Adventureland. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first movie, we were on the sand thing, it was all kind  
of a brown color. The second movie, I put it in the snow and it was 
all kind of white, and we did the green, swampy kind of thing. The 
third ... a forest was really the only thing I had left,'' Lucas 
said in a 1995 interview released with the video edition of the 
trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole color and environment motif,'' he said. ``The  
good guys are all earth colors and the bad guys are all 
colorless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the trilogy's innovations, Lucas and ILM were working  
with toddler technology. Their models could simulate reality only 
so far. The storm troopers, and even Darth Vader, seemed polished 
with Lemon Pledge and tended to resemble plastic action figures. 
Same story at times with the Death Star, the Imperial tie fighters 
and the rebel X-wings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked then. It wouldn't work now. It needs more texture,''  
says Stan Bertheaud, an architect and screenwriter at Woodbury 
University in California who studies production design and 
cinematic visions of the future. ``There's just more on the screen 
today. There's more stuff up there happening in the background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film that truly pioneered stuffing ``stuff'' into the  
background came five years after ``Star Wars,'' courtesy of 
director Ridley Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott had already pushed things visually in 1979's  
shadow-drenched ``Alien,'' which featured its own dark, 
steam-belching ship and an oozy, predatory extraterrestrial. In 
1982, even as the otherwise mediocre ``Tron'' was introducing 
computer graphics into production design, Scott changed the look of 
science fiction forever with ``Blade Runner,'' a muddled retelling 
of a Philip K. Dick story. Many consider it the most visually rich 
sci-fi movie ever made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blade Runner'' built a future -- Los Angeles, 2019 -- that used  
today's reference points as its foundation. Familiar brand names 
abounded: Cuisinart, Coca-Cola, even Atari (a not-so-prescient 
move, it turns out). Colored neon was deployed liberally to evoke 
the gaudy look of Tokyo's Ginza strip. Futuristic architecture was 
retrofitted with older building styles to create the layered look 
of a society with a past. 
</P>
<P>
	This was eons ahead of the flat, metallic futures of 1950s  
sci-fi. Sammon calls it ``one of the most compulsively detailed 
motion pictures ever made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Blade Runner upped the ante,'' the author says. ``It presented  
a flood of visual information. And the audience was left to sort 
out the function of these things for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Blade Runner'' paved the way for ``Terminator'' (1984) and  
``Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' (1991). It made possible ``Total 
Recall'' (1990) and the post-apocalyptic Western landscape of ``The 
Postman'' (1997). It inspired Luc Besson's ``The Fifth Element'' 
(1997), which postulated a futuristic, ``Metropolis''-like New York 
City complete with rusted yellow hovercabs, cloud-level skyscrapers 
and a flying Chinese-junk lunch cart that floats up to Bruce 
Willis' apartment window to sell him noodles. 
</P>
<P>
	Concurrently, a darker vision of the modern city was developing  
in the ``Batman'' movies, in which production design was crucial to 
the plot. Batman was a product of Gotham City; it had to be as dark 
and ghoulish as he was. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ``Batman,'' under production designer Anton Furst,  
drew heavily from film noir depictions of the American city between 
1945 and 1959. But it also drew in fantastic, almost cartoonish 
architecture, a mix of Gothic, neoclassical and art deco. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Batman,'' the vertical stone megalopolis pushes down upon  
its citizenry. Steam belches continually; decay is everywhere. With 
``Batman Returns,'' production designer Bo Welch conceived a 
slightly different Gotham, a city of neo-fascist architecture, with 
its cold-stone ``Hall of Records'' and its even colder Gotham 
Square, a soulless reinterpretation of Manhattan's Rockefeller 
Center. And in ``Batman Forever,'' the architecture functions as 
overt monstrosity -- giant globes and structures that are lovingly 
built only to come tumbling down in the urban chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time ``Phantom Menace'' came around, then, the visual  
requirements for a film -- effects, props and scenery -- had evolved. 
Lucas knew that. He didn't want to simply re-create the look of the 
trilogy; he wanted it to be mere foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been saturated with designs from the original `Star  
Wars' look for over 20 years,'' Chiang says. ``So I was really 
pleased when George asked for something new, such as chrome, sleek 
shapes, Art Nouveau and Art Moderne. That's when I realized that 
'Episode I' was going to be something new and not just a reworking 
of the earlier material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiang, who drew on everything from 1950s car designs to African  
art for his vision, describes the age in which ``Phantom Menace'' 
unfolds as ``polished, individualized and refined -- perhaps even 
overly designed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be called a `craftsman's era,''' Chiang says.  
</P>
<P>
	He began creating images in 1994, and Bocquet started work in  
1996. In the end, 250 computer artists worked for two years, and 95 
percent of the frames in ``Phantom Menace'' included digital work -- 
three times as many as any previous movie, according to 20th 
Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a production with the detail and architectural  
impact of ``Batman,'' a layered, more visual, ``Blade Runner''-like 
look and special effects that ILM spent years perfecting on 
non-Lucas films. 
</P>
<P>
	It has droids that roll into battle and uncoil with a  
come-get-me stance; a computer-generated supporting character; the 
streamlined Naboo star ship, with a fluidity inspired by the liquid 
metal of ``Terminator 2''; a double light saber used as a 
martial-arts tool; and tie fighters that seem more predatory than 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the look of ``Phantom Menace.'' Sure, the good guys are  
still vaguely earthen. But the orange-black countenance of Darth 
Maul, who resembles Kiss' Gene Simmons after a particularly long 
gig, is anything but colorless. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the story's good, then that's the main thing,'' Woodbury  
University's Bertheaud says. ``But the film loses credibility with 
an audience if the production design is lacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By drawing from the best of the past 20 years and adding its own  
newer visions, ``Phantom Menace'' far surpasses anything that its 
``Star Wars'' predecessors had to offer. Which, of course, is what 
audiences demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh: And the haircuts are a lot better as well.

<HEADLINE> Single Party To Form Nepal Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- The Nepali Congress Party surged toward a  
parliament majority Thursday in a decisive verdict that could end 
years of messy coalition politics in the Himalayan kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has won 94 of the 167 seats announced so far by the  
election commission, just nine short of an absolute majority in the 
205-member Pratinidhi Sabha, or lower house of parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was leading in at least eight other places where votes  
were still being counted Thursday. Voting was held in two phases, 
on May 3 and on Monday, to allow security forces to better protect 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process to form a new government has now begun. The  
parliamentary party will chose a new leader who will be the prime 
minister,'' Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala told reporters 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Koirala, who is also the president of the Nepali Congress Party,  
said senior party leader Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, will be the new 
prime minister. Bhattarai also won from his constituency in 
southern Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences between Bhattarai and Koirala have been blamed for  
the Congress Party's electoral loss in 1994, and factional rivalry 
has almost split the party many times. This time, however, Koirala 
called a truce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arrangement has been Bhattarai will run the government and  
I will manage the party. I have full faith that the newly elected 
members will back this arrangement,'' Koirala said. 
</P>
<P>
	His party's main rival, the United Marxist Leninist Communist  
Party of Nepal was trailing with 58 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Democratic Party has won seven seats, and the  
National Goodwill Party and the National Janmorcha Party have won 
three seats each so far. The Nepal Workers And Peasants Party won 
one seat and another went to an independent candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	An opinion poll by a local magazine last month put the Nepali  
Congress slightly ahead of other parties but it predicted a hung 
parliament as in the last elections five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The final results will be known later after repolling in nearly  
two dozen constituencies over the weekend, where the election 
commission ordered fresh balloting after election violence killed 
four people and injured 31 others. 
</P>
<P>
	A clear majority for the Nepali Congress would break the  
political deadlock that has doomed Nepal to a succession of 
unstable governments since it became a parliamentary democracy nine 
years ago. Three elections have been held since then.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves $15 Billion Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brushing aside discontented conservatives,  
Congress sent President Clinton a $15 billion package Thursday 
financing the fighting in the Balkans, aid to hurricane victims and 
a stew of projects for lawmakers' home districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate gave the measure final congressional approval by a  
64-36 vote. That ended an erratic, three-month episode in which 
urgent administration requests for funds for Central American 
disasters and the bombardment of Yugoslavia became intertwined with 
the politics of Social Security, tobacco, the environment and other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Clinton said he would sign the legislation  
``as soon as it gets here.'' But in a written statement later, he 
criticized ``unnecessary and ill-advised special projects'' 
lawmakers placed in the bill that he said ``reward special 
interests, weaken environmental protection, and undermine our 
campaign to stop teen smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no way to do the people's business, and I will not  
tolerate this kind of special interest meddling as we complete the 
annual budget process,'' Clinton's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the compromise measure Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans voted for the bill 32-23, with many of the  
most conservative members voting ``no.'' Democrats supported it 
32-13, with opponents citing excessive spending or objectionable 
environmental amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	In a split atop the GOP hierarchy, the measure was supported by  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., but opposed by Sen. Don 
Nickles of Oklahoma, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a leader of 
the chamber's conservatives. Nickles also broke from Lott and 
defected last fall when Congress approved a massive omnibus 
spending bill that conservatives considered too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives lambasted the Kosovo package because it is stuffed  
with local provisions that they said were hardly the emergencies 
the bill proclaims them to be. These included $250,000 to help 
revitalize a downtown Los Angeles neighborhood; $2 million to 
intensify security at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington, D.C.; and increased federal payments to some 
northwestern wheat farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The freight train has stowaways hidden all the way through,''  
said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	They also complained that all but $2 billion of the measure's  
price tag would come from this year's federal surplus, which comes 
completely from Social Security -- money Republicans have pledged to 
leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not use Social Security to pay for a war in the  
Balkans,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders focused on the bill's $12 billion -- twice Clinton's  
request -- for the conflict with Yugoslavia, the Kosovar refugees, 
Balkan countries near the fighting and U.S. forces around the 
globe. They said rejecting the package would hurt American troops 
in combat -- something few lawmakers want to be accused of doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to watch how you vote on this bill, and they  
should,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska, referring to members of the U.S. armed forces. 
``This is not the time for petty differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance of senators to block the package was underscored  
when an effort by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to pay for more of the 
bill by cutting most domestic programs failed, 70-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's Senate debate marked the culmination of a process  
that began in February, when Clinton asked Congress for nearly $1 
billion to help Central American and Caribbean nations recover from 
last fall's two deadly hurricanes, Mitch and Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation providing that aid was passed by the House and  
Senate in March. But it languished until congressional leaders 
decided to use it to rush Clinton defense money and a host of other 
items the measure collected in its sojourn through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, the measure picked up $900 million so the  
government could help victims of this month's killer tornadoes in 
the Midwest and be prepared for other natural disasters yet to 
come. The bill also has $574 million to help American farmers, 
mainly those facing low prices for hogs, wheat and other 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, one of America's Middle East allies, would get $100  
million for its role in helping to arrange the Wye River peace 
accord between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by all 50 governors, Republicans won a provision barring  
the federal government from claiming any of the $246 billion the 
states have won from tobacco companies in a legal settlement. 
Clinton wanted to use some of that money for health care and 
anti-smoking initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeats for the environmental lobby, the measure also has  
language delaying tighter restrictions on mining companies using 
government lands. Higher royalties on oil companies that drill on 
federal property would also be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would allow House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,  
D-Mo., and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, an additional 
$333,000 a year each for office expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens successfully inserted language making reindeer ranchers  
eligible for a $70 million program helping livestock producers. And 
there is $2.3 million for the government to temporarily house in 
Calverton, N.Y., the wreckage of TWA Flight 800, which crashed off 
Long Island in July 1996.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Gun Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Propelled by school violence, the Senate  
slapped fresh restrictions Thursday on firearms sales at gun shows 
and pawnshops. Vice President Al Gore eagerly broke a tie to pass 
the curbs opposed by most Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have seen today is for the first time in a major kind  
of gun control issue, rejection of the National Rifle Association 
and a vote for common sense,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy proclaimed 
moments after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would require background checks for all sales at  
gun shows. It also would close what gun control advocates said was 
a loophole that allows anyone to pawn his gun and reclaim it 
without undergoing a check. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure would restore changes in current gun  
law that majority Republicans had insisted on with an amendment 
passed moments earlier. Among them was a provision that would have 
cut from three days to 24 hours the amount of time allowed for a 
background check. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes came one month to the day after the Colorado high  
school shootings in which two students are alleged to have killed 
12 fellow students, a teacher and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	And only hours before the roll was called in the Senate, there  
was new gunfire at a high school east of Atlanta. Six students were 
injured by another student, who later surrendered to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Democrat Max Cleland, who had voted against similar gun  
controls last week, lined up in favor this time. He said he had 
made up his mind to do so Wednesday night, after Democrats had 
agreed to changes. But he added the day's home state bloodshed 
``really confirmed for me that I was on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The curbs were added to a larger measure designed to crack down  
on juvenile violence -- a bill that contains other gun control 
provisions that Democrats won earlier in a bruising week of debate. 
These include a ban on importation of certain high capacity 
ammunition clips and a requirement for handguns to be sold with 
safety devices or lockboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote was expected quickly. Final passage would send the  
legislation to the House, where Republican and Democratic leaders 
were discussing a plan to bring the gun control issue to the floor 
in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	By themselves, the measures adopted were relatively minor in  
scope. Democrats conceded they had decided not to force votes on 
more sweeping proposals likely to lose, including one to limit an 
individual's purchases to one gun per month. 
</P>
<P>
	But in political terms, the developments were striking, with  
Republicans backpedaling consistently on an issue that has suddenly 
taken on new importance after the Littleton shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA was defiant in defeat. ``It's more  
made-for-television-lawmaking,'' the organization said. ``Now they 
want more gun laws they won't enforce,'' it said of the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was en route to Littleton, Colo., to mark the  
one-month anniversary of the shootings there when the Senate cast 
its vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Gore's turn in the spotlight, and after enduring a  
rocky period in his presidential campaign, he was clearly pleased 
to be there. Twice, after all 100 senators had cast their votes, he 
prodded the Senate clerk to announce the tie. That done, he cast 
his vote in favor of gun controls that enjoy overwhelming 
popularity in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the morning's shootings in Georgia, he said later,  
``We're reminded again that until we get more controls in a 
sensible way on the easy availability of guns in our society to 
children, to criminals, to those who are mentally disturbed, then 
these tragedies will continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the vote, 44 Democrats and six Republicans were in favor.  
There were 49 Republicans and one Democrat, Sen. Max Baucus of 
Montana, opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans who cast their votes in favor were John Chafee  
of Rhode Island, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Mike DeWine and 
George Voinovich of Ohio, Dick Lugar of Indiana and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	A critical vote was supplied by Georgia's Cleland, who noted  
that Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the principal author, had made 
several changes. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Cleland said in a statement after the shootings in  
Conyers, Ga., ``It wasn't just an issue in Littleton, Colo., 
anymore. It was home town people, in my backyard, and I said 
anything I can do I want to do to work on this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on Lautenberg's amendments marked a stinging defeat for  
the GOP leadership, which has presided over several days of 
Republican disarray on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Republicans muscled through an amendment that left  
some background checks voluntary at gun shows. Some GOP lawmakers 
changed their minds overnight, and forced Republicans to bring the 
issue back to the floor for a reversal. But Clinton claimed the 
revised proposal was ``riddled with high-caliber loopholes,'' and 
Democrats pressed for a third vote on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the GOP leadership crafted an amendment that was  
designed to close the loopholes at pawnshops and gun shows yet 
satisfied the numerous Republicans who are not sympathetic to gun 
control. Their aim was to pass their own proposal and hold enough 
wavering Republicans in line to defeat the stronger, Democratic 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	But that strategy failed.  
</P>
<P>
	While the GOP amendment passed, it was wiped out moments later  
on the strength of Gore's tie-breaker.

<HEADLINE> Racing Returns to Site of Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Racing is back at Lowe's Motor Speedway  
this weekend for the first time since three fans were killed at an 
Indy-car race May 1. This time, center stage belongs to Winston Cup 
racing's all-star event. 
</P>
<P>
	A record field of 21 drivers will compete in The Winston on  
Saturday night. Time trials are set for Friday night at the 
1.5-mile, high-banked trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from advance ticket sales, there doesn't appear to be  
lingering fan concern about safety at the track because of an Indy 
Racing League crash that sent debris into the stands, killing three 
spectators and injuring eight. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 tickets for The Winston had been sold by  
Thursday, and the speedway expects the usual gathering of about 
125,000 for the event, which typically draws a strong walk-up 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the speedway's advance-sale tickets were $76 seats in  
the fourth-turn grandstands, where a wheel and suspension parts 
landed during the IRL race after a three-car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	But Winston Cup cars are not built like IRL machines, which are  
designed to shed parts in wrecks to help absorb the impact of 
crashes. Winston Cup cars weigh twice as much and have heavy steel 
roll cages surrounding the drivers to protect them from impacts, 
and the vehicles are far less likely to send wheels and other large 
parts flying after crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see no reason at all for anybody to be concerned about  
sitting in the grandstands for The Winston,'' speedway president 
H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting isn't something that's always popular at The Winston, a  
70-lap affair that generally takes only about 45 minutes to 
complete while featuring the kind of action that keeps fans on 
their feet and cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the drama is that this brisk event offers a purse of  
more than $1.3 million, with the winner guaranteed a minimum of 
$200,000. In addition, because it is a non-points race, NASCAR 
officials tend to turn their heads away and permit the kind of 
aggressive racing that isn't tolerated on the circuit on a weekly 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Winston has produced its share of physical driving, but it  
has created drama in other ways as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Waltrip, a non-winner in his 15-year career on stock car  
racing's premier circuit, earned a spot in the 1996 all-star event 
by winning a qualifying race. He followed that by staging a 
dramatic charge from last to first to win the main event. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to an all-star game in football or basketball,  
those guys don't have to go 100 percent,'' Waltrip said. ``They can 
let their friends shoot or make sure everybody scores. In our 
all-star game, we're still running 200 mph down the straightaway. 
So it gets really serious once we start. In that respect, it's a 
lot like a regular race. But the atmosphere is awesome. Everybody 
is loose and there to enjoy the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race is run in segments of 30, 30 and 10 laps, and Jeff  
Gordon appeared to have the final segment well in hand last year, 
only to run out of gas as he took the white flag. As Gordon's 
silent car coasted helplessly off the pace, Mark Martin powered by 
to win The Winston for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we won that race on the last lap was real exciting,''  
Martin said. ``I guess that was a payback for losing one the same 
way a few years back. Who knows what this year will bring? It's 
always an interesting race, and nobody holds back. I'm anxious to 
get on with it and see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Driver Accused of Hitting Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- A white man accused of intentionally  
running down two black teen-agers on their bicycles had a note in 
his car that referred to inciting racial friction, police records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the 14-year-old victims -- Dontrell Langston and  
Austin Hansen-Tyler -- want the driver, James G. Langenbach, to be 
charged with a hate crime for the incident Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	An officer who took Langenbach's car to a garage found  
handwritten papers with the phrase: ``I'm here to get this 
white/black race B.S. started and it looks like I did,'' according 
to search warrant records released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach, 27, of Kenosha, who has been treated for psychiatric  
problems, failed to attend anger management sessions and did not 
get his high school equivalency test despite a court order, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston was hospitalized in good condition Wednesday, while  
Hansen-Tyler was listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach was charged Monday with causing great bodily harm to  
a child and leaving the scene of an injury accident, each as a 
repeat offender. The charges carry up to 66 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he was sentenced to two years probation for endangering  
safety for ramming his car twice into a van holding five black 
passengers. He was ordered to undergo an alcohol assessment, anger 
management and other counseling.

<HEADLINE>  Indy Speedway Lifts Credential Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Facing the threat of media boycotts at the  
Indy 500, the speedway reinstated credentials for a Sports 
Illustrated writer who had been barred because the magazine ran a 
critical article and photo of fans killed at a race. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban had raised concerns at several newspapers around the  
country. The Chicago Tribune and Sports Illustrated said they 
weren't going to cover the May 30 race, and the Los Angeles Times 
was considering a similar move. 
</P>
<P>
	But speedway president Tony George said Thursday that he had  
decided to allow SI's senior auto writer, Ed Hinton, to cover the 
race because he didn't want to detract from the event itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my hope that I never see him or they never come around,''  
said George, who called Hinton a ``danger to himself and to the 
sport he covers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a communist, but I just feel like something had to be  
done, a statement had to be made,'' George said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated said Hinton would cover the race but was  
upset by George's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad it's been resolved. We wish it hadn't come to  
this,'' SI spokesman Joe Assad said. ``We stand by everything Ed 
has written. He's a valuable writer for the magazine. We trust this 
will be the last of the attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Tribune sports editor Dan McGrath said the newspaper  
would also cover the race now that George had changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a statement because we believed the IRL was practicing  
censorship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indy Racing League officials were upset by SI's coverage of the  
IRL VisionAire 500 in Concord, N.C., on May 1, when three fans were 
killed by debris from a wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine ran an Associated Press photo in its May 10 issue  
that showed two sheet-covered bodies on bloody grandstand steps. 
Hinton wrote in the accompanying article, titled ``Fatal 
Attractions,'' that such accidents could be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway offered to provide credentials for a different SI  
writer, but the magazine declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Mai Lindstrom, an IRL spokeswoman, has said that while some of  
the AP photos were ``very graphic, to our knowledge, SI was the 
only publication that chose to print one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Horton, AP's senior photo editor for sports, said photo  
editors were sensitive to the graphic nature of the photographs and 
took steps to edit them carefully. He said there had been no 
complaints from AP members.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Sign Kosovo-Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he would sign a  
compromise $15 billion bill paying for the assault on Yugoslavia, 
support for victims of Caribbean hurricanes and other items, and 
urged Congress to send it to him quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some unhappiness among Republicans and Democrats alike,  
the Senate began debating the bill and final congressional approval 
was likely today. The House endorsed the legislation on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the White House, Clinton said the measure would rush  
badly needed help to Kosovar refugees and countries bordering on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most important, it will give our military what it needs to see  
its mission through, while maintaining the readiness of our forces 
around the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When GOP senators met privately Wednesday to discuss the  
measure, some complained that all but $2 billion of it would be 
paid for from the federal surplus, participants said. Others were 
upset that most of the claimed savings -- $1.3 billion -- came from 
cutting food stamp funds that would not be spent anyway because the 
healthy economy has reduced dependency on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like'' parts of the bill either, Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters. ``But it probably won't 
get better if it's defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the bill should have cut spending  
more so it would eat away less of the budget surplus, which comes 
from Social Security. He said even though he would probably lose, 
he would use Senate procedures to force supporters to get 60 of the 
100 senators to support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say we want to lock up the money from Social Security'' for  
the pension program, he said of Republicans. ``And then we sit idly 
by and watch it be spent. I'm not going to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very difficult road. A lot of people in  
principle are against the bill, but I believe the bill will pass,'' 
said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest chunk of the package, $12 billion, is for the price  
tag of the U.S. aerial assault on Yugoslavia, aid to Kosovar 
refugees and the Balkan countries, and a general buildup of 
American armed forces worldwide. That is twice the sum Clinton 
originally requested, but the White House has abandoned its early 
insistence that defense spending not directly related to Kosovo 
should be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has $1 billion for a recent spate of hard-hitting  
natural disasters, chiefly last autumn's Hurricane Mitch, which 
pummeled Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Clinton 
originally requested that money in February and Congress approved 
early versions of it in March, but the legislation languished until 
lawmakers used it as a way to speed the military money to passage. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $900 million would replenish the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency's coffers so it can address damage from this 
month's horrific tornadoes in Oklahoma and other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also has $574 million to help American farmers, mainly  
those facing low prices for hogs, wheat and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprinkled throughout the bill are projects large and small that  
lawmakers won for home-state interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens made sure that $70 million in aid for livestock  
producers would include reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and House Majority  
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, each would be entitled to an additional 
$333,000 a year for office expenses. The Senate could spend $10 
million to bring 3,000 Russian political leaders to the United 
States for a month of observing the U.S. government and economy at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains $6.5 million to monitor elections in East  
Timor, which is deciding whether to break free of Indonesia; $2.2 
million for Utah to build sewers for the 2002 Winter Olympics; and 
$1.5 million to add water to drought-stricken San Carlos Lake on an 
Indian reservation in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately on Wednesday, the House Armed Services Committee  
voted to impose new spending restrictions on Clinton's conduct of 
the Yugoslavia operation. Democrats denounced the action as the 
latest in a series of conflicting signals by the Republican-led 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, working on a $288.8 billion defense spending bill for  
the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, endorsed a provision stating 
that none of the funds ``may be used for the conduct of combat or 
peacekeeping operations'' in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., whose attempt to block the  
GOP-sponsored language was defeated, said the provision would be 
interpreted as ``pulling the plug'' on U.S. forces there, but 
committee Republicans insisted they were just trying to reclaim 
congressional powers to make decisions about war. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C., said the measure would  
force Clinton to go to Congress first to request funds in a 
separate piece of legislation if he wants to continue the military 
campaign beyond Sept. 30.

<HEADLINE> Ray Turns Fastest Lap at Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Greg Ray turned the fastest lap of the week  
and Tony Stewart, expected to be his chief rival for the 
Indianapolis 500 pole, hit the wall Thursday in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who left Team Menard at the end of last year and is now  
the hottest rookie in NASCAR's Winston Cup series, had supplanted 
Ray at the top of the speed charts on Wednesday with a lap of 
226.683 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ray, Stewart's replacement on John Menard's team, took the  
challenge Thursday and upped the top speed to 227.192. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels nice to be this consistently quick,'' Ray said. ``We  
regard our competition very highly. We're not taking anything for 
granted. From here, we want to try to go even faster but, above 
all, keep it off the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Stewart, wasn't able to keep his car off the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaking down his primary car, he got too high in turn 3 on the  
2 1/2-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway and bounced twice off the 
concrete wall before stopping on the main straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed about 12 more inches of racetrack,'' Stewart said.  
``Unfortunately, I just ran out of racetrack and hit the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The car was not badly damaged, but Stewart was upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just made a stupid mistake,'' he said. ``I'm disgusted with  
myself. They pay me to drive a race car, and I take these things to 
heart. Thankfully, it wasn't too bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knock on wood, we haven't had an engine problem of any kind  
yet and I've had more fun so far this week, and the most relaxing 
week leading up to qualifying that I've ever had at Indy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robby Unser, last year's top Indy rookie, jumped to fourth  
overall at 225.079. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fast drivers on Thursday included two-time Indianapolis  
champion Arie Luyendyk, retiring following the May 30 race, at 
225.073; Stephan Gregoire at 224.792; 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier 
at 224.361, and defending champion Eddie Cheever Jr. at 224.193. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Unser, Robby's cousin, also crashed in practice Thursday,  
spinning in turn 3 and hitting the wall twice. He also escaped 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Harrington, who also found the wall this week, had a much  
better day on Thursday, thanks to his persistence. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, who drove in a CART race in 1989, finishing 16th at  
Elkhart Lake, Wis., in his debut, didn't make it back to the top 
level of the open-wheel sport until the 1996 Indianapolis 500, 
placing 15th in his first Indy Racing League start. 
</P>
<P>
	His racing has been sporadic enough so that Harrington is the  
leading IRL rookie of the year candidate after finishing 25th in 
the season-opener at Orlando, Fla., and a career-best fifth at 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the story of my career,'' Harrington said. ``Seven  
years between races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even after finally making the show at Indy, the struggle  
continued for Harrington, whose underfinanced team -- currently 
co-owned by Harrington, his father, Gene, and longtime open-wheel 
crew chief and team manager Darrell Soppe -- couldn't find a sponsor 
willing to make a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harrington finally got that commitment Thursday, with  
CertainTeed Roofing Products Group stepping up as sponsor of the 
Harrington Motorsports Dallara-Infiniti for the Indy 500 and the 
rest of the IRL season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their involvement with our program is the answer to our  
prayers,'' said Harrington, who left the news conference, got into 
uniform and happily began running practice laps. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran 42 laps with a top speed of 216.320. That was just shy of  
his top lap of 218.330, run Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But everything hasn't been wonderful for Harrington this week.  
He tore up one car Monday in a crash in turn 3, walking away with 
only a bruised left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the latest in a series of crashes at Indy.  
</P>
<P>
	He got through rookie orientation in 1989 without crashing, but  
didn't make the race. In 1996, Harrington passed his refresher test 
two days before final time trials and promptly hit the wall in 
practice, bruising his left foot and shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	He came back to make the field with 23 minutes left on the final  
day of qualifying, but crashed in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no money and no Indy effort in 1997, but he came back  
last year and nearly made the field in a last-ditch effort in one 
of A.J. Foyt's backup cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't going too fast and A.J. made a lot of changes to  
the car before we went out for that qualifying run,'' Harrington 
said. ``We needed a 210 to make it and, when I came by after the 
first lap, the pit board said 210. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it was 214, but I didn't know that, so I stayed in  
the gas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he drove that second of four qualifying laps, his engine blew  
and Harrington slid hard into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it as far as turn 2 and woke up in Methodist  
Hospital,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concussions and bruises don't stop race drivers, but Harrington  
has developed a healthy respect for Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place is different than any other track,'' he said.  
``It's more mental than any other track we run on. The turns are so 
long and the straightaways so fast, you have a lot of time to 
think. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, if you get even 6 inches off here, that can be 6 feet off  
in a quarter-mile. It's very easy to get frustrated. You can't let 
that happen. You can't lose concentration for a moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifications to determine the 33-car lineup are set for  
Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> New Law for Ships Entering U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beginning July 1, all ships entering the  
United States will have to tell the government what they have done 
on the high seas to protect fragile American waterways from 
invading species. 
</P>
<P>
	The interim regulation, published today by the Coast Guard, puts  
into action a 1996 law extending to all ports measures so far in 
effect only on the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The law asks big ocean vessels to empty their ballast tanks at  
sea and replace the local liquid with sea water, in theory washing 
out bacteria, plants and animals that otherwise would end up in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign creatures such as the sea lamprey and zebra mussel had  
no natural enemies in the Great Lakes and became such a problem 
that a law was passed in 1990 to first ask, and later require, the 
ballast swaps. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulation requires officers of ships that have been  
outside U.S. waters to fill out forms stating what they did with 
their ballast water. The Coast Guard will monitor those reports and 
determine whether the ballast moves were adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Coast Guard issued voluntary guidelines asking  
tankers, container ships and other vessels to make ballast-water 
swaps in mid-ocean, no matter where their ports of call. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems caused by non-native plants and animals have become  
increasingly visible around the country, with ballast-water dumps 
frequently identified as a prime culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	James Baker, administrator of the National Oceanic and  
Atmospheric Administration, estimated earlier this year that 40,000 
gallons of foreign ballast water is dumped into U.S. harbors every 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how the zebra mussel made it into the Great Lakes,  
hitchhiking in the ballast water of a ship that originated in 
either the Caspian Sea or Black Sea, the animal's natural habitat.

<HEADLINE>  A Loud Pop, Then Chaos -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The bell for the first class of the day was  
still 20 minutes away, leaving plenty of time for students at 
Heritage High School to mill about the common area next to the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Some nibbled on cinnamon rolls and sipped juice or milk while  
others just conversed with friends. For seniors, it was a time to 
revel in their last full day of school before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were looking forward to getting their yearbooks signed and  
were braced for senior pranks. The previous day, jokesters let 
loose a large bag of crickets, and firecrackers had become almost 
an annual tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Then suddenly, the chatter and laughter was interrupted by a  
loud popping sound. A 15-year-old sophomore wielding a .22-caliber 
rifle was standing in front of the girls' bathroom in the common 
area firing at his schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting in the common area when I heard something that  
sounded like fireworks. I turned around and saw him and I just ran 
out of the school and across the street to my friend's house,'' 
said Brittanie Berry, 15. ``I saw everybody yelling and running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, 15, was a friend of the gunman.  
</P>
<P>
	``I yelled to him, `Hey, what're you doing?' But he just kept  
shooting. And then the kid next to me got shot in the foot. Then I 
started to run,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students took cover under benches and behind planters while  
others raced outside the one-story red brick building into the 
parking lot of the 1,300-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody started throwing their book bags down and trying to  
get out, running as fast as they could,'' said Lee Merritt, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and administrators in other parts of the building  
ushered students into classrooms, telling them to lock the doors. 
At least one teacher took her students into a closet, where she 
recited Bible verses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were screaming at us over the intercom to get to our  
homerooms as fast as we could,'' said Jessie McCumber, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	After wounding six students, the gunman dropped the rifle and  
fled outdoors. He dropped to his knees, pulled out a .22-caliber 
revolver and stuck it in his mouth. But before he could shoot, an 
assistant principal talked him into dropping the weapon. The 
suspect broke down sobbing and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, cafeteria worker Teresa Kumar was preparing lunch and  
had walked into the cooler to get fruits and vegetables. When she 
emerged, everybody was gone and there were plates of grits, 
biscuits, and bowls of cereal left sitting on the tables. In the 
common area, she saw a wounded girl lying on the floor bleeding and 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was hollering she wanted her mother and she was hollering  
that she was shot,'' Ms. Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, small groups of students stood outside waiting for rides  
home and trading versions of how the event unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just crazy and chaos,'' said Alaina Mitchell, 16,  
hugging her brother, who had come to school to pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
	When the news first carried reports of the shooting, Janice Pugh  
waited at home for a while, hoping for a phone call from her only 
child, William. Finally she decided she couldn't wait any longer, 
so she went to Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Her voice cracking and her eyes red, she kept one arm wrapped  
around William while her other hand gripped a balled-up tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not knowing what exactly had happened, not knowing what I  
would find, I just prayed that he would be all right,'' she said. 
``I'm just happy that he's OK and I pray for the others.''

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Charged in Copper Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators charged Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.  
on Thursday with allegedly helping a commodities firm manipulate 
the world copper market. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that Merrill  
Lynch worked with New York-based Global Minerals and Metals Corp. 
and Japan's Sumitomo Corp. to artificially force prices higher in 
late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Aronow, the enforcement director for the CFTC, said  
Thursday's action capped a three-year investigation of ``one of the 
most serious worldwide manipulations'' of a commodity in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch denied the allegations and said it will defend  
itself. An attorney for Global Minerals also denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street firm said it fully cooperated with the CFTC's  
investigation and was ``extremely disappointed'' that the agency 
decided to proceed with charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC also announced charges against the commodities firm,  
Global Minerals and Metals Corp., its president and chief executive 
officer and its chief copper trader. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Haveles, an attorney for New York-based Global Minerals,  
and Global Minerals' president and CEO, R. David Campbell of New 
York City, said the CFTC's complaint was ``based on an 
Alice-in-Wonderland view of the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Haveles said the company's trading activities  
occurred in a market with a big copper deficit due to a dramatic 
increase in demand in the mid-1990s, which would have pushed up the 
metal's price. He also said British commodities regulators were 
``fully informed'' about Global Minerals' activities at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is confident the complaint will be judged to be  
baseless, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stems from a scandal that rocked the world copper  
market in 1996, based on trades that occurred as much as 10 years 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuo Hamanaka, a former Sumitomo star trader who has been  
convicted of fraud and forgery by a Japanese court, caused $2.6 
billion in losses in unauthorized copper trading over a decade 
after cornering as much as 5 percent of the market. When the losses 
were exposed in 1996, copper prices plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders have said Hamanaka's activities kept the price of copper  
high on the New York and London futures markets in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move a year ago, Sumitomo agreed to pay $150  
million to settle the CFTC's charges that it manipulated the world 
copper market. The big Japanese trading house, which also agreed to 
pay $8 million to British regulators, neither admitted to nor 
denied wrongdoing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC alleged that Merrill ``knowingly and intentionally  
aided, abetted and assisted'' the manipulation scheme by providing 
substantial credit and financing that Global Minerals and Sumitomo 
used to corner warehouse stocks of copper. The regulators also 
accused Merrill of intentionally advising Global Minerals and 
Sumitomo on how they could best corner the market. They alleged 
that Merrill benefitted from the scheme in its own copper trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, Merrill said it had no knowledge that  
Sumitomo's conduct was unlawful and had no intention of aiding any 
improper activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business transactions that occurred more than three years  
ago between Merrill Lynch and Sumitomo, including copper trading 
..., were conducted in a commercially reasonable fashion and were 
fully visible to the regulators at the time,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Merrill spokesman said the company similarly had no knowledge  
of unlawful conduct by Global Minerals and had made reasonable 
transactions with the commodities firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named in the CFTC complaint was Global Minerals' chief  
copper trader, Carl Alm, of Massapequa, N.Y. His attorney, David 
Frankel, didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC filed a civil complaint against the companies and  
individuals, asking for a hearing before an administrative law 
judge at the agency to determine if the charges are true and what 
penalties may be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible penalties include an order requiring the companies and  
individuals to refrain from future violations of federal 
commodities laws and civil fines and restitution of damages, the 
agency said.

<HEADLINE> France Offers Four Films at Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- Intellectuals may love them, but danger  
lurks at the box office for the long-winded abstractions being 
presented by French directors at Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
	The four films in competition pretty much sum up the state of  
cinema in France, where generous state subsidies encourage 
producers to worry less about attracting a large audience and 
guarantee near-complete freedom for directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be a danger in our system because it allows  
directors to be indulgent,'' says Michel Ciment, editor of the 
French film monthly Positif. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildly different in tone and style, the French entries at Cannes  
share slender plots that fail to sustain running times of well over 
two hours. Many also have shocking sex scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pola X,'' a somber, unsettling tale of incest starring  
Catherine Deneuve and Guillaume Depardieu, son of the famous actor 
Gerard, was enfant terrible Leos Carax's first feature film since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong visuals, this adaptation of Herman Melville's  
``Pierre, or the Ambiguities,'' racked up almost unanimously bad 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran Chilean director Raoul Ruiz, who adapted Marcel Proust's  
classic, ``Time Regained,'' fared a bit better. 
</P>
<P>
	The plodding costume drama with an all-star cast of Deneuve,  
Emmanuelle Beart, Chiara Mastroianni, Arielle Dombasle and John 
Malkovich managed to convey a hint of Proust's analytical lyricism. 
But it was long and boring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno Dumont's skillful but snail-paced ``Humanity,'' about a  
hapless small-town cop investigating a sordid murder, is an 
intellectually ambitious take on sexual obsession and guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	But the meticulous attention to detail -- including an  
excruciatingly long close-up of the genitalia of a murdered 
11-year-old girl -- left some viewers with a feeling of physical 
revulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the camera zooms in on Domino, a fleshy factory worker  
lying naked and spread-eagled. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the black-tie crowd bolted from the official screening,  
but French critics deemed ``Humanity'' prize-worthy and praised 
Dumont for defending the colors of French cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	``Humanity isn't a great film, but there's a great film if you  
lopped off 30 minutes,'' Ciment said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no wonder French audiences have turned their backs on  
homegrown films in favor of big Hollywood productions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to National Cinema Center statistics released this  
week, French films in 1998 made up 27 percent of national 
box-office receipts -- the lowest ever. Hollywood's market share was 
a record 64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm all for the intellectual films that please Cannes juries,  
but I think a film can be edifying and entertaining at the same 
time,'' said Jack Valenti, President of the Motion Picture 
Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Maillot's ``Our Happy Lives,'' the fourth French entry,  
isn't exactly entertaining, but this plunge into the troubled lives 
of six dysfunctional young adults has its fun moments. 
</P>
<P>
	The acting is superb, but some say it uses heavy-handed cliches  
that oversimplify the complexity of contemporary France.

<HEADLINE>  Tribe Is Hitting on All Cylinders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- While in Chicago, several Cleveland Indians  
attended a taping of the ``Jerry Springer Show.'' It was the only 
time in three days they were outhit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland did more than just sweep three games from the White  
Sox. Baseball's top hitting club thoroughly dismantled Chicago's 
young pitching staff, scoring 13 runs in each game to extend an 
offensive assault on AL pitchers this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Indians came into Comiskey Park, the White Sox led  
the AL with a 3.86 ERA. Three games, 39 runs and 48 hits later, 
Chicago's ERA had swelled to 4.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, Cleveland's lineup is scarier than Darth Maul.  
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are out of control,'' said Charles Nagy, the latest  
Indians pitcher to benefit from Cleveland's offensive firepower. 
``All you can do is sit back and watch them hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And hit, and hit. Since opening day, the Indians have swung  
right through some shaky starting pitching, suspensions and 
injuries. They're batting .310 as a team, scoring runs at a record 
pace and showing no signs of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at their numbers,'' White Sox pitcher Jim Parque said  
after getting rocked Wednesday. ``Everyone is batting above .300. 
The ones who aren't are hitting .299.9.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite, but Parque isn't far off. The Indians are at the top  
of nearly every team offensive category in the AL. They also are 
well represented among the individual leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering Thursday's games, Roberto Alomar, Kenny Lofton and  
Manny Ramirez ranked 1-2-3 in runs scored, while Ramirez led the 
majors in RBIs and was tied for the AL lead in hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians are averaging 7.4 runs per game -- 8.6 per game in  
May -- and have scored 10 runs or more in a game 10 times. Since a 
20-11 win over Tampa Bay May 7 when they scored 18 runs in their 
final three at-bats, the Indians have scored 10 runs or more in 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not just how many runs the Indians are scoring, it's  
how quickly. The Indians outscored the White Sox 19-7 in the first 
two innings of the series with Chicago getting six of those runs in 
the first inning of the opener only to lose 13-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to ride this thing as long as we can,'' said  
David Justice, batting .440 with seven homers and 25 RBIs in his 
last 12 games. ``It's a very humbling game. There will be times 
when we don't score like this, but right now we're riding it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bit of bad news did emerge from the 5-1 road trip to Detroit  
and Chicago. Catcher Sandy Alomar will undergo arthroscopic surgery 
to repair two bone chips in his left knee Friday, and will miss 
4-to-5 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar's absence will place the burden of handling the Indians'  
staff on rookie Einar Diaz, who will be backed up by recently 
promoted Chris Turner. Cleveland also has veteran Pat Borders at 
Triple-A Buffalo if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Of concern to the rest of the AL is this fact: Cleveland's  
starting pitching appears to be straightening out. Dwight Gooden's 
seven scoreless innings Tuesday night were followed by eight strong 
innings from Nagy on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Cleveland's starters have only one complete game and a  
combined 5.13 ERA, a stat which gets glossed over by a lineup that 
has scored at least five runs in 17 of its last 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every morning I wake up and say, `Thank God I'm on this team,'  
'' Nagy said.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Looks To Boost Women's Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Women's sports got a big boost from Salt  
Lake Olympic organizers Thursday, moving into a near-dead heat with 
men when it comes to the schedule for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a proposal by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
two-woman bobsled, skeleton and cross-country ski sprints would be 
added to the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney said he was confident the plan would  
be approved by the boards of both his panel and the International 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The additions, long in the pipeline, would push the number of  
events to 75 -- seven more than in the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano -- 
and cost the cash-strapped organizers another $650,000, according 
to Cathy Priestner-Allinger, SLOC's sports director. 
</P>
<P>
	But Romney, struggling to get the Salt Lake Games in shape after  
the devastating bribery scandal, said it was a small price to pay 
for the chance to make the sports schedule more equitable for women 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be very hard for me to explain to my daughter  
why we have men's bobsled and not women's bobsled,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also left competitors beaming.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is truly exciting,'' said Lincoln DeWitt, a skeleton racer  
from Park City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Jen Davidson, a braker on the U.S. women's bobsled team from  
Layton, Utah, said she had started the sport ``100-percent based on 
hopes that it would be an Olympic sport someday.'' Thursday's 
announcement made that decision pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	The skeleton -- a headfirst plunge on a small sled down an ice  
chute at 70 mph -- and cross-country sprints will have both men's 
and women's fields. So the additions, if approved, would leave the 
Salt Lake schedule almost evenly split by gender -- 39 men's events, 
34 women's. Only ski jumping and Nordic combined would remain 
men-only. Pairs figure skating and ice dancing complete the slate. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of four days of meetings with the IOC's coordination  
commission for the games, Romney also announced that figure skating 
would stay in the Delta Center, the city's biggest arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns had been raised about obstructed seats and spectators  
being too far off the ice, issues raised at the World Figure 
Skating Championships here last February. 
</P>
<P>
	But Romney and Frazier Bullock, SLOC's chief operating officer,  
said jumbo TV screens would allow those in the obstructed-view 
seats to see all the action. Those seats might be sold at cut-rate 
prices, Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, seats would be installed between the  
boards around the ice and the first row of permanent stands. 
Skaters at the world championships said they often could not see 
the fans, which interrupted their rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena holds more than 16,000 fans for Utah Jazz games, but  
officials have put the Olympic capacity at 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on figure skating means short-track speedskating  
also will stay at the Delta Center, while the E Center, an 
8,500-seat arena west of downtown, will remain the main venue for 
men's ice hockey. That tournament might again include top players 
from the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, the Olympic officials said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC had agreed to change its home for the games, from a  
swanky new hotel tower under construction to an older, smaller but 
still first-class one across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the IOC commission chairman, said the new tower  
``contained too many suites and thus would have been too 
expensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC would maintain its practice of double rooms, a  
move Romney said virtually guaranteed that SLOC would not be stuck 
with a portion of the hotel bill. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SLOC had been given permission to solicit information  
technology sponsorships, an area Romney had called the single 
biggest potential source of new income for a committee looking to 
fill a $300 million budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney and Hodler said splitting the sponsorship funds would be  
done on a case-by-case basis. But Romney said the IOC would lead on 
finding a computer hardware sponsor, a deal probably worth $50 
million, while SLOC would focus on an Internet partner, a package 
probably worth $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Olympic organizers were not trying to change Utah's strict  
liquor laws to make it easier for visitors to the games to drink. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not asked for any changes in the laws, and are not  
lobbying for any changes in the laws,'' Romney said. ``We'll just 
look and see how the laws apply to each situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Wednesday that it had asked SLOC to try to make it  
easier for reporters to buy alcohol in the main press center, where 
it felt there might be a culture clash between Utah's laws and 
foreigners used to more liberal drinking rules. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC was concerned about the possible impact of heavy  
snowfall on the games, especially on Interstate 80 between Salt 
Lake and Park City, where many ski events will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler even said he hoped that most of the snow on the slopes  
would be machine made, because it holds up longer than natural 
snow. That took Romney by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the greatest snow on earth,'' he told Hodler. ``Does  
this mean we have to adjust our prayers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first visit by IOC leaders since the bribery  
scandal broke last November, and all sides said they were moving 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are focusing on the games and the athletes of the world,''  
Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said the IOC had full faith in Romney's administration,  
and that it's goal ``is to make sure these great facilities 
produce, in our president's pet remark, the greatest Winter Games 
ever.''

<HEADLINE>  Cyclone Batters Southern Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KETI BANDER, Pakistan (AP) -- A cyclone battered fishing villages  
on Pakistan's southern coast Thursday, whipping the region with 170 
mph winds and causing tidal waves that deluged thousands of homes. 
Hundreds of people were reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too early to tell whether the missing had sought shelter  
elsewhere or had drowned, emergency workers said. Many were 
presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	As residents slept at 4 a.m. local time Thursday, the cyclone  
tore into the Arabian Sea coast near Gharo, 25 miles east of 
Karachi, causing a swath of damage from Gharo about 50 miles east 
toward the Indian border. 
</P>
<P>
	In Keti Bander, a fishing village 25 miles southeast of Gharo  
where many mud homes were pulverized, residents clung to each other 
amid a mess of debris and water. 
</P>
<P>
	Some sat knee-deep in mud where their homes once stood,  
seemingly unable to move. Others gathered their belongings and 
slogged through the waste to reach higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Sadiq struggled with his two children and wife to reach  
dry land. ``We lost everything,'' he said. ``I don't know what we 
can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of nearby undamaged villages arrived with rice and  
bread to feed the victims. But floodwaters and fierce rains kept 
people away from the hardest-hit areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Local residents said at least 100 fishermen on their boats when  
the cyclone struck were missing and presumed drowned. Government 
officials, who have been unable to reach many of the hardest-hit 
areas, estimate the missing at about 700, many presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact death toll will not be known until rescue workers  
reach the worst-hit areas, which are still underwater, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lashing rain and strong wind prevented the deputy commissioner  
of Thatta region, where the brunt of the damage was caused, from 
reaching the areas that were most severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can get near there,'' said Dr. Mumtaz Uqali, who was  
interviewed on telephone from Thatta, 50 miles from Karachi. 
``There are constant warnings on the radio telling people to 
evacuate the area ... but it's too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One resident of Gharo, Ahmed Baksh, said the devastation was  
horrific. Hundreds of villages have disappeared, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are gone ... we don't know where they are,'' Baksh  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many villagers along the coast lived in homes built with  
thatched roofs and other flimsy materials. Few buildings in the 
area that were made of concrete, Baksh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications with much of the area has been completely cut  
off, and telephone lines were down, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's largest city, Karachi, experienced high winds, but  
the brunt of the cyclone was felt farther east, toward neighboring 
India, said Akhtar Qayyum Saddiqi, director of the Institute of 
Meteorology and Geophysics.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs' Stottlemyre on the Shelf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks put right-hander Todd  
Stottlemyre on the 15-day disabled list Thursday and recalled 
left-hander Brian Anderson from Triple-A Tucson to replace him in 
the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre will be out four to six weeks while a tear in the  
rotator cuff of his pitching shoulder heals. The injury was 
diagnosed after an MRI Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will start in Stottlemyre's place Friday night in  
Colorado -- the second game of a four-game series with the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury became apparent Monday while Stottlemyre was pitching  
against the Giants in San Francisco. He lasted four innings, not 
enough to get the win in a 12-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Team orthopedist David Zeman said a first MRI administered  
Wednesday was inconclusive and ordered another one, which found a 
partial tear in the cluster of muscle in Stottlemyre's shoulder.

<HEADLINE>  Gunman Wounds Six in High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A boy upset over a broken romance shot and  
wounded six students Thursday in yet another school attack in a 
comfortable suburban community, then fell to his knees, stuck a gun 
in his mouth and surrendered in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, my God, I'm so scared,'' he said, according to witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	Exactly a month after the bloodbath in Colorado, the 15-year-old  
sophomore, armed with two guns, opened fire with a rifle about 7:55 
a.m., 20 minutes before classes were to begin at Heritage High 
School. It was the final day of class for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the gunman was running and shooting at no one in  
particular and firing at students below the waist so as not to kill 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were falling on the floor, a lot of screaming, people  
trying to help each other,'' said Joel Thomas, 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in the common area and cafeteria dived for cover under  
benches and behind planters. Others raced outside the long 
one-story red brick building into the parking lot and an area of 
tall pines. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not identify the suspect or suggest a motive. He  
was charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, and prosecutors 
also were considering charging him with weapons violations and 
cruelty to children, District Attorney Richard Read said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman must go before a juvenile court judge before he can  
be charged as an adult, and that probably won't take place until 
Monday, Read said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the victims' wounds were considered life-threatening.  
The girlfriend who had broken up with the gunman was not among the 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage, 20 miles east of Atlanta, is a mostly white, suburban  
school, like Columbine High in Littleton, Colo. About 80 percent of 
graduates go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Columbine High rampage, which left 15 people dead,  
Heritage officials had sent letters to parents of the 1,300 
students to assure them that a similar attack was unlikely at their 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day since then I've been thinking about whether it could  
happen here,'' said Chris Scroggs, 15. ``Last night I was thinking 
that this might be the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the massacre in Colorado, Heritage had video  
surveillance cameras in the hallways and an armed sheriff's deputy 
on duty during school hours. The deputy didn't exchange fire with 
the gunman Thursday, and it was unclear where he was during the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was about to leave for Littleton when he  
received word of the Georgia shooting. The news ``is deeply 
troubling to me, as it is to all Americans,'' he said. ``We thank 
God that the injuries to the students do not seem to be 
life-threatening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After wounding six students, the gunman dropped the rifle and  
walked outside. He pulled out a .22-caliber pistol and pointed it 
through a window at senior Joe Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stood there with the gun, then he dropped to his knees and  
put it in his mouth like he was going to shoot himself and he 
started waving his hands around and pulling the back of his hair,'' 
Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then assistant principal Cecil Brinkley came over. ``He said,  
`Let me have the gun,' and the boy flipped the gun over and handed 
it to him,'' Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And when he got the gun from him, he just quickly put his arm  
around him and held him and the boy started crying and said: `Oh my 
God. I'm so scared. I'm so scared.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley would not comment other than to say: ``I was just doing  
my job. I did what needed to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the wounded students were expected to be hospitalized  
overnight. The most seriously hurt was a 15-year-old girl who 
underwent surgery after a bullet hit her in the buttocks and passed 
through to her intestines. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, a 15-year-old sophomore, said the gunman's  
girlfriend of one year had broken up with him this week. He talked 
to the boy about the breakup on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I have no reason to live anymore.''' Deeter said.  
``And I told him he was crazy. I thought he was just feeling sorry 
for himself because a lot of kids feel like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dunn, a sophomore, said he had seen ``lots of guns'' at  
the teen-ager's home but never heard him mention plans to shoot 
anyone at school. 
</P>
<P>
	But Katie Bir, a freshman and a friend of the gunman's  
ex-girlfriend, said: ``People have been saying he's been wanting to 
do this all year long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deeter said he chatted with the gunman about 10 minutes before  
the shooting started. The gunman was wearing a baggy pullover and 
loose pants, and Deeter didn't see any weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	During the shooting, Deeter said, his eyes locked with the  
gunman's for a moment. ``He had a chance to shoot me when I was in 
the commons area and he shot the kid next to me in the foot,'' 
Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it was the last day for seniors, many students at first  
thought the loud popping sounds were part of a prank. A day 
earlier, a student had released 2,000 crickets in the school. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, students gathered outside the school on a  
track, then boarded buses and headed home. Classes were canceled 
for Friday, but school officials said graduation would go on as 
scheduled May 28.

<P>
	After the shooting, students gathered outside the school on a  
track, then boarded buses and headed home. Classes were canceled 
for Friday, but school officials said graduation would go on as 
scheduled May 28.

<HEADLINE> Healtheon Buys WebMD for $9.86B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors overwhelmingly supported Healtheon  
Corp.'s planned acquisition of Internet health care information 
company WebMD Inc., pushing shares of Healtheon up 25 percent 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At its current value of $9.86 billion, the purchase ranks among  
the largest Internet industry deals in history, rivaling America 
Online Inc.'s $10.2 billion purchase of Netscape Communications 
Corp. earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-stock transaction will create a powerful Internet  
company offering health care services and information for 
consumers, doctors, insurers and drug makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal made huge sums for early investors and left bystanders  
scratching their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the market overvaluing the acquisition?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone can answer that,'' said James Clark,  
co-founder of Healtheon, and one of the original founders of 
Netscape. ``Typically markets are very efficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than $1.2 trillion is spent every year on health care in  
the United States, and Clark estimates $250 billion is wasted in 
duplicative and paper-based processes. 
</P>
<P>
	Healtheon/WebMD, as the new firm will be called, aims to break  
into the industry by offering doctors the ability to order 
supplies, prescriptions, check lab results, verify insurance 
coverage. The company also will offer continuing education and 
certification services. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 consumers, on the other hand, currently log on  
to the WebMD site to access information on prevention and diseases, 
and get physician referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger is about leadership and this merger is about  
winning,'' said Jeff Arnold, the 29-year-old chief executive of 
WebMD, who will keep his title at the combined venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the promise of riches, both companies have yet to make a  
dime of profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Healtheon went public in February at $8 a share. Thursday, its  
shares closed up $20.37 1/2 at $100.62 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
All this for a company that was $54 million in the red last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, WebMD lost $7.8 million on sales of $75,000 for the  
first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Healtheon will issue 1.815 of its shares, worth $182.63  
Thursday, for each of the privately held WebMD's 54 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Healtheon's ``current valuation for the stock basically gives  
them a remarkable advantage, which is they have virtually free 
money to buy other businesses,'' said Linda R. Killian, a 
co-manager for the Renaissance Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its big stock price, Healtheon/WebMD also has  
big-name backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Signaling not only the importance of the deal, but also the  
potential profits seen in Web-based health care services, Microsoft 
Corp. will invest $250 million in the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, the world's largest software company, will pay $150  
million to help cover the $29.95 monthly fee for 11,000 physicians, 
allowing them to subscribe free to the service. Microsoft also will 
pay at least $100 million to help Healtheon/WebMD get advertising 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Healtheon/WebMD, in exchange, will use Microsoft's technology  
extensively. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont will spend $180 million to pay for physician fees and $40  
million to generate advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group of technology leaders, including Intel Corp.,  
Excite Inc. and Softbank, also will invest a combined $110 million 
to forge strategic operating agreements with WebMD. 
</P>
<P>
	``The depth and breadth of our partnerships simply cannot be  
equaled by any of our competitors,'' Arnold said. ``With this 
merger we are the clear leader in Internet health care services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Healtheon/WebMD will have about 1,300 employees, a headquarters  
in Atlanta and a technology headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will each control 50 percent of the new firm.  
Each company will have four representatives on the new board of 
directors and Microsoft will have one. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third Internet health care deal this week.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, CVS Corp., the nation's second-largest pharmacy  
chain, said it would buy Soma.com, and online drug retailer, for 
$30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, Synetic Inc., a competitor to Healtheon, agreed to pay  
$1.3 billion in stock for Medical Manager Corp., the largest maker 
of software for physician practices.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Continue Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybeans futures prices continued  
their downward spiral Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as favorable 
growing weather boosted prospects for bumper production. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures were pressured by favorable growing and planting  
conditions across the Midwest, while prices found some support from 
strong weekly export figures reported by the U.S. Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
        The government reported sales of 742,900 metric tons, a figure  
below previous weeks' sales but still above expectations. Corn sales 
now are 30 percent higher than this time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures fell amid mediocre export numbers and continued  
reports of above-average yields in winter wheat growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans were pressured by expectations farmers will complete  
plantings in the next week amid generally favorable weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for July delivery fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.56 1/4 a bushel;  
July corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.19 a bushel; July oats fell 1/2 cent 
to $1.21 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $4.68 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
lean hogs were mixed and pork bellies retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        June live cattle rose .20 cent to 62.87 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .70 cent to 74.62 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .43 cent to 56.50 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .40 cent 
to 54.05 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> David Duke Questioned About Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke on  
Thursday was called before a grand jury investigating a $150,000 
payment he received from Gov. Mike Foster during the 1995 
gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men say the payment was for a list of Duke supporters and  
they have done nothing wrong. But the high price for the list has 
raised questions about whether the money was actually for something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have suggested the money was a payoff to keep Duke out of  
the race, which Foster won. When asked about it, Duke responded: 
``Ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I already had decided to get out of the race'' before the list  
was sold, Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster also denied it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I didn't pay him to stay out of the race,'' said  
Foster, who said he had not been summoned before the grand jury but 
would cooperate with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke decided not to run in the 1995 governor's campaign,  
surprising many observers who thought he might try to capitalize on 
his strong support in the predominantly white New Orleans suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the grand jury Thursday, Duke exercised his Fifth Amendment  
right against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions. 
He contends the investigation is a smear effort on Foster 
orchestrated by U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan on behalf of Congressman 
William Jefferson, who is running against Foster for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Jordan and Jefferson are black and worked in the same law  
firm at different times. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan refused comment, citing grand jury secrecy laws.  
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson said he had never talked with Jordan about the case  
and called on Foster and Duke to produce ``some straight talk'' 
about the payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling mailing lists is common during political campaigns.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke said a similar list was sold to state Rep. Woody Jenkins  
for $82,500 during Jenkins' unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 
1996. Jenkins said the payment included money for computer 
equipment that maintained the list and automatically dialed names 
on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Ryder, the governor's deputy chief of staff, said Foster  
bought the list with his personal money and never used it in the 
campaign so it was never reported on campaign finance forms. Ryder 
said $100,000 was for exclusive use of the list and another $50,000 
to renew the exclusive use. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke said he did not personally sell the lists but went through  
a broker, Impact Mail Inc., of Metairie. Duke said he believed the 
company received a 10 percent commission. Duke said he did not own 
any part of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has not been given immunity and he has not been labeled a  
target of the investigation, said his attorney, James McPherson. 
However, McPherson advised Duke not to answer questions on grounds 
of self-incrimination, saying Duke had nothing to gain by 
testifying.

<HEADLINE> Hacker Case Against Analyst Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors have dropped charges against a fired  
analyst for the Morgan Stanley brokerage firm, saying the company 
may have paid a witness $10,000 to help set him up on a forgery 
rap. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against Christian Curry, 24, were dismissed Tuesday.  
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the witness are now under 
investigation, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we're concerned, the case against Christian Curry is  
over,'' said Daniel Castleman, the chief investigator for the 
Manhattan district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The odd case began in April 1998 when Curry was fired from his  
entry level job as an investment analyst. The company said he was 
dismissed for abusing his expense account. But Curry claimed he was 
fired because he is black and because they thought he was gay after 
explicit photographs taken of him while he was in college were 
published in a gay magazine without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Curry's attorneys, Benedict Morelli, said Curry is not  
gay. Morelli filed a grievance challenging Curry's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	While awaiting the company's response to the grievance, Morelli  
said, Curry talked to a college acquaintance about planting phony 
e-mail in the company computer system to bolster his claim that 
Morgan Stanley was racist and homophobic. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquaintance, C. Joseph Luethke, reported their talks first  
to Morgan Stanley officials, then to police, who sent in an 
undercover detective posing as a computer hacker. Morelli 
acknowledged that Curry offered the undercover detective $200 to 
plant the phony e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was arrested in August and charged with forgery, coercion  
and tampering with physical evidence, but the district attorney's 
office said it has since learned that the company paid Luethke. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, within days of the defendant's arrest, officials at  
Morgan Stanley wired a $10,000 payment into an account designated 
by the confidential informant,'' said Leroy Frazer, an assistant 
district attorney, at a court hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morgan Stanley officials withheld from this office information  
regarding the facts and circumstances of this payment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley officials wouldn't comment Tuesday and did not  
immediately return calls today. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry's attorney said he was considering a lawsuit against  
Morgan Stanley, accusing the firm of libel, conspiracy and 
violating Curry's human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry is now working as a model in Beverly Hills, Calif. He  
referred all questions to his attorneys.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks edged slightly higher Friday, with  
many investors sidelined to monitor upcoming corporate earnings 
announcements. The dollar dropped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 34.63  
points, or 0.21 percent, to 16,234.62 by the end of the morning 
session. On Thursday, the average closed up 71.81 points, or 0.44 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar slipped against the yen after early gains, falling to  
123.83 yen, 0.65 yen below its level late Thursday in Tokyo and 
also below its late New York level of 124.40. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei 225 briefly dropped below 16,000  
for the first time since April 1. But with the index down more than 
6 percent from a high set on May 6, further downside risk is 
limited, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, they don't expect a quick rebound in share  
prices either, especially since the U.S. Federal Reserve's hint at 
an interest rate hike has cooled off the action on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the U.S. market's volatility declining after the Federal  
Reserve's change in bias for its monetary policy, Tokyo shares 
should also stabilize at current levels,'' said Masaaki Higashida, 
deputy general manager at Nomura Securities Co. ``Adjusting 
positions for a while, players are waiting for the market's 
rebound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players were also waiting to monitor corporate earnings  
statements, which have been coming out this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips were mixed. Sony, TDK, Fujitsu, Tokyo Electron,  
Kyocera, Honda, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, NTT Mobile 
Communications and Fuji Photo were weaker, while NEC, Advantest, 
Toyota and Bridgestone were up. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in banks and brokerages are generally higher after recent  
declines. Major commercial banks will announce earnings results 
later Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 4.80 points, or 0.37 percent, to 
1,306.67. The TOPIX closed up 1.26 points, or 0.10 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the greenback had gained early Friday  
following remarks from U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that 
the United States had no intention to use its currency as a trade 
policy tool. That indicated the government had no plans to make 
American exports cheaper by undermining the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.36 yen, down  
from 132.44 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.325 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.295 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.55 yen from 101.82 yen.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley Sued for Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former investment analyst sued one of Wall  
Street's largest firms for $1.35 billion Wednesday, alleging they 
fired him because he is black, told lies about him, and then had 
him arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Curry, 25, said he worked for Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter as a real estate analyst from July 1997 until he was fired 
in April 1998. He says he suffered bigotry and harassment almost 
the entire time. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they fired Curry for expense account  
abuses, but Curry says they fired him because he is black and 
because they thought he was homosexual after nude photos of him 
appeared in a gay men's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after they fired Curry, company officials told  
police he was plotting to plant racist and homophobic e-mail in 
their computers. Curry was arrested Aug. 20 on charges of forgery, 
coercion and computer trespass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manhattan district attorney's office Wednesday dropped  
charges against Curry and is now investigating Morgan Stanley and 
the informant who tipped them to the alleged scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Curry's lawyers, Earl Rawlins, admits that Curry paid a  
hacker, actually an undercover police officer, $200 to plant the 
phony e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant and Morgan Stanley officials never revealed to  
investigators that they were negotiating with each other, which 
ruined them as witnesses in the case, said Assistant District 
Attorney Leroy Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within days of the defendant's arrest,'' Frazier said  
Wednesday in Manhattan Criminal Court, ``officials at Morgan 
Stanley wired a $10,000 payment into an account designated by the 
confidential informant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference to announce his lawsuit against Morgan  
Stanley and several company officials, Curry said ``the most 
outrageous incident'' involving him occurred at a Christmas party. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked to mock one of Morgan Stanley's black executives by  
wearing an Afro wig and making his lips appear larger. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I refused I was berated,'' Curry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeanmarie McFadden, spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said the  
firm had not seen Curry's lawsuit, but she issued a statement 
saying the firm ``regrets the decision on the part of the DA's 
office to drop the charges against Christian Curry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our conduct and the conduct of our employees  
in this matter was entirely appropriate and legal,'' McFadden said. 
``We do not tolerate harassment of any kind at the firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain the $1.35 billion that the lawsuit is asking,  
one of Curry's lawyers, Benedict Morelli, said, ``When you punish 
someone who is worth $45 billion, you don't sue for a million.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Backs U.S. Reform Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told  
Congress today that Fed policy-makers support Clinton 
administration efforts to make the global financial system less 
susceptible to future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin sounded the same  
reform themes in a joint appearance before the House Banking 
Committee. They outlined steps policy-makers have taken to deal 
with the 22-month-long crisis that has plunged one-third of the 
global economy into recession and sent America's trade deficit to 
record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told the committee that a number of steps have already  
been taken to strengthen rules to encourage greater financial 
disclosure by developing countries and to put into place guidelines 
that will discourage these countries from taking too many risks 
when they borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community, with the leadership of the United  
States, has made important progress so far,'' Rubin said. ``There 
is now a broad-based consensus on the appropriate framework for 
reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, the administration's point man in dealing with the Asian  
crisis, announced last week that he will step down as treasury 
secretary in July and President Clinton said he will nominate 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers as Rubin's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who issued a strong statement of support for Summers  
last week, continued to signal to financial markets that he and 
other Fed policy-makers are working closely with the administration 
to deal with the global crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We at the Federal Reserve are in broad agreement with the  
approach outlined by Secretary Rubin and expect to continue to work 
closely with the Treasury in this area,'' Greenspan said in his 
committee testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rubin and Greenspan called on the private sector to share  
more of the burden of bad investment decisions. One of the 
principal criticisms of the massive bailouts of Mexico in 1995 and 
Asian nations, Russia and Brazil in the recent crisis has been that 
much of the money went to repay foreign investors who made bad 
bets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the ill-advised investing of recent years can be  
avoided in the future if investors ... are more appropriately 
forewarned'' that they will suffer losses, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin in his testimony repeated a package of proposals the  
administration first unveiled last month immediately before the 
spring meetings of the 182-nation International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Those suggestions for the most part represent alterations of  
existing rules to encourage greater disclosure by nations of their 
true financial position and discourage inappropriate risk-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF last month adopted a key Clinton proposal to provide  
countries with preapproved loans in hopes it will discourage 
speculative attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the result of the approach I have outlined  
will be a more robust global economy that is less susceptible to 
instability and crisis,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said countries need to put in place improved financial  
reporting standards, citing in particular the need for foreign 
central banks to publish accurate statistics on the amount of 
foreign currency reserves they are holding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it difficult to believe, for example, that the crises  
that arose in Thailand and Korea would have been nearly so virulent 
had their central banks published data prior to the crisis on net 
reserves instead of the not very informative gross reserve 
positions only,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan repeated that he favors a rule of thumb put forward by  
Pablo Guidotti, the deputy finance minister of Argentina, that 
countries should manage their external debt holdings so their 
reserves could carry them a full year without any new foreign 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. economy has escaped relatively unscathed from the  
global turmoil, certain sectors, most notably manufacturing and 
farming, have been battered by the loss of overseas markets and 
increased competition from imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported earlier today that the U.S. trade  
deficit for March set a third straight monthly record, rising to 
$19.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Fall, Tokyo Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets fell Thursday on lingering  
worries over a possible rise in U.S. interest rates, but Tokyo's 
key index bounced back from a five-day decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 71.81  
points, or 0.44 percent, closing at 16,199.99. Before Thursday's 
rebound, the Nikkei had lost 819.19 points over the previous five 
trading days, including Wednesday's 250.44-point drop, or 1.53 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei was down most of the day, but rebounded in the last  
30 minutes of trading as institutional investors picked up 
selective shares, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors remained bearish on worries that Japan's economy is  
not gaining momentum and frustration that the government appears 
reluctant to push new steps to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar extended its seven-month  
high against the Japanese yen. In late trading, the dollar bought 
124.48 yen in late afternoon, up 0.78 yen from late Wednesday in 
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 124.21 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip index fell on local interest rate  
concerns, but China-related shares bucked the downward trend on 
expectations of more economic restructuring in mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng index fell 27.72 points, or 0.22 percent, at  
12,375.42. On Wednesday, the index fell 1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were concerned that Hong Kong interest rates were  
unlikely to fall in the coming months, following news Tuesday that 
the U.S. Federal Reserve was inclined to adopt a tighter monetary 
policy to curb inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong interest rates usually follow the movement of U.S.  
rates because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. currency.

<HEADLINE> Officer Said To Boast of Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In an account never before made public, a police  
sergeant testified that an officer bragged about brutalizing a 
prisoner in a police station bathroom before showing off the stick 
he allegedly used to torture the Haitian immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a man down tonight,'' Sgt. Kenneth Wernick quoted  
Justin Volpe as saying about the attack on Abner Louima that 
shocked the city and raised tensions between police and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, is charged with ramming a broken broomstick into the  
handcuffed prisoner's rectum and mouth in a fit of rage. 
Prosecutors say Volpe mistakenly thought Louima, 32, punched him in 
a disturbance outside a Brooklyn nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Wernick, Volpe said he ``took a stick and put it  
five or six inches up his (rectum), took it out and put it up to 
his mouth and teeth area, kind of like showing it to him. ... He 
told him that if he told anyone, he'd kill him and his whole 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After asking Wernick if he wanted to see the stick, Volpe took  
him into the bathroom and retrieved a 2- to 3-foot, gray-colored 
stick from a sink area, the witness said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, ``He pointed the stick at me and said, `You see this  
sh--? You see this sh--?'' Wernick said. The witness said he then 
watched Volpe go over to a dumpster and raise the stick, but turned 
away before seeing whether he threw it in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be involved,'' Wernick said.  
</P>
<P>
	Officers Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese are  
also charged with violating Louima's civil rights by beating him in 
a patrol car en route to the station. A fifth defendant, Sgt. 
Michael Bellomo, is charged with covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Wernick -- a former patrolman who was promoted shortly after the  
Louima scandal broke -- was to return to the stand today.

<HEADLINE> Helms Praised on Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the Clinton administration lost  
another nominee for a key diplomatic post in a dispute with Sen. 
Jesse Helms, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin praised 
Helms for ``great cooperation'' in getting nominations through the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Wednesday that the State Department fares better than  
other agencies in getting its nominees confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman also soft-pedaled differences over the  
long-delayed nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador, 
putting most of the blame for delay on the State Department's own 
investigative process. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was only quite recently that all the paperwork was provided  
following the work that the administration had to do,'' Rubin said. 
``So I wouldn't presume that he (Helms) has slowed the process. 
There's an investigative process that went through. It took a very 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agency for International Development Administrator Brian Atwood  
withdrew his nomination to be ambassador to Brazil on Tuesday, 
saying he would never get past Helms, chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina Republican opposed the nomination, Atwood  
said, because of Atwood's successful campaign to defeat the 
senator's proposal to merge USAID into the State Department. Helms 
had no comment on Atwood's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had agreed  
to a merger of three agencies into the State Department, but their 
plan never made it through Congress. The final merger plan retained 
USAID's independence while consolidating the arms control and 
information agencies into the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Atwood made his own decision to withdraw just Tuesday  
and the administration had fully supported him. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of Helms' cooperation came up at a State Department  
briefing in which Rubin was asked about opposition to the 
nomination of Peter Romero, who is acting assistant secretary of 
state for Western Hemisphere affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., wrote a letter to Helms recently urging  
that he block the nomination of Romero to become assistant 
secretary because of concerns over Romero's stance on Cuba and his 
role in U.S. contacts with the Colombian rebel group FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said U.S. contacts with FARC came at the request of the  
Colombian government and Albright fully supports Romero as the 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's new president, Andres Pastrana, ``thought that our  
assistance might help stop this brutal civil war and thus enable 
Colombia to be in a position to better fight the drug war without 
having to deal with the civil conflict that's going on,'' Rubin 
said, dismissing Burton's concerns as misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
	On Helms, Rubin said ``he believes it is his right to pursue his  
prerogatives in this area. And he certainly has that right under 
the Senate's rules. We think that, by and large, we have received 
great cooperation from Senator Helms in putting through an enormous 
number of nominees.''

<HEADLINE> Mazda Reports a Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Mazda Motor Corp. posted its first annual profit in  
six years on Thursday, citing gains in North America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroshima-based Mazda, which is 33.4 percent owned by Ford Motor  
Co. of the United States, earned 38.71 billion yen, or $310.97 
million, in the fiscal year ended March 31 compared with a loss of 
6.8 billion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's fifth biggest auto company also credited the impact of a  
weaker yen against the dollar, which increased the value of its 
dollar-denominated income from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that Mazda is on the right track for a complete  
turnaround,'' company president James Miller said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda's group sales in the business year ended in March climbed  
0.8 percent to 2.06 trillion yen, or $16.54 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it expects net income to grow to a record  
40 billion yen on sales of 2.59 trillion yen in the current fiscal 
year, despite a prolonged recession in its home market of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Group earnings should be helped by cost-cutting moves and  
Mazda's disposal of low-yielding assets, said senior managing 
director Gary Hexter. 
</P>
<P>
	It forecast domestic sales will climb 8.1 percent in fiscal 1999  
to 340,000 vehicles, spurred by the debut of new models such as the 
Premacy. Exports were projected to increase 6.1 percent to 580,000 
units, led by shipments to North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda estimates its overall production will rise 5.7 percent to  
865,000 vehicles over the course of the fiscal year, which ends 
March 31, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Former Cup-Winning Teammates Duel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A decade ago, the Calgary Flames won the Stanley  
Cup with help from second-year center Joe Nieuwendyk and rookie 
right wing Theo Fleury. Young and talented, Nieuwendyk and Fleury 
had reason to expect more titles to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't worked out that way. Despite solid careers, neither  
has even come as close as the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now.  
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk and the Dallas Stars meet Fleury and the Colorado  
Avalanche in the Western Conference finals beginning Saturday. No 
matter which team wins the series, either Nieuwendyk or Fleury will 
get a chance to again have his name etched onto hockey's premier 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of players on both sides who can put the puck  
in the net, and both teams have good goaltending,'' Fleury said. 
``It's going to be a great series. I'm just excited to be a part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars reached this round last year, but Nieuwendyk missed it  
with a knee injury suffered midway through the first period of the 
first postseason game. It was a devastating blow to Dallas as 
Nieuwendyk had led the team in goals and points during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	This postseason, Nieuwendyk is making up for the lost time. His  
three game-winning goals are tied for the playoff lead, as are his 
two overtime goals. Over 10 games, he has six goals and three 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury also is making the most of his chance to play in late  
May, scoring five goals and assisting on nine others. His 14 points 
tie teammate Joe Sakic for third in the playoffs. Another teammate, 
Peter Forsberg, leads the list with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fleury is another threat for them, but he's not asked to carry  
the load like he was in Calgary the last few years,'' Nieuwendyk 
said. ``I think he's a real good fit for that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Nieuwendyk left the Flames in December 1995, Fleury has  
played in four playoff games -- all at the end of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Fleury established himself as one of the league's top  
scorers and became an all-star for the sixth time this season, he 
was likely to leave Calgary as an unrestricted free agent this 
summer. The Flames made no secret of their desire to trade him, and 
on Feb. 28 he was sent to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-6, 160-pounder with the laser shot and quick skates  
scored in his first game for the Avalanche but also sprained his 
right knee. He missed seven games, then scored again in his first 
game back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really an opportunistic kind of guy,'' Nieuwendyk said.  
``He won't be overly aggressive on the forecheck, but he'll be the 
guy coming in late who seems to get the goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Fleury is on a team loaded with scorers, opponents are  
hesitant to target him for fear of being hurt by someone else. 
Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said his team's biggest challenge will 
be finding a way to handle Colorado's depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you know you have more firepower, you can almost play  
cocky at times,'' Hitchcock said. ``Fleury brings that cocky 
attitude that says, `We're going to beat you with the puck and beat 
you bad.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars center Mike Modano knows what to expect from Fleury  
because they've played against each other since they were juniors 
in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Sakic went head-to-head in that league for a long time  
for the scoring championship and you could just sense back then 
that he had ability,'' Modano said. ``A lot of this game is speed, 
and if you can skate, you can play in this game.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Help Nears for Hog Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog farmers struggling with record low prices  
stand to receive at least $145 million in federal aid under the 
spending package sent Thursday to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation offers up to $245 million for the farmers, but  
agriculture officials indicated that as much as $100 million 
probably will go to other Agriculture Department needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15 billion package that cleared the Senate on Thursday  
finances the fighting in the Balkans, aid to hurricane victims and 
other projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation set asides $145 million in new funds for the  
Agriculture Department and authorizes $100 million in existing 
funds to help pork producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog prices plummeted to 40-year lows last December, sinking to 8  
cents to 10 cents a pound. Producers on Thursday were getting 36 
cents per pound, still below the break-even point of almost 40 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department already has bought record amounts of  
pork and is unlikely to make substantially more purchases with the 
$100 million in existing funds, according to a USDA official 
speaking on condition of anonymity. Those funds also can be used 
for fruit, vegetables and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will help hog farmers with direct payments as well as  
loans or purchases of surplus pork. Earlier this year, the agency 
sent $50 million in direct payments to hog farmers, an industry 
traditionally not subsidized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of independent pork producers who are really  
struggling, and should these below-cost prices go on much longer, 
they'll have a very difficult time staying in business, there's no 
doubt about that,'' said Steven Cohen, a spokesman for the National 
Pork Producers Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers and lawmakers want Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman  
to use the new funds for direct payments. They also asked him to 
spend most of the other funds on the pork industry.

<HEADLINE> St. James Gets Another Try at Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- After a struggle to find sponsorship, Lyn  
St. James now has the backing she hopes will make her latest 
Indianapolis 500 effort a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	St. James recently was hired to drive for Team Pelfrey as Robby  
Unser's teammate, but did not have a major sponsor until Garden 
Fresh potatoes and the Kroger grocery chain came on board 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But St. James -- one of only two women ever to drive in the  
Memorial Day weekend classic -- knows financial backing is only part 
of the equation if she is to race May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal ultimately is to have my best-ever Indy,'' she said .  
``But my expectation is first to make the field. I've learned that 
is not a given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her first practice session Wednesday, she made 33 laps on the  
2 1/2-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway Oval, topping out at 214.408 
mph. That's not fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Stewart had the day's fast lap at 226.683 mph, followed by  
Greg Ray at 226.086, Arie Luyendyk at 225.096, Kenny Brack at 
224.411, Stephan Gregoire at 224.193, Unser at 224.042 and rookie 
Robby McGehee at 224.025. 
</P>
<P>
	A few others didn't do nearly as well, in fact not even as well  
as St. James. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Dave Steele crashed in the first turn and was treated at  
Methodist Hospital for a mild concussion and back strain before 
being released. Tyce Carlson and Mark Dismore also hit the wall in 
separate crashes, but were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	St. James has persevered in a sport where women remain a  
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still perceived as a male-dominated sport,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But things are getting better.  
</P>
<P>
	Until 1971, women were not even allowed in the pits at Indy. In  
1976, Arlene Hiss became the first woman granted a competition 
license by the U.S. Auto Club, and in 1977 Janet Guthrie became the 
first to drive at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Before St. James arrived in 1992, the only other woman to enter  
and attempt to qualify at Indy was Desire Wilson in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	St. James was the Indy rookie of the year in 1992, when she  
finished 11th. In five other starts, her best finish was 13th in 
1997 with Hemelgarn Racing. She entered her own car last year, but 
did not qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	St. James and Unser, the son of three-time Indy winner Bobby  
Unser, are driving Dallara-Aurora cars for Team Pelfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been in a Dallara before, but not in a few years, so  
this will be a new experience a bit,'' St. James said. 
</P>
<P>
	She knows she must find speed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of work to do,'' St. James said. ``It's a very  
competitive field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched how the numbers have gone, and there are a lot of  
cars going fast and going very close. A couple of tenths (of a 
second) make a huge difference here.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes' NH Campaign Manager Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The New Hampshire campaign manager for  
Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes resigned following 
his arrest on charges of pulling a gun on another man at a bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Robbio, 37, resigned the day after his April 16 arrest at  
the Black Brimmer, a Manchester saloon, the Forbes campaign said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A bar patron, Raul Gonzalez, said Robbio bumped him and the two  
exchanged words. He said Robbio walked a few feet away and pulled 
out a handgun, which he displayed but did not aim at Gonzalez, 
according to an affidavit from arresting officer James Ahern. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Mark Putney said Robbio faces up to 14 years in prison if  
convicted of reckless conduct and criminal threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbio had told the Concord Monitor earlier this week that he  
quit for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running the New Hampshire presidential primary is more than a  
full-time job,'' he told the newspaper. ``For personal reasons, I 
just don't have that time.'' Reached Wednesday after Fox News broke 
the news of his arrest, Robbio declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Dal Col, national campaign manager for Forbes, also  
declined to comment on the arrest Wednesday. He did say Robbio was 
welcome to continue volunteering for the campaign, as he has done 
since resigning.

<HEADLINE> Nude Statue Returns to Library Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A nude statue banned a century ago -- not because  
of her nakedness, but because the figure was holding a bunch of 
grapes -- is reclaiming her rightful spot at the nation's oldest 
public library. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a $60 million renovation at the Boston Public  
Library, the bronze ``Bacchante and Infant Faun's'' could be in 
place by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue, by Frederic Macmonnies, depicts a woman holding a  
naked infant in one hand and a bunch of grapes in the other. The 
child looks longingly toward the fruit. The statue's name is a 
derivation of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiled in 1895 at the height of Boston's temperance movement,  
it was branded a ``monument to inebriety.'' The Rev. James B. Brady 
attacked it as ``strumpetry'' and ``the worst type of harlotry with 
which the earth was ever afflicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No tipsy statue for the public library,'' shouted the Boston  
Post, which campaigned against the figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities simply laughed. ``Too naughty for Boston Library,''  
read a headline in the New York Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuss so outraged library architect Charles F. McKim, who had  
commissioned the work, that he bestowed the sculpture on New York's 
Metropolitan Museum. ``Removed from Puritan surroundings to this 
Metropolis, where she belongs,'' McKim wrote to the sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
	A replica was commissioned by the Boston library in 1993 and  
stands inside the building. That is the statue that is going to be 
moved to the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The outrage was a precursor to the puritanical wrath that  
flourished in 1920s Boston, which banned Henry Miller novels, D.H. 
Lawrence's ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' and dancer Isadora Duncan.

<HEADLINE> Software Maker To Take on Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A tiny software maker that once did  
business with Microsoft is taking on the maker of Windows next 
month in a trial some say could break new ground in antitrust 
challenges against Bill Gates and company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Technology Inc., a Danbury company with just 70  
employees, is scheduled to go to trial June 2 in a lawsuit that 
claims Microsoft is improperly withholding software code that 
Bristol says is vital for its survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is not directly related to the larger lawsuit filed  
against Microsoft by the U.S. Department of Justice and 19 states. 
However, it has a similar theme. 
</P>
<P>
	The government suit contends that Microsoft illegally wielded  
the power of its dominant Windows computer operating system to 
expand into new markets, such as Internet software, and thus crush 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol contends Microsoft is abusing the market power of its  
Windows NT business software, which runs powerful corporate 
machines that direct networks of smaller personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about here is the brain and the central  
nervous system of corporations,'' said Ed Black, president of the 
Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association, a trade group. ``So 
one of the concerns beyond pure economics is that all of those 
central nervous systems of many companies wind up potentially 
dependent upon, reliant on and subservient to the wishes of a 
powerful monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another small software maker, Orem, Utah-based Caldera, also has  
a suit pending against Microsoft alleging abusive business 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry  
Association, said the outcome of both cases, while uncertain, could 
have implications for the larger antitrust lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the Bristol and Caldera cases explore novel issues  
related to the responsibility of the dominant operating system 
vendor in working with independent software vendors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs  
such as word processors and spreadsheets written to work with 
Windows to be converted to run on computers with different 
operating systems such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	Unix is sold by a number of companies including Sun  
Microsystems, an arch-foe of Microsoft. It is a major competitor to 
Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to make Wind/U, Bristol needs access to the source code  
-- the programming blueprints -- for Windows NT. Bristol had a 3-year 
licensing agreement for Windows NT source code with Microsoft, but 
that expired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, Bristol claims Microsoft is illegally preventing  
it from obtaining the Windows source code, in effect severing 
Bristol's customers from the latest Windows technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denies the allegations and says Bristol's lawsuit is  
merely an attempt to negotiate a more favorable licensing 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Tom Pilla said his company was able to  
negotiate a licensing agreement with Mainsoft, one of Bristol's 
competitors, under the same terms it offered Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bristol turned down those terms, then hired an economic  
expert, a public relations firm and a legal team to sue Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Bristol's attempt to use the court system to obtain  
something that isn't theirs in order to obtain an unfair advantage 
over Mainsoft,'' said Pilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Chief Executive Keith Blackwell dismissed Microsoft's  
claim that his lawsuit is a strong-arm negotiating tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really just ridiculous,'' he said. ``That would be a very  
time-consuming and expensive negotiating ploy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will square off in court just as the Microsoft  
antitrust trial in Washington, D.C., is expected to resume after a 
three-month recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera's antitrust suit against Microsoft claims the company's  
pricing practices and marketing techniques effectively destroyed 
the market for a desktop computer operating system its sells called 
DR-DOS, while building a monopoly for Microsoft's MS-DOS, the 
precursor to Windows. That case is scheduled to go to trial in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft dismissed any comparisons between the Bristol and  
Caldera cases and the Department of Justice case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that these cases are linked in any way,'' Pilla  
said.

<HEADLINE> Relations in Space Similar to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When space travelers leave on voyages to  
distant planets, their baggage will include the same anger, 
rivalries and jealousies that mark relationships on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	After months in tight confines, leadership erodes, cliques  
develop and everybody gets mad at Mission Control, says a 
psychiatrist who studied astronaut and cosmonaut crews aboard the 
Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Outbursts of emotion are inevitable in outer space, said Dr.  
Nick A. Kanas of the University of California, San Francisco. He 
and other experts are searching for ways to control those emotions 
and teach space travelers how to cope. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to train the crews before they go up, so they will be  
aware of what is happening and can apply some self-correction to 
prevent onboard tension,'' said Kanas, a speaker at the annual 
meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger in space, by astronauts and cosmonauts, has been common  
since early in the manned space program. Some Apollo crews in the 
1960s griped at Mission Control even during short-duration 
missions. On Skylab missions that lasted up to 84 days in the 
mid-70s, astronauts regularly ranted about their workload and 
malfunctioning equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers also flashed occasionally aboard Mir, the Russian space  
station where astronauts and cosmonauts spent months in an aging 
craft prone to breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Kanas said, he expects anger and tension to be a part of  
missions to the International Space Station in the next decade, and 
again on the two- to three-year missions to Mars expected in the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to live with two or three people in space for  
months,'' Kanas said. ``If you have a fight on Earth, you can go 
out to a movie or something and it is all better. But in space, you 
can't go anywhere. You are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Research on the Mir suggests that highly professional space  
travelers do well for several months, working smoothly and 
compatibly, Kanas said. But eventually, tempers flare. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians believe it starts after just a few months. Kanas'  
research suggests it takes up to four months before emotions boil 
to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens, he said, is that crew compatibility breaks down,  
with some members ganging up on others. The dynamics of onboard 
leadership may change in subtle ways. And the crew develops a 
tendency to blame Mission Control for all problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a feeling that things are tough on board and nobody  
cares on the outside,'' Kanas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In severe cases, the powerful emotions affected sleep, attention  
to work and even caused physical weakness. Experts are still 
searching for answers, but Kanas said studies have established some 
fundamentals: 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of people in a crew is crucial. ``Three is the most  
difficult number for a crew. With three, somebody is excluded. You 
have a majority and one is a loner,'' said Kanas. ``Eleven and nine 
are good numbers. For instance, you might have a majority of six, 
but those in the 'out' group still have somebody to talk to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--A variety of people may be better than a crew of one sex, one  
race or one nationality. ``There is a school of thought that 
diversity during a long-term space mission might be a positive, 
because it keeps them interested in each other longer,'' Kanas 
said. ``I would guess that the first trip to Mars probably will be 
multicultural with at least two languages and include at least one 
woman.'' Studies suggest, he said, that crew members who are well 
traveled, sophisticated and able to speak different languages ``are 
used to working with other people and will be less tense and more 
cohesive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The compatibility of crew members can be evaluated in advance.  
Russians, the world's leaders in long-term space flight, pay much 
attention to how cosmonauts get along and base crew selection, in 
part, on compatibility. Crew members work together for a year 
before launch, and if tensions develop, are broken up. In the 
United States, crew members are excluded for ``obvious 
psychopathology,'' but selecting for compatibility ``is not well 
developed,'' Kanas said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Death Row Inmate To Go to Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- DNA evidence cleared Ronald Jones of murder and  
got him off death row in Illinois after eight years. But he won't 
be getting out from behind bars just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was convicted of a 1979 robbery in Tennessee and was  
serving five years in prison when he escaped from a community work 
crew in 1980, said Pam Hobbins, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee 
Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 49, appeared briefly in court Wednesday and waived his  
right to fight extradition to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just waiting for authorities from Tennessee to come and  
pick him up; he's basically their prisoner,'' said Cook County 
sheriff's spokesman Bill Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was convicted of the March 1985 rape and killing of Debra  
Smith outside a Chicago hotel. He confessed to the crime but 
claimed that police had beaten the confession out of him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Supreme Court overturned the conviction in July  
1997 after DNA tests of semen showed that Jones was not the 
assailant. Prosecutors announced Monday that they would not retry 
him on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones became the 12th condemned person in Illinois to be  
exonerated in the last 12 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Monitors To Visit N.Korea Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 14-member team prepared today to inspect an  
underground facility in North Korea as congressional critics of the 
administration proposed restrictions on its nuclear deal with the 
communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. will have satisfactory access to the site in order to  
remove fully our concerns about the nature of the site and the 
activities of the site,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin 
said Wednesday. He declined to identify members of the team, 
described as ``technical specialists,'' and said there is no time 
limit for them to do their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also declined to say whether former Defense Secretary  
William Perry, President Clinton's special envoy for the North 
Korean issue, is going to Pyongyang next week for talks. He said, 
however, that Perry is ``prepared to travel to North Korea under 
the right circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin criticized new efforts on Capitol Hill to get more out of  
North Korea in exchange for oil shipments and food aid under the 
agreement designed to halt any North Korean nuclear weapons 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that we're getting access ... should take the  
steam out of some of those ill-advised ideas to throw away an 
agreement that has helped us prevent North Korea from becoming a 
major nuclear power threatening our vital national interests ...'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee, said, ``We should be getting 
more for our money.'' His legislation would limit Clinton's 
discretion in providing aid under the program and impose new 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1994 agreement, North Korea agreed to curtail its  
nuclear weapons program in exchange for fuel oil for its 
conventional power plants and international assistance for 
developing new nuclear power generators, mostly from Japan and 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton requested $55 million in his budget for fiscal year 2000  
for the oil program, up from $35 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman and other congressional critics of the program contend  
North Korea has not lived up to its end, citing concerns over the 
underground facility and other indications that North Korea may be 
developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	They have also criticized North Korea's 1998 launch of a  
multistage rocket over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation it would permit humanitarian food shipments to  
North Korea only if food ``is not diverted to the North Korean 
military and that North Korea is taking steps to regain 
self-sufficiency in food production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House last year voted to block the oil payments, but they  
were restored in later negotiations with the Senate and the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting another concern of some Americans, a Massachusetts  
man called The Associated Press on Wednesday to register his 
objection to deals with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred Gregori of Longmeadow, Mass., said his brother, Joseph,  
has been missing in North Korea since he was a 19-year-old soldier 
serving in the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregori said his 86-year-old mother, Lena, who lives in West  
Pittston, Pa., is still waiting for word of her son. She still has 
his wardrobe, Purple Heart medal and an American flag given by the 
military, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before she passes away, she would love to know whatever  
happened to my brother,'' Gregori said. He said no aid -- oil or 
food -- should go to North Korea until it accounts for all Americans 
missing from the war. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say North Korea has been cooperating in efforts  
to account for American soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Education Plan Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Clinton administration proposal to phase out  
uncertified teachers and limit the role of teachers' aides drew a 
host of objections from educators who said more, not less, help is 
needed in schools. One Republican lawmaker said the White House was 
meddling in local school affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	A $15 billion Elementary and Secondary Education Act unveiled  
Wednesday would make participating school districts do away with 
the practice of ``emergency certification,'' through which teachers 
teach subjects such as math or English in which they have not been 
certified by the state. It also would end the practice of allowing 
teachers' aides to supervise classrooms on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's public schools are going to rise and fall on the  
quality of their teachers,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley 
said, adding that schools in poorer districts rely too heavily on 
aides to instruct students. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators and lawmakers attacked the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``Holding us accountable without providing us the assistance to  
achieve these goals puts everybody in a very difficult bind,'' said 
Mike Casserly of the Council of Great City Schools, adding that 
most new teachers choose suburban posts with better pay and working 
conditions over urban ones. ``We're going to need substantially 
more help than there is in the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan to renew the act also would require states and school  
districts to reduce class size, turn around failing schools, issue 
report cards to parents on how schools are doing, set strict 
academic and classroom discipline standards and end the practice of 
promoting children who are not academically ready by helping them 
with more after-school and summer programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The act, on average, provides about 7 percent of states'  
education spending. Poorer schools, however, tend to get a larger 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the Clinton proposal, first made in his State  
of the Union address in January, runs counter to their efforts to 
ensure local control of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a classic example of the administration trying to  
mandate national solutions to local problems,'' said Rep. Bill 
Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and Workforce 
Committee, which is crafting its version of the legislation. 
``Without federal mandates, these new requirements are already 
being carried out by states and local school districts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall Smith, a Riley deputy, said teachers' unions support  
the teacher-quality proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have given the districts room and time to make this  
happen by phasing it in,'' said Sandra Feldman of the American 
Federation of Teachers, adding that the aides should not be 
eliminated. ``Working under the supervision of a classroom teacher 
and properly trained, they can be very helpful. But they are not 
teachers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kati Haycock of the Education Trust, a Washington-based  
nonprofit group promoting academic achievement, said, ``Parents 
want -- and children need -- highly qualified teachers now. We can't 
afford ... teachers who are on a three-year road to 
certification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	States would be able to apply their various teacher  
certifications under the Clinton proposal, said Mary Jean LeTendre, 
who oversees the Education Department's administration of funds for 
poor students. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996-97 school year, almost as many teachers' aides  
(52,714) as teachers (61,252) were funded by the federal 
government. Education Department surveys found that 41 percent of 
aides at participating schools spent at least half of their time in 
the classroom without a teacher present. 
</P>
<P>
	Also a third of the nation's teachers said they either lacked  
degrees in the subjects they teach or did not spend enough time 
training in them. 
</P>
<P>
	Urban districts have some of the greatest need, often two and  
half times the vacancies of other districts. About three-fourths of 
those districts have to rely on noncertified teachers to teach 
under emergency licenses, long-term substitute teachers, teachers 
with provisional licenses and internships or apprenticeships. But 
nearly half offer programs to prepare aides for licensed teaching 
positions.

<HEADLINE> Mother, Shot Daughter Made Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A paralyzed woman who won the right to go  
off life support made peace with her mother, who is accused of 
shooting her, before she died, the mother's attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgette Smith spoke to her mother during a videotaped  
deposition from her hospital bed Tuesday, one day before Ms. Smith 
was removed from a ventilator at her own request. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very emotional. They were at peace with one another,''  
the mother's attorney, Bob Wesley, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Egan, 68, is charged with attempted murder in her  
daughter's shooting, and the charge could be changed to 
manslaughter or murder now that her daughter is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesley said he didn't believe a grand jury would indict Egan for  
murder once they saw the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan, who has emphysema and is blind in one eye, is accused  
of shooting her 42-year-old daughter in March after overhearing her 
discuss putting her in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet hit Ms. Smith's spinal cord, paralyzing her and  
leaving her unable to speak without effort and incapable of 
swallowing or controlling her bladder. In asking a court for 
permission to be taken off life support, she said she could only 
wink and wiggle her nose and tongue, and added, ``I can't live like 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith died Wednesday after a court granted her wish. Ms.  
Egan supported her daughter's decision, but Wesley fought it to 
avoid the charge being upgraded to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesley said Ms. Egan didn't mean to shoot her daughter and  
didn't want to see her suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith was sedated before the ventilator was removed  
Wednesday night. Ms. Egan was told of her daughter's death by a 
chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a traumatic night for her,'' Wesley said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise Modestly; Dow Up 30.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly today amid fresh evidence  
that the U.S. economy is growing at a steady but not inflationary 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 30.97 at 10,918.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also posted slim gains. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 5.04 at 1,349.27, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 6.32 at 2,583.72. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good looking day,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst  
at Prudential Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders took their cues from a Philadelphia Federal Reserve  
survey that indicated inflation remains in check. Stock and bond 
markets have been highly sensitive to signs of inflation since last 
Friday, when the government reported an unusually steep jump in the 
consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said that more signs of  
inflation could prompt an increase in interest rates some time this 
year. Since then, the market has struggled to break out of a narrow 
range as investors weigh the possibility of higher rates and the 
negative impact they would have on corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense of relief from the Philly meeting,'' Wachtel  
said. ``Things are calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan maintained that sense of calm as he  
kept his remarks to the House Banking Committee today focused on 
the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The market took two government economic reports in stride. The  
Commerce Department said the nation's deficit rose to a record high 
in March, led by a widening gap with Japan. Meanwhile, the Labor 
Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for 
unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 last week to 299,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mergers provided some extra activity in the market today.  
Healtheon soared for a second straight session as it announced it 
will merge with WebMD Inc. to create an Internet-based health care 
services company. It was up 28 3/4 to 109. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck was among the Dow's biggest advancers, rising 2 1/4 to 72 3/4 as  
analysts anticipated it will soon receive approval for a new 
painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's gains spanned most sectors. Paper and forest products  
stocks rose after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised earnings 
estimates for the group. Georgia-Pacific jumped 2 to 91 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	EToys soared in its Nasdaq debut. Shares of the online toy store  
were priced at 20 and opened at 78 before settling back to 76 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Some major Internet businesses were weaker, though. Amazon.com  
Inc. dropped 3 7/8 to 135 11/16 after the company said it plans to 
sell $2 billion in securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 589.86 million 
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.81 at 642.35, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 4.48 at 792.84.

<HEADLINE> Internet Companies Asked To Drop Bomb Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Safety advocates are calling on major computer  
firms to purge the Internet of bombmaking instructions, arguing 
lethal information is too easy to access. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has a constitutional right to use an Internet company's  
property to facilitate murder,'' Dennis Saffran of the Center for 
the Community Interest said Wednesday. ``Rather, the companies have 
the constitutional right -- and the moral obligation -- to stop this 
use of their property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski, the brother of convicted Unabomber Theodore  
Kaczynski, said ready access to bombmaking sites can turn good kids 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're allowing every Eric Harris, every troubled kid out  
there, to become the next Tim McVeigh,'' Kaczynski said, referring 
to the Oklahoma City bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and fellow student Dylan Klebold stormed Columbine High  
School in Littleton, Colo., on April 20, killing 12 students and a 
teacher before taking their own lives. Police later discovered that 
Harris had a Web site filled with bomb diagrams. 
</P>
<P>
	The advocates asked America Online, Microsoft, Walt Disney Co. --  
which recently launched Go.com -- and Yahoo Inc!, to shut down 
bombmaking sites and remove any sites that threaten or encourage 
physical violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Saffran said if the companies refuse to act voluntarily, then  
his organization would ask crime victims to press for government 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with America Online, Yahoo and Go.com said they  
already prohibit such information. Officials with Microsoft did not 
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Littleton Reacts to Ga. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School junior Kim Blair  
could not believe that what happened at her school one month ago 
happened again elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do now?'' Miss Blair, 17, said. ``It's happening  
again. What school is going to be next? It's kind of scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Conyers, Ga., on Thursday, a student opened fire inside  
Heritage High School, shooting and injuring six students. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20 at Columbine, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold,  
17, shot and killed a dozen students and a teacher, then killed 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Many classmates and relatives of Columbine victims believe the  
country may be in for more such shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said since this thing happened that they better beware  
because it's going to happen again and again,'' said Michael 
Shoels, whose son, Isaiah, 18, died at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has some kind of organization to it, so we better  
beware,'' Shoels said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoe Bruschke, grandmother of Columbine student Grant Taylor, 16,  
who escaped, was shocked by the Georgia shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be more,'' Ms. Bruschke said. ``Where does this  
start? Aren't there warning signs?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Blair was troubled that anyone would want to emulate Harris  
and Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like how people are trying to copycat the Columbine  
shooting,'' she said. ``Those two kids are famous because they 
killed people, and that's not what this should be about.''

	Christian Curry, 25, said Wednesday that he suffered from  
bigotry and harassment for nearly a year until he was fired in 
April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they fired Curry for expense account  
abuses, but he said it was because of his race and because they 
thought he was homosexual after nude photos of him appeared in a 
gay men's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain the $1.35 billion figure, Curry's lawyer,  
Benedict Morelli, said: ``When you punish someone who is worth $45 
billion, you don't sue for a million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest development in an odd case.  
</P>
<P>
	Four months after they fired Curry, company officials told  
police he was plotting to plant racist and homophobic e-mail in 
their computers. Curry was arrested last August on charges of 
forgery, coercion and computer trespass. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Manhattan district attorney's office dropped charges  
against Curry on Wednesday and is now investigating Morgan Stanley 
and an informant who tipped them to the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant, C. Joseph Luethke, was a college acquaintance of  
Curry's who told Morgan Stanley about the e-mail scheme and at the 
same time put Curry in touch with a computer hacker -- actually an 
undercover police officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry's lawyer, Earl Rawlins, admits that Curry paid the hacker  
$200 to plant the phony e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Luethke and Morgan Stanley officials never revealed  
to investigators that they were negotiating with each other. 
Assistant District Attorney Leroy Frazier said this ruined both as 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within days of the defendant's arrest,'' Frazier said,  
``officials at Morgan Stanley wired a $10,000 payment into an 
account designated by the confidential informant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanmarie McFadden, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said the  
firm had not seen Curry's lawsuit, but she said it ``regrets the 
decision on the part of the DA's office to drop the charges against 
Christian Curry.''

<HEADLINE> European Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank left its key  
interest rate unchanged at 2.5 percent at its regular meeting 
Thursday, as was widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank cut the rate by half a percentage point April 8, the  
first reduction since it took over monetary policy for the 11 
European Union nations that adopted the euro currency on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It said at the time that that cut, which was bigger than  
expected, would be the last for the foreseeable future, telling 
European capitals that it was their turn to do their part to revive 
lagging growth and cut unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Compromise on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asserted today that NATO's  
bombing campaign is working and insisted the alliance will not 
compromise on its demands for the return of ethnic Albanians to 
Kosovo under allied protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is united in our determination to persist as long as it  
takes to achieve these goals,'' the president said in brief remarks 
in the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made no mention of the most contentious issue facing the  
alliance as its bombing campaign entered its ninth week -- whether 
and when to introduce ground troops into Kosovo to get the 
displaced Albanians back home before winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugees must go home with security and self-government,''  
Clinton said, with Defense Secretary William Cohen and Joint Chiefs 
Chairman Gen. Henry H. Shelton standing at his side. ``Serbian 
forces must leave Kosovo, an international security force with NATO 
at its core must deploy to protect people of every ethnicity and 
faith in Kosovo. On this, our country is speaking with a single 
voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said NATO would not waver, even as public support for  
the bombing campaign has waned in some allied countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will also continue our military campaign until the  
conditions are met,'' he said. ``I believe the campaign is 
working.'' He cited recent NATO claims that signs of dissent within 
Serbia are beginning to mount, including reports of desertions by 
hundreds of Serb soldiers and protests in some Serb communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Milosevic should know that he cannot change the  
fundamental terms that we have outlined because they are simply 
what is required for the Kosovars to go home and live in peace,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised the House of Representatives for passing  
legislation Tuesday that would provide $12 billion for operations 
related to the bombing campaign, including about $1.1 billion in 
humanitarian aid to the Albanian refugees and the Macedonian and 
other ``front-line'' states that are hosting hundreds of thousands 
of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely imperative that the Senate follow suit  
without delay,'' he said. Senate leaders were hoping the chamber 
would approve the measure today. Clinton said he would sign the 
measure as soon as it reaches his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Justice Department, spokesman Myron Marlin said the FBI  
has agreed to send agents to Kosovo, as soon as conditions permit, 
to gather forensic evidence for any future war-crimes tribunal. 

</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who was due to meet with  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright late today, said all the NATO 
allies had agreed not to send ground troops into Kosovo until ``the 
endgame'' to secure a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	While Britain has advocated preparations for a ground war in  
case the air attacks fail to produce results, another NATO ally, 
Germany, is against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am against any change in NATO strategy because I believe it  
is beginning to take effect,'' German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
said in Brussels, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stirred speculation about U.S. policy Tuesday when he  
said no option should be ruled out on the use of ground troops, 
although he also said NATO should continue on its present course of 
airstrikes. Previously, Clinton had said he had no intention of 
introducing ground troops into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, appearing before a Senate subcommittee before her  
meeting with Cook, conceded that NATO's ``objectives are not easily 
achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We all want this confrontation to end, but we must have the  
patience and the spine to make sure it does on the right terms,'' 
she told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing ``how you come to the end of this,'' Albright  
conceded the possibility that Milosevic would remain in power under 
an agreement she suggested might be negotiated by Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Serbians would be better off without him, but  
we have to remain focused on what the objectives of this campaign 
are,'' she said. Albright said a NATO force including Americans 
would have to remain at the core of any international peacekeeping 
force. But she also raised the possibility that Serbia might be 
able to keep some of its forces ``around holy sites'' in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is divided on the administration's strategy in the  
conflict, now in its ninth week. Some members question U.S. 
involvement, others would send in ground troops, and still others 
are critical of Clinton's tactics against the Serb-led Yugoslav 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also considerable backing for the president.

<HEADLINE> Boys May Be Impacted by Body Types </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Long legs, a tiny waist and a big bust made Barbie  
the target of critics for giving girls an unrealistic body ideal. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, chiseled pectorals, abdominals and biceps have put male  
action figures under similar scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers who studied boys' favored action figures found they  
preferred ``very muscular figures,'' said Harrison Pope, a Harvard 
University psychiatrist and author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of male action figures placed on the market since  
the 1960s have been beefed up to bulky, inhuman proportions, 
leading boys to believe muscle equals masculinity, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before then, ``people weren't using anabolic steroids so men  
would lift weights and stay within their natural body size,'' Pope 
said. ``But now, the unnatural is possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers measured the circumference of GI Joe's waist, chest  
and biceps at different stages of development over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	The original GI Joe from the 1960s, scaled to human dimensions,  
had a biceps circumference of about 12 inches, similar to an 
ordinary man. But a GI Joe Extreme from 1997 had a biceps 
circumference of more than 26 inches -- almost the size of a small 
man's waist. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Hasbro Inc., which makes GI Joe,  
Star Wars and a host of other figures, said action heroes aren't 
designed to resemble the meek and the mortal. 
</P>
<P>
	``As for our superhuman figures like Batman and Superman, they  
are based on cartoon characters and their proportions are likely to 
remain superhuman,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the buffed play toys could be leaving impressions on young  
boys, said Martin Zelin, a Tufts University psychology professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as women who are anorexic have been influenced by the  
images of thin models, boys could be influenced by muscular men,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft May Unseal Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. said Thursday it would  
make it easier for news organizations to get confidential documents 
filed in a lawsuit accusing the world's largest software maker of 
predatory business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune, San Jose Mercury News and Bloomberg  
Business News on Thursday asked federal Magistrate Ronald Boyce to 
unseal as many as 40 pretrial exhibits and some 50 other sealed or 
heavily blacked-out documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Salt Lake lawyer James Jardine, representing Microsoft,  
agreed to provide a list specific enough for news organization to 
decide which documents they want to see. 
</P>
<P>
	If Microsoft refuses to turn over a document, Boyce will rule on  
whether it can be released after reviewing it for trade secrets or 
proprietary business information. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure request had the support of Caldera Inc. of Orem,  
which is suing Microsoft for pricing and marketing tactics it 
claims destroyed public demand for DR-DOS, an operating system that 
competed against Microsoft's MS-DOS. Both enable personal computers 
to perform basic functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has managed to keep many documents, including  
deposition transcripts, sealed under a broad court order in the 
three-year-old case. Since February, however, the company has had 
to get Boyce's permission to file documents under a court seal. At 
issue are documents sealed before then and any future papers 
Microsoft may try to seal. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyce said federal court has four boxes of ``very boring''  
sealed documents and ``if a newspaper wants to print them, that's 
fine. It'll drive them right out of business.''

<HEADLINE> Fed OKs Bankers Trust Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve approved Thursday the  
proposed $10.2 billion merger of Bankers Trust Corp. and Germany's 
Deutsche Bank AG, which would create the world's largest financial 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 6-0 by the central bank's board of governors, who  
determined the merger of the nation's eighth-largest bank with 
Germany's largest would not threaten banking competition in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bankers Trust concentrates on banking for big  
corporations and does no business with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, proposed last November, would create a financial  
powerhouse with $830 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Bankers Trust would be the biggest takeover  
of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank. The institution 
would be larger than UBS AG of Switzerland, currently the largest 
bank, and the recently formed Citigroup Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators apparently were not troubled by Deutsche Bank's  
12 percent stake in the newly formed DaimlerChrysler AG. According 
to U.S. laws that separate banks from other kinds of corporations, 
banks in this country are prohibited from owning more than 5 
percent of a nonfinancial company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's approval was the latest in a series of big hurdles  
cleared by the merger recently, leaving only approval from 
authorities in Canada and New Jersey to be secured. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks said in a statement Thursday they expected the  
merger might be completed as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, under pressure from the U.S. State  
Department, New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi withdrew his 
opposition to the deal, acknowledging that the two banks had made 
progress in resolving Holocaust claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Holocaust survivors and heirs have been seeking restitution for  
millions of dollars in Jewish property and financial holdings 
stolen by the Nazis in the World War II era and hidden in various 
European banks. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official had warned that opposition to the  
merger on political grounds could chill the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state's banking regulators and European Union  
authorities have also approved the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In the resolution of another matter, Bankers Trust agreed in  
March to pay $63.5 million in fines to settle federal prosecutors' 
charges that it boosted its financial performance by unlawfully 
diverting millions of dollars from unclaimed customer accounts into 
its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea entered in a federal court brought a speedy resolution  
to accusations that the bank made false entries in its books to 
conceal the true source of $19.1 million its employees diverted.

<HEADLINE> Top Government Aide Killed in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Gunmen waiting in ambush shot and killed a top  
government labor official as he left for work Thursday, in what 
Italian political leaders were quick to call an apparent act of 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The killers -- at least two young men -- lay in wait for Massimo  
D'Antona in a stolen van outside his home near the city center. 
They opened fire when he stepped outside, hitting him at least 
three times in the chest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Rosa Russo Jervilino said police found two .38  
caliber guns at the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The circumstances of the killing have not yet been  
reconstructed in detail, but from what we know so far we can say 
that there is little doubt of the precise preparation of the ambush 
and of the cold and professional execution,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on a possible motive. Suggestions  
ranged from a protest against Italy's participation in NATO to 
D'Antona's standing as a reformer. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were investigating a claim of responsibility to  
Rome's Il Messagero daily in the name of the feared leftist Red 
Brigades. Other claims came on behalf of the lesser-known Armed 
Communist Cells and the little-known right-wing Armed Phalanx. 
</P>
<P>
	Jervilino called an emergency meeting of the national security  
commission and Walter Veltroni, the leader of the center-left 
governing coalition's main party, urged a state of maximum alert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the plain sense of a return to the years of the darkest  
period of our country,'' said Veltroni, head of the Democrats of 
the Left. 
</P>
<P>
	Veltroni was one of many to liken the killing to those of the  
``Years of Lead'' -- the 1970s and 1980s, when Red Brigade bullets 
killed hundreds in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona, 51, was considered one of the country's most  
accomplished labor lawyers and served as Labor Minister Antonio 
Bassolino's top aide. He was Transport Ministry undersecretary in 
the 1995-96 government of then-Premier Lamberto Dini. 
</P>
<P>
	President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and others went to the morgue to  
pay homage to D'Antona, and labor groups planned days of protests 
in cities across Italy.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Jr. Still Having Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Whenever Ken Griffey Jr. is in Minneapolis, he  
goes to see his close friend, Kirby Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first came into the league, he treated me like I was  
somebody and not a rookie,'' the Seattle Mariners' slugger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett, former star for the Minnesota Twins who now is an  
executive vice president with the team, offered Griffey some good 
advice. Griffey still uses it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Smile and do what you've got to do,' '' Griffey  
said. '' `Just play hard and have some fun.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The charismatic Griffey is still smiling and having fun 11  
seasons later. He's one of the most popular players in the game and 
perhaps the best. 
</P>
<P>
	He's an American League MVP, a three-time AL home run champion,  
a nine-time All-Star and a nine-time Gold Glove center fielder. 
He's led the majors in voting for the All-Star game the past three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey is off to a fast start this season with 16 home runs in  
39 games to share the major league home run lead with Tampa Bay's 
Jose Canseco. He has homered in five of his last six games, and he 
has hit in nine straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, Seattle will be at Minnesota and Griffey plans to  
visit Puckett in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett led the Twins to World Series titles in 1987 and 1991,  
before being forced into early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Griffey's first season, Puckett told him to enjoy  
baseball as much as he could because it was a gift. Puckett's words 
were prophetic. He was forced out of the game in 1996 when an early 
form of glaucoma left him blind in his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey remembers Puckett's message fondly.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was towards the end of my rookie season and we were playing  
Minnesota and I didn't run out a ground ball,'' Griffey said. ``He 
said, `Show a little more effort. You ain't got to run under four 
seconds, but just do a little more. And smile.' That always 
stuck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another baseball elder whom Griffey has listened to is Chili  
Davis of the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always gives me calls during the season when I've done  
something wrong and when I've done something right,'' Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the late Jackie Robinson. He appreciates everything  
his father, former major leaguer Ken Griffey Sr., has done for him 
and he appreciates everything Robinson did for today's black 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did everything you ask somebody to do and more,'' Griffey  
said. ``He endured the name-calling, the dirty play. If you're the 
only one, it's always hard. He's the one who did it for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners have another star in Alex Rodriguez, a three-time  
All-Star shortstop. Last season, Rodriguez joined Canseco and Barry 
Bonds in the majors' 40-40 club with 42 homers and 46 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey enjoys watching young players develop into stars. He  
knows Rodriguez is a special talent. Rodriguez is good enough to 
play anywhere on the field, Griffey says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at our shortstop,'' he said. ``He could play second base  
if he wanted. Third base. First base. The outfield positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't matter if a player isn't a center fielder like  
Griffey. If he's got talent, Griffey likes him. He particularly 
enjoys watching Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and Red Sox 
right-hander Pedro Martinez, whom he thinks might be the best 
pitcher in the game today. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he enjoys hitting against Martinez.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the one guy who's going to come after you,'' Griffey  
said. ``He's a skinny kid who gives you everything he's got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Griffey with a smile: ``I don't like pitchers.''  
</P>
<P>
	Among his other favorite players:  
</P>
<P>
	Derek Jeter, Chuck Knoblauch, Bernie Williams and David Cone of  
the world champion Yankees; Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox; 
Mark McGwire of St. Louis; Roberto Alomar of Cleveland; Mo Vaughn 
of Anaheim; former teammate Randy Johnson of Arizona; Charles 
Johnson and Cal Ripken of Baltimore; Curt Schilling and Scott Rolen 
of Philadelphia; Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez of Texas; Tony 
Gwynn of San Diego, and Wade Boggs of Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of ballplayers who do great things for their  
ballclubs,'' Griffey said. ``Whatever it takes to win. That's all 
that matters.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early  
Friday following remarks from U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin 
that the United States had no intention to use its currency as a 
trade policy tool. Japanese stocks were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 124.52 yen in early trading, up 0.04 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
124.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 47.29  
points, or 0.29 percent, to 16,152.70 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Thursday, the average closed up 71.81 points, or 0.44 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was supported by reassuring  
comments from Rubin that the United States was not about to use the 
greenback to reduce the country's trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's remarks in Washington on Thursday came following news of  
a record-high U.S. trade deficit of $19.7 billion for March. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials in the past have used the currency as a trade  
policy measure in an attempt to pare the nation's ballooning trade 
deficits by pushing its trade partner's currencies, such as the 
yen, higher. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japan's exports more expensive aboard and  
thus less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.98 yen, down  
from 132.44 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, some investors bought shares on dips after  
the Nikkei average closed below 17,000 points Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips were mixed. Sony, TDK and Honda Motor were slightly  
lower, while NEC, Toyota Motor and Fujitsu were among early 
gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 1.25 points, or 0.09 percent, to 
1,303.12. The TOPIX closed up 1.26 points, or 0.10 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 20.65  
points to 10,866.74 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.330 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.295 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.51 yen from 101.82 yen.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another policeman came forward Thursday to  
testify that Officer Justin Volpe brazenly showed off the stick 
prosecutors say he used to torture a Haitian immigrant in a 
stationhouse bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the stand at the federal trial of five policemen, Officer  
Michael Schoer said Volpe taunted him by putting the end of an 
excrement-soiled stick in his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoer told the jury that he at first thought the feces were  
from the puppy Volpe kept around the station. Instead, Volpe told 
him it was human excrement, Schoer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, is charged with ramming a broken broomstick into  
Abner Louima's rectum and mouth in a fit of rage, inflicting severe 
internal injuries. Prosecutors say Volpe mistakenly thought the 
Louima, 32, had punched him in a melee outside a Brooklyn 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutality case, involving a black Haitian immigrant and five  
white officers, has heightened tensions between the police 
department and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, however, has opened a breach in the vaunted police  
code of silence. Schoer was the fourth patrolman from the precinct 
to testify about seeing Volpe with a stick in the station around 
the time of the alleged bathroom assault. 
</P>
<P>
	In a more detailed account never before made public, a police  
sergeant, Kenneth Wernick, testified on Wednesday that Volpe had 
bragged about about brutalizing the prisoner and showed off the 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Wernick's damaging testimony, like Schoer's, ended without  
cross-examination. Outside court, Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, 
refused to say why he didn't question the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiese, Volpe and two other officers, Charles Schwarz and Thomas  
Bruder are charged with violating Louima's civil rights by beating 
him en route to the police station. Schwarz also is accused of 
holding down Louima in the bathroom. A fifth officer is charged 
with covering up the incident.

<HEADLINE> Southwest CEO's Health Made an Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A shareholder is worried about the longevity of  
Southwest Airline's leader, since Herb Kelleher is considered the 
brain trust of the low-cost carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal put forward by shareholder Michael Schaefer would  
have made chairman, CEO and president Kelleher choose between 
running either the board or day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer's concern was with the airline founder's penchant for  
cigarettes, Wild Turkey liquor and frequently flying aboard an 
airline that routinely offers fat- and salt-laden peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer had warned in his proposal that ``Kelleher's longevity  
is speculative, since he is a chain smoker, 67, and a frequent 
flier. Unless nudged by the shareholders to divide his control and 
responsibility he simply won't do it,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders didn't vote on the issue because Schaefer didn't  
attend Thursday's meeting. A Southwest spokeswoman said his flight 
on another airline was canceled. Schaefer was not immediately 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher has always had a tongue-in-cheek style that has created  
a corporate culture at Southwest which is known as a casual airline 
with high customer satisfaction. Fortune magazine named it the 
country's most admired airline, and this year, the best place to 
work in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher himself has become an icon as a personable and savvy  
leader. As for his personal habits, they're probably not that 
healthy, he and his staff admit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelleher, who has been chairman of the carrier since 1978 and  
CEO and president since 1981, said he doesn't think he smokes too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that he gives up drinking every February and  
there will be a Leap Year in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to Pope Gregory and the Gregorian calendar I now have  
to stop drinking for an extra day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boardmembers Travis Johnson and Walter Mischer said Kelleher's  
zany comments and spirited ribaldry are good for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great asset. It brings nourishment to the  
shareholders,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Approves TV License Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- EchoStar Communications Corp. was cleared by  
federal regulators Wednesday to acquire the last available U.S. 
license to beam TV shows and other services directly to pizza-sized 
dishes at people's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission's action should make  
Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar a stronger competitor in the 
satellite TV business. 
</P>
<P>
	It also should help EchoStar better compete against cable TV  
companies, the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
	EchoStar is acquiring the license and other assets from MCI  
WorldCom and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.. Both MCI and News Corp. 
will be investors in EchoStar. 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, the deal means more channels and services by  
early 2000. The company has said it will have the ability to 
provide more than 500 channels of programming, Internet access and 
other data services at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	It also helps EchoStar's technical efforts to provide satellite  
TV viewers with local broadcast channels -- a move that requires 
both extra channel space and federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``By allowing companies like EchoStar to become stronger  
competitors to cable, the FCC is clearing the way for consumers to 
have more choices in how they get their television programming,'' 
said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard.

<HEADLINE> Auction House Pulls Malcolm X Diary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A bloodied diary of Malcolm X was taken off  
the auction block Thursday after the family of the slain civil 
rights leader charged it had been stolen and threatened to sue to 
halt the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, a San Francisco auction house, said  
it will hold on to the diary until attorneys for the city of New 
York or the person who consigned the book direct them to send it 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best thing that can happen at this time,'' said  
Joseph Fleming, the attorney representing the six daughters of 
Malcolm X. ``Certainly they'd like to have this done with and over, 
but the first step was to have the sale halted. This is in line 
with what we hoped and anticipated would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction house would not identify the person who consigned  
the book, but spokeswoman Catharine Williamson said the collector 
is a reputable person who has dealt with Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The red, 146-page diary, pierced by three bullet holes, was  
found in the left breast pocket of the suit Malcolm X was wearing 
when he was assassinated Feb. 21, 1965, in New York. It was used as 
an address book and lists names and telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is worth an estimated $30,000 to $50,000, and was last seen  
when it was used as evidence in the trial of three men convicted of 
his assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield spokesman Levi Morgan said the auction  
house office was approached a few months ago by the collector, who 
said he acquired the diary from someone who obtained it in a court 
evidence purge. It was scheduled to be displayed in Los Angeles on 
Friday and be auctioned in San Francisco on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Fleming, an attorney representing the Muslim leader's six  
daughters, said that even if the court file was purged, Malcolm X's 
relatives should have been offered any personal materials it 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
	New York investigators have worked since last week to learn how  
the book disappeared from 5,000 pages of documents turned over to 
the city's Municipal Archives in 1993. Only an empty envelope 
labeled to contain the diary was there, said archive director 
Kenneth Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't offered to the family in 1965, it certainly  
should be now,'' he said.

	Georgia School Shooting Wounds 6  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- No one was killed today when a 15-year-old  
boy, apparently troubled by a broken romance, opened fire in a 
suburban Atlanta high school. Witnesses said the boy shot randomnly 
and fired at people below the waist, so as to injure but not kill. 
Six people were hit by the shots at Heritage High School, with none 
of the injuries being life-threatening. The student was carrying a 
.22-caliber rifle and a .22-caliber revolver. Authorities said the 
boy has been charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, and may 
face other charges. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate OKs Gun-Show Restrictions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With yet another school shooting occurring in  
the United States, the Senate today narrowly passed restrictions on 
firearms sales at gun shows and pawnshops. Vice President Al Gore 
broke a tie vote in order to pass the curbs opposed by most 
Republicans. The proposal would require background checks for all 
sales at gun shows. It also would close what gun control advocates 
said was a loophole that allows anyone to pawn his gun and reclaim 
it without undergoing a check. 

</P>

	Feds Approve Bankers Trust Merger  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve approved today the  
proposed $10.2 billion merger of Bankers Trust Corp. and Germany's 
Deutsche Bank AG, which would create the world's largest financial 
institution. The vote was 6-0 by the central bank's board of 
governors, who determined the merger of the nation's eighth-largest 
bank with Germany's largest would not threaten banking competition 
in this country. The merger, proposed last November, would create a 
financial powerhouse with $830 billion in assets.

	House Approves Missile Defense Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is expected to sign  
legislation passed today that would commit the United States to an 
anti-missile national defense system. The legislation, passed 
345-71, states that it is the policy of the United States to 
deploy, as soon as technologically possible, an effective system 
capable of defending U.S. territory against limited ballistic 
missile attack.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Belgrade and its suburbs were  
heavily bombed by NATO jets today, leaving three patients dead at a 
hospital hit hard in the attacks. Homes of three European 
ambassadors were damaged, as was the Libyan embassy. There were new 
accounts of desertions in the Yugoslav army, and there was a fresh 
round of diplomacy in Moscow involving Russian, Finnish and 
American envoys.

needs of Kosovo after eight weeks of NATO bombing and the expulsion 
of an estimated 800,000 ethnic Albanians by Serb forces. Among 
other things, the U.N. team will try to determine what is required 
to facilitate the return of hundreds of thousands of people whose

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Motor Speedway today lifted

credential partly because the magazine ran a photo of fans killed 
at a race. The ban had raised concerns at several newspapers around 
the country, and the Chicago Tribune said it wasn't going to cover 
the May 30 race as a result. However, speedway president Tony 
George decided to reinstate the credential for SI's senior auto 
writer, Ed Hinton.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Finally Get H.S. Diplomas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDNER, Mass. (AP) -- Decades ago, Harding Mason left high  
school in his junior year to fight in the Pacific, learning his 
history lessons of World War II firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he and 38 other veterans received what they  
abandoned long ago, their diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It fills a void,'' said Mason, 75, waving his diploma aloft on  
the stage of Gardner High School as his grandchildren gave him a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was the first held by Operation Recognition, a  
program developed by the Massachusetts Department of Veterans 
Services to award diplomas to honorably discharged veterans and 
those who earned high school equivalency degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	About 600 Gardner students, veterans' relatives and former  
teachers gathered with government officials to witness the 
graduation. Former President Bush, former Sen. Bob Dole and 
director Steven Spielberg sent letters of congratulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid cries of ``Grandpa, Grandpa!'' the veterans received  
diplomas on a stage draped with patriotic bunting. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine honorees were killed in combat and received diplomas  
posthumously. Mason accepted a second diploma for his older 
brother, Leslie, who was killed in the North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Students decorated the library with old yearbooks and student  
newspapers from the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have made it through what they did,'' said Chris  
Hancock, a senior at Gardner. His grandfather, Edward Misiewicz, 
and great uncle, Edward Gallant, were among Thursday's graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Riley, who left for the Army Air Corps in 1944, the  
first month of his senior year, said the awarding of his degree 
carried a surprising significance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize how much that diploma would mean to me,'' he  
said, ``until now.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Walk 80 Miles for Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- As a truck loaded with the bones of their  
ancestors made its way from Massachusetts to New Mexico, more than 
200 Pueblo Indians were walking on an 80-mile pilgrimage to be 
there when it arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were using the route their ancestors took 160 years  
ago, when disease and warfare decimated Pecos Pueblo. Most of the 
survivors moved to Jemez Pueblo, now a small community of scattered 
adobe houses about 50 miles north of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	To unify the tribe and reconnect with their culture, a large  
group of people from Jemez Pueblo left on foot Wednesday. They 
headed through the high red rock area of northern New Mexico 
through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains toward Pecos National 
Historic Park, about 15 miles east of Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
	There, on Saturday, they will meet a truck that is bringing home  
the bones of 1,912 people excavated between 1915 and 1929 in New 
Mexico's upper Pecos Valley by archaeologist Alfred Kidder. The 
pueblo plans a burial ceremony at the monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard University handed over the remains Tuesday in the  
largest and perhaps most scientifically significant transfer under 
the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 
which requires the return of Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones, plus objects to be returned next week from Phillips  
Academy in Andover, Mass., represent the foundation of scientific 
knowledge about early cultures of the American Southwest, said 
James Bradley, director of the Peabody Andover museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Jemez Pueblo Gov. Raymond Gachupin said the walk to the Pecos  
monument was a way for the entire community to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's mostly to pay tribute to our ancestors to give us  
an idea of the pain and tribulations that they went through,'' he 
said. ``For them, it was a matter of survival. For us, it is a 
matter of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walkers on Wednesday, the first day, included the young and old.  
Some wore traditional attire of a cotton dress, sash belt and 
moccasins, while others were in sweats and running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Jemez creation story, Father Sun warned that if  
the people neglected or forgot the traditional ways, he would take 
their lands for someone else. Today, the culture remains strong: 
Children in the 3,200-member tribe learn their traditional 
language, Towa, before English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other pueblos are losing their language,'' tribal official  
Cruz Toya said. ``The reason we are here is to show the people, our 
ancestors, we care. By doing this we also teach the kids our 
language and culture. Hopefully, they will carry this on and tell 
their kids the history we made.''

<HEADLINE> Nude Statue Will Return in Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A nude statue that was banned in Boston by the  
city's bluenoses a century ago as a symbol of debauchery is being 
returned to its spot at the Boston Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a $60 million library renovation, the bronze  
``Bacchante and Infant Faun's'' could be in place by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue, by Frederic Macmonnies, depicts a woman holding a  
naked infant in one hand and a bunch of grapes in the other. The 
statue's name is a derivation of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiled in 1895 at the height of Boston's temperance movement,  
it was branded a ``monument to inebriety.'' The Rev. James B. Brady 
attacked it as ``strumpetry'' and ``the worst type of harlotry with 
which the earth was ever afflicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No tipsy statue for the public library,'' shouted the Boston  
Post, which campaigned against the figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities simply laughed. ``Too naughty for Boston Library,''  
read a headline in the New York Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuss so outraged library architect Charles F. McKim, who had  
commissioned the work, that he bestowed the sculpture on New York's 
Metropolitan Museum. ``Removed from Puritan surroundings to this 
Metropolis, where she belongs,'' McKim wrote to the sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
	A replica was commissioned by the Boston Public Library in 1993  
and stands inside the building. That is the statue that is going to 
be moved to the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The outrage was a precursor to the puritanical wrath that  
flourished in 1920s Boston, which banned Henry Miller novels, D.H. 
Lawrence's ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' and dancer Isadora Duncan.

	COLUMBUS, N.C. (AP) -- Robert L. Turner, who helped create the  
Eastern Airlines shuttle service between New York and Washington in 
1961, died Saturday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner began working for Eastern in 1934 as a ticket agent in  
Atlanta. After service in the Air Transport Command during World 
War II, he joined Northeast Airlines and rose to vice president. He 
also worked for the Air Transport Association, where he became 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, he returned to Eastern and two years later the shuttle  
was introduced. The service was radical at the time because it 
guaranteed seating without reservations and its low fare. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from Eastern in 1969, Turner leased airliners to  
meet peak demand of Eastern and Air Canada.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Donald K. White, a former newspaper  
business writer and editor, died Tuesday of pulmonary disease. He 
was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who had hoped to be a doctor, abandoned his premed  
studies at the University of San Francisco when he was asked to 
dissect a frog. 
</P>
<P>
	He quit school and worked for the El Paso Times, the Sacramento  
Union and the Humboldt Star in Winnemucca, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	White returned to San Francisco as a business writer for the  
Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco 
Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 years as business editor at the Examiner, he joined the  
Crocker Bank as vice president for advertising and public 
relations, then returned to the Chronicle in 1974 as business 
editor and columnist. 
</P>
<P>
	His columns often featured a middle-class San Francisco couple  
named George and Adele, who lived in the Marina with their poodle, 
Sir. White used the couple as a column device for more than 30 
years. 
</P>

	White retired in 1989. He is survived by his wife, Donna  
Balzarini; a son; and a brother.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tony Award-winning actor Henry Jones, whose  
career on Broadway and in movies and television spanned more than 
half a century, died Monday from injuries suffered in a fall at his 
home. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	The character actor's bulldog face was familiar from dozens of  
Broadway plays and films and 350 television shows, where he played 
everything from judges to janitors and murderers to ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	When he began his career, ``the casting directors didn't know  
what to do with me,'' Jones once recalled. ``I was never tall 
enough or good looking enough to play juvenile leads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did have several memorable roles.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, he was the handyman killed by deadly child Patty  
McCormack in the Broadway play ``The Bad Seed,'' a role he repeated 
in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Louis Howe,  
confidante of Franklin D. Roosevelt, in ``Sunrise at Campobello.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His three dozen films included ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance  
Kid,'' ``Arachnophobia,'' ``The Grifters'' and Alfred Hitchock's 
``Vertigo,'' in which he played a coroner and delivered a 
four-minute monologue. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Philadelphia and educated at St. Joseph's College, Jones  
began his career with theater work in the 1930s and made his 
Broadway debut in 1938 as a gravedigger in ``Hamlet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His movie career started in 1943 with Irving Berlin's ``This Is  
the Army.'' He was an Army private at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	His TV roles began when the medium was in its infancy, with such  
classics as ``Playhouse 90.'' More recently, he was Sam in the 1994 
Hallmark Hall of Fame production of ``Breathing Lessons,'' and in 
1995 was the Assayer in ``Picture Windows.''

</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jerome Jay Wolken, a Carnegie Mellon  
University biophysicist who invented a lens system that gave sight 
to some legally blind people, died May 10. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	People with cataracts were the main beneficiaries of his Light  
Concentrating Lens System, developed in the 1980s for use in 
eyeglasses. It reproduced the lenses in deep-sea creatures' eyes 
that allow them to see in almost total darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	One patent for the system involved a pear-shaped lens 10 times  
more sensitive to light than a standard camera lens. 
</P>
<P>
	To develop the system, Wolken researched deep-sea optics at the  
Marine Biological Laboratory and the Oceanographic Research 
Institute at Woods Hole on Cape Cod, Mass., as well as similar 
institutions in Miami, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolken earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from the  
University of Pittsburgh. He taught at his alma mater in the 1950s 
and was named a professor of biophysics biology in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Carnegie Mellon appointed him a professor and  
head of the biological sciences department at Morrison Carnegie 
College. He wrote nine books in his field and edited two others in 
additions to contributing many papers to scientific journals.

<HEADLINE> Sculpture Garden Dedicated in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sculpture garden first proposed 30 years ago  
for the National Mall was dedicated Wednesday by Hillary Rodham 
Clinton as a place to rest and romp among shady trees, water and 
modern works. 
</P>
<P>
	``This makes a powerful statement that art should be accessible  
to all people,'' the first lady said about the garden, which opens 
to the public Sunday as part of the National Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	After the dedication, she strolled through the garden past Barry  
Flanagan's ``Thinker on a Rock,'' a whimsical twist on Rodin's 
``The Thinker'' that shows a long-eared, pensive rabbit; and more 
austere works such as David Smith's pioneering 1965, welded steel 
``Cubi XXVI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked in other corners amid the oak, magnolia and cedar trees,  
azalea bushes and pink geraniums, are a thin sheet of steel, 
``Stele II'' by Ellsworth Kelly; Roy Lichtenstein's ``House I,'' a 
stand-up version of his comic-strip style paintings; and a serene 
slab of stone by Isamu Noguchi called ``Great Rock of Inner 
Seeking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of delay and lack of money, the garden was built  
with a $10 million grant from the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz 
Foundation, a Washington philanthropy also buying many of the 10 
new works to be exhibited. Six other sculptures come from the 
gallery's present collection; the 17th, the bright-orange abstract 
Cheval Rouge'' (Red Horse) by Alexander Calder, is on loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayer money will go to maintain the garden, as it does the  
National Gallery next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Cafritz, the foundation's chairman, said his late  
parents, who established the foundation, would take ``great joy'' 
from seeing children ``romp through the garden'' or gawk at Louise 
Bourgeois' ``Spider,'' a 24-foot spindly bronze work. 
</P>
<P>
	The original 1960s' plans for the garden were abandoned long ago  
after a circular pond that doubled as a wintertime skating rink was 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone thought it wasn't dignified to combine art with a  
skating rink, and we couldn't get money from Congress to do the 
garden,'' said J. Carter Brown, chairman of Washington's Fine Arts 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The garden will have no ``Keep Off the Grass'' signs, but five  
security guards will patrol the two-block area, in part to try to 
keep children from climbing the art works. Some, like Sol LeWitt's 
``Four-Sided Pyramid,'' may prove irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibits will change periodically but be limited to 20th-century  
and 21st-century work. 
</P>
<P>
	The circular pool, newly enlarged and surrounded by benches,  
occupies the middle of the garden, with arching sprays of water. In 
the winter, it will again become a skating rink. A wrought-iron and 
glass enclosed pavilion with indoor and outdoor seating will open 
in the fall as a cafe and restaurant.

<HEADLINE> FEC May Allow Credit-Card Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Election Commission took the first  
step Thursday toward approving federal matching dollars for credit 
card donations made to presidential candidates, a move that would 
give a huge boost to fund-raising on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	All the major presidential campaigns have Web sites that include  
fund-raising sections. The easiest way for donors to contribute is 
via credit card, but existing FEC regulations expressly forbid 
candidates from collecting federal matching funds on those 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC tentatively approved a plan that would allow  
presidential campaigns to begin collecting credit card donations in 
anticipation of receiving matching funds for them on Jan. 1, 2000, 
the same time that they will get federal dollars for other eligible 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the commission -- which is made up of six members split  
evenly along party lines -- did not formally vote, members indicated 
that as soon as some details regarding the security and 
documentation of donations are resolved, the regulations would be 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FEC is going to take the legal steps to make these funds  
matchable,'' said Scott Thomas, the commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission acted in response to a formal request made by  
Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley's campaign in March. 
</P>
<P>
	All five of the commission members present at the meeting  
indicated that they would vote to pass the regulation in some form, 
but they left the final decision to a written vote, by each of the 
six commission members within the next 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clear indication is that the commission wants to do  
this,'' said David Mason, a Republican FEC member. ``It's just the 
details that need to be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring disapproval from the Congress or the president, the new  
regulations would be effective in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan outlined Thursday calls for the campaigns to maintain  
security procedures -- the details of which are still to be worked 
out -- to avoid illegal donations via corporate credit cards or from 
foreign nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many members of the commission stressed, however, that it would  
be unfair to place more restrictions on credit card donations than 
more traditional forms like checks or money orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no more restrictions 1/8on credit card  
donations3/8 than we place on a check,'' Mason said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Travels To Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NIS, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A U.N. humanitarian team touring  
Yugoslavia is trying to resist pressure to get dragged into public 
discussions about who is suffering more -- ethnic Albanians driven 
from their homes or Serb civilians battered by NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission traveled to Kosovo today to see firsthand the  
destruction caused by the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians and by 
the eight-week NATO air campaign. Yugoslav authorities allowed two 
foreign reporters to accompany the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a dinner Wednesday arranged by local officials here in  
Yugoslavia's third largest city, the head of the local civil 
defense agency, Jovan Zlatic, presented a grisly set of photographs 
from the autopsy of a pregnant woman killed here in a NATO attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the objections of Mayor Zoran Zivkovic, the official ended  
his presentation with a picture of the destroyed fetus. The head of 
the U.N. team, Sergio de Mello, was then asked by local Serb 
reporters to comment on what he had seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're deplorable,'' de Mello said. ``Some of them are  
shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But de Mello, a veteran diplomat, added: ``I've told you what I  
think you need to do to stop that,'' meaning reach a political 
solution to the Kosovo crisis, which led to the NATO attack. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched its air campaign March 24 after Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic refused to accept a Western-dictated peace plan 
for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia. 
Kosovo's population is overwhelming Albanian majority, and most 
favor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western alliance has refused to call off the attacks until  
Milosevic halts ``repression'' in Kosovo, withdraws his forces and 
allows an armed international military force with NATO as its core 
to enter the province to supervise the return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The plight of the ethnic Albanians is not unique in recent  
Balkan history. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia began in 1991, 
other ethnic groups have been driven from their homes or subjected 
to other atrocities by rival groups who had been their fellow 
countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporters asked de Mello to compare the plight of the ethnic  
Albanians with that of Serbs forced from their own homes in the 
former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina earlier 
in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never established any hierarchy between victims,'' de  
Mello replied. ``For me, there is no difference between a refugee 
from Kosovo and a refugee from Croatia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. team is traveling through Yugoslavia to assess the  
humanitarian needs caused by the Kosovo conflict and the NATO air 
campaign. Western officials have warned that unless a solution is 
found quickly, it will be difficult to return the nearly 800,000 
refugees before the harsh Balkan winter sets in. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the refugees have little to return to since their  
villages have been burned and their homes destroyed, either by 
marauding Serb forces or NATO airstrikes.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Reaches 7-Month High Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose to another seven-month high  
against the yen Thursday as hopes for higher U.S. interest rates 
overshadowed a discouraging trade report. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also added to Wednesday's gains against the euro  
despite news that the U.S. trade deficit soared to a record high 
for the third straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 124.40 yen from Wednesday's seven-month high  
of 124.21 yen even though the report showed that the trade gap with 
Japan shot up to the highest level in more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Thursday, the euro was quoted at $1.0623,  
falling from $1.0657 in Wednesday's late trading in New York. The 
British pound fell to $1.6075 from late Tuesday's $1.6173. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5090 Swiss Francs, up from  
1.5040; and 1.4662 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4673. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported early Thursday that the March  
deficit totaled $19.7 billion, up 2.9 percent from February. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first three months of the year, the U.S. trade  
deficit was running at an annual rate of $222.6 billion, nearly 
one-third higher than last year's all-time high of $169.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade gap, aggravated by the continuing troubles in foriegn  
economies, hurts the dollar because foreign exporters need to 
convert the dollars they get from U.S. buyers to their local 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar continued to draw support from Tuesday's  
announcement that the Federal Reserve is now leaning toward higher 
interest rates to keep inflation in check. Higher rates make U.S. 
assets more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8413 German marks, up from 1.8352; 6.1767 French francs, up from 
6.1538; and 1,821.49 Italian lire, up from 1,818.18.

<HEADLINE> Report: J.P. Morgan Eyes Japan Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A group of investors led by J.P. Morgan and Co. of  
the United States have showed interest in purchasing troubled 
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, now under state control, a Japanese 
newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment group would sell LTCB after rehabilitating its  
operations, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said in a dispatch from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The major U.S. investment bank does not plan to acquire LTCB to  
expand its own Japanese business at present, the report said, 
quoting sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Ichiro Murakami, a spokesman for LTCB in Tokyo, acknowledged  
that negotiations were under way with an unspecified number of 
companies interested in buying the bank. But he said that in line 
with bank policy he could not comment on any individual case. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known if J.P. Morgan would put up any of its own  
funds, or whether it would get involved in the management of LTCB, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Credit Bank, once one of Japan's premier banks, was  
nationalized last year after regulators determined it would never 
be able to dig way out from under a mountain of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Japanese government had taken over a  
bank since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of LTCB's bad debt was the result of aggressive lending to  
real estate developers before property prices in Japan burst in the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Nihon Keizai also said LTCB has decided to file a  
civil suit against creditors who ran the bank between 1988 and 
October 1998, when it was put under state control, alleging that 
their mismanagement inflicted damage on the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is now assembling figures on how much it will seek in  
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned suit will name dozens of former directors, including  
past presidents, with total damages expected to mount to hundreds 
of millions of dollars, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Gun Trade Group Pulls Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A gun industry group discontinued a planned  
three-year advertising campaign aimed at gaining sympathy for 
recreational use of firearms after just two weeks due to last 
month's Colorado high school slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign's objective was to let opinion leaders know that  
millions of Americans use rifles and guns responsibly for hunting 
and target shooting despite widespread associations of guns with 
crimes and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the foundation's executive director, Doug Painter, said  
Thursday the campaign was pulled a few days after the April 20 
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., left 15 
people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult decision, but we felt that after Littleton,  
the messages in these ads might not be as appropriate, might not be 
as relevant in the context of this moment,'' he said. ``There is so 
much emotion surrounding this issue, we felt our message would be 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Painter said foundation officials also didn't want to offend  
readers. ``There was an understandably emotional reaction against 
everything that has to do with firearms,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, authorities said a student at a school in Georgia  
shot six classmates before surrendering. In Washington, the Senate 
approved fresh restrictions on firearms sales at gun shows and 
pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
	Clive Chajet, who heads his own corporate image consultancy in  
New York, said the gun industry group had no alternative to ending 
the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who attempts to promote the use of guns at this point  
in history is, pun intended, shooting themselves in the foot,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting sports foundation, based in Newtown, Conn.,  
represents 16,000 manufacturers, distributors and retailers of 
firearms and ammunition. It had never before advertised in 
magazines outside those intended for sportsmen and the gun trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry has been under attack in recent years and  
several municipalities have sued gun makers over the public costs 
of violence caused by people using guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation hired the public relations firm Porter Novelli,  
which has represented antitobacco forces in a similar campaign 
against cigarette makers, in August 1998 to develop a campaign to 
get out its message about the safety and popularity of hunting and 
target shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter said Porter Novelli's research indicated ``opinion  
leaders in this country were not so much against the shooting 
sports but were not aware of them. That was a side of the story 
they didn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firm prepared three ads. One showed a rifle below the  
headline ``The very fact that it can be dangerous is what makes it 
safe.'' The ad called the shooting sports ``the safest of all 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Another ad showed a handgun and a target. ``Ever shoot a wad of  
paper into a wastebasket? Then you already understand target 
shooting,'' the ad headline said. It noted there are 21 Olympic 
shooting events. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter said he didn't know how much of the first year's $1  
million media budget was spent before the ads were discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was too soon to tell whether the ad campaign would  
ever be revived. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, an organization of gun owners,  
has been running a campaign for more than a year featuring 
celebrity NRA members like author Tom Clancy, former baseball star 
Nolan Ryan and actor Tom Selleck. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the group, Bill Powers, declined to say whether  
the NRA had adjusted its ad plans in the wake of the Colorado 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ongoing periodic campaign. It doesn't have anything to  
do with'' the shootings in Colorado, he said.

<HEADLINE> Katzenberg Goes After Disney Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The little midget'' could be in for a giant  
amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge has ruled that the Walt Disney Co. owes former studio  
boss Jeffrey Katzenberg a piece of the profits, plus interest, from 
movie projects he worked on before he quit in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge didn't say how much interest Katzenberg will receive  
or when the clock should start ticking on the 10 percent-a-year 
rate. But if Katzenberg gets anything close to the $250 million to 
$500 million he says he's owed, the interest would be tens of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the judge must decide exactly how much money Katzenberg is  
owed. This phase, beginning Monday, is expected to feature the 
return of the central characters in the real-life melodrama of 
Hollywood infighting: Katzenberg and his former boss, Disney 
Chairman Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual spectacle, Katzenberg is going to try to make the  
case that Disney will do tremendously well without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner, Disney's top cheerleader, is in the even more awkward  
position of having to show that its future, while certainly not 
bleak, isn't as rosy as Katzenberg says it will be. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first part of the trial, Katzenberg's lawyer tried to  
show that Eisner had animosity toward his former employee. Under 
questioning, Eisner acknowledged he may have made embarrassingly 
disparaging remarks about Katzenberg, including, ``I think I hate 
the little midget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner said that if he made the remark about Katzenberg, who at  
5-foot-4 is at least a half-foot shorter than Eisner, it was in 
temporary anger after Katzenberg left the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg left when Disney wouldn't promote him to president to  
replace Frank Wells, who had died in a helicopter crash. Katzenberg 
went on to form DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg contends his contract guaranteed him a bonus of 2  
percent of his projects' future income if he ever left Disney. 
Disney says he forfeited that bonus by leaving with two years left 
in the six-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	So now Katzenberg is suing for 2 percent of all profits Disney  
will ever make off nearly every product, including such 
blockbusters as ``The Lion King'' and ``The Little Mermaid,'' 
generated during the 10 years he headed the movie unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney settled with Katzenberg for $117 million, according to  
sources, and both sides agreed to an arbitration proceeding to hash 
out how much more money Katzenberg would get, which products would 
apply, and whether interest would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the retired judge hearing the dispute ruled Disney  
did in fact breach its contract with Katzenberg and therefore owes 
him interest payments on top of the bonus. Katzenberg also is 
entitled to a cut of profits from Disney products sold in theme 
parks and Disney Stores, Judge Paul Breckenridge said.

<HEADLINE> Cablevision Chairman May Buy Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The chairman of Cablevision, already a  
dominant player in New York sports, and his brother were said to be 
leading contenders to buy the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Cablevision Systems Corp. announced it would help  
the New Jersey Devils build an arena in Hoboken, where the NHL 
club's owner said he will move the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams play at New Jersey's Meadowlands sports complex, and  
interest by Charles and Larry Dolan and Cablevision raises more 
questions on the future of the East Rutherford center. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets spokesman Frank Ramos said Thursday the NFL team would not  
comment on whether it is entertaining offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not making an announcement today '' regarding any  
potential sale, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Dolan is chairman of Cablevision, which has majority  
ownership of New York's Madison Square Garden, the NBA's Knicks and 
the NHL's Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan and his brother, a Cleveland lawyer, made an unsuccessful  
bid in September to buy the NFL's Cleveland Browns expansion 
franchise. They also have tried to buy the baseball's Cincinnati 
Reds and New York Yankees, as well as the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	When baseball's Cleveland Indians went on sale last week, the  
Dolans were mentioned. Larry Dolan said then it was ``premature'' 
to say whether he was a prospective buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles and Larry Dolan declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The two are the leading contenders to buy the Jets, according to  
Newsday, citing unidentified people it said were familiar with the 
team's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources also confirmed earlier reports that the NFL club's  
late owner, Leon Hess, had stipulated in his will that the team be 
sold upon his death. Hess died May 7 at 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Shula, retired coach of the Miami Dolphins, could be part of  
the Dolan effort to acquire the Jets, according to Newsday. He was 
part of their bid for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel free to comment on that,'' Shula told the  
newspaper when asked about his possible involvement in the move to 
buy the Jets. He said he enjoyed his relationship with the Dolans 
when they tried to get the Browns franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach Shula on Thursday through the Dolphins were not  
immediately successful. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been estimated that the Jets may sell for about $500  
million. The NFL finance committee voted this week to recommend 
that the Washington Redskins be sold to Daniel Snyder for $800 
million, but that deal would include the team's new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision itself would not be involved in a deal for the Jets  
team, since NFL franchises cannot be sold to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other possible buyers for the Jets was New York Mets  
principal owner Nelson Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets play at Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands sports  
complex, site of the Meadowlands Racetrack and the Continental 
Airlines Arena, home to the Devils and basketball's New Jersey 
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets and Devils are both seeking new arenas, but their plans  
clash with one put forth by the Meadowlands operator, the New 
Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils want to move to Hoboken for a hockey-only venue. The  
Nets would like both teams to locate in downtown Newark, and invite 
the Devils and sports authority to help them build it. 
</P>
<P>
	The authority, however, is offering to build a new arena at the  
complex, then raze the Continental Arena and build an entertainment 
and shopping center in its place. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman has said the economics are better if both  
teams are under one roof, but is still reviewing the three plans, 
all of which would need some taxpayer money as well as state 
permits.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Sign Kosovo-Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he would sign a  
compromise $15 billion bill paying for the assault on Yugoslavia, 
support for victims of Caribbean hurricanes and other items, and 
urged Congress to send it to him quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some unhappiness among Republicans and Democrats alike,  
the Senate began debating the bill and final congressional approval 
was likely today. The House endorsed the legislation on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives were unhappy that most of the measure would be  
paid for out of the federal surplus, which comes from Social 
Security, and that the measure contained projects for some 
lawmakers' districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the pork spending in this bill comes straight out of  
the Social Security trust fund,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, Sen. Ted  
Stevens, R-Alaska, a chief author of the bill, said opposing the 
measure ``would send the wrong message for the young men and women 
who represent this country in uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the White House, Clinton said the measure would rush  
badly needed help to Kosovar refugees and countries bordering on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most important, it will give our military what it needs to see  
its mission through, while maintaining the readiness of our forces 
around the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When GOP senators met privately Wednesday to discuss the  
measure, some complained that all but $2 billion of it would be 
paid for from the federal surplus, participants said. Others were 
upset that most of the claimed savings -- $1.3 billion -- came from 
cutting food stamp funds that would not be spent anyway because the 
healthy economy has reduced dependency on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like'' parts of the bill either, Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters. ``But it probably won't 
get better if it's defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the bill should have cut spending  
more so it would eat away less of the budget surplus, which comes 
from Social Security. He said even though he would probably lose, 
he would use Senate procedures to force supporters to get 60 of the 
100 senators to support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say we want to lock up the money from Social Security'' for  
the pension program, he said of Republicans. ``And then we sit idly 
by and watch it be spent. I'm not going to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very difficult road. A lot of people in  
principle are against the bill, but I believe the bill will pass,'' 
said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest chunk of the package, $12 billion, is for the price  
tag of the U.S. aerial assault on Yugoslavia, aid to Kosovar 
refugees and the Balkan countries, and a general buildup of 
American armed forces worldwide. That is twice the sum Clinton 
originally requested, but the White House has abandoned its early 
insistence that defense spending not directly related to Kosovo 
should be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has $1 billion for a recent spate of hard-hitting  
natural disasters, chiefly last autumn's Hurricane Mitch, which 
pummeled Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Clinton 
originally requested that money in February and Congress approved 
early versions of it in March, but the legislation languished until 
lawmakers used it as a way to speed the military money to passage. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $900 million would replenish the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency's coffers so it can address damage from this 
month's horrific tornadoes in Oklahoma and other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also has $574 million to help American farmers, mainly  
those facing low prices for hogs, wheat and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprinkled throughout the bill are projects large and small that  
lawmakers won for home-state interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens made sure that $70 million in aid for livestock  
producers would include reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and House Majority  
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, each would be entitled to an additional 
$333,000 a year for office expenses. The Senate could spend $10 
million to bring 3,000 Russian political leaders to the United 
States for a month of observing the U.S. government and economy at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains $6.5 million to monitor elections in East  
Timor, which is deciding whether to break free of Indonesia, and 
$1.5 million to add water to drought-stricken San Carlos Lake on an 
Indian reservation in Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Breaks Opening Day Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The new ``Stars Wars'' movie made $28.5  
million on its opening day, shattering the box-office record set in 
1997 by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened at 2,970  
locations, some of which have been playing the movie 
round-the-clock since 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-hour receipts totaling $28,542,349 beat the one-day  
record of $26.1 million set by ``Lost World'' on a Sunday of 
Memorial Day weekend in 1997, box office tracker Exhibitor 
Relations Co. reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' also topped the ``Lost World'' opening-day  
record of $21.6 million, set on the Friday of that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ``Phantom Menace'' should gross $100 million to  
$140 million by the end of its five-day opening Sunday, setting 
more records. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is so big that some employers decided to not fight the  
Force and just pay to send their workers to theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to see this movie, and we thought it would be  
fun to send our whole company,'' said Steven J. Lund, president and 
chief executive of Provo, Utah-based cosmetics seller Nu Skin 
Enterprises, which reserved a theater for all 1,600 employees and 
one guest each.

<HEADLINE>  A Loud Pop, Then Chaos -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The bell for the first class of the day was  
still 20 minutes away, leaving plenty of time for students at 
Heritage High School to mill about the common area next to the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Some nibbled on cinnamon rolls and sipped juice or milk while  
others just conversed with friends. For seniors, it was a time to 
revel in their last full day of school before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were looking forward to getting their yearbooks signed and  
were braced for senior pranks. The previous day, jokesters let 
loose a large bag of crickets, and firecrackers had become almost 
an annual tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Then suddenly, the chatter and laughter was interrupted by a  
loud popping sound. A 15-year-old sophomore wielding a .22-caliber 
rifle was standing in front of the girls' bathroom in the common 
area firing at his schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting in the common area when I heard something that  
sounded like fireworks. I turned around and saw him and I just ran 
out of the school and across the street to my friend's house,'' 
said Brittanie Berry, 15. ``I saw everybody yelling and running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, 15, was a friend of the gunman.  
</P>
<P>
	``I yelled to him, `Hey, what're you doing?' But he just kept  
shooting. And then the kid next to me got shot in the foot. Then I 
started to run,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students took cover under benches and behind planters while  
others raced outside the one-story red brick building into the 
parking lot of the 1,300-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody started throwing their book bags down and trying to  
get out, running as fast as they could,'' said Lee Merritt, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and administrators in other parts of the building  
ushered students into classrooms, telling them to lock the doors. 
At least one teacher took her students into a closet, where she 
recited Bible verses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were screaming at us over the intercom to get to our  
homerooms as fast as we could,'' said Jessie McCumber, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	After wounding six students, the gunman dropped the rifle and  
fled outdoors. He dropped to his knees, pulled out a .22-caliber 
revolver and stuck it in his mouth. But before he could shoot, 
assistant principal Cecil Brinkley talked him into dropping the 
weapon. The suspect broke down sobbing and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, cafeteria worker Teresa Kumar was preparing lunch and  
had walked into the cooler to get fruits and vegetables. When she 
emerged, everybody was gone and there were plates of grits, 
biscuits, and bowls of cereal left sitting on the tables. In the 
common area, she saw a wounded girl lying on the floor bleeding and 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was hollering she wanted her mother and she was hollering  
that she was shot,'' Ms. Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, small groups of students stood outside waiting for rides  
home and trading versions of how the event unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just crazy and chaos,'' said Alaina Mitchell, 16,  
hugging her brother, who had come to school to pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
	When the news first carried reports of the shooting, Janice Pugh  
waited at home for a while, hoping for a phone call from her only 
child, William. Finally she decided she couldn't wait any longer, 
so she went to Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Her voice cracking and her eyes red, she kept one arm wrapped  
around William while her other hand gripped a balled-up tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not knowing what exactly had happened, not knowing what I  
would find, I just prayed that he would be all right,'' she said. 
``I'm just happy that he's OK and I pray for the others.''

<HEADLINE> Coffee Falls on Brazilian Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell sharply Thursday on the Board of Trade of  
the City of New York, ending a four-session rally, after 
forecasters predicted there will be virtually no chance for frost 
in Brazil over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, crude edged higher, while palladium futures  
suffered a meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures had risen explosively in recent days amid belief  
that Brazil may be in for a harsh winter that could freeze blooms 
off coffee trees and sharply reduce the 2000-2001 harvest.

	While forecasters never predicted temperatures would reach  
sustained freezing levels, they previously had said the thermometer 
could drop into the upper 30s over the next few days. The 
unexpectedly cold forecasts before winter officially begins had 
boosted speculation that the world's largest coffee producer this 
year may not escape a damaging freeze, as it has done for the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some meteorologists now say, however, that temperatures will  
drop only into the 40s and that they will moderate next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil produces mainly robusta beans, which are not certified  
for delivery against New York futures contracts. But many roasters 
mix those beans with high-quality arabica beans for gourmet blends. 
</P>
<P>
	Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 3 cents to $1.20 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures edged higher on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange as the United Nations became mired in debate over whether 
to approve another round of an oil-for-aid program for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is operating under an embargo imposed after its 1990  
invasion of Kuwait but is allowed to export 1.9 million barrels of 
oil, equal to $5.2 billion, over six months to buy food and medical 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	That period ends Monday, however, and the U.N. Security Council  
still is trying to determine how to reinstate weapons inspectors 
who were pulled out of the country after Iraq refused to cooperate 
with the program. Iraq also has not submitted a distribution plan 
for such a sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants said the current wrangling could take weeks,  
effectively keeping oil off the market at a time when other major 
oil producers are cutting back output. The two combined could cause 
prices to jump, although investors were cautious in light of recent 
refiner cutbacks that have limited demand for that reduced output. 
</P>
<P>
	June crude rose 15 cents to $17.03 a barrel.  
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures prices tumbled on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid market talk that Russia, the world's largest 
supplier, was selling heavily onto London markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the largest single producer of palladium, which is  
used in jewelry, electronics and the automobile industry. 
Large-scale shipments had been halted since December, however, amid 
bureaucratic delays that have taken place for three consecutive 
years at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	The delays have forced auto manufacturers in particular to  
scramble for available supplies since many use the metal in the 
manufacture of emission-control devices required under clean-air 
laws in a number of countries. 
</P>
<P>
	September palladium fell $7.75 to $328.50 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Chemical Giant To Make Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's largest  
business conglomerate, said Thursday it will invest $2 billion to 
make electric cars and auto parts, primarily for export. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Wang Yung-ching said the chemical giant hopes to  
capitalize on lower tariffs on Taiwanese cars following Taiwan's 
admission by the World Trade Organization, which is expected late 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The group chose to make electric cars because Taiwan's  
conventional car production has fallen too far behind other 
countries for it to catch up, Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past few years, we have focused on chemical products,  
but our next target will be the electric cars,'' Wang told a 
shareholders meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the auto plant will begin in three years after a  
new industrial park in northern Taoyuan County is ready to 
accommodate factories, Formosa officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Formosa auto plant is expected to turn out 500,000 electric  
cars a year after mass production begins in 2006, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has held discussions with several foreign car makers,  
including Renault of France, about possible technology transfer, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they believe there will be a huge market for  
electric cars once technologies become available to produce 
longer-lasting batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Formosa Plastics' plan comes at a time Taiwanese makers of  
conventional cars are bracing for a hard time because of 
competition from foreign carmakers after Taiwan is admitted to the 
WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has agreed to phase down its car import duties from the  
current 30 percent to 17.5 percent by 2008.

<HEADLINE> Two Die in Conn. Store Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- An explosion at a liquor store collapsed  
most of the two-story building, killing two people and trapping 
another in the burning debris for several hours before rescuers 
could reach him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten others were injured when the building housing Vencano's Wine  
&AMP; Liquor store and three apartments exploded on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers dug through the rubble for two people they knew  
were trapped when an explosion collapsed much of the two-story 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified man was found dead, and a 36-year-old victim was  
found alive pinned against a wall and under burning debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was conscious and alert through the rescue,'' Peter  
Siecienski, the city's deputy fire chief. ``The firefighters were 
fighting fire on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Keeler, a store employee, was in critical condition with  
``major'' burns at Bridgeport Hospital, spokesman John Cappiello 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators discovered a second body this morning, pulling the  
unidentified man from the leveled building. 
</P>
<P>
	Siecienski said an initial pass by the dogs failed to turn up  
any scent of a second body, but he said the searchers were not able 
to get to a part of the building until some rubble is removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the blast was unknown, but fire officials said they  
were investigating a report of a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people were admitted to Danbury Hospital. One man was in  
intensive care this morning after undergoing surgery for multiple 
trauma injuries, said Kristine Mascoli, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Four others, including a 5-year-old boy, were listed in good  
condition. Another victim was listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital, which is just blocks from the liquor store, was  
forced to use emergency generators for two hours after the 
explosion knocked out power to the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast also interrupted train service for several hours  
between Danbury and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Day was in the kitchen of her home around the corner from  
the store when she heard the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It actually shook my house and I got scared and ran  
downstairs,'' she said. ``It sounded like a big boom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danbury is about 60 miles northeast of New York City.

<HEADLINE>  Gunman Wounds Six in High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A boy upset over a broken romance shot and  
wounded six students Thursday in yet another school attack in a 
comfortable suburban community, then fell to his knees, stuck a gun 
in his mouth and surrendered in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, my God, I'm so scared,'' he said, according to witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	Exactly a month after the bloodbath in Colorado, the 15-year-old  
sophomore, armed with two guns, opened fire with a rifle about 7:55 
a.m., 20 minutes before classes were to begin at Heritage High 
School. It was the final day of class for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the gunman was running and shooting at no one in  
particular and firing at students below the waist so as not to kill 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were falling on the floor, a lot of screaming, people  
trying to help each other,'' said Joel Thomas, 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in the common area and cafeteria dived for cover under  
benches and behind planters. Others raced outside the long 
one-story red brick building into the parking lot and an area of 
tall pines. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not identify the suspect or suggest a motive. He  
was charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, and prosecutors 
also were considering charging him with weapons violations and 
cruelty to children, District Attorney Richard Read said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman must go before a juvenile court judge before he can  
be charged as an adult, and that probably won't take place until 
Monday, Read said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the victims' wounds were considered life-threatening.  
The girlfriend who had broken up with the gunman was not among the 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage, 20 miles east of Atlanta, is a mostly white, suburban  
school, like Columbine High in Littleton, Colo. About 80 percent of 
graduates go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Columbine High rampage, which left 15 people dead,  
Heritage officials had sent letters to parents of the 1,300 
students to assure them that a similar attack was unlikely at their 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day since then I've been thinking about whether it could  
happen here,'' said Chris Scroggs, 15. ``Last night I was thinking 
that this might be the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the massacre in Colorado, Heritage had video  
surveillance cameras in the hallways and an armed sheriff's deputy 
on duty during school hours. The deputy didn't exchange fire with 
the gunman Thursday, and it was unclear where he was during the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was about to leave for Littleton when he  
received word of the Georgia shooting. The news ``is deeply 
troubling to me, as it is to all Americans,'' he said. ``We thank 
God that the injuries to the students do not seem to be 
life-threatening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After wounding six students, the gunman dropped the rifle and  
walked outside. He pulled out a .22-caliber pistol and pointed it 
through a window at senior Joe Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stood there with the gun, then he dropped to his knees and  
put it in his mouth like he was going to shoot himself and he 
started waving his hands around and pulling the back of his hair,'' 
Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then assistant principal Cecil Brinkley came over. ``He said,  
`Let me have the gun,' and the boy flipped the gun over and handed 
it to him,'' Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And when he got the gun from him, he just quickly put his arm  
around him and held him and the boy started crying and said: `Oh my 
God. I'm so scared. I'm so scared.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley would not comment other than to say: ``I was just doing  
my job. I did what needed to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the wounded students were expected to be hospitalized  
overnight. The most seriously hurt was a 15-year-old girl who 
underwent surgery after a bullet hit her in the buttocks and passed 
through to her intestines. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, a 15-year-old sophomore, said the gunman's  
girlfriend of one year had broken up with him this week. He talked 
to the boy about the breakup on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I have no reason to live anymore.''' Deeter said.  
``And I told him he was crazy. I thought he was just feeling sorry 
for himself because a lot of kids feel like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dunn, a sophomore, said he had seen ``lots of guns'' at  
the teen-ager's home but never heard him mention plans to shoot 
anyone at school. 
</P>
<P>
	But Katie Bir, a freshman and a friend of the gunman's  
ex-girlfriend, said: ``People have been saying he's been wanting to 
do this all year long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deeter said he chatted with the gunman about 10 minutes before  
the shooting started. The gunman was wearing a baggy pullover and 
loose pants, and Deeter didn't see any weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	During the shooting, Deeter said, his eyes locked with the  
gunman's for a moment. ``He had a chance to shoot me when I was in 
the commons area and he shot the kid next to me in the foot,'' 
Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it was the last day for seniors, many students at first  
thought the loud popping sounds were part of a prank. A day 
earlier, a student had released 2,000 crickets in the school. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, students gathered outside the school on a  
track, then boarded buses and headed home. Classes were canceled 
for Friday, but school officials said graduation would go on as 
scheduled May 28.

<HEADLINE> Knievel Breaks Jumping Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND CANYON WEST, Ariz. (AP) -- Motorcycle daredevil Robbie  
Knievel jumped a 200-foot-wide chasm of the Grand Canyon on 
Thursday, breaking his own record. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks erupted and a crowd of about 500 cheered as Knievel  
easily cleared the gorge, 2,500 feet above the canyon floor at the 
Hualapai Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Knievel traveled 228 feet, eclipsing the 223-foot  
record he set in Panama City, Fla., in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 37, ran off the ramp and wiped out in a cloud of dust.  
He did not appear to have suffered any serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wiped out in the head a little,'' Knievel said.  
</P>
<P>
	The jump was televised live by Fox on the East Coast for  
tape-delay airing later Thursday night in the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel was going to attempt the same jump on April 29 but it  
was canceled at the last minute because of wind and cold weather. 
Conditions were much better this time, with clear skies, lighter 
wind and warm temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel said his daredevil father, Evel Knievel -- recovering  
from a recent liver transplant -- had wanted to jump the Grand 
Canyon but never got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	His son achieved notoriety in April 1989 by jumping the  
fountains at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, a stunt that nearly 
killed Evel Knievel 21 years earlier.

<HEADLINE> Schilling Criticizes State of MLB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Curt Schilling has plenty of prospective  
employers. It sounds like the commissioner's office is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling is off to a 7-1 start with a major league-leading four  
complete games. Despite the low-budget Phillies' strong start, he 
is still unhappy in Philadelphia and would welcome a trade to a 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	He had some other ideas on his mind Wednesday during a national  
conference call in which he ripped his team's ownership, baseball's 
leadership and lamented the state of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I would get done if I were commissioner would  
be to have both sides' bargaining teams at the table to resolve the 
contract beyond 2001,'' Schilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would move the Montreal Expos. I would move them to a city I  
knew would support them financially and fan-base wise. I would find 
a spot other than a city where 4,000 people show up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would get rid of interleague play, realign baseball  
geographically,'' he continued. ``I can't get rid of the wild card. 
I hated it when it came in, but I think it's been a good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and one more thing: ``Get rid of the DH,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, the reigning NL strikeout leader and the league's  
first to win seven games this season, is just as outspoken off the 
mound as he is intimidating and dominating when standing atop it. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Phillies broke spring training camp with their $30.36  
million payroll -- fourth-lowest in the National League -- Schilling 
announced that he would waive his no-trade clause for a chance to 
play for a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	But a funny thing happened in the first few weeks of the season.  
The surprising Phillies are 21-17, trailing only the Atlanta Braves 
in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	After pitching his fourth complete game, more than any other  
TEAM in the majors, Schilling said Monday, ``I feel good about 
what's going on here. We're playing good ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Phillies president David Montgomery denied a  
recent report in Forbes Magazine that the Phillies were one of 16 
teams that made money in 1998. The city is deciding whether to kick 
in an extra $80 million that would be necessary if the Phillies get 
their preferred downtown site for a new stadium that will be 
partially funded by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their estimate does not come close to accurately representing  
our 1998 results,'' Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he won his last start in front of 5,104 fans in Montreal,  
Schilling saw it as another example of how the game he grew up 
adoring isn't the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame the fans for it, not for a minute,'' Schilling  
said. ``What happens is you have owners who are in the game that 
don't belong anymore, that don't fit in. And to fit in, they're 
asking for new stadiums funded by taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he would realign baseball's divisions, Schilling said,  
``Why wouldn't you want the New York Yankees and the New York Mets 
playing each other 18 times a year? Why wouldn't you want the 
Chicago Cubs and White Sox battling 18 times for a pennant? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are just too many ridiculous things that haven't been  
taken care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, 32, has two years left on a three-year contract that  
pays him $15.9 million with an option for 2001 at $6.5 million. 
Behind all this bluster, he is off to one of the best starts of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling has a 2.58 ERA, is second in the NL to Randy Johnson  
with 58 strikeouts and is tied with Houston's Jose Lima for the 
league lead in wins. The Phillies are averaging 8.7 runs in his 
seven victories -- five more than they averaged in his 35 starts 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a junky for big-game adrenaline, an intimidating throwback  
to days when pitchers would take the mound in the first inning and 
keep pitching until the game was over. He would make a mighty fine 
starter for Games 1, 4 and 7 of the World Series for any team lucky 
enough to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I take the ball, I make the day I pitch an event in my  
mind,'' he said. ``Even if it isn't, it is to me. It's a major 
thing to me. I make it a major event in my mind, and I play it up 
for four days in my mind. I prepare myself to play a part in a 
major event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Come July, when the trade deadline arrives, we'll see whether  
Schilling gets to pitch in a pennant race -- for real, or just in 
his own imagination.

<HEADLINE> World Economy Said To Be Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The global economy is emerging from the  
financial crisis that began in Asia nearly two years ago, a key 
Clinton official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still at a delicate stage and we are not yet out of the  
woods,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, a State Department official who 
is awaiting Senate confirmation as Deputy Secretary of the 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the Committee for Economic Development, a private,  
nonprofit group, Eizenstat said that key stricken countries do 
``show clear signs of rebounding,'' however. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asia, where the crisis began with the devaluation of the Thai  
currency in July 1997 and spread to Japan, currencies have 
stabilized and stock markets are up. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund is predicting 2 percent growth  
for most Asian economies this year, and more than twice that in the 
newly industrialized Asian economies of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong 
Kong and Singapore, Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, interest rates have declined 18 percentage points  
since March, and Brazilian securities markets have recovered. The 
IMF predicts that positive growth in the second half of the year 
will offset declines in the first. 
</P>
<P>
	And Russia, which defaulted on some debts and devalued its  
currency last August, has taken some positive steps just in the 
past few days, Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised the efforts earlier this week of acting Prime  
Minister Sergei Stepashin to get legislators to approve economic 
reforms required for a new loan from the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	On the domestic front, U.S. bank regulators must more  
aggressively monitor U.S. loans in developing countries, and banks 
must be clearer with regulators about the risks they are taking, 
Eizenstat warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, lenders should bear the most risk of such loans,  
Eizenstat said. They can't count on the IMF or any other 
organization to make them whole when the loans go bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat, currently Undersecretary of State, was tapped for the  
Treasury post last week to succeed Deputy Secretary Lawrence 
Summers, who was nominated to succeeded departing Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Private School Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation allowing IRA-like, tax-free  
accounts to pay private school costs is moving in the 
Republican-led Senate, setting the stage for a likely veto 
confrontation with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday approved a measure --  
similar to one vetoed by Clinton last year -- that would allow 
parents to save up to $2,000 a year in Education Savings Accounts 
and withdraw the money tax-free for public or private school costs 
in kindergarten through 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill cleared the panel after Republicans shot down a  
Democratic attempt to substitute a version of Clinton's $25 billion 
school construction proposal. It does contain a smaller 
construction plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the GOP believes federal help is  
better spent on giving parents freedom to choose the best schools 
than on construction projects that don't address the quality of 
classroom education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many working Americans, taxpayers, are trapped in these  
failing schools,'' Gramm said. ``They are more capable than we are 
of deciding what is best for their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would expand existing accounts that now are used only  
for higher education and raise the annual contribution cap from 
$500 to $2,000. The money could be spent on public, private, 
parochial or home-school expenses such as tuition, books, supplies 
and required uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton argued last year that the cost of the accounts -- about  
$2.6 billion of the bill's overall 10-year price tag of $7.6 
billion -- is money better spent repairing or replacing crumbling 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Education Association, a major Democratic ally,  
cited Treasury Department statistics in contending that 70 percent 
of the benefits would go to the wealthiest 20 percent of families -- 
and only 7 percent of American families have children in private 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Education Secretary Richard  
Riley in a joint letter to senators said the accounts would 
generate little savings, increase tax complexity and ``reward 
families, particularly those with significant means, for what they 
may do in any case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the legislation's main sponsors, Republican Sen. Paul  
Coverdell of Georgia and Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New 
Jersey, told reporters the accounts would help 14 million 
middle-class families save an estimated $12 billion of their own 
money for both public and private education costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This important legislation will benefit all American families,  
especially those families earning under $75,000 a year,'' Coverdell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Bob Graham,  
D-Fla., that would relax revenue bond rules for schools and add 
schools to the projects that can be paid for with tax-exempt 
private activity bonds. That would let each state issue school 
construction bonds each year worth $10 per resident or $5 million, 
whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a proposal to allow tax-free distributions from  
state-sponsored and private prepaid college tuition plans, and 
would extend an expiring tax break for employers who pay for 
college level education expenses for their workers and eliminate 
the 60-month limit on tax deductibility of student loan interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats tried to delete the education IRA provisions and  
replace them with Clinton's proposal to bolster existing revenue 
bond programs, which would raise $25 billion in 2000 and 2001 to 
renovate or build schools. A third of the money would go to the 
poorest inner-city school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to help those who are most in need of  
assistance,'' Sen. Chuck Robb, D-Va., said. 
</P>
<P>
	But voting largely along party lines, the Finance Committee  
defeated their amendment, 12-8, and then approved the original 
bill, with three committee Democrats in support. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the bill would  
move independently in June or July from the Republicans' 
as-yet-unknown plan to cut taxes by $778 billion over 10 years 
using projected budget surpluses. The education measure would be 
paid for by closing certain business tax loopholes and similar 
revenue raisers.

<HEADLINE> Senators Push Rural Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state Senate Democrats asked the Federal  
Communications Commission on Thursday to improve Internet access in 
rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC should consider setting a standard for high-speed  
Internet service and using federal subsidies to make sure it is 
available in remote areas, the senators said. Such subsidies come 
from fees imposed on telecommunications companies and typically 
passed on to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rural communities need the economic and social benefits that  
high-speed Internet access provides. For some of them, it's a 
matter of basic economic survival,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D., said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1996 law, rural areas are supposed to have  
telecommunications services that are ``reasonably comparable'' to 
those in cities, but it was left to the FCC to decide how to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already is distributing nearly $1.7 billion in  
subsidies to schools and libraries -- including those in rural areas 
and inner cities -- for a variety of telecommunications needs, 
including Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard recently called for $2.25 billion to  
fund the program in its second year. That's generating criticism 
primarily from Republicans on Capitol Hill because of fears that it 
could raise phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	In their letter, the lawmakers said that farmers, rural  
businesses and small-town health-care facilities need access to 
high-speed Internet services for transmitting graphics and large 
amounts of data. Farmers, for example, often use satellite imaging 
to decide how much fertilizer and pesticide to use in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators also said the FCC should consider subsidizing  
high-speed Internet and data services via satellite and encourage 
cellular companies to serve remote areas and Indian reservations, 
where there is little phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment on  
the senators' request. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the senators are introducing legislation to create  
an office of rural advocacy at the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are determined not to end up with a country of haves and  
have-nots with respect to advanced telecommunications,'' said Sen. 
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications companies have been racing each other to  
provide high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	An alliance of computer makers and big telephone companies,  
including US West, want the FCC to ease regulations that they said 
discourage modernization. Rival long-distance companies, including 
AT&AMP;T, oppose the move. AT&AMP;T, meanwhile, is seeking to become a 
major provider of Internet service over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was signed by Daschle, Dorgan and, in alphabetical  
order by state, Iowa's Tom Harkin, Minnesota's Paul Wellstone, 
Montana's Max Baucus, Nebraska's Bob Kerrey, North Dakota's Kent 
Conrad, Oregon's Ron Wyden, South Dakota's Tim Johnson and 
Washington's Patty Murray.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Is NBA's Most Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Making history was the farthest thing from  
Darrell Armstrong's mind when he launched his comeback from a 
career-threatening shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Magic guard added the NBA's Most Improved Player  
Award to his postseason haul Thursday, making him the first to win 
both that honor and the Sixth Man Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Armstrong was in so much pain following rotator  
cuff surgery that he thought the hospital was making a mistake by 
releasing him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to check back in. It was that much pain ... I  
couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat,'' he recalled. ``Things like that, 
it makes you appreciate life. It makes you appreciate basketball, 
and it makes you appreciate anything you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong averaged career highs of 13.8 points, 6.7 assists, 3.6  
rebounds and 2.16 steals in 30 minutes a game while coming off the 
bench in 35 of 50 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He improved on his career averages in scoring by 6.9 points, in  
assists by 3.5 assists, in rebounds by 1.8 and in steals by 1.2. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few people in the world of basketball,  
particularly last summer, that worked harder on their game than he 
did, and he continues to work on it,'' Magic general manager John 
Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong received 54 of a possible 118 votes from a national  
panel of sports writers and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen players received votes. Eric Snow of Philadelphia was  
second with 15 votes and Gary Trent of Dallas was third with 14 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Most Improved Player Award has been given since the 1985-86  
season. The Sixth Man Award began in the 1983-84 season. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Gastonia, N.C., Armstrong was not drafted in 1991  
after completing his college career at Fayetteville State. He 
played in the Global Basketball Association, the Continental 
Basketball Association, the United States Basketball League and in 
Cyprus and Spain before signing with the Magic on April 8, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times in our industry, in all sports industry, where  
evaluators of talent forget some basic principles, like does a guy 
compete each and every night ... competitiveness,'' Gabriel said. 
``We talk about it a lot, but it's probably not on a lot of our 
evaluation sheets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, honored last week as the league's top reserve, didn't  
expect to win both awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people had me for most improved, some people had me for  
sixth man,'' he said. ``I have both of them sitting here in front 
of me. It's just a blessing.''

<HEADLINE> Mich. Beating Death Raises Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The arrest of two gas station clerks in the  
slaying of a man who was beaten with a tire iron in front of his 
five children has heated up long-simmering tensions between 
Detroit's many Arab-American store owners and their black 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The black community ``cries out for justice for this family and  
for our community,'' Detroit NAACP President Wendell Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalvin Porter, a black 34-year-old electrician, was killed last  
Friday at a gasoline station in a poor neighborhood on the city's 
east side. Investigators said the clerks attacked Porter after he 
argued with them about comments they supposedly made to his 
12-year-old stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadhel Mazeb, 46, and Adel Altam, 26, were jailed without bail  
on murder charges. Both are immigrants from Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beating, protests outside the Sunoco station have  
forced it to remain closed, and some blacks have called for a 
boycott of Arab-American businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab-Americans first began to dominate the grocery store, liquor  
store and gas station business in Detroit in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s as white business owners fled the city in the wake of 
the 1967 riots. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan Detroit's more than 4 million people include about  
200,000 people of Arab descent, one of the largest Arab populations 
outside the Middle East. The city of Detroit has about 1 million 
people, about 80 percent of them black. 
</P>
<P>
	``The African-American community has too long been the victim of  
mistreatment and disrespect by some who operate and work in stores 
and gas stations in our neighborhood,'' the NAACP's Anthony said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony said Porter's slaying ``is a tragic example of festering  
problems of ill will and ill feelings between African-Americans and 
some Arab-Chaldean store operators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday afternoon, the two sides met at a church at a  
gathering sponsored by the civil rights group, Arab store owners 
and other community and religious groups. About 100 people 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation was tragic, to say the least,'' Ed Deeb,  
president of the Michigan Food and Beverage Association, which 
represents 3,100 Arab-American merchants in metropolitan Detroit. 
``We feel this is not a racial incident but a crime issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several blacks at the meeting disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Williams said she has seen a pattern of racism by Arab  
store owners against black customers. ``We need to boycott these 
businesses,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's racism involved. There's prejudice involved,'' said  
Mary McClendon. ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. It's been 
going on for 400 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic tensions between inner-city residents and store owners  
from immigrant or minority groups are nothing new in America. 
</P>
<P>
	In cities like Los Angeles and Miami, it is between black  
customers and Korean, Vietnamese or Cuban merchants. A generation 
ago, it was Italian and Jewish store owners in black neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland, tensions between Arab-American shopkeepers and  
blacks ran high in the mid-1990s after several inner-city merchants 
were killed and a store clerk was arrested for killing a black 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 study done by the Arab American Institute in Washington  
blamed tensions on a combination of crime, poverty and the presence 
in poor neighborhoods of recent immigrants with successful 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis is the same in every city. It's a crisis of the  
inner city, not enough employment, not enough hope,'' said James 
Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Microsoft Browser Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new survey purports to show that Microsoft  
is winning the Internet browser war in the nation's offices, 
traditionally the domain of its software rival, Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Zona Research Inc. said almost 60 percent of 308 companies in  
its new survey now use Microsoft's Internet browser, an important 
trend that could be a Pyrrhic victory for the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp.'s aggressive push to persuade consumers to use  
its Internet software rather than one from Netscape Communications 
Corp. is at the core of the government's antitrust case against 
Microsoft, scheduled to resume June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A Zona survey in October -- which was cited as evidence in the  
trial -- indicated that 60 percent of companies used Netscape's 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden told the judge that the earlier  
survey ``completely undermines the government's case.'' Lawyers 
also cited the earlier results two other times as they challenged 
government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new survey of 308 corporate technology professionals  
showed that 59 percent identified Microsoft's browser as the one 
they ``personally use the most at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results put Microsoft in the awkward position of playing  
down a survey that trumpets the company's own success. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan argued that the results show  
only which browser the professionals used personally, not 
necessarily which browser was used by all employees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survey also said more than two-thirds of the companies  
encourage or require all employees to use specific Internet 
software, and that of those, 62 percent encourage or require the 
use of Microsoft's browser over Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply offering choice, and the best product  
winning,'' Cullinan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the results support the government's allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It reconfirms the underlying facts of the case, and the  
problems and the tactics shown,'' said Ed Black, president of the 
Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group 
that has been critical of Microsoft. ``Microsoft has always made 
the point, you have to have real damage (to Netscape). Here's 
obviously real damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape early on targeted companies as its prime market for  
browser sales. Companies' software managers recognized Netscape as 
an Internet pioneer, and a 1996 Zona survey found more than 70 
percent of companies used Navigator. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Internet Explorer generally has been more popular  
among consumers at home, especially since the company began 
bundling its browser within Windows, the operating system used to 
run most of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which released a new version of its browser in March,  
also enjoys unusual popularity for its browser among home consumers 
because America Online distributes Microsoft's Web software to all 
its more than 18 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL recently purchased Netscape, but is contractually obligated  
to continue distributing Microsoft's browser until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Zona said its survey was taken of 308 randomly selected  
technology professionals who have software purchasing 
responsibilities, and whose companies have at least 20 employees 
and $1 million in revenues.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia Accuses Olivetti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- As Europe's biggest takeover battle nears a  
climax, Telecom Italia on Thursday accused hostile suitor Olivetti 
of rigging its offer and unsuccessfully urged regulators to suspend 
the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations came as Olivetti appeared poised to meet its  
goal for pressing ahead with its upstart bid for the former 
state-owned phone monopoly that is five times it size. Olivetti's 
$65 billion offer expires Friday, and analysts said most 
shareholders would wait until then to decide whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, with interests in cellular phones, office equipment  
and communications technology, has said it needs at least 35 
percent of Telecom's ordinary shares to proceed with the takeover. 
As of Thursday it had just under 20 percent of Telecom's shares. It 
hopes to win 67 percent, enough to give it a controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's bold offer, which has convulsed the clubby world of  
Europe's former government-run phone companies, appears to be 
gaining support even as Telecom Italia's proposed defensive merger 
with Deutsche Telekom seems increasingly remote. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom and its German counterpart announced their plans for a  
friendly merger in April, but the deal has encountered resistance 
from the Italian government and skepticism from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom accused Olivetti of leaking false information about the  
number of shares already tendered by Telecom shareholders and 
threatened legal action. It also asked Italy's stock market 
regulating agency to suspend the bidding, but was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's move underscored the importance of public perception  
in determining the outcome of the struggle. As more people are seen 
to be tendering their shares to Olivetti, the offer gains popular 
acceptance and other shareholders may decide to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Italian news agency Radiocor quoted an adviser  
to Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno as saying Olivetti 
had already won more than 35 percent of Telecom's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's market regulator, Consob, warned Olivetti afterward to  
``abstain from spreading information about the bid which is not 
backed up by hard data, isn't verifiable, and is only based on the 
calculations of analysts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's chief Franco Bernabe accused Olivetti officials of  
acting ``without any respect for authority or rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti denied releasing any such information. Calls seeking  
further comment were not immediately returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some industry analysts said Thursday that they expected  
Olivetti to achieve its minimum targeted number of shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the consensus is that they're likely to get 35  
percent. Whether they'll get as much as 50 percent is difficult to 
tell,'' said Denis Gross of Williams De Broe, a London brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross noted rumors that Olivetti had already amassed more than  
42 percent of Telecom shares. However, the outcome was still 
unclear because many large shareholders were ``fence-sitting'' 
until Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe made a last attempt to reassure investors on Wednesday,  
emphasizing his plan to spread Telecom's wealth by buying back 10 
percent of the company's shares at a premium to the price offered 
by Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they  
were not persuaded by Bernabe's pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe also tried to play down the effectiveness of Olivetti's  
offer, saying that Italian fund managers told him they were 
relinquishing no more than half of their Telecom shares to 
Olivetti, the Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
this meant that Italian fund managers were giving up no more than 7 
percent of the total number of company shares. 
</P>
<P>
	If Olivetti garners more than 35 percent but fewer than 50  
percent of Telecom's shares, the outlook becomes cloudier still. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom officials say that under company bylaws, unless Olivetti  
gets at least half of Telecom's shares, it won't be able to control 
more than 3 percent of the voting stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti disputes this interpretation of Italian law, making a  
court battle a near certainty under this outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom ended trading Thursday in Milan down 2 percent at the  
equivalent of $10.32 a share, while Olivetti shares lost 2 percent 
to close at $3.51.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Nears Telecom Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Olivetti appeared poised to meet its goal for  
acquiring a controlling stake in Telecom Italia as its $65 billion 
offer to acquire its larger rival was set to expire today. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said most shareholders would wait until the last minute  
to decide whether to accept the hostile offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, with interests in cellular phones, office equipment  
and communications technology, has said it needs at least 35 
percent of Telecom's ordinary shares to proceed with the takeover. 
As of Thursday it had just under 20 percent of Telecom's shares. It 
hopes to win 67 percent, enough to give it a controlling interest 
in the former state-owned phone monopoly that is five times it 
size. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's bold offer, which has convulsed the clubby world of  
Europe's former government-run phone companies, appears to be 
gaining support even as Telecom Italia's proposed defensive merger 
with Deutsche Telekom seems increasingly remote. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom and its German counterpart announced their plans for a  
friendly merger in April, but the deal has encountered resistance 
from the Italian government and skepticism from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom on Thursday accused Olivetti of leaking false  
information about the number of shares already tendered by Telecom 
shareholders and threatened legal action. It also asked Italy's 
stock market regulating agency to suspend the bidding, but was 
turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's move underscored the importance of public perception  
in determining the outcome of the struggle. As more people are seen 
to be tendering their shares to Olivetti, the offer gains popular 
acceptance and other shareholders may decide to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Italian news agency Radiocor quoted an adviser  
to Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno as saying Olivetti 
had already won more than 35 percent of Telecom's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's market regulator, Consob, warned Olivetti afterward to  
``abstain from spreading information about the bid which is not 
backed up by hard data, isn't verifiable, and is only based on the 
calculations of analysts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's chief Franco Bernabe accused Olivetti officials of  
acting ``without any respect for authority or rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti denied releasing any such information.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, some industry analysts said Thursday that they expected  
Olivetti to achieve its minimum targeted number of shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the consensus is that they're likely to get 35  
percent. Whether they'll get as much as 50 percent is difficult to 
tell,'' said Denis Gross of Williams De Broe, a London brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross noted rumors that Olivetti had already amassed more than  
42 percent of Telecom shares. However, the outcome was still 
unclear because many large shareholders were ``fence-sitting'' 
until Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe made a last attempt to reassure investors on Wednesday,  
emphasizing his plan to spread Telecom's wealth by buying back 10 
percent of the company's shares at a premium to the price offered 
by Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they  
were not persuaded by Bernabe's pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	If Olivetti garners more than 35 percent but fewer than 50  
percent of Telecom's shares, the outlook becomes a bit cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom officials say that under company bylaws, unless Olivetti  
gets at least half of Telecom's shares, it won't be able to control 
more than 3 percent of the voting stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti disputes this interpretation of Italian law, making a  
court battle a near certainty under this outcome.

<HEADLINE> Sabres, Leafs Brewing Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite being separated by just 107 miles,  
Buffalo and Toronto have little hockey history between them. That 
figures to change in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres and Maple Leafs played five games this season after  
realignment sent the Leafs to the Eastern Conference. The Sabres 
won three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams could play as many as seven more games as they chase a  
berth in the Stanley Cup finals. That's a lot of traffic on the 
Peace Bridge, the span that links the two regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Conference best-of-7 final starts in Toronto on  
Sunday. The media already have named it the ``QEW Series'' after 
Queen Elizabeth Way, the highway between Toronto and the 
Buffalo-Niagara Falls area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be pretty intense,'' Leafs president Ken Dryden said.  
``We want rivalries, and rivalries get spawned in playoff series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo and Toronto have enough in common to nurture a rivalry.  
Both have plenty of ice and snow. Both are stocked with hockey 
fans. And the two cities are only a 90-minute drive apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for everybody outside the dressing room, for the  
fans, for Buffalo, for Toronto,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, 
whose playoff record is 18-7, including last year's trip to the 
conference final. ``You talk about building rivalries, all of a 
sudden we've got one that's an hour and a half away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-clad Leafs fans made their way to Buffalo's Marine Midland  
Arena in such large numbers that the Sabres sometimes wondered 
which city they were playing in. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had as many fans in our building as we had,'' said  
Buffalo center Brian Holzinger. ``And we had a lot of fans up 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leafs fans have wormed their way onto the Buffalo roster. Sabres  
captain Michael Peca and defenseman Jason Woolley grew up rooting 
for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	After Buffalo disposed of Boston in the sixth game of the  
conference semifinal Tuesday night, Woolley, a Toronto native, said 
his biggest worry going into the Toronto series was how to handle 
all the ticket requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca, who grew up in a Toronto suburb, said he and Woolley joked  
about the Leafs fans pouring out of bars and honking their horns on 
Yonge Street after Toronto eliminated Pittsburgh on Monday night. 
``That used to be us,'' Peca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are fast and have solid goaltenders. Buffalo's  
Dominik Hasek ranks third in the playoffs with a 1.77 goals-against 
average and leads with a save percentage of .942. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto's Curtis Joseph sits one place behind Hasek in the  
rankings with equally impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the two best goaltenders in the conference going at  
it right now,'' said Ruff, whose Sabres had a tough enough time 
with Boston's Byron Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have one more thing in common -- frustration. The  
Sabres haven't advanced to the Stanley Cup finals since 1975. The 
Flyers won the Cup that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs haven't made it to the championship round since they  
won the Cup in a series with Montreal in 1967. Toronto lost to 
Vancouver in the 1994 Western Conference final.

<HEADLINE> Fila To Sell Products on Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARKS, Md. (AP) -- Fila U.S.A. Inc. will begin selling its  
athletic apparel and shoes on the Internet beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's 1 1/2-year-old World Wide Web site (www.Fila.com)  
hasn't allowed visitors to purchase products online. Fila products 
are sold in athletic stores and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is revamping the site and adding the Fila Store.  
</P>
<P>
	Internet retailing will complement, rather than erode, retail  
sales, said Todd McDonald, Fila's manager of electronic commerce, 
adding that Internet sales likely will account for 1 percent to 2 
percent of total sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to get an advantage on our retailers,''  
McDonald said. ``It's a brand-awareness tool. We're hoping people 
will come and look at the products, then go to retailers and shop 
for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of offering a full line of products, the Fila Store will  
carry 65 items of footwear and apparel. The items will be priced 
the same as in stores. To entice shoppers, Fila will offer free 
shipping for a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding the store and making the Web site more interactive should  
help Fila meet its goal of doubling the number of visits to the 
site, now about 2,500 a day, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	The site will include reader polls, contests, retail locations  
and interviews with Fila's endorsing athletes such as National 
Basketball Association star Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Fila's biggest rivals, Nike Inc. and Adidas America, also  
have begun selling products electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is doing it. If you don't do it, you're dead in the  
water,'' said Mark Millman, president of Millman Search Group Inc., 
a national retail consulting firm in Lutherville.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Sorry for Stereotyping Irish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- An attorney suing Dollar Rent-A-Car has  
apologized for filing a lawsuit that characterized the Irish as 
hopelessly tethered to pubs and pints and unfit to drive the 
highways of America. 
</P>
<P>
	John Stemberger admitted he made a mistake and promised  
Wednesday to rewrite the negligence lawsuit he filed in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed on behalf of the family of Carmel Elizabeth  
Cunningham, an Irish woman who was killed last year when her 
boyfriend, Sean McGrath, crashed their rental car. He is also 
Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say McGrath, 33, was drunk at the time of the crash  
and have charged him with manslaughter. A warrant has been issued 
for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, Stemberger claimed Dollar ``knew or should have  
known about the unique cultural and ethnic customs existing in 
Ireland which involve the regular consumption of alcohol at `Pubs' 
as a major component to Irish social life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to charge that Dollar ``knew or should have known  
that Sean McGrath would have a high propensity to drink alcohol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irish-Americans didn't appreciate someone turning a crude  
cultural stereotype into a barometer of individual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``That enrages me,'' said Kathleen Reineke, past president of  
the local Irish American Club. ``That would be like saying all 
blacks steal. It falls under the same category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a barrage of incensed calls, Stemberger said he would  
rewrite the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to express my deepest regret to the Irish who have been  
offended,'' he said. ``I recognize the mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stemberger said he had already planned to amend the lawsuit to  
focus on Ireland's different driving conditions and the duty that 
should be imposed on car rental companies to make sure Irish 
drivers can handle American roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Peyton Hodges, an attorney for Dollar, said he did not know  
Stemberger's motivation for amending the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is the sentiment was so overwhelming and so negative  
the guy finally woke up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Stemberger's latest theory, Dollar gives all customers  
brochures explaining penalties for drunken driving and warning them 
to drive on the right side of the road, company vice president Tom 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stemberger said Dollar doesn't do nearly enough to teach  
drivers from Ireland and the United Kingdom about U.S. driving 
rules, including blood-alcohol limits, open-container laws and the 
drinking age. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want Irish-Americans to know because of Dollar's negligence,  
Ireland has lost one of its daughters,'' he said. ``I view myself 
as an advocate trying to protect the Irish, in this case.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Files Suit Against Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A casino security guard has filed a lawsuit  
against basketball star Dennis Rodman, accusing him of grabbing her 
breast while she was working at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Ehlert claims in the lawsuit filed Wednesday that Rodman  
embarrassed and humiliated her when he grabbed and shook her breast 
in front of a crowd of people last November. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time of sexually assaulting the plaintiff, the  
defendant was making lewd comments in the presence of numerous 
patrons, spectators and other employees,'' the lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehlert seeks unspecified damages in the case.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Rodman did not immediately return a phone call  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed in Las Vegas in June 1998 involve  
allegations about Rodman's behavior in casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas Hilton employee accused him of grabbing her sides  
near her breasts and lifting her off the ground in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Las Vegas woman accused Rodman of sexually assaulting  
her in April 1998 at the Las Vegas Hilton by grabbing one of her 
breasts and shaking it. 
</P>
<P>
	A craps dealer at The Mirage filed a lawsuit alleging Rodman  
humiliated him at work by rubbing his groin and head. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls before  
joining the Los Angeles Lakers earlier this year. The Lakers waived 
him in April.

<HEADLINE>  Japanese Stocks Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen Thursday  
following the release of a central bank report showing the nation's 
economy remains weak. Japanese stocks finished higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 124.44 yen at midafternoon, up 0.74 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
124.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 71.81 points,  
or 0.44 percent, closing at 16,199.99. On Wednesday, the index fell 
250.44 points, or 1.53 percent. Before Thursday's rise, the Nikkei 
had lost 819.19 points over the previous five full trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's strength was boosted by the  
Bank of Japan's latest monthly report saying that the economy 
appears to have stopped deteriorating, but that no signs of 
recovery can yet be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese companies are still struggling to bail out of the  
nation's worst recession in 50 years, mostly through restructuring 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted that the yen has weakened recently on the  
back of the interest rate differential between the United States 
and Japan. U.S. rates are higher. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the dollar rose to a seven-month high against the  
yen, trading above 124 yen. Higher interest rates make a nation's 
currency more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar stayed in a narrow range in afternoon trading as  
market participants were taking a rest after somewhat volatile 
trading in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 132.90 yen, up from  
131.60 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened moderately higher on buying  
of shares in technology companies but turned lower at midday as 
investors sold shares of companies whose earnings are linked to 
strength in domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors turned bearish on worries that Japan's  
economy is not gaining momentum and frustration that the government 
appears reluctant to push new stimulus measures anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average moved into positive territory within 30  
minutes of the closing bell as institutional investors picked up 
selective shares on dips. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained  
50.44 points to close at 10,887.39 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 1.26 points, or 0.10 percent, to 1,301.87. The 
TOPIX fell 23.54 points, or 1.78 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.295 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.325 
percent, driving its price up to 101.82 yen from 101.55 yen.

<HEADLINE> Rubin, Greenspan Support Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Current efforts to reform the global financial  
system are gaining momentum and will not falter as did an attempt 
after the 1995 Mexican crisis, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan and outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They assured Congress they had much more confidence that  
necessary reforms will be implemented this time, in part because 
the 22-month-long Asian crisis had demonstrated the need for an 
overhaul of the world's financial structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has come out of the Asian crisis is an enormous global  
focus on architecture, a lot of debate, a lot of different ideas,'' 
Rubin said. ``I would have a fairly high degree of confidence this 
energy will not flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint appearance with Rubin before the House Banking  
Committee, Greenspan said there was added urgency because of the 
long list of countries whose economies have been leveled by 
financial troubles that have struck three continents. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, around one-third of the globe was pushed into  
recession, providing a number of new case studies of how the world 
operates now that billions of dollars in investments can move with 
the speed of clicking computer keys, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have far more information, far more understanding and  
the capability of confronting these things which I don't believe we 
had immediately after the Mexican crisis,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and Rubin gave a generally upbeat status report on  
efforts to institute reforms to prevent future Asian-style currency 
crises. Greenspan stressed that Fed policy-makers agreed with the 
broad thrust of the plan put forward last month by the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, the administration's point man on the Asian crisis,  
announced last week that he will step down as treasury secretary in 
July. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has been nominated 
to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who issued a strong statement of support for Summers  
last week, continued to signal to financial markets that he and 
other Fed policy-makers are working closely with the administration 
on the global crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rubin and Greenspan urged the private sector to share more  
of the burden of bad investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the principal criticisms of the massive bailouts of  
Mexico in 1995, and, more recently of Asian nations, Russia and 
Brazil, has been that much of the money went to repay foreign 
investors who made bad bets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that all creditors who make bad  
investments should get the appropriate remedy -- which is loss,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin reviewed a package of proposals the administration first  
released in April before the spring meetings of the 182-nation 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the IMF already had adopted a key measure: contingent  
credit lines to countries pursuing sound economic policies, before 
a crisis prompted by investors dumping currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the IMF would not disburse any money without approval  
from the agency's executive board, ensuring that qualified 
countries continued prudent economic plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, making the case for better financial reporting  
standards, said misleading information put out by Thailand and 
South Korea had worsened the market's reaction when trouble arose 
in those nations.

	6 Georgia High School Students Shot  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A student with two guns opened fire at his  
high school today, shooting six schoolmates exactly one month after 
the Colorado massacre, authorities said. A suspect was quickly 
taken into custody. None of the injuries was believed to be 
life-threatening. The suspect was described as a 15-year-old 
sophomore at Heritage High School who according to a friend had 
recently broken up with his girlfriend. The gunman had two weapons, 
a .22-caliber rifle and a .22-caliber revolver, District Attorney 
Richard Read said. The shootings happened about 7:55 a.m., or about 
20 minutes before classes were to begin in this middle-class suburb 
20 miles east of Atlanta.

	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Ending what could be Germany's last  
major war crimes trial, a court has convicted a 79-year-old former 
Nazi of assisting in the murders of 17,000 Jews at a concentration 
camp in Poland. The court sentenced Alfons Goetzfrid to 10 years in 
prison, but gave him credit for time served on similar charges in 
the Soviet Union. He will not be jailed in Germany. The conviction 
comes as Nazi hunters around the world race to press charges 
against suspected war criminals before they become too old or

<HEADLINE> Gateway To Build Low-Cost Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Computer maker Gateway Inc. will  
continue to turn its focus to high-profit services such as 
financing, Internet service and computer training, Chief Executive 
Officer Ted Waitt told shareholders at the company's annual meeting 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Sioux City, S.D.-based company also plans to introduce  
more low-cost computers, which represent the fastest growing 
segment of the personal computer market, Waitt said. ``The days of 
everyone buying a $2,500 PC are over,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway currently sells a $999 personal computer, but Waitt  
declined to say how much lower the company would go in the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now to say we'll be at $499, or $599, or $399, we're  
still working that out,'' he told reporters after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Services and software account for 8 percent of the company's  
revenues today, Waitt said at the meeting. That could rise to 20 
percent in the future, he said, and added that since those 
businesses carry lower overhead, the portion of profit they bring 
would be even greater. 
</P>
<P>
	Financing packages offered with personal computers totaled $1  
billion last year and next year should top $2 billion, said Jeff 
Weitzen, president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will also focus more on small businesses, currently  
the fastest-growing segment of Gateway's market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway will also increase its efforts to sell to schools, and  
will expand its line of servers, computers that send information 
over the Internet, Weitzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Home computers remain the company's mainstay, and will still be  
heavily targeted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, shareholders could watch the meeting live on  
the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Wineries Make Comeback in Kentucky / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDWAY, Ky. (AP) -- Grape-growing and wineries are making a  
comeback in central Kentucky, where the industry flourished for 
years before it was uprooted by Prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
	There are now six licensed wineries, and tobacco farmers looking  
for alternative crops are showing more interest in grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Bohn, a full-time IBM employee who grew up on a tobacco  
farm near Elizabethtown, said she hopes Equus Run Vineyards -- a 
``boutique winery'' -- will become a tourist destination along with 
the horse farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Chris and Denise Nelson of Nicholasville, the owners of  
Chrisman Mill Vineyards in Jessamine County, are looking to make 
their operation the seventh licensed commercial winery in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	They want to pick up the horticulture begun by Swiss/French  
settler Jean Jacques Dufour, who planted a vineyard in Jessamine 
County 200 years ago and who organized the Kentucky Vineyard 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, in the late 1800s, Kentucky was the third-largest  
grape and wine producer in the United States,'' said Chris Nelson, 
president of the Kentucky Vineyard Society, resurrected in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jessamine and Woodford county vineyards will harvest their  
first light crops in September. Equus Run near Midway has a tasting 
room for customers to sample wines. 
</P>
<P>
	The wines were made from grapes grown in California and Indiana,  
where the Woodford winery's product is made until it can get its 
own winery equipment installed in a former tobacco barn this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	An acre of wine grapes can yield gross income of $6,000 to  
$11,000, Bohn said. Tobacco ranges from $4,000 to $5,000 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
	State viticulturist Garth Vinson of Murray State University, who  
advises growers, recommends grapes as a companion crop to tobacco, 
rather than a replacement. Vinson said the peak labor times for 
each crop don't overlap. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two work well hand in hand,'' Vinson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The industry is still in its infancy. There were only 250 acres  
of grapes planted in the state last year, according to the Kentucky 
Horticulture Council, and they produced $798,000 in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But interest is growing because the state offers incentives,  
such as matching grants to help those planting vineyards. 
</P>
<P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new variety of wheat developed by government  
scientists will slow the spread of a fungus that has plagued 
farmers in the upper Midwest over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers lost an estimated $2.6 billion between 1991 and 1997  
because of scab, or Fusarium head blight, that shrivels kernels of 
wheat and barley. The disease also produces toxins that can make 
the grain unsuitable for food and animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new wheat variety, our most scab-tolerant ever, will be  
available to farmers for the spring 2000 planting season, 
preventing more damage by this costly disease,'' Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The new variety, McVey hard red spring wheat, slows the spread  
of the disease in the seedhead so fewer kernels are destroyed. The 
Agriculture Department last year accelerated its research on the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The new variety is named for Donald McVey, a plant pathologist  
at the USDA's Cereal Disease Laboratory in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Crop Improvement Association, based in St. Paul,  
is distributing seed to certified seed growers.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs D.C. Scholarships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia residents would be able  
to attend public colleges or universities nationwide and pay the 
cheaper tuition charged to state residents under a bill that a 
House committee approved Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, approved by the House Government Reform Committee  
by voice vote and without debate, advanced to the full House for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation is pending in the Senate, but it would limit  
attendance to state-supported colleges and universities in Maryland 
and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters on the House committee said the bill would improve  
educational opportunities for residents of the city, which has just 
one publicly funded institution of higher education, the University 
of the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to bring this city back, we've got to make sure  
kids in this city have the same opportunities for higher education 
that they have everywhere else,'' said Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va., a 
sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would create a program, to be run by the District  
of Columbia mayor, that would award scholarships to residents to 
attend college at lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Public colleges and universities require students who are not  
residents of the state that funds them to pay higher tuition fees 
than those who live there. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget requests $17 million for  
higher education in the city, including the new program, said Del. 
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city's nonvoting representative in the 
House and co-sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	She predicted the program would encourage residents to remain in  
the city instead of moving out so they can spend less to send their 
children to college. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incentive to leave (Washington) just to get your kid an  
education you can afford is very great,'' said Norton, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the bill would designate the University of the  
District of Columbia as a historically black college, making it 
eligible for federal funding set aside for those schools. A $15 
billion emergency spending bill nearing completion in Congress 
includes $1.5 million in such funding for the university.

<P>
	The Blazers were up 32-31 at the half. Karl Malone and Brian  
Grant had 13 points apiece to lead their respective teams.

<HEADLINE> Iverson To Play Desperate Early  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The scripts for Indiana's two playoff  
victories over Philadelphia have been nearly identical. 
</P>
<P>
	It goes like this: The 76ers' fall behind by early double  
figures, then rally late before succumbing to the Pacers' playoff 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson thinks it's time for a rewrite. His new storyline  
-- previewed Thursday -- is for the 76ers to play with abandon as 
soon as the clock starts ticking and race past the slower Pacers 
all the way to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for us to play like we're down in the beginning  
of the game,'' Iverson said Thursday after the team concluded 
practice for Game 3 of its Eastern Conference semifinal series. 
``We're waiting till we get 13, 14, 15 points down, and then we 
start playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the Pacers warned. They know they could be headed east  
with the series tied at 1-1 after missing six free throws in the 
final 67 seconds and running into trouble against the Sixers' 
full-court press late in their 85-82 victory in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't given up, if anything they probably feel good  
about what they've done, and they should,'' said forward Chris 
Mullin, 2-of-9 from the field for eight points Wednesday night. 
``We don't feel like we've played great. We feel we've played well 
enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put themselves in a position where they could have stolen  
two games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the two-game deficit, the young Sixers seemed loose and  
restless during a 45-minute practice session Thursday. Matt Geiger 
ribbed a teammate over 3-point attempts that banged off the rim 
while Rick Mahorn gave bear hugs to Iverson as the franchise guard 
cried out in mock pain. 
</P>
<P>
	And as reporters and photographers jockeyed for position to  
offer questions at ``The Answer,'' Iverson cooly sank down in a 
chair and nibbled on white grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure, Iverson said, is not a word in his vocabulary.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like there's pressure in basketball. Why not be  
loose? They still have to win two games,'' said Iverson, the NBA's 
regular-season scoring champion who has averaged 28.5 points in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But to avoid another early letdown, the Sixers will need a  
better shooting performance from their flashy guard. After scoring 
35 in Game 1, Iverson was held to 7-of-28 for 23 points by an 
Indian team that played him more physically. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't stop him with one guy,'' said Pacers guard Mark  
Jackson. ``He's a great, great basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he's shooting good, you don't give the defense credit. No  
one guy is going to stop him, you just try to contain him and make 
him work for everything. Fortunately, he missed some shots last 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's something Sixers coach Larry Brown hopes will happen  
Friday for the Pacers' Rik Smits, whose used his outside shooting 
to score 25 points in Game 2, after totaling 34 in Indiana's four 
previous playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a tremendous long-range shooter,'' Brown said. ``t we  
didn't trap very well, and that enabled Mark to find Rik. And when 
we did trap, it was late, so we have to adjust to that a little 
bit. If you give them enough open looks, he can hurt you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pacers guard Reggie Miller is sure his playoff-savvy team will  
adjust to whatever the Sixers -- and their success-starved fans -- 
throw at them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we did what we had to do by holding serve here at  
home, now we get to go on the road with an 'us-against-the-world 
attitude,''' Miller said. '' We had only one playoff game in 
Milwaukee, and we were fortunate to clinch there. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, this is different circumstances against a very different,  
and talented young team. ``There ain't no way we're going to sweep 
Philadelphia, they're too good.''

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A nephew of Pablo Escobar, the late  
Medellin cocaine cartel boss, was shot to death in a health club 
Thursday by five gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Roberto Escobar, a 20-year-old computer student, was  
killed in the gym where he exercised every morning in the upscale 
El Poblado neighborhood of Medellin, Colombia's second largest 
city, said Gen. Alfredo Salgado, operations director for the 
National Police. 
</P>
<P>
	The killers fled in a car, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	Salgado said there was no clear motive for the killing of  
Escobar, whose uncle was boss one of Colombia's most feared 
criminal mafias and died in a December 1993 gunfight with police. 
</P>

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A Sao Paulo court Wednesday convicted  
two former police officers for their involvement in the torture, 
extortion and shooting of slum residents at a roadblock two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack -- captured on videotape in March 1997 -- involved 10  
policemen. They were seen on the video beating a man on the feet 
and back with nightsticks for three minutes before letting him and 
two others return to their car. As the car pulled away, a policeman 
fired a shot that killed one of the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Soares da Silva was sentenced to 13 years in jail for  
attempted murder and abuse of power. Jose dos Santos, who has been 
under arrest for eight months, had his sentence increased by 
another 10 days for abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
	The policeman seen firing the shot on the video, Otavio Lourenco  
Gambra, is awaiting a new trial after a court threw out an October 
verdict sentencing him to 59 years in prison for one count murder 
and three counts attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Six officers involved in the case received jail terms of up to  
six years, but have been released because they completed one sixth 
of their sentence. One officer was found not guilty.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Torrential rains washed out highways  
and bridges in northern Nicaragua, where infrastructure is still 
being rebuilt from Hurricane Mitch in November. 
</P>
<P>
	A temporary bridge built to replace one destroyed by the  
hurricane was washed out in the Wednesday storm, cutting traffic in 
the province of Nuevo Segovia. 
</P>
<P>
	The provincial capital of Ocotal, 12 miles south of the border  
with Honduras, was cut off from land links with the rest of the 
country by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Nicaragua's highway system is still undergoing repair  
from the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch, which killed more than 
9,000 people in Central America, left 2 million homeless and caused 
damage estimated at $10 billion in the region.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Honduras has sent an official  
delegation to neighboring El Salvador to bring back about 100 
children who left their flood-damaged Honduran town to beg on the 
streets of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Honduras dispatched a government bus Wednesday to bring the kids  
back, the federal prosecutor's office said in a press statement. 
The children, most between the ages of six and 12, left the town of 
Marcovia, on the Salvadoran border, after Hurricane Mitch 
devastated the area in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The children are expected to be returned to Honduras Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Mitch hit Honduras in late October and early November,  
killing more than 5,000 people and causing heavy damage to 
Marcovia, 90 miles south of the capital, Tegucigalpa. El Salvador 
suffered less damage in the hurricane.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's largest union said  
Thursday that the jobless rate has jumped by four percentage points 
this year, leaving 20 percent of workers unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Confederation of Venezuelan Workers blamed low prices for  
oil, the country's main export, for the jump. It said hundreds of 
thousands of workers have been laid off since January in the 
construction, manufacturing, petroleum, agricultural and banking 
sectors, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates unemployment at 15 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last year and  
provoked one of the country's worst recessions in years. However, 
prices have rebounded in recent weeks, prompting hopes that the 
economy may rebound later this year.

<HEADLINE> Indy Boss Makes a U-Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Death is something nobody in auto racing likes to discuss.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony George is no exception. But the Indianapolis Motor Speedway  
boss learned an important lesson the hard way: Ignoring the subject 
won't make it go away. 
</P>
<P>
	He was so unhappy with Sports Illustrated's story on the death  
of three spectators at an Indy Racing League event May 1, that he 
barred writer Ed Hinton from covering next weekend's Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
	But after one newspaper said it would boycott the race and  
several others considered doing so, George made a U-turn -- 
reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not right to allow Ed Hinton to have a forum and take  
away what's really important with this event. And that's for the 
media to cover the event and not some sideshow,'' George said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He should know, because the Indy 500 has looked more and more  
like a sideshow the past three years, ever since George chased away 
drivers and owners from the Championship Auto Racing Teams circuit 
and brought in replacements under the IRL banner. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was fooled. Today, the circuit George founded and funded  
with his family fortune is struggling for attention in a congested 
sport. So is CART. The popularity of NASCAR, meanwhile, has zoomed. 
Stock-car racing has reached the point, in terms of TV ratings and 
live audience, where the Indy-car rivals are fighting over fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	When George picked up the May 10 issue of SI and read Hinton's  
article, headlined ``Fatal Attractions,'' he was ready to fight 
about something else. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinton recounted how three spectators were killed, a 9-year-old  
girl critically injured, and eight other fans hurt when a three-car 
collision during the VisionAire 500 sent debris hurtling over a 
15-foot fence at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	His article also mentioned a similar accident at a CART race in  
Michigan last July that claimed three lives and injured six. It was 
accompanied by an Associated Press photograph showing two 
sheet-covered bodies on bloody grandstand steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinton suggested that ``at the very least,'' racetrack officials  
consider raising the catch fences in front of the grandstands to 25 
feet. But, he concluded, ``The surest solution is simple but 
unlikely to happen: The IRL and CART should stop racing open-wheel 
cars on high-speed oval tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the IRL races exclusively on ovals, Hinton might as well  
have suggested George and his IRL friends back their race cars into 
garages, pull down the doors and throw away the keys. Small wonder 
that George referred to Hinton twice as ``dangerous'' during 
Thursday's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to elaborate, he said, ``I'm not preventing him from  
writing, and I'm sure there will be worse stuff to come as a result 
of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George can't have it both ways.  
</P>
<P>
	The sad truth is that death -- of drivers, mechanics and  
spectators -- has been part of racing since the Indy 500 first came 
on the scene in 1911. It's also true that George has added some 
lucrative events to the speedway calendar, but he's also taken some 
of the luster off what used to be ``The Greatest Spectacle in 
Racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People have slammed it before.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Murray, the late Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist of The Los  
Angeles Times, was so upset by the death of a friend, driver Eddie 
Sachs, in the 1964 race that he penned one of the best-known lines 
in sports writing -- ``Gentlemen, start your coffins!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 500 not only survived that sting, it continued to thrive.  
Back then, the race owned Memorial Day weekend and no other sport 
dared scheduled an event near it. Back then, it seemed that Indy, 
like the Super Bowl, Kentucky Derby, Wimbledon and Masters, was one 
of those events that would forever own the pinnacle of its sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But a funny thing happened while George and CART feuded.  
NASCAR's crown jewel, the Daytona 500, supplanted the Indy 500 at 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
	There was, however, one promising development on the racing  
front Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-year-old Haley McGee, who suffered bruises to the brain and  
lungs in the May 1 crash, has already begun her comeback. She's 
undergoing daily physical and speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	She's doing fine.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> American Confident in Federal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Justice Department will have to prove that  
American Airlines' fight against low-cost competition was more than 
just business, chairman Donald J. Carty says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal civil lawsuit filed last week in Wichita, Kan., the  
government accused American of monopolizing and attempting to 
monopolize passenger service to and from Dallas-Fort Worth 
International Airport, the nation's third largest airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department alleged that Fort Worth-based American,  
the nation's second largest carrier, cut fares and added flights 
temporarily to drive low-cost competitors out of its giant hub 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty said Wednesday after the annual shareholders meeting of  
American parent AMR Corp. that the company was confident it abided 
by antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Justice has to do is go in and somehow argue that past  
precedent and past court cases somehow don't apply to the airline 
industry,'' Carty said. ``I think that's a very tough thing for 
them to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American was charged with repeatedly trying to drive small,  
startup airlines out of the DFW airport by saturating their routes 
with additional flights and cutting fares. After the competitors 
withdrew or drastically reduced their service, American 
re-established high fares and reduced its service, the government 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty said that new airlines don't require federal protection if  
they are ``properly capitalized'' in a way ``consistent with the 
capital required to compete in this or any other industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Carty said that the airline was ``very  
comfortable'' with its stand that American had complied with the 
law ``as it is written and as it has been interpreted in the 
past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first predatory pricing case brought in the industry  
since airline deregulation in 1978. At that time, major carriers 
established hubs to concentrate their traffic through one or more 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	While hubs provide some conveniences for passengers, hub  
carriers frequently charge higher fares on hub routes with little 
competition. Low-cost carriers often can provide competitive 
alternatives to the hub carrier, generally offering fare cuts of 50 
percent or more. A 1996 study by the Department of Transportation 
estimated that low-cost carriers were saving consumers $6.3 billion 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to targeting Vanguard's routes to Wichita, Kan., and  
Kansas City, Mo., American's actions were aimed at Sun Jet's routes 
to Long Beach, Calif., and Western Pacific's to Colorado Springs, 
Colo., the lawsuit said.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo To Be Asked About Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo will be  
summoned as a witness in a investigation into why doctors then with 
Brazil's national team allowed him to play in the World Cup final 
after suffering a convulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ronaldo's testimony is of fundamental importance,'' Mauro  
Brandao, president of Rio de Janeiro's Regional Medical Council, 
which is conducting the inquiry, told the Correio Braziliense 
newspaper. ``He will be summoned when he comes to Brazil to play 
for the national team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldo, who now plays for Internazionale of Milan, will be on  
the Brazilian team for two exhibition matches against the 
Netherlands on June 5 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldo was hospitalized shortly before the July 12 World Cup  
final against France, and was scratched from the lineup -- then 
inexplicably put back in, apparently with the approval of the 
team's doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	He played poorly and Brazil lost 3-0. Later, Ronaldo said he had  
gone into convulsions at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical council is trying to determine why doctors Lidio  
Toledo and Joaquim da Matta allowed the star striker to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Former coach Jorge Zagallo, team coordinator Zico, Toledo and  
Matta have already been questioned by the council. Details of their 
testimony have not been revealed.

<HEADLINE> Cablevision, Devils Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) -- Cablevision will help the New Jersey Devils  
build an arena for the hockey club in Hoboken, the team and company 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hoboken is the natural location for a premier sports and  
entertainment facility,'' the joint announcement said today about 
the city across the Hudson River from midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision, which already owns New York's Madison Square Garden  
as well as the New York Knicks and Rangers, would bear half of the 
$206 million cost to construct the new venue above the Hoboken 
commuter rail station, Devils president John McMullen told The 
Star-Ledger of Newark in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would still need some public subsidies, and Hoboken  
officials are worried about crowded streets and a parking shortage. 
Still, McMullen called the plan ``an outstanding opportunity'' for 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have done it alone, but this makes it a lead pipe  
cinch,'' McMullen told the newspaper. ``Having a significant 
partner like this makes it certain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was not immediately available for comment today. The  
Devils-Cablevision joint announcement was faxed to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan, and his brother, Larry, were  
said to be the leading contenders to buy the New York Jets from the 
estate of the late Leon Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision and the NHL club would jointly run the 18,500-seat  
arena as well as its entertainment and shopping complex. McMullen 
said the agreement should include long-term broadcast rights for 
Cablevision, which already televises Devils' games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils' plan is one of three proposals for new indoor sports  
venues in northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, basketball's New Jersey Nets discussed their plans to  
build an arena in Newark with Gov. Christie Whitman. The Nets 
owners would like the Devils to join them, and say their project 
also may include a new soccer stadium for the New York-New Jersey 
MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority officials are trying  
to convince both the Devils and Nets to remain at the Meadowlands 
in a new arena near their current home, the outmoded Continental 
Airlines Arena. The authority wants to demolish the arena in East 
Rutherford and build an entertainment and shopping complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, citing the cost of proposed state subsidies, has said  
she prefers to have both teams playing in a single building, and is 
to meet shortly with McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
	McMullen said he will not move his team to Newark, preferring  
instead to build atop Hoboken's historic rail terminal along the 
Hudson River. It handles 80,000 commuter train riders daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is dependent upon the state granting the Devils and  
Cablevision ``air rights'' to build above the terminal. It calls 
for state taxpayers to contribute $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Long Island-based Cablevision recently tried unsuccessfully to  
purchase the New York Yankees. The Yankees instead agreed to a 
merger with the Nets. The proposed YankeesNets organization raises 
the possibility that the two teams could break away from 
Cablevision's regional sports networks -- MSG and Fox Sports New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	A new YankeesNets-created sports network is viewed as more  
viable if the Devils join. Officials did not address how the deal 
would affect the cable television balance of power.

	6 Wounded in Ga. School Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Exactly one month after the bloodbath in a  
Colorado high school, a 15-year-old sophomore, armed with two guns, 
opened fire this morning at suburban Atlanta's Heritage High 
School. The boy, upset over a broken romance, shot and wounded six 
students. Witnesses said the gunman was running and shooting at no 
one in particular and firing at students below the waist so as not 
to kill them. Authorities did not identify the suspect or suggest a 
motive. He was charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, and 
more charges may be pending.

	Stiffer Gun Restrictions Approved  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Propelled by a shocking outbreak of school  
violence, the Senate passed legislation tonight to require the sale 
of safety devices with handguns and expand a system of background 
checks for firearms purchasers. The vote was 73-25, and came a few 
hours after Vice President Al Gore eagerly broke a 50-50 tie in 
favor of a politically popular gun control amendment that most 
Republicans opposed. Passage sent the measure to the House, where 
there appears to be support for the legislation.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- On a day of more school bloodshed,  
President Clinton consoled grief-stricken families in the town 
where a murder-suicide rampage by two teen-agers a month ago left 
15 dead and shocked the nation. ``What happened to you has pierced 
the soul of America,'' the president said. Nearly 2,000 people 
packed Dakota Ridge High School gymnasium to hear the president. In 
remarks later at the high school, Hillary Rodham Clinton said she 
was impressed by the community's strength and ``your refusal to let 
violence and hatred win.''

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets hit Belgrade harder  
Thursday than they have since the Chinese embassy was mistakenly 
bombed by NATO on May 7. Today's attacks left a hospital in 
smoldering ruins, three patients dead and eight foreign diplomatic 
missions damaged. One attack hit a fuel depot in a busy capital 
street, damaging the nearby home of the Swiss ambassador, who was 
hosting a diplomatic reception at the time, the private Beta news

	Auction House Pulls Malcolm X Diary

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A bloodied diary of Malcolm X was taken off  
the auction block today after the family of the slain civil rights 
leader charged it had been stolen and threatened to sue to halt the 
sale. An auction house said it will hold on to the diary until 
attorneys for the city of New York or the person who consigned the 
book direct them to send it elsewhere. The red, 146-page diary, 
pierced by three bullet holes, was found in the left breast pocket 
of the suit Malcolm X was wearing when he was assassinated Feb. 21, 
1965, in New York.

Three newspapers today asked a federal judge to unseal some 90

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Down; Dow Off 20.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower in late trading today as  
lingering concerns about leading technology companies sapped the 
market's modest gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 20.65 at 10,866.74.  
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, particularly the technology-dominated  
Nasdaq composite index, were lower. It was down 34.98 at 2,542.42. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 5.40 to 1,338.83.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,750 up, 1,219 down and 578 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 774.00 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
767.74 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.12 to 639.42. The American Stock  
Exchange composite index eked out the only gain, rising 3.67 to 
792.03. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.89 to 448.03.  
</P>
<P>
	For several days, stocks have traded in a narrow band as  
investors struggled to determine whether a recent rise in inflation 
will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an 
effort to slow the runaway economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve offered fresh evidence  
of steady but not inflationary economic growth. The group reported 
that manufacturing growth eased slightly in April, which calmed an 
anxious market and set the stage for some mild, broad-based gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan maintained that sense of calm with a  
morning address to the House Banking Committee. The influential 
policymaker focused solely on the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon, traders had grown comfortable enough with  
U.S. economic policy to cast their eyes back toward corporate 
America. Dell Computer, which disappointed analysts earlier this 
week with a profit report that merely matched expectations, sank in 
late trading, depressing the Nasdaq and dragging many technology 
stocks with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Internet businesses also tumbled today. Amazon.com dropped  
3 7/8 to 135 11/16 after the company said it plans to sell $2 billion 
in stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mergers set the stage for some gains today. Healtheon soared for  
a second straight session as it announced it will merge with WebMD 
Inc. to create an Internet-based health care services company. 
</P>
<P>
	In other corporate news, Merck was among the Dow's biggest  
advancers as it nears approval for a new painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Paper and forest products stocks including Georgia-Pacific rose  
after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised earnings estimates for the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was plenty of room for at least one successful new  
issue. EToys soared in its Nasdaq debut.

<HEADLINE> ABC Extends Indy 500 Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Howard Katz made keeping the Indianapolis  
500 on ABC Sports his No. 1 priority when he became president of 
that department eight weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz joined Dick Glover, executive vice president of programming  
for ESPN, and Tony George, president of the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway and founder of the Indy Racing League, in announcing 
Thursday a five-year extension of the contract that would have 
expired after ABC's 35th consecutive Indy 500 May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were two major reasons why this was my No. 1 priority,''  
Katz said. ``No. 1, the Indy 500 is an American institution. There 
are only certain sports events that rise above everything, and the 
Indy 500 is one of those. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second, this is the 35th year that ABC has had this event.  
There's a tradition here. I think it's far worse to lose something 
you've had than to not have something. And I'm trying to turn this 
department around, emotionally as well as strategically. It was 
important to make this happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No dollar amounts were revealed for the extension through 2004,  
but TV sources, who asked not to be identified, said published 
reports of $13 million to $14 million per year were accurate. The 
previous contract paid the speedway was between $9 million and $10 
million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz said ABC will continue to broadcast the 500 and also will  
air five other IRL events in 2000, with ESPN broadcasting the other 
five races on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, ABC showed the IRL season-opener at Orlando, Fla.,  
but the Fox Networks are doing the rest of the schedule, excluding 
Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the arrival of Katz, ABC was reluctant to bid on  
extending the contract because ratings have slipped 35 percent in 
the three years since the IRL was formed and the established CART 
series began boycotting the race. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the last year the CART teams and drivers were here, the  
rating was 8.4. Last May, it slipped to 5.5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Special credit needs to be given to Howard Katz, who made this  
agreement his personal priority,'' George said. ``Without Howard's 
enthusiasm and commitment, we would not be here making this 
announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot invested here,'' Katz said. ``We've made a  
commitment and we're going to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, both the IRL and CART have drawn minuscule TV ratings  
since the split. But Katz said that just means there's work to be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've got to build stars,'' he said. ``You've got to  
have a reason to root for or even against people. If you look at 
it, a lot of big names have retired from open-wheel racing in 
recent years. And there's been a general deterioration of TV 
ratings in a lot of platforms, with a greater fragmentation of 
audiences and more things to do, more things to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're hoping we can do things that will create excitement  
and interest and grow this audience. We think it can be done or we 
wouldn't be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, whose cable network has the contract with CART -- which  
runs through 2001 -- said, ``The Indy Racing League rounds out the 
best motorsports lineup on television. ABC and ESPN provide the 
best cross-promotional platform in sports ...'

<HEADLINE> Gun Trade Group Pulls Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A gun industry trade group dropped a fledgling  
magazine advertising campaign aimed at changing perceptions about 
firearms soon after last month's Colorado high school slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Shooting Sports Foundation had launched the  
campaign in late March with plans to spend $1 million a year 
running it for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign was aimed at letting opinion leaders know that  
millions of Americans use rifles and guns responsibly for hunting 
and target shooting despite widespread associations of guns with 
crimes and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the foundation's executive director, Doug Painter, said  
Thursday the campaign was pulled a few days after the April 20 
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., left 15 
people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult decision, but we felt that after Littleton,  
the messages in these ads might not be as appropriate, might not be 
as relevant in the context of this moment,'' he said. ``There is so 
much emotion surrounding this issue, we felt our message would be 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Painter said foundation officials also didn't want to offend  
readers. ``There was an understandably emotional reaction against 
everything that has to do with firearms,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, authorities said a student at a school in Georgia  
shot six classmates before surrendering. In Washington, the Senate 
approved fresh restrictions on firearms sales at gun shows and 
pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
	Clive Chajet, who heads his own corporate image consultancy in  
New York, said the gun industry group had no alternative to ending 
the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who attempts to promote the use of guns at this point  
in history is, pun intended, shooting themselves in the foot,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting sports foundation, based in Newtown, Conn.,  
represents 16,000 manufacturers, distributors and retailers of 
firearms and ammunition. It had never before advertised in 
magazines outside those intended for sportsmen and hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry has been under attack in recent years and  
several municipalities have sued gun makers over the public costs 
of violence caused by people using guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation hired the public relations firm Porter Novelli,  
which has represented antitobacco forces in a similar campaign 
against cigarette makers, in August 1998 to develop a campaign to 
get out its message about the safety and popularity of hunting and 
target shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter said Porter Novelli's research indicated ``opinion  
leaders in this country were not so much against the shooting 
sports but were not aware of them. That was a side of the story 
they didn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firm prepared three ads. One showed a rifle below the  
headline ``The very fact that it can be dangerous is what makes it 
safe.'' The ad called the shooting sports ``the safest of all 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Another ad showed a handgun and a target. ``Ever shoot a wad of  
paper into a wastebasket? Then you already understand target 
shooting,'' the ad headline said. It noted there are 21 Olympic 
shooting events. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were slated to appear in magazines like the Atlantic  
Monthly, The Economist and the Columbia Journalism Review. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter said he didn't know how much of the first year's $1  
million media budget was spent before the ads were discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was too soon to tell whether the ad campaign would  
ever be revived. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, an organization of gun owners,  
has been running a campaign for more than a year featuring 
celebrity NRA members like author Tom Clancy, former baseball star 
Nolan Ryan and actor Tom Selleck. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the group, Bill Powers, declined to say whether  
the NRA had adjusted its ad plans in the wake of the Colorado 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ongoing periodic campaign. It doesn't have anything to  
do with'' the shooting in Colorado, he said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit soared to a record  
high for the third straight month in March as the politically 
sensitive deficit with Japan shot up to the highest level in more 
than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that the March deficit of  
$19.7 billion was 2.9 percent higher than the previous record of 
$19.1 billion in February. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the U.S. trade deficit is running at an annual  
rate of $222.6 billion, nearly one-third higher than the all-time 
high of $169.3 billion set last year as the global financial crisis 
continues to wreck havoc with America's trade performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trade data released today confirm the continuing strength  
of the American economy. These data also show the continuing 
weakness of much of the rest of the world,'' said Commerce 
Secretary William M. Daley. ``To improve our trade balance, we will 
have to continue to focust on improving economic conditions abroad 
and ensuring that foreign markets are open to American firms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were some glimmers of hope in the March report. U.S.  
exports, which had fallen for four straight months, staged a small 
rebound in March, climbing by 0.9 percent to $77.5 billion as 
exports of farm goods were up 2.5 percent, led by rising sales of 
soybeans and corn. 
</P>
<P>
	But strong consumer demand in the United States caused imports  
to rise even faster, climbing 1.3 percent to a record $97.2 
billion. Imports of foreign cars and parts hit an all-time high of 
$14.9 billion, a 2.5 percent increase over the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	But a separate report on steel imports showed that they fell by  
14 percent in April, based on preliminary data, a good sign for the 
country's beleaguered steel industry, which has been battered by a 
flood of cheap imports the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Labor Department issued a report showing that  
America's strong economy was continuing. The number of Americans 
filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 last 
week to 299,000, a sign that tight labor market conditions were 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration argues that the overall deficit  
represents a sign of American strength. As the only major world 
economy doing well at the present, the United States is playing a 
valuable role by providing a market for crisis countries who are 
struggling to emerge from deep recessions triggered by the currency 
crisis that began in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration is also worried that if the deficit rises  
too high, it will spawn unstoppable protectionist pressures in 
Congress from industries who have been severely hurt by the 
competition from cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has already won a lopsided vote in the House  
to impose global quotas on steel imports into the United States 
despite a threatened presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration claims the measure is blatantly in violation  
of World Trade Organization rules and would put the country's 
exporters at risk of copy-cat retaliation by other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	On steel, the government released a separate report today  
showing that steel imports in April fell by 14 percent to 2.24 
million metric tons, with steel imports from Japan down an even 
larger 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has warned Japan that unless its shipments to  
the United States return to pre-1997 levels quickly, the 
administration will bring its own trade sanction case against 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	For March, America's overall deficit with Japan shot up 23.2  
percent to $6.5 billion as Japanese imports to the United States 
climbed to an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has warned Japan that it should not try to  
export its way out of its worst recession in 50 years. Instead, the 
United States, with rising urgency, has been pushing Japan to do 
more to jump-start domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with China declined by 10.5 percent in March  
to $4.1 billion, but was still the second largest for any nation. 
China has been negotiating a trade agreement to lower barriers to 
American goods in hopes it will clear the way for China's entry 
into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in  
Yugoslavia and tensions over human rights have called into question 
whether a deal can be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with the 15-nation European Union shot up 30  
percent in March to $2.6 billion while America's deficit with 
Mexico, its partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement, hit 
a record $2.5 billion, up 26 percent from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been arguing that the United States  
cannot sustain such high deficits and that other economic powers, 
specifically Japan and Europe, must do their part by boosting 
growth at home so that they can serve as markets for countries in 
economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Debate Over Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democrats seeking the White House are  
jousting over who is toughest on gun control, even as many 
Republicans with the same goal are making it clear they also favor 
some restrictions in the wake of yet another school shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	A fresh round of polling showed voters ever more in favor of  
restrictions, and congressional actions on gun control are likely 
to keep the debate going. 
</P>
<P>
	One GOP candidate took credit for being miles ahead on gun  
control during a hectic day of fighting after a shooting at a 
school outside Atlanta rekindled the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, Vice President Al Gore voted to break a Senate tie  
and approve an amendment to require background checks for all 
firearms transactions at all gun shows and pawn shops. ``This is a 
turning point for our country,'' Gore said in touting his vote, 
which drew a congratulatory call from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only announced  
rival for the Democratic nomination, scornfully said White House 
gun control initiatives ``are minimums'' and much stronger actions 
must be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before this is over, we are going to have to do something much  
stronger,'' Bradley said at a news conference while campaigning in 
Iowa. He said he was formulating a proposal on the issue and would 
offer it ``sooner rather than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore believes ``there's no one  
answer to helping to protect our kids,'' but the new restrictions 
will help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do everything we possibly can from availability of  
guns and today's tie-breaking vote in the Senate is a good step in 
that direction,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation the Senate passed, 73-25, Thursday night would  
require the sale of safety devices with handguns and expand a 
system of background checks for firearms purchasers. The House has 
not yet considered the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican contenders took care to note they do not flatly  
oppose gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I first started running for office, I've been for  
background checks, instant background checks,'' said Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. ``I think background checks are important to make 
sure that guns don't get in the hands of felons and-or people who 
shouldn't be carrying guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Elizabeth Dole noted that she began calling for gun  
control three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did it first,'' said spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``She did it  
when it wasn't popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio noted that he voted for a ban on  
assault-style weapons and ``there's some legitimate tightening we 
can do.'' He urged caution, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at gun control as a way to pass three laws and think  
we've fixed the problem,'' Kasich said. ``I'm going to look at 
additional restrictions that make sense, but I'm going to be very 
careful about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to former Vice President Dan Quayle said he preferred to  
focus on what he sees as declining cultural values that are the 
root cause of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan Quayle believes there's one issue, and that's the  
culture,'' said spokesman Jonathan Baron. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for former Education Secretary Lamar  
Alexander, said Alexander favored some restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would sign legislation requiring background checks at gun  
shows,'' but he opposes ``unreasonable'' restrictions, Schmidt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates spoke hours after the latest school shooting, at  
a suburban Atlanta high school, where six students were wounded, 
and after the Senate approved new gun restrictions it had rejected 
just last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It adds another impetus for doing something very significant  
on gun control,'' said Bradley. ``The things that have been 
proposed by the White House are minimums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, seeking the GOP nomination, said he  
would focus on the school shooting issue during a speech Saturday 
to the Georgia Republican Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there are some real and important steps local, state  
and national leaders can and must take to keep our kids safe and 
bring real discipline and values back into our classrooms,'' Forbes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush announced a $420,000 grant to create a Texas School Safety  
Center to examine ways of curbing violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obviously a part of the American tragedy that children  
are coming to school and shooting people, and our society has got 
to do everything we can to figure out ways to prohibit violence,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a new poll released by the Pew Research Center for  
the People &AMP; the Press indicated that large majorities of Democrats 
and of Republican women were more inclined to say it was more 
important to control gun ownership than to protect the rights of 
gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was taken before the Georgia shootings. Other surveys  
taken after the deadly shooting spree in Littleton, Colo., showed 
public support for gun control elevated by the school incident.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Climb / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages has jumped to its highest level since November 
1997, an expected reaction to a Federal Reserve warning it might 
raise a key interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The average this week was 7.23 percent, up from 7.10 percent the  
previous week, the mortgage company Freddie Mac said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve officials said Tuesday if signs of inflation  
continue to show up in the U.S. economy, they were leaning toward 
raising, later this year, the interest rate banks charge each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the government reported consumer prices rose by 0.7  
percent in April, the biggest monthly jump in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	``With ... the Fed's announcement of its bias toward higher  
interest rates, mortgage rates began to climb,'' said Frank 
Nothaft, deputy chief economist for Freddie Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates, along with other interest rates set by financial  
markets, are extremely sensitive to the disposition of Fed 
policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, analysts say central bank officials may have anticipated  
their warning alone would be enough to boost some interest rates 
that affect consumers, therefore helping to put a gentle brake on 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Low mortgage rates have helped bring about a record home-buying  
boom, accompanied by spending on new furniture, appliances and 
other household items. That activity has kept the U.S. economy 
strong amid widespread financial troubles abroad during the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that some demand for American products overseas is  
recovering, continued low unemployment in the United States and 
robust consumer spending make inflation a bigger worry. 
</P>
<P>
	Before March, mortgage rates had held below 7.0 percent since  
last summer. This week's rise -- the sharpest of five straight -- 
brought the 30-year mortgage rate to its highest level since the 
first week in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.83 percent this week, up from 6.71 percent. That is the 
highest since 15-year rates were at 6.85 percent during the last 
week of April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.76 percent this week, up from 5.71 the 
week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE>  Sweden Goes to World Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Jonas Bjorkman breezed to a  
straight-set victory over an impatient Greg Rusedski Thursday as 
Sweden swept Britain to reach its fifth final at the World Team 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden won the Red Group match 3-0, wrapping it up early by  
taking both singles as Bjorkman rolled past Rusedski 6-2, 6-2, and 
Thomas Enqvist outlasted Tim Henmann 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bjorkman and Niklas Kulti then beat Rusedski and Henman 6-3,  
5-7, 6-1 in a meaningless doubles at the $1.65 million event, which 
pits eight top tennis countries against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Group winner will be decided in a showdown of unbeatens  
Friday with Pat Rafter-led Australia facing the United States and 
its top player, Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care who we play -- both countries have excellent  
individual players,'' said Enqvist. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-serving Rusedski, still trying to prove his power game  
functions on the slow clay, made numerous errors while gambling on 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went into the match with a lot of self-confidence since I  
had already beaten Rusedski five times,'' said Bjorkman, a former 
top player who has slipped to No. 37 in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't play badly, but I made it hard for him with my  
return of serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden, a three-time winner under Stefan Edberg, advanced to  
Saturday's final on the strength of its 2-1 record and a victory 
over Spain, which also finished 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain finished second in the Red Group after beating Germany  
2-1, with defending French Open champion Carlos Moya and Alex 
Corretja wrapping up the match with singles wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya beat Tommy Haas 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 and Corretja struggled for  
two hours, 20 minutes before putting away Nicolas Kiefer, 6-3, 4-6, 
6-4 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Becker and David Prinosil gave Germany its point, beating  
Albert Costa and Jairo Velasco, 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Joplin Home Turned Into Rehab Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Three decades after Janis Joplin died of a  
heroin overdose, a house in the Haight-Ashbury district where she 
lived is being turned into a drug rehab center. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-story Victorian was the scene of many a wild night when  
Joplin lived there in 1967 and 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	After a $350,000 renovation, the home's nine rooms are painted  
yellow and white, with new cribs and beds. The nonprofit Golden 
Gate Community Inc. runs the place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Janis would be really pleased and happy to have this  
happen,'' said Country Joe McDonald, who sometimes played with 
Joplin. ``Really, she was just a regular person who had simple 
pleasures and liked family life. She'd like to know something good 
was being done with that house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One big change -- no stereos. Music distracts people trying to  
live together and shake drugs, said Randy Newcomb, Golden Gate's 
executive director.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Lab Theft Suspected in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intelligence experts were worried three years  
ago about the possible theft of secrets about America's nuclear 
arsenal and believed the Los Alamos weapons lab was the most likely 
source, an Energy Department intelligence officer told a Senate 
panel Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, investigators found the missing ``legacy''  
codes, which contain years of cumulative data about the nation's 
nuclear warheads, in the unsecure computer of a Los Alamos, N.M., 
scientist suspected of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was done, in short was nothing,'' Notra Trulock, acting  
deputy of the Energy Department's Office of Intelligence, said of 
the concerns expressed by intelligence experts in early 1996 about 
potential loss of the top-secret computer codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have applauded Trulock for raising alarms as early as  
1995 about the possible theft of nuclear secrets from weapons labs, 
including information in the 1980s about a sophisticated warhead 
known as the W-88. That theft has been the subject of a four-year 
espionage investigation that prompted the firing of the Los Alamos 
scientist in March. The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged 
with a crime and has denied giving secrets to China or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock, appearing before the Senate Energy and Natural  
Resources Committee, described repeated attempts in early 1997 to 
bring his concerns about espionage and lax security at weapons labs 
to then-Energy Secretary Federico Pena. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that he was repeatedly thwarted by senior DOE officials,  
including Pena's deputy, Elizabeth Moler, and that Pena knew 
nothing of the espionage concerns for about six months. Trulock in 
the past also has accused Moler of muzzling him when he tried to 
testify before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Moler has denied she tried to block Trulock. The allegations  
have been investigated by the DOE's inspector general, but the 
report has not yet been released. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal investigation into the handling of the Los Alamos  
espionage case is near completion and is expected to result in 
disciplinary action against some DOE and laboratory officials and 
possibly former officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why heads are not rolling is beyond me,'' declared Sen. Conrad  
Burns, R-Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock, who was director of the Office of Intelligence from  
1994 into early 1998, said his concerns about espionage at the labs 
were viewed in 1997 with skepticism and ``outright denial'' among 
senior DOE officials. 
</P>
<P>
	They were dismissed as views of ``Cold War warriors,'' said  
Trulock. He said the investigation at Los Alamos into apparent loss 
of secrets about the W-88 warhead was viewed as ``merely a 
historical curiosity and of little relevance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Curran, the FBI official appointed a year ago to consolidate  
and lead counterintelligence efforts at the department, 
acknowledged that in the past there had been ``no accountability'' 
and inadequate support from top officials of the department on 
intelligence and security matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, the committee chairman, derided  
the ``cavalier attitude about security'' described by Trulock and 
suggested that senior administration officials should not be let 
off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a 700-page report by a special House committee  
examining U.S. technology losses to China will conclude that China 
has been able to make substantial gains in modernizing its nuclear 
weapons program because of U.S. secrets obtained in a pervasive 
campaign of espionage and misuse of legally obtained technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, a year in the making, is to be released early next  
week, after months of wrangling between lawmakers and the Clinton 
administration over how much of it should be kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, according to officials familiar with it, concludes  
that there is little question that China has obtained critical 
information about an array of U.S. warheads through theft from U.S. 
nuclear weapons labs as well as meticulous scanning of publicly 
available information. 
</P>
<P>
	Many details of the report have been leaked in recent weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Amid a string of embarrassing revelations in the news media  
about suspected Chinese espionage and lax security at the labs, 
Richardson has revamped the department security structure, imposed 
tighter controls on computers at the labs and directed other new 
security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno announced on Thursday that a veteran  
prosecutor, Randy Bellows, would head a Justice Department 
investigation into whether Justice or the FBI made any mistakes in 
the Wen Ho Lee investigation, dating to 1996.

<HEADLINE> Wartime Camps Exhibit at Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was an odd but moving sight:  
Japanese-American veterans marching into the State Department with 
fife and drum to mark the opening of an exhibit on World War II 
concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit on facilities for Jews in Europe and  
Japanese-Americans in the United States calls them both 
``concentration camps'' that were ``rooted in bigotry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an ironic twist, Japanese-American units that fought in  
Europe were among those who liberated Nazi concentration camps in 
Dachau, Germany, while their own families were forced to live in 
what the U.S. government calls ``internment camps'' in the Western 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, which opened Wednesday, is a departure from U.S.  
policy, which refuses to apply the words ``concentration camp'' to 
the U.S. camps. It also chronicles anti-Semitism and anti-Asian 
sentiment in the United States before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Five decades after they fought for their government -- the U.S.  
government -- the veterans joined with Jewish Americans to tell the 
horror stories of the wartime camps. 
</P>
<P>
	A disclaimer on the exhibit says: ``The use of the words  
'concentration camp' is not intended to equate the American camps 
with the Holocaust camps. The events were differently motivated and 
on different scales, though both were rooted in bigotry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series of photographs, maps and posters greeting visitors at  
the main State Department entrance is sponsored by the 
Japanese-American National Museum in Los Angeles and the National 
Museum of American Jewish Military History in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene Hirano, executive director of the Japanese-American  
museum, said the exhibit pointedly does not use official language 
to describe the plight of 120,000 loyal Japanese-Americans, 
avoiding euphemisms like ``relocation'' and ``evacuation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jewish and Japanese-Americans had a particularly poignant role  
in World War II,'' she said, noting that both were victims of 
prejudice and persecution. To make amends, the U.S. government has 
made $20,000 payments and apologized to more than 82,000 
Japanese-Americans for the World War II internments. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit also focuses on American bigotry in the 1920s and  
1930s. A re-election poster for Sen. James D. Phelan declares: 
``Keep California White.'' Another from a New York judicial race 
says: ``Don't vote for Pike. He's a kike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the display features photos taken by Japanese-American  
soldiers in Europe, including George Oiye of San Jose, Calif., who 
was among those attending the opening. Oiye, 77, said his unit 
liberated several Nazi slave labor camps. His photos show Jewish 
prisoners in black and white concentration camp uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Another veteran, Eddie Ichiyama of Honolulu, also in his 70s,  
said memories of liberating Dachau are still with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I remember most is the gaunt, white faces, and the  
stench,'' he said. ``I don't think we have learned the lessons of 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit comes as the government considers paying $5,000 each  
in reparations to other Japanese-Americans, most of them from Latin 
America, who also spent time in the camps. The measure is part of 
$15 billion spending bill passed by the House on Tuesday and 
scheduled for a vote today in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 ethnic Japanese were rounded up from 13 Latin  
American countries during World War II and forcibly brought to the 
United States. The government had hoped to exchange the group for 
U.S. prisoners of war held by Japan. The exchange program never 
developed and the Japanese Latin Americans were instead housed in 
the camps with Japanese-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has agreed to pay $5,000 to each of them of the  
Latin American Japanese, but only 145 have received payments so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the reparations bill, the Justice Department would  
allocate: 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.58 million for up to 79 eligible Japanese-American cases at  
$20,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.98 million for 395 eligible Japanese Latin American cases at  
$5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	--$665,000 for 133 additional Japanese Latin American cases  
expected to qualify, at $5,000 each.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Lab Integrity Shattered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The director of the Los Alamos National  
Laboratory says the facility has been devastated by allegations of 
espionage and will take years to regain the nation's trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly not going to happen in a year,'' Jon Browne  
said in today's Albuquerque Journal. ``I think you're talking about 
time frames in the three- to five-year range of sustained 
performance in security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lab has been the subject of intense scrutiny this year. The  
apparent theft of nuclear secrets at Los Alamos -- in the 1980s, but 
possibly as recently as 1995 -- has put pressure on officials to 
increase security. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of California operates the lab for the Department  
of Energy. Browne, who has led the lab since 1996, set up a new 
counterintelligence office last year and shut down classified 
computing. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics remain worried over allegations that former Los  
Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee downloaded hundreds of classified 
files. And they're particularly angry that Lee -- who remains under 
an espionage investigation -- remained on the job as long as he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne fired Lee in March for alleged security violations.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with a crime and through a lawyer has  
denied spying or providing secrets to China. China also has denied 
it stole U.S. nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said investigators and DOE officials failed to keep Los  
Alamos executives apprised of their findings and did not clear the 
lab to move Lee out of his job. He described communications as 
``inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't just take action because someone's a suspect in a  
criminal investigation. That would be a terrible situation,'' 
Browne said. ``If at any time someone had said the information is 
good enough to take somebody out of their job, we would have done 
it right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed current problems on such things as ``underestimating  
the (espionage) threat, a nationwide lowering of the guard after 
the end of the Cold War and an attitude that failed to recognize 
small infractions as a harbinger of bigger problems.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Tribune Won't Cover Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Tribune will not cover the  
Indianapolis 500 because race officials barred a Sports Illustrated 
writer from the event, and the Los Angeles Times also is 
considering a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indy Racing League denied credentials for the May 30 race to  
Ed Hinton, SI's senior auto racing writer. IRL officials were upset 
by a photo of a sheet-covered body and an article that appeared in 
the magazine's May 10 issue after three fans were killed May 1 at 
the VisionAire 500 in Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinton wrote in the article, titled ``Fatal Attractions,'' that  
such accidents could be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cherwa, the Tribune's associate managing editor for sports,  
said the newspaper will not cover the event because it believes the 
IRL's decision is wrong and ``shows a complete lack of 
understanding of the role of the press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not exactly standing with Sports Illustrated. But we are  
standing up against the kind of censorship the IRL is trying to 
impose -- telling us who is acceptable to them to cover their 
event,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune plans to use wire services to report on the race.  
</P>
<P>
	Other newspapers also are mulling over coverage plans.  
</P>
<P>
	Rick Jaffe, executive sports editor at the Los Angeles Times,  
said the newspaper was trying to reach IRL officials Wednesday 
evening to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it's right what they're doing,'' he said. ``We  
are considering not covering the Indy 500 and want to talk to them 
to get their side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway offered to provide credentials for a different SI  
writer, but the magazine declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Mai Lindstrom, an IRL spokeswoman, said race officials had no  
comment on the Tribune's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors at other newspapers said they will cover the race, even  
if they don't support the IRL action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what Indy has done with SI is a very bad thing, but  
right now our position is that we need to look out for our readers, 
and our readers are looking for coverage of the race,'' said Greg 
Gibson, sports editor of The Orange County Register, the 
second-largest newspaper in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis Star's sports editor said she understands why  
SI and the Tribune backed out of covering the race, but her 
newspaper won't follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the biggest events that occurs in our hometown,  
and we intend to cover it,'' said Nancy Winkley, The Star's 
assistant managing editor for sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The photograph at the center of the controversy was taken by The  
Associated Press. It showed one victim lying on blood-covered 
grandstand steps with a leg protruding from beneath a sheet and 
another sheet-covered body. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Horton, AP's senior photo editor for sports, said photo  
editors were sensitive to the graphic nature of the photographs and 
took steps to edit them carefully. He said there had been no 
complaints from AP members.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Talks to Littleton Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- On a day of more school bloodshed,  
President Clinton consoled grief-stricken families in the town 
where a murder-suicide rampage by two teen-agers a month ago left 
15 dead and shocked the nation. ``What happened to you has pierced 
the soul of America,'' the president said. 
</P>

	``Something profound has happened to your country because of  
this,'' the president told Columbine High School students, parents, 
faculty and community members. He said that when Columbine seniors 
graduate in two days, ``America will be cheering you on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2,000 people packed Dakota Ridge High School gymnasium to  
hear the president. The audience cheered, whistled and applauded at 
word that two wounded youths had left their hospital beds to be at 
the speech -- Sean Graves and Patrick Ireland, who was pulled from a 
second story window by police the day of the shootings.

<P>
	Clinton said Littleton's suffering and bravery have touched the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can help us to build a better future for all of our  
children, a future where hatred and distrust no longer distort the 
mind or harden the heart, a future where what we have in common is 
far more important than what divides us, a future where parents and 
children are more involved in each other's lives,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his wife Hillary spent nearly two hours at  
Light of the World Catholic Church, going from table to table to 
shake hands with the families of those killed. A month ago, 
counselors had worked at the church with survivors of the 
shootings.

<P>
	Michael Shoels, whose 18-year-old son Isaiah was killed, said  
Clinton put his arm around him. ``He gave us his true condolences 
and I really do believe him,'' Shoels said. ``It went great.'' He 
said he gave Clinton a letter suggesting what should be done now. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks later at the high school, Mrs. Clinton said she was  
impressed by the community's strength and ``your refusal to let 
violence and hatred win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the latest shootings in Conyers, Ga., in which six  
students were injured Thursday morning, before he left Washington, 
were ``deeply troubling to me as it is to all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident again should underscore how profoundly important  
it is that all Americans come together in the face of these events 
to protect all of our children from violence,'' the president said 
at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Hammond, superintendent of Jefferson County School, said  
that Littleton has ``been a symbol of the worst nightmare that you 
could imagine with the loss and injuries of our students and staff 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will also be a symbol to the nation of strength, of  
dedication, of commitment and resilience as we pull together as a 
community with Columbine at our core,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To a community still searching for answers, the president said  
in his remarks here, ``These dark forces that take over people and 
make them murder are the extreme manifestation of fear and rage 
with which every human being has to do combat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Dakota Ridge gymnasium before Clinton spoke, a  
handful of Columbine students talked of breaking into tears when 
they heard the news of gunfire at the Georgia school. 
</P>
<P>
	It was exactly one month ago that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris  
terrorized Columbine, killing 12 classmates and a teacher before 
shooting themselves dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Student body president Heather Dinkel tugged at her dress, took  
a deep breath and hugged her mother as they waited for the Clintons 
to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about it,'' she said when asked about the  
presidential visit. ``It's been so overwhelming the last few 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her twin brother Mike, also a Columbine senior, said the  
Clintons could ``make some people here see that their problems are 
something that even big people like the president are going to help 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But 15-year-old Kerin Lucero, who was in the school cafeteria  
when the shooting started, had mixed feelings about Clinton's 
visit. ``It made everything come right back; it opened the wounds 
again,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbine High School shootings April 20 also had an effect  
on the nation's debate on gun control, softening Republican 
opposition in Congress to tougher measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest step came Thursday as the Senate, after angry calls  
from constituents, approved a Democratic plan to require background 
checks for firearms buyers at gun shows and pawnshops. Vice 
President Al Gore cast the deciding vote; Clinton called him from 
Air Force One with congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seizing on the Columbine shootings, Clinton has begun a national  
campaign against school violence, urging more gun control and less 
violence in movies, music and video games.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Talks to Littleton Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- On a day of more school bloodshed,  
President Clinton consoled grief-stricken families in the town 
where a murder-suicide rampage by two teen-agers a month ago left 
15 dead and shocked the nation. ``What happened to you has pierced 
the soul of America,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something profound has happened to your country because of

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Around lunchtime every Friday, Mohammad Abdallah  
left his sales job in suburban Lincolnshire for the 20-minute drive 
to his mosque. There, he removed his shoes, faced east toward Mecca 
and followed his spiritual leader, his imam, in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Muslims, Friday is the holy day,'' the 30-year-old  
Abdallah explains. 
</P>
<P>
	The service took him away from work for about an hour and 15  
minutes, including the 30 minutes he counted as lunch. ``I would 
make up the time I missed by coming in early or working late,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly observance, however, eventually cost the  
Jordanian-American his job. He took his case to the U.S. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission and won a $49,000 settlement in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of worshippers are pursuing workplace  
complaints: among them, Muslim women who refuse to remove 
head-scarves at work; evangelical Christians who bring religious 
objects to the office; and Jews who oppose working on the Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Kamp, an attorney in the EEOC's Chicago office, says it's  
unclear to what extent an employer has to accommodate an employee's 
religious beliefs, and so the agency is giving priority to such 
cases in hopes the courts will provide answers. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1998, the EEOC considered 1,786 allegations of  
religious discrimination, compared with 1,584 two years earlier. In 
1998, 325 had outcomes favorable to the complainants, compared with 
165 in fiscal 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers are much smaller for some other types of cases  
before the EEOC. In fiscal 1998, for example, there were 24,454 
complaints of sex discrimination, and $58.7 million in payments to 
complainants. That compares with $2.6 million for religious 
discrimination cases. 
</P>
<P>
	What does the law provide where workplace needs and religious  
practices collide? 
</P>
<P>
	Abba Cohen, Washington counsel for Agudath Israel of America, a  
national Orthodox Jewish organization, says employers are legally 
required to accommodate a religiously observant person unless doing 
so would cause what the law calls an ``undue hardship.'' And the 
courts have found it has to be only ``a little bit more than a 
minimal amount of hardship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago attorney Michael Karpeles, who has represented  
businesses in religion discrimination cases, said employers must 
try to balance workers' religious interests with their companies' 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If all the employer has to do is to make modest or minimal  
adjustments, they probably are wise to make those adjustments and 
work things out with the employee,'' Karpeles said. ``If they get 
to the point they are having so many requests and it's hard to 
accommodate all of them, they can feel comfortable drawing the line 
and saying, 'We've done all we can reasonably do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cases involving religious beliefs, however, aren't always  
clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdallah's former employer, W.W. Grainger Inc., said it allowed  
his midday absences during his 15 months there until a co-worker 
died, leaving the staff stretched. 
</P>
<P>
	Grainger labor counsel Hank Galatz said Abdallah refused to  
temporarily suspend the absences. Abdallah, however, says 
short-staffing wasn't the real issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had it been temporary, I would have been more than happy to  
accommodate them,'' Abdallah said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, seven Muslim women who said they were fired for  
refusing to remove their head-scarves while working security jobs 
at Dulles International Airport near Washington learned last month 
that they could return to work. The agreement was part of a 
settlement reached with Atlanta-based Argenbright Security Inc. to 
avoid an EEOC complaint. The company contended the women were never 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims who strictly interpret their religion consider it  
obligatory for women to cover their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the EEOC accused the University of Chicago  
Hospitals of discriminating against an evangelical Christian 
employee. Victoria Levya, who recruited entry-level employees such 
as janitors, contends her supervisor told her not to hire people 
from her church and prohibited her from keeping religious objects, 
such as a church clock and inspirational calendar, on her desk. Her 
case is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesman John Easton denies Levya's claim of religious  
discrimination and said she was told not to recruit only people of 
a particular religion. ``There was concern that the prominent 
display of religious items in the employment office could be 
perceived as discrimination against candidates with other 
religions,'' Easton added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Karpeles believes it's better for employees and employers  
``to try to work these issues out'' rather than resort to lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Theologian Martin Marty, whose studies include religion in  
public life, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hunch is that many of these things used to get settled in  
the backyard,'' he says, ``or a walk down to the coffee shop ... 
and now immediately end up in court. If both sides would lower 
their voices ... we'd be better off.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Finance Chief Is Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. chief financial officer  
John M. Devine has decided to retire at the end of September, the 
nation's second biggest automaker announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Chairman W. Wayne Booker will assume the additional role of  
chief financial officer on July 1, Ford said. It said Devine will 
remain on to help with the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Devine, a 31-year veteran of Ford, had also held the title of  
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted ``to explore other opportunities involving  
wider responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devine became chief financial officer in 1994. Before that, he  
spent six years as president, and later as chairman, of First 
Nationwide Bank, which then was a Ford subsidiary.

<HEADLINE> Fed OKs BT, Deutsche Bank Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. and Germany's Deutsche  
Bank AG have cleared a major hurdle on their way to creating the 
world's largest financial institution, securing the Federal 
Reserve's approval for their $10.2 billion merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 6-0 Thursday by the central bank's board of  
governors, who determined the acquisition of the nation's 
eighth-largest bank by Germany's largest would not threaten banking 
competition in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bankers Trust concentrates on banking for big  
corporations and does no retail consumer business. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would create a transnational financial powerhouse  
with $830 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Bankers Trust would be the biggest takeover  
of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank. The institution 
would be larger than UBS AG of Switzerland, currently the largest 
bank, and the recently formed Citigroup Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushing through regulatory channels on two continents since they  
announced the deal last November, the two banks have surmounted 
concerns over competition, the mixing of banking and commerce, and 
the claims of Holocaust survivors and heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators apparently were not troubled by Deutsche Bank's  
12 percent stake in the newly-formed automaker DaimlerChrysler AG. 
According to U.S. laws that separate banks from other kinds of 
corporations, banks in this country are prohibited from owning more 
than 5 percent of a nonfinancial company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve's approval was the latest in a series of  
hurdles cleared by the merger recently, leaving only approval from 
authorities in Canada and New Jersey to be secured. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks said in a statement Thursday they expected the  
merger might be completed as early as next month. They called the 
Fed's approval ``a further decisive step'' towards completion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, under pressure from the U.S. State  
Department, New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi withdrew his 
opposition to the deal, acknowledging that the two banks had made 
progress in resolving Holocaust claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Holocaust survivors and heirs have been seeking restitution for  
millions of dollars in Jewish property and financial holdings 
stolen by the Nazis in the World War II era and hidden in various 
European banks. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official had warned that opposition to the  
merger on political grounds could chill the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed noted in its decision that it had received written  
comments from people and groups expressing concern about Deutsche 
Bank's activities during the war and urging it to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently discovered files from eastern Europe showed that loans  
from a Deutsche Bank branch in Nazi-occupied Poland helped finance 
the Auschwitz death camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After a careful review, the Fed said it had concluded that  
Holocaust-related issues ``do not warrant denial'' of the proposed 
merger. The Fed noted that Deutsche Bank had recently joined with 
other German banks, insurers and other companies to set up a 
humanitarian fund to benefit Holocaust victims and compensate slave 
laborers from the wartime era. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state's banking regulators and European Union  
authorities have also approved the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In the resolution of another matter, Bankers Trust agreed in  
March to pay $63.5 million in fines to settle federal prosecutors' 
charges that it boosted its financial performance by unlawfully 
diverting millions of dollars from unclaimed customer accounts into 
its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea entered in a federal court brought a speedy resolution  
to accusations that the bank made false entries in its books to 
conceal the true source of $19.1 million its employees diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust has some $133 billion in assets. Deutsche Bank has  
assets of $734 billion.

<HEADLINE> Fox Adds Eight New Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox is adding to its fall schedule a condensed  
version of ``Ally McBeal,'' a ``Party of Five'' spinoff with 
Jennifer Love Hewitt and a drama about a virtual reality game gone 
awry from the creator of ``The X-Files.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network's new entertainment chief, Doug Herzog, also said  
Thursday he was following through on a promise to cut back on Fox's 
rollicking reality shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, struggling UPN cemented its effort to appeal to young  
men by sinking its ``Love Boat'' remake and adding a two-hour 
weekly World Wrestling Federation show to its fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN and Fox were the last of the seven broadcast networks to  
unveil their fall schedules to advertisers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is the fourth-rated network, but near the top among young  
people. It returns three dramas to its schedule -- ``Party of 
Five,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' -- but there's 
a strong possibility this is the final season for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for the next generation of programming, Fox included  
five dramas among the eight news shows that will join its fall 
lineup. One is ``Time of Your Life,'' which moves Hewitt's 
character to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Carter, creator of ``The X-Files,'' is also behind the  
dark action series, ``Harsh Realm.'' Fox also returns ``Cops'' and 
``America's Most Wanted'' on Saturday nights and premieres a gritty 
drama about a 19-year-old policeman, ``Ryan Caulfield,'' at a time 
when there's a concern about media depiction of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sensitive issue and we'll be keeping our eye on it, no  
question about it,'' Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesdays, Fox will run a half-hour ``Ally McBeal'' edition  
fashioned from outtakes and material from the show's first two 
seasons. It's an intriguing new programming concept that appeals to 
network executives' search for cheaper shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, you'll probably see more of this thing at the  
networks going forward,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herzog promised this winter to cut back on Fox's reality shows.  
He left ``Guiness Book of World Records'' and ``World's Funniest'' 
off the schedule. Most of the reality shows air as specials, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox canceled ``Millennium'' and left the animated comedy, ``The  
PJs,'' off the schedule, although it will return as a sub series. 
``Melrose Place'' has retired. ``Party of Five'' is moving to 
Tuesdays, and the cartoons ``King of the Hill'' and ``Futurama'' 
will be shifted to Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-rated UPN has taken note of professional wrestling's hold on  
the cable TV audience and asked the World Wrestling Federation to 
produce a broadcast version. ``WWF Smackdown!'' will air at 8 p.m. 
Thursdays and will be tamer than the cable shows, UPN president 
Dean Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will probably be toned down a bit in terms of language and  
the upraised finger -- you'll see a lot less of it,'' Valentine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN will spin off its most popular sitcom, ``Moesha,'' with the  
comedy, ``Mo'Nique,'' and shift its comedies that appeal to a black 
audience to Mondays. Its five new series also include ``The Grown 
Ups,'' starring former ``Family Matters'' actor Jaleel White. 
</P>
<P>
	Its other new series are ``Shasta McNasty,'' a modern-day  
version of the Monkees, and the spy drama, ``Secret Agent Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Love Boat,'' the network is canceling  
``Clueless,'' ``The Sentinel'' and ``Between Brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's other new programs include:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Get Real,'' a family drama about a couple and their three  
high school-aged children. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Manchester Prep,'' a drama about a prep school student from  
New York City who moves in with his father's new family, setting up 
a rivalry with his stepsister. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Action,'' a comedy starring Jay Mohr and Illeana Douglas that  
is a satirical look at Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Malcolm in the Middle,'' a family comedy about a  
nine-year-old genius.

<HEADLINE> Neb. OKs Moratorium on Executions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- The Nebraska Legislature today became the  
first in the nation to place a moratorium on executions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would put a two-year ban on executions while a study is  
done to see if the death penalty is being applied fairly in the 
state. Death sentences could be imposed during the two years, but 
no executions would take place. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-chamber, nonpartisan Legislature approved the bill on a  
vote of 27-21 -- two more than the 25 needed to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican and Roman Catholic in his first year in office,  
Gov. Mike Johanns must decide whether to maintain his longtime 
stance in favor of the death penalty and veto the bill, or sign it 
into law and jostle his party's platform. He could also let it 
become law automatically without his signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said he will consider the measure over the next several  
days. He indicated he likely wouldn't let it become law without his 
signature.

	``I think I'm here for a purpose. I think I'm here to make  
difficult decisions,'' he said. ``With the unicameral system -- 
which is of course unique in the country -- the checks and balances 
is with the governor's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor reiterated his support of the death penalty: ``I  
think it has a place in the criminal justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association and the National Conference of  
Catholic Bishops have called for such moratoriums. Other states 
have considered them but have not approved legislation, said the 
Death Penalty Information Center, an anti-death penalty group in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois House recently passed a resolution endorsing a  
study of the death penalty that would include a six-month 
moratorium on executions and a task force to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns could choose to take no action on the Nebraska measure  
and it would become law automatically. State GOP chief Chuck 
Sigerson has urged the governor to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Support of the death penalty is essential to the (GOP)  
platform,'' Sigerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men have been put to death since Nebraska resumed  
executions in 1994 after a 35-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns discussed the moratorium privately with Sens. Ernie  
Chambers and Kermit Brashear, the sponsors who pushed the bill 
through three rounds of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers has proposed abolishing the death penalty nearly every  
year since his election in 1970, but Brashear's support for the 
moratorium surprised statehouse insiders.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Conn. Store Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Investigators were sifting through the  
rubble of a liquor store Thursday to try and find out why the 
building exploded, killing two people and injuring 11 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast Wednesday leveled most of the two-story building,  
which housed Venancio's Wine &AMP; Liquor on the first floor and three 
apartments above. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw anything like it. It was like the whole roof  
lifted up and fell on the sidewalk,'' said Ed Pryblski, whose 
brother, Michael, co-owns the liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were looking into reports of gasoline odors before  
the blast, Deputy Fire Chief Peter Siecienski said. 
</P>
<P>
	And environmental officials were trying to determine whether a  
stream that ran under a corner of the building carried gasoline 
vapors inside, Siecienski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials said there was no evidence the explosion was  
intentional. Gas company officials detected no leaks at the site 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the blast, rescuers dug through the rubble for  
hours Wednesday night for two men they knew were trapped in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	One man did not survive, but a 36-year-old store employee,  
Jeffrey Keeler, was found alive pinned against a wall under burning 
debris. He was in critical condition at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, using police dogs and heavy machinery to move  
debris, later pulled a second body from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten other people were hospitalized for non-life threatening  
injuries.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Private School Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation allowing IRA-like, tax-free  
accounts to pay private school costs is moving in the 
Republican-led Senate, setting the stage for a likely veto 
confrontation with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday approved a measure --  
similar to one vetoed by Clinton last year -- that would allow 
parents to save up to $2,000 a year in Education Savings Accounts 
and withdraw the money tax-free for public or private school costs 
in kindergarten through 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill cleared the panel after Republicans shot down a  
Democratic attempt to substitute a version of Clinton's $25 billion 
school construction proposal. It does contain a smaller 
construction plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the GOP believes federal help is  
better spent on giving parents freedom to choose the best schools 
than on construction projects that don't address the quality of 
classroom education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many working Americans, taxpayers, are trapped in these  
failing schools,'' Gramm said. ``They are more capable than we are 
of deciding what is best for their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would expand existing accounts that now are used only  
for higher education and raise the annual contribution cap from 
$500 to $2,000. The money could be spent on public, private, 
parochial or home-school expenses such as tuition, books, supplies 
and required uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton argued last year that the cost of the accounts -- about  
$2.6 billion of the bill's overall 10-year price tag of $7.6 
billion -- is money better spent repairing or replacing crumbling 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Education Association, a major Democratic ally,  
cited Treasury Department statistics in contending that 70 percent 
of the benefits would go to the wealthiest 20 percent of families -- 
and only 7 percent of American families have children in private 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Education Secretary Richard  
Riley in a joint letter to senators said the accounts would 
generate little savings, increase tax complexity and ``reward 
families, particularly those with significant means, for what they 
may do in any case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the legislation's main sponsors, Republican Sen. Paul  
Coverdell of Georgia and Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New 
Jersey, told reporters the accounts would help 14 million 
middle-class families save an estimated $12 billion of their own 
money for both public and private education costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This important legislation will benefit all American families,  
especially those families earning under $75,000 a year,'' Coverdell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Bob Graham,  
D-Fla., that would relax revenue bond rules for schools and add 
schools to the projects that can be paid for with tax-exempt 
private activity bonds. That would let each state issue school 
construction bonds each year worth $10 per resident or $5 million, 
whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a proposal to allow tax-free distributions from  
state-sponsored and private prepaid college tuition plans, and 
would extend an expiring tax break for employers who pay for 
college level education expenses for their workers and eliminate 
the 60-month limit on tax deductibility of student loan interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats tried to delete the education IRA provisions and  
replace them with Clinton's proposal to bolster existing revenue 
bond programs, which would raise $25 billion in 2000 and 2001 to 
renovate or build schools. A third of the money would go to the 
poorest inner-city school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to help those who are most in need of  
assistance,'' Sen. Chuck Robb, D-Va., said. 
</P>
<P>
	But voting largely along party lines, the Finance Committee  
defeated their amendment, 12-8, and then approved the original 
bill, with three committee Democrats in support. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the bill would  
move independently in June or July from the Republicans' 
as-yet-unknown plan to cut taxes by $778 billion over 10 years 
using projected budget surpluses. The education measure would be 
paid for by closing certain business tax loopholes and similar 
revenue raisers.

<HEADLINE> Changing Cover Girls: Who Will Sell? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The woman on the magazine cover isn't Kate or  
Claudia or another fab supermodel. Still, she's so famous that the 
browser almost has to take a second look -- and may even buy the 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The cover girl's appeal? She's a superstar, not a supermodel.  
</P>
<P>
	Fashion magazine editors are putting more famous faces from  
movies and television to music on covers, hoping the box office 
power of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore or Mariah Carey will succeed 
at newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems the obvious solution when they're saying in publishing  
circles that supermodels are as passe as last season's hemline. 
Some critics say models have exhibited less-than-model behavior. Ot 
they've become boring. Or even worse -- old. 
</P>
<P>
	The megamodels still have cover girl faces, but their star power  
has dimmed, now that the runways are no longer ruled by the deified 
six: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy 
Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and Kate Moss. And their heirs aren't 
apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one is yet sure whether entertainers or models sell  
better. Last January, a death knell directive from leading fashion 
editor Linda Wells appeared in The New York Times: ``Nobody cares 
about models anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Ms. Wells, the editor of Allure, is not so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I sounded too harsh. It is not as dire as that,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, she added, ``Americans might be slightly less captivated  
by models' daily habits and ... their latest spats with their 
boyfriends or agents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allure, which had a cover ratio of 10 models to two stars in  
1998, is flip-flopping those figures. Vogue increased celebrity 
covers last year from two to seven. Mademoiselle and Elle also have 
swung to star power. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm gambling on this, and it's an important gamble,'' said Ms.  
Wells, who lined up actresses Angelina Jolie and Julianne Moore for 
spring covers. ``We are putting a lot more celebrities on the cover 
because I believe they will sell more. After all, that's what we're 
trying to do, sell magazines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing a hot cover is not an exact science. Not every  
celebrity cover scores. Sometimes it's timing -- fall fashion issues 
are usually best sellers, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	And according to magazine sales, today's fashion face is Oprah  
Winfrey. Her October cover was Vogue's 1998 best seller, with some 
810,000 newsstand sales. The talk-show queen likewise reigned in 
first place at In Style, with 844,000 newsstand sales for November. 
</P>
<P>
	Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal'' was Harper's Bazaar's top  
seller for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Public personalities also are stealing the spotlight -- a Hillary  
Rodham Clinton cover on Vogue got excellent grades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some women's magazines are tossing off models because people  
identify more with celebrities,'' said Lisa Granatstein, senior 
editor at Mediaweek, a New York-based trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	She explained the celebrities' appeal: ``You know they've just  
broken up with their husband, you know their latest movie, you know 
their every move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Lambert, who founded the New York designer previews  
known as Fashion Week, said that the word ``supermodel'' derived 
from ``a group of young women with slatlike bodies and colorless 
personalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, today's supermodels could flourish by making the  
transition from model to actress as did Audrey Hepburn, Jane Fonda, 
Cybill Shepherd, Kim Basinger and Sharon Stone. Naomi Campbell 
could be the next escapee to film stardom in the upcoming 
``Prisoner of Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always say it is my last (modeling) season because I think  
they're not going to want me anymore,'' she told Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder she worries -- the headline on her profile in the March  
issue read ``The Last Supermodel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is Ms. Campbell indeed the end of a breed?  
</P>
<P>
	About 10 years have passed since the decade's best-known  
mannequins revolutionized the genre. Perhaps they were too hot not 
to cool down. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe the supermodel image just got old -- literally -- since  
most of the big names are over 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Some style watchers expect another generation of megamodels on  
the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as there have been magazines, there have been star  
models,'' said Eileen Ford, who founded Ford Models in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ford would know. On her payroll were Cheryl Tiegs, who  
racked up 24 Glamour covers between 1967 and 1989, and Christie 
Brinkley, who scored 19, from 1975 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect at some point the celebrity tide will swing back,''  
said Elaina Richardson, editor of Elle. ``If you think about a 
Twiggy or a Jean Shrimpton, there have been very famous models who 
had more celebrity than most actresses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ms. Richardson put actress Cate Blanchett on the  
magazine's cover for May and stockpiled 1998 covers with Sharon 
Stone, Minnie Driver and Salma Hayek. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be, however, that neither celebrities nor models are  
the biggest draw. Ms. Ford recalled that McCall's once ran a test 
to see whether a model or a strawberry shortcake on the cover would 
draw more readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know which (sold more), don't you -- the strawberry  
shortcake,'' she said. ''We almost died of horror.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves To Work for NASD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edward S. Knight, general counsel of the  
Treasury Department since September 1994, is leaving the government 
to become executive vice president and chief legal officer of the 
National Association of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, a self-policing trade group for the securities  
brokerage industry, announced Wednesday that Knight would begin his 
new position July 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes a week after Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin  
announced he was stepping down, also in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, 48, will provide legal advice to the NASD's senior  
managers and will oversee the association's legal services. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Treasury, Knight gave legal and policy advice to Rubin  
and other top officials and oversaw the department's 2,200 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight played a key role last fall in arranging a $5 billion  
U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund's $41.5 
billion rescue package for Brazil. The American contribution is in 
the form of U.S. government guarantees for loans to Brazil from the 
Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Before entering the government, Knight was a partner with the  
Washington law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, a native of Amarillo, Texas, has a bachelor's degree in  
Latin American studies and a law degree from the University of 
Texas.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Closer to Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's close friends and  
advisers expect her to take a dramatic step closer to running for 
the Senate in New York by forming an exploratory campaign committee 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Two longtime associates, both speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said this week the first lady has suggested that she 
will form the committee, which would allow her to raise and spend 
money while determining whether to seek the seat of retiring 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior adviser intimately familiar with Mrs. Clinton's  
decision-making process said Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton has not 
directed her political or legal teams to form the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Final word on the matter is not expected before she and  
President Clinton return from a brief Florida vacation May 30, the 
adviser said, also speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton plans to use that time to discuss the race with the  
president and their daughter, Chelsea, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser said while it was not likely, it still was possible  
Mrs. Clinton could decide this month not to seek the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	She is more likely to return from vacation and remain mum on her  
intentions, continuing to explore the race and moving ever closer 
to a full-fledged campaign, the three sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	If she takes this route, political and legal considerations  
would force Mrs. Clinton to form an exploratory committee almost 
immediately, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	All three sources said Mrs. Clinton's staff and advisers now  
believe she is more likely than not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's supporters long have suspected she would form an  
exploratory committee. The matter took on greater importance after 
she began to be criticized for traveling to New York at taxpayers' 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Forming a committee would allow Mrs. Clinton to raise money to  
help finance the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Arranging for the first lady to travel is expensive, though the  
full costs never are disclosed. Mrs. Clinton goes with a Secret 
Service entourage and a handful of aides, staying at pricey hotels 
and flying aboard government planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the exploratory committee, taxpayers would cover most  
of her costs. Under federal policy, campaigns do not pay the full 
cost of flying government planes or providing Secret Service 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Mrs. Clinton rules out the bid in June, she is not  
expected formally to enter the race for weeks or months. Friends 
and advisers, however, say it would be difficult to turn away from 
the race once she forms an exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	She determined weeks ago that a Senate seat would be a good  
platform for her advocacy of children and women's issues and a 
steppingstone for a potential long-term goal -- seeking the 
presidency. Associates also say Mrs. Clinton knows she could lose 
the race, and is increasingly willing to take that risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Her most likely GOP rival, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,  
would be a formidable candidate. Aides to GOP Gov. George Pataki 
say he plans to make a major political announcement next week, 
stirring rumors that he might seek the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the potential hurdles to the race are the logistics of  
running for the Senate in New York while being first lady, one of 
the associates said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second associate, a longtime ally who would prefer that she  
not seek the seat, said Mrs. Clinton has told friends the 
opportunity may be too good to pass up.

<HEADLINE> GOP Bill Kills Gore Space Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's vision of putting an  
Earth-viewing satellite in orbit has been brought down to Earth by 
House Republicans who say the idea is wasteful and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Wednesday approved a three-year $42 billion NASA  
authorization bill that, over the protests of Democrats, 
effectively kills a Gore-inspired plan to launch a satellite that 
would put 24-hour views of the Earth on television and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The $32 million originally set aside for the Triana project is  
less than 1 percent of the proposed National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration budget, but Democrats and the White House suggested 
the legislation might be subject to a presidential veto if the 
money is not restored when the Senate takes up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said it was part of the GOP campaign to trip up Gore's  
run for the presidency next year. ``I can think of no reason for 
the elimination of this particular program except partisan 
politics,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Triana spacecraft, named for the sailor who first spotted  
the New World on the journey with Christopher Columbus, was to have 
been launched by NASA in December next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House Science Committee, on a party-line 21-18 vote last  
Thursday, transferred all the money for the program to life and 
microgravity research. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Weldon, R-Fla., chief sponsor of the amendment,  
argued that views of the Earth are already available on the Weather 
Channel and NASA-TV and he considered it an ``insult'' that some 
600 people were being laid off at the Kennedy Space Center at the 
same time the agency was ``finding tens of millions of dollars to 
fulfill a vision for the vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because the new Star Wars movie is opening today doesn't  
mean we have to spend $30 million on a far-out boondoggle,'' said 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But NASA and the White House argued that the satellite would  
transmit an image twice as clear as new high-resolution television 
sets and would be unique in presenting a full-Earth view. 
</P>
<P>
	Triana was subject to rigorous peer review, the White House  
said, and would provide the scientific community with valuable data 
on the Earth's climate and solar flares. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking Democrat on the Science panel, Rep. Bart Gordon of  
Tennessee, said NASA had already spent $40 million on the $75 
million project, and the government would lose more by killing it 
than by completing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats did not propose an amendment to revive the program,  
saying they would press the Senate to do so when it takes up the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope they will change their mind,'' said Dave Steitz,  
spokesman for NASA. ``We would like them to base their decision on 
the science of the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also provides $7 billion for the U.S. portion of the  
international space station, $7.8 billion for space shuttle 
operations and $4.2 billion for earth science programs. 
</P>
<P>
	As in past years, Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., led a move against  
the space station, but with that program moving into the 
construction phase he got little support for amendments that would 
have capped funding, killed the program altogether or removed 
Russia as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The House defeated, 313-117, Roemer's amendment that would have  
ended Russian participation, relegating the Russians to 
subcontractors in future work on the 16-nation project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians repeatedly have been behind schedule in completing  
their work, driving up U.S. costs by as much as $5 billion. Rep. 
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the Science Committee, 
said the Russians were ``a miserable failure in being a partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others warned the amendment could undermine fragile  
U.S.-Russian relations and kill a project that is finally making 
headway. The first component of the station, the U.S.-funded, 
Russian-built Zarya module, was launched last November. NASA 
followed in December with its Unity module. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the House by voice vote accepted an amendment by Rep. John  
Sweeney, R-N.Y., requiring NASA to certify within 15 days that any 
proposed future agreements with China would not improve the missile 
or space launch capabilities of China.

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Honors Furniture Designers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone who ever looked for a way to relax  
after a hard day at work has reason to know about Charles and Ray 
Eames. 
</P>
<P>
	The husband and wife team designed the fiberglass stacked chair  
and the laid-back lounger-with-ottoman that makes even a crowded 
furniture ad look restful. The lounger still retails for as much as 
$2,500. Knock-offs in a variety of materials and varying levels of 
comfort can be had for less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
	A Library of Congress exhibit opens today for a three-month  
showing of more than a million items of the Eameses' work. The 
couple created a variety of things, from children's toys to the 
film ``Powers of 10,'' shown at the Air and Space Museum, that 
gives viewers an idea of the universe's vastness. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall theme: something can be useful and beautiful at the  
same time. 
</P>
<P>
	They worked together for more than 35 years until Charles' death  
in 1978. Ray Eames, a designer and sculptor, lived for another 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``They combined work and play,'' Lucia Eames, Charles' daughter  
from an earlier marriage, said at a news conference this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1940s, the Eames put together a wood-molding machine from  
bicycle parts and scraps of wood. When the house electricity did 
not furnish enough current to generate the heat required to run the 
machine, Charles Eames climbed a pole with a big piece of insulated 
cable to bypass the fuses, according to his grandson, Eames 
Demetrios. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy during World War II gave them a contract to mold leg  
splints for wounded servicemen. The glues used and techniques they 
learned helped later with furniture design. Ray, who had trained as 
an artist with German-American painter Hans Hofmann, also based an 
abstract sculpture on the splint design. 
</P>
<P>
	Eames made the film ``Glimpses of the U.S.A.'' for a 1959 Moscow  
exhibit, which later became known for the ``kitchen debate'' 
between then Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita 
Khruschev on the merits of the Soviet and American systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The film was shown on seven screens stretched about 250 feet  
around a dome, Demetrios estimated. It impressed Khruschev and he 
asked Eames to make one like it for the Soviet Union. Eames 
suggested diplomatically that Russians could do it better, and 
turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides their heavily padded lounger, the Eames designed many  
more metal, fiber glass and plastic chairs, rounded to the human 
form to make a lack of padding less noticeable to the sitter. That 
design feature has been supported by recent criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Work of Charles and Ray Eames'' leaves the Library of  
Congress Sept. 20 and will be seen at the Cooper-Newitt National 
Design Museum in New York, Oct. 12, 1999 to Jan. 9, 2000; St. Louis 
Art Museum, Feb. 19, 2000-May 14; and the Los Angeles County Art 
Museum, June 25, 2000-Sept. 11.

<HEADLINE> Roy, Forsberg Help Avs Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- For two years, Colorado languished in the shadow  
of the Detroit Red Wings, watching enviously as they supplanted the 
Avalanche as Stanley Cup champions and then won back-to-back 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no three-peat for the Red Wings, however, as the  
Avalanche finally vanquished their bitter rivals in six games in 
the Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	After spotting Detroit a 2-0 series lead, the Avalanche won four  
in a row. Now, they face the team with the best regular-season 
record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado will meet the Dallas Stars in Game 1 of the conference  
finals on Saturday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long couple of years for us,'' Avalanche  
defenseman Adam Foote said, ``but that's over for us against that 
team now. It's just very, very sweet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Forsberg scored two goals as the Avalanche beat Detroit  
5-2 Tuesday night to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Forsberg clearly justified his new $30 million  
contract with his all-around play in the last four games, it was 
goalie Patrick Roy who was the catalyst for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, whose 12th career playoff shutout led Colorado to a 3-0  
victory in Game 5 in Denver on Sunday, made 35 saves Tuesday night, 
many of them brilliant when the game was close. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an awesome feeling, coming back from 0-2,'' Forsberg  
said. ``Everybody's been stepping up, from the last guy to the 
first guy. And Patrick's been great in net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avs coach Bob Hartley agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick is Patrick,'' Hartley said. ``He was outstanding. I'm  
not surprised with the way he played. I grew up around Montreal and 
I saw him win with the Canadiens (Stanley Cup titles in 1986 and 
1993). I saw him win a Stanley Cup with the Avalanche (1996). He's 
rock solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Colorado lost the first two games of the series at home  
and appeared on the verge of being swept, Roy stopped 146 of 153 
shots as Colorado won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win four straight against Detroit -- I didn't think it was  
possible, to be honest,'' Roy said. ``But we had no choice. We put 
ourselves in a really bad position, losing those two games in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great comeback for us, being down 2-0. We took it one  
game at a time and played some great hockey. We won three games in 
Detroit, and it's not every team that can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blessed with talented skaters and puck-handlers, the Avalanche  
faltered early in the series with Detroit when they tried to get 
fancy, making too many passes or attempting the highlight-video 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played simple hockey,'' Roy said. ``That's how we won this  
series. It was a good series, and great for us to beat that team. 
They were the Stanley Cup champions, and we beat them. It feels 
good, but now we've got another series against another very tough 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley called the Stars ``a great hockey club. They are the  
regular-season champions and they're going to be a great challenge 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the bad blood that has defined Colorado-Detroit meetings  
since 1996, the Red Wings were gracious in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lose four straight like we did, you can't say the other  
team was lucky,'' Detroit coach Scotty Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at it as we underachieved,'' Red Wings captain  
Steve Yzerman said. ``Or you can look at it as we got beat by a 
great team. I choose to look at it as Colorado played fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made great adjustments from the first two games to the  
last four. Their top players played very well at both ends of the 
rink. Joe Sakic was excellent on penalty killing, on faceoffs, and 
he did all the little things well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got production from all four lines, their defense is good  
and their goaltender was very solid. They did all the things 
through the last four games that are necessary, not just to beat 
good teams, but to win the Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While only 2-4 at home during the postseason this year, the Avs  
can take comfort in the fact they're 6-0 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Stars' 51-19-12 regular-season record, Colorado  
compiled a 2-1-1 record against them. Dallas defeated St. Louis in 
six games to advance to the next round.

<HEADLINE> Fox Adds Eight New Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox is adding to its fall schedule a condensed  
version of ``Ally McBeal,'' a ``Party of Five'' spinoff with 
Jennifer Love Hewitt and a drama about a virtual reality game gone 
awry from the creator of ``The X-Files.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network's new entertainment chief, Doug Herzog, also said  
Thursday he was following through on a promise to cut back on Fox's 
rollicking reality shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, struggling UPN cemented its effort to appeal to young  
men by sinking its ``Love Boat'' remake and adding a two-hour 
weekly World Wrestling Federation show to its fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN and Fox were the last of the seven broadcast networks to  
unveil their fall schedules to advertisers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is the fourth-rated network, but near the top among young  
people. It returns three dramas to its schedule -- ``Party of 
Five,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' -- but there's 
a strong possibility this is the final season for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for the next generation of programming, Fox included  
five dramas among the eight news shows that will join its fall 
lineup. One is ``Time of Your Life,'' which moves Hewitt's 
character to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Carter, creator of ``The X-Files,'' is also behind the  
dark action series, ``Harsh Realm.'' Fox also returns ``Cops'' and 
``America's Most Wanted'' on Saturday nights and premieres a gritty 
drama about a 19-year-old policeman, ``Ryan Caulfield,'' at a time 
when there's a concern about media depiction of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sensitive issue and we'll be keeping our eye on it, no  
question about it,'' Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesdays, Fox will run a half-hour ``Ally McBeal'' edition  
fashioned from outtakes and material from the show's first two 
seasons. It's an intriguing new programming concept that appeals to 
network executives' search for cheaper shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, you'll probably see more of this thing at the  
networks going forward,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herzog promised this winter to cut back on Fox's reality shows.  
He left ``Guiness Book of World Records'' and ``World's Funniest'' 
off the schedule. Most of the reality shows air as specials, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox canceled ``Millennium'' and left the animated comedy, ``The  
PJs,'' off the schedule, although it will return as a sub series. 
``Melrose Place'' has retired. ``Party of Five'' is moving to 
Tuesdays, and the cartoons ``King of the Hill'' and ``Futurama'' 
will be shifted to Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-rated UPN has taken note of professional wrestling's hold on  
the cable TV audience and asked the World Wrestling Federation to 
produce a broadcast version. ``WWF Smackdown!'' will air at 8 p.m. 
Thursdays and will be tamer than the cable shows, UPN president 
Dean Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will probably be toned down a bit in terms of language and  
the upraised finger -- you'll see a lot less of it,'' Valentine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN will spin off its most popular sitcom, ``Moesha,'' with the  
comedy, ``Mo'Nique,'' and shift its comedies that appeal to a black 
audience to Mondays. Its five new series also include ``The Grown 
Ups,'' starring former ``Family Matters'' actor Jaleel White. 
</P>
<P>
	Its other new series are ``Shasta McNasty,'' a modern-day  
version of the Monkees, and the spy drama, ``Secret Agent Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Love Boat,'' the network is canceling  
``Clueless,'' ``The Sentinel'' and ``Between Brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's other new programs include:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Get Real,'' a family drama about a couple and their three  
high school-aged children. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Manchester Prep,'' a drama about a prep school student from  
New York City who moves in with his father's new family, setting up 
a rivalry with his stepsister. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Action,'' a comedy starring Jay Mohr and Illeana Douglas that  
is a satirical look at Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Malcolm in the Middle,'' a family comedy about a  
nine-year-old genius.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Lab Theft Suspected in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intelligence experts were worried three years  
ago about the possible theft of secrets about America's nuclear 
arsenal and believed the Los Alamos weapons lab was the most likely 
source, an Energy Department intelligence officer told a Senate 
panel Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, investigators found the missing ``legacy''  
codes, which contain years of cumulative data about the nation's 
nuclear warheads, in the unsecure computer of a Los Alamos, N.M., 
scientist suspected of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was done, in short, was nothing,'' Notra Trulock, acting  
deputy director of the Energy Department's Office of Intelligence, 
said of the concerns expressed by intelligence experts in early 
1996 about potential loss of the top-secret computer codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have applauded Trulock for raising alarms as early as  
1995 about the possible theft of nuclear secrets from weapons labs, 
including information in the 1980s about a sophisticated warhead 
known as the W-88. That theft has been the subject of a four-year 
espionage investigation that prompted the firing of the Los Alamos 
scientist in March. The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged 
with a crime and has denied giving secrets to China or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, appearing elsewhere on Capitol  
Hill, said the file transfers at Los Alamos, discovered in March, 
were ``an incredible breach of security'' but that with new 
computer safeguards ``that cannot happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now impossible to download material from the classified  
computers,'' Richardson assured the House Science Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock, appearing before the Senate Energy and Natural  
Resources Committee, described repeated attempts in early 1997 to 
bring his concerns about espionage and lax security at weapons labs 
to then-Energy Secretary Federico Pena. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was repeatedly thwarted by senior DOE officials,  
including Pena's deputy, Elizabeth Moler, and that Pena knew 
nothing of the espionage concerns for about six months. Trulock in 
the past also has accused Moler of muzzling him when he tried to 
testify before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Moler has denied she tried to block Trulock. The allegations  
have been investigated by the DOE's inspector general, but the 
report has not yet been released. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal investigation into the handling of the Los Alamos  
espionage case is near completion and is expected to result in 
disciplinary action against some DOE and laboratory officials and 
possibly former officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why heads are not rolling is beyond me,'' declared Sen. Conrad  
Burns, R-Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock, who was director of the Office of Intelligence from  
1994 into early 1998, said his concerns about espionage at the labs 
were viewed in 1997 with skepticism and ``outright denial'' among 
senior DOE officials. 
</P>
<P>
	They were dismissed as views of ``Cold War warriors,'' said  
Trulock. He said the investigation at Los Alamos into apparent loss 
of secrets about the W-88 warhead was viewed as ``merely a 
historical curiosity and of little relevance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Curran, the FBI official appointed a year ago to consolidate  
and lead counterintelligence efforts at the department, 
acknowledged that in the past there had been ``no accountability'' 
and inadequate support from top officials of the department on 
intelligence and security matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, the committee chairman, derided  
the ``cavalier attitude about security'' described by Trulock and 
suggested that senior administration officials should not be let 
off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson acknowledged that ``security was given second  
fiddle'' at the department, but he declined to criticize his 
predecessors. ``I'm not going to get into the blame game,'' he told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a 700-page report by a special House committee  
examining U.S. technology losses to China will conclude that China 
has been able to make substantial gains in modernizing its nuclear 
weapons program because of U.S. secrets obtained in a pervasive 
campaign of espionage and misuse of legally obtained technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said after being  
briefed behind closed doors on the House report that ``you almost 
have to measure in megatons'' the security damage from Chinese 
espionage. He provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, a year in the making, is to be released early next  
week, after months of wrangling between lawmakers and the Clinton 
administration over how much of it should be kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	According to officials familiar with it, the report concludes  
that there is little question that China has obtained critical 
information about an array of U.S. warheads through theft from U.S. 
nuclear weapons labs as well as meticulous scanning of publicly 
available information. 
</P>
<P>
	Many details of the report have been leaked in recent weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Amid a string of embarrassing revelations in the news media  
about suspected Chinese espionage and lax security at the labs, 
Richardson has revamped the department security structure, imposed 
tighter controls on computers at the labs and directed other new 
security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno announced on Thursday that a veteran  
prosecutor, Randy Bellows, would head a Justice Department 
investigation into whether Justice or the FBI made any mistakes in 
the Wen Ho Lee investigation dating to 1982, when his name first 
surfaced.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Ask for Cemetery Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With World War II servicemen dying at the rate  
of 1,000 a day, the nation's veterans groups are delivering a 
pre-Memorial Day plea for new and expanded national cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes five to seven years to plan and build national  
cemeteries, and work must begin now before available space is used 
up, the organizations are telling a House Veterans Affairs 
subcommittee today. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Ken  
McKinnon, said most of the burial grounds the agency runs would 
last until 2030 -- even if there is no expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington National Cemetery, maintained by the Army, would run  
out of space by 2025 without an expansion. However, Army officials 
are looking at 14 parcels of land that could enlarge the burial 
ground and keep it operating into the 22nd century. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinnon said the Veterans Administration will ``continue to  
evaluate the need to establish new national cemeteries based on 
veteran demographics, and we are currently building four new 
ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman of the House Veterans  
Affairs investigations subcommittee, said, ``We're losing more than 
a thousand World War II veterans a day, more than 377,000 a year. 
Funding is millions of dollars short to meet their needs. We're 
going to run out of space early in the 21st century unless 
something is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and  
Budget, said federal agencies operate on five-year budgeting and 
strategic planning cycles. But she added, ``This is not to say that 
agencies wouldn't be expected to be thinking ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates that annual veterans' deaths will  
increase from 550,000 in 1998 to a peak of 620,000 in 2008. About 
10 percent of all veterans are buried in national cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main concern is beyond the year 2000,'' said John  
Vitikacs, the national cemeteries expert for the American Legion. 
``The VA cannot gear up fast enough. Even if they're given a 
go-ahead tomorrow to create the next five national cemeteries, it 
will be 2007 before any of them are going to be open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four new national cemeteries will open this year in Albany,  
N.Y.; Chicago; Dallas; and Cleveland. Major construction projects 
are planned at a number of existing sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Legion said areas with the greatest need for new  
national cemeteries include Oklahoma City; Atlanta; Sacramento, 
Calif.; Miami; St. Louis; Pittsburgh; and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony prepared for the hearing, Sidney Daniels, a  
Veterans of Foreign Wars official, said expansion of the cemetery 
system ``over the next 10 years will be crucial to meeting the 
burial demands that will be placed on this system as the veteran 
population ages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except for the national scope of the country's most hallowed  
burial ground, Arlington National Cemetery, other cemeteries are 
designed to handle burials within a 75-mile radius. The Veterans 
Administration also provides states with 100 percent funding for 
construction and initial equipment costs of new state veterans' 
cemeteries. However, many states are reluctant to commit to the 
long-term costs associated with maintaining the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of Arlington, those eligible for burial in national  
cemeteries include active duty personnel and veterans who completed 
their service requirements. Spouses and minor children also are 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arlington, regulations are more restrictive. Besides those on  
active duty, veterans must be on a retired list and eligible to 
receive retirement pay.

<HEADLINE> How Young Murder Witness Was Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Screaming ``Mommy, Mommy,'' an  
8-year-old boy was fatally shot after a gunman burst into his house 
and chased him up the stairs to prevent him from testifying in a 
murder trial, a witness said. 
</P>
<P>
	The final moments of Leroy ``B.J.'' Brown Jr.'s life were  
detailed in court papers that were released Thursday in which 
Josephine Lee admitted acting as a lookout for the boy's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee told police the gunman chased the boy and his mother up the  
stairs, firing at them as they ran for their lives. B.J. was still 
yelling for his mother when the gunman shot him in the back of the 
head, Lee told police. The mother, Karen Clarke, 29, was also 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 8 slayings horrified the community and prompted sharp  
criticism of Connecticut's witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy had been scheduled to testify against Russell Peeler in  
the 1998 slaying of Ms. Clarke's fiance. The boy had witnessed an 
earlier drive-by shooting in which Peeler allegedly attempted to 
kill the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee told police that Peeler's brother, Adrian Peeler, was the  
killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee lived across from B.J. and his mother, and had been asked to  
page Russell Peeler when Clarke returned home, according to the 
affidavit. She said he also asked her to serve as lookout. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee paged Russell Peeler when Clarke arrived home and his  
brother arrived within minutes. Lee said she rang Clarke's doorbell 
and Adrian Peeler pushed his way in when she answered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard the shot and the little boy was reaching out for his  
mother,'' Lee said. ``He was yelling, `Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, 
Mommy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Peeler chased Clarke into a bedroom. Lee heard a shot,  
and then saw Adrian Peeler came out of the bedroom, where B.J. was 
still screaming for his mother. He then shot B.J. in the head, Lee 
told police. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors arrested the Peelers last month. Lee pleaded guilty  
to conspiracy to commit murder and prosecutors have agreed to ask 
for a maximum sentence of seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers pleaded innocent Thursday to murder and  
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler's lawyer, John T. Walkley, called Lee's account  
``preposterous'' and said she had changed her story several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each statement seems to be a little more incredible than the  
next,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report Says US Secrets Helped China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China has been able to make substantial gains  
in modernizing its nuclear weapons program because of U.S. secrets 
obtained in a pervasive campaign of espionage and misuse of legally 
obtained technology, a long-awaited congressional report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, according to officials familiar with it, concludes  
that there is little question that China has obtained critical 
information about an array of U.S. warheads through theft from U.S. 
nuclear weapons labs as well as meticulous scanning of publicly 
available information. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700-page report by a special House committee was ready to be  
released, possibly as early as today, after months of negotiations 
with the Clinton administration over how much of it should remain 
classified. 
</P>
<P>
	Many details of the report, which has been a year in the making,  
have been leaked in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, its formal findings are certain to add to the growing  
turmoil over charges of lax security at the government's 
prestigious nuclear weapons research labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from a string of embarrassing revelations in the  
news media, President Clinton and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
have said steps were being taken to improve security at the labs. 
And congressional Republicans said they would make sure 
improvements took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Security at weapons labs has been the subject of intense  
scrutiny since early March when a scientist at the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory in New Mexico was fired after being suspected 
since 1996 of having provided China with warhead secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged with a crime and  
through his lawyer has denied providing nuclear secrets to China or 
anyone else. Chinese officials also have denied that the country 
stole secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The special House committee, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox,  
R-Calif., heard extensive testimony concerning the investigation 
surrounding Lee. But the declassified version of the panel's report 
provides little additional information about the Los Alamos 
investigation, said officials familiar with the document. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the report sharply criticizes security and  
counterintelligence activities at three weapons research labs -- Los 
Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico, and Lawrence Livermore in 
California -- saying it has led to the loss of secrets to China 
under both Republican and Democratic administrations, spanning more 
than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	And the report maintains the security problems persist today and  
adequate counterintelligence measures are unlikely to be in place 
before 2000, according to officials who summarized the findings. 
They spoke only on condition of not being further identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Energy Department and White House declined comment late  
Wednesday on the report in advance of its formal release. 
</P>
<P>
	But senior administration officials have raised concerns  
privately -- as negotiations dragged on over how much of the report 
to make public -- that the document does not adequately take into 
account security and counterintelligence improvements made in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	And, they have complained, the bipartisan committee's findings --  
approved unanimously last December -- is based largely on 
conjecture, taking too pessimistic of a view on the extent to which 
China may have actually benefited from its espionage, citing a 
recent CIA finding that expressed less certain conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	The report assumes a ``worst case'' scenario while there remain  
sharp disagreements within the U.S. intelligence community on how 
much China actually benefited, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, officials familiar with the massive report said  
the document describes a pervasive and determined campaign by China 
to use both America's nuclear secrets and unclassified 
technological information to advance its weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee of five Republicans and four Democrats, found  
that:	   --There is clear evidence that China obtained highly secret 
information about a sophisticated nuclear warhead, the W-88, in the 
1980s as a result of secrets stolen from Los Alamos. Other 
information, some available from public sources, was obtained on a 
half-dozen other weapons systems 
</P>
<P>
	--Chinese espionage encompasses a wide array of activities from  
targeting scientists at the weapons labs to ferreting out both 
classified and unclassified information from public sources. 
</P>
<P>
	--America's national security has been compromised by China's  
legal acquisitions of satellite and missile technology, 
supercomputers, jet engines, telecommunications equipment and 
sophisticated machine tools because they have been used in part for 
military purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	--While most of the espionage cases cited by the report date back  
to 1980s, one case involving the suspected theft of secrets about 
the neutron bomb is believed to have occurred as recently as 1995 
during Clinton administration. The FBI never had enough evidence to 
prosecute that case.

	BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- On his way out of town after a concert,  
John Mellencamp made a donation to a fund-raiser for a school music 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, parents and students at Bench Elementary have been  
putting together items for a silent auction. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, just hours before Mellencamp was to perform in  
Billings, Missy Jones and her daughter, Karli, dashed off a letter

get the letter to one of Mellencamp's guitar players following 
warm-ups at MetraPark Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones got a call Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `This is John. ... John Mellencamp,''' Jones said.  
``At that point I turned into a 16-year-old saying, `Oh, my God! 
Oh, my God!'''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: School Attack Is Troubling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- With blood spilled today at yet another  
American high school, President Clinton urged Congress to tighten 
gun controls and asked all Americans to ``come together in the face 
of these events to protect our children from violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before leaving Washington for this suburban Denver  
enclave, where 12 students and a teacher were killed exactly one 
month ago, the president said, ``The news this morning of another 
school shooting ... in suburban Atlanta is deeply troubling to me 
as it is to all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident again should underscore how profoundly important  
it is that all Americans come together in the face of these events 
to protect our children from violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senate debating gun control legislation 20 blocks away  
from the sun-dappled Rose Garden, Clinton referred to the debate 
and said American must ``press ahead again with the national 
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to do this,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A student opened fire today at Heritage High School in Conyers,  
Ga., injuring six students. The shooter was taken into custody and 
the victims were reported in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was the final day of classes for seniors at Heritage.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who traveled a year ago to Oregon and another high  
school ravaged by gunfire, went with his wife, Hillary, to meet 
with victims' relatives at Littleton's Light of the World Catholic 
Church. The church is about three miles from Columbine and the 
place where counselors worked with survivors after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	After those private meetings, which press secretary Joe Lockhart  
called ``a more personal session rather than a sort of policy 
session,'' the Clintons travel to Dakota Ridge High School to 
address Columbine students, rescuers and community leaders, before 
returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, Lockhart said, wants to ``articulate how the  
country shares the grief of the Littleton students and the 
Littleton community, and highlight the remarkable resilience of 
these students and of this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Lapp said his 16-year-old son, Joshua, who escaped from  
the Columbine library, will attend the meeting. But he is not sure 
if the visit will help Joshua recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that's going to help kids like my son is a lot  
of counseling,'' Randy Lapp said. ``That's the only way he can deal 
with this.' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Mauser, whose son Daniel was killed, said he was looking  
forward to meeting with Clinton. Mauser has criticized the National 
Rifle Association, and formed a gun-control group called Sane 
Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we'll talk about my son,'' Mauser said. He also  
plans to give the president some written questions, which he 
declined to specify. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Saltzman, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Public  
Schools District, said the president's visit ``is a wonderful 
opportunity for students to see a visible sign of the caring there 
is throughout the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping it will help the healing process,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Panel Sets Social Security Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee is planning summer hearings on ways to strengthen Social 
Security even though other Republican leaders have said final 
congressional action is unlikely this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are areas where there can be an ultimate  
reconciliation,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said late Wednesday 
after a meeting with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said he and Clinton did not ``attempt to try to negotiate  
any sort of compromise'' between competing rescue plans they have 
put forth, but rather talked about how they could help other 
lawmakers overcome reluctance to negotiate changes in the popular 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we have developed a working relationship that if  
we both worked our sides we would have an opportunity'' for 
compromise, Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, said several weeks  
ago he does not expect any significant changes in Social Security 
to be enacted this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said that at the  
meeting with Archer the president brought up ``the need to have 
processes like hearings and consultations that allowed Democrats 
and Republicans to participate, express views and suggestions and 
give an opportunity for bipartisan consensus to form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear, however, whether Archer's offer to hold hearings  
in June, after Congress returns from its traditional Memorial Day 
break, will provide such a forum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means chairman said he will limit discussion to  
proposals that meet a test of providing 75 years of financial 
health for Social Security. Clinton's plan, by the administration's 
own estimate, would assure only about 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is in some way added to so that it will meet that  
standard, it will be subject to the hearing and I think the 
president understands that,'' Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton's and Archer's plans would invest some of Social  
Security's cash reserves in the stock market in an effort to 
increase their worth enough to help close a financing shortfall 
expected after baby boomers retire and begin to collect benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton would have the government handle the  
investments while Archer would set up a new system of accounts that 
individual Americans would control.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan's Brother Sought by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Family members say a brother of presidential  
candidate Pat Buchanan plans to surrender to police on charges he 
used a gun to threaten people at the home of a relative of a top 
State Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Buchanan, 61, has a history of mental illness and checked  
into a hospital earlier this week for treatment, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my brother very much,'' Pat Buchanan said today in a  
telephone interview from Monroe, La. ``He has had long years of 
mental difficulties. It is a sad and tragic matter and all I can 
say is that I will stand by my brother and I love him. It is a sad 
tragedy for his lovely wife and five children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible setback for Hank and his family,'' said Bay  
Buchanan, his sister and a former U.S. treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from an episode last weekend at the home of  
Cody Shearer, brother-in-law of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer told police an intruder broke into his garage Sunday,  
slashed the tires of his cars and then brandished a handgun at two 
house guests who confronted him in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the guests obtained the license plate of the car the  
intruder fled in, Shearer's lawyers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer said he had received death threats from anonymous  
callers after a television show aired unsubstantiated allegations 
last week that Shearer may have been involved in threatening 
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey in January 1998. Shearer 
denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Shearer is concerned about the breakdown in journalistic  
standards that has led to his personal safety being jeopardized,'' 
his lawyers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Police traced the car and on Wednesday contacted Hank Buchanan's  
lawyer to arrange for a surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hank, through me, is fully cooperating with the authorities  
and hopes to resolve this to everyone's satisfaction,'' said Tom 
Buchanan, a lawyer who is representing his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan, a former Nixon White House aide and television  
commentator who is making his third bid for the GOP presidential 
nomination, has visited his brother since he checked into the 
hospital, the family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Buchanan ran his own accounting firm but has had a history  
of manic depression, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been years. He has had lots of problems. It is a tragic  
situation,'' Bay Buchanan said in an interview from her brother's 
campaign headquarters. ``He had been doing very well and this is a 
terrible setback.''

<HEADLINE> Teammate: Glover Staying at Ga. Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Dion Glover has decided to remain at Georgia  
Tech, a teammate said, and an announcement probably will be made 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yellow Jackets guard met Thursday with his coach, Bobby  
Cremins, to discuss his options. Neither commented on whether he 
would stay at Tech instead of entering the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tony Akins, a sophomore guard and Glover's roommate, said  
the decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to stay,'' Akins said. ``I feel better now. We have  
a better team. We're getting our leader back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glover was the third-leading freshman scorer in the nation in  
1997-98, averaging 18.4 points. He did not play last season after 
severely injuring his knee in the opening practice. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Mike Finn said an announcement on Glover's  
future was expected Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dion has not had a chance to talk to his parents, and he wants  
to do that first,'' Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover announced last week he was making himself eligible for  
the draft. But he left open the possibility of returning to Tech 
for what would be his redshirt sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, the 6-foot-5 guard changed his mind after  
considering the physical demands that would be required prior to 
the June 30 draft. He was cleared to run only two weeks ago after 
tearing the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in 
his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover planned to attend a pre-draft camp in Chicago -- paying  
his own way -- and also work out individually for NBA teams. He did 
not sign with an agent so he could keep his college eligibility 
intact if he decided to pull out before the draft.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Gun-Show Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acting only hours after another school  
shooting, the Senate today approved tighter restrictions on 
firearms transactions at gun shows and pawn shops. Democrats said 
the measure still enables people to buy guns without undergoing 
background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	By 79-29 vote, the Senate passed a Republican amendment to a  
juvenile crime bill that would require background checks on all 
firearms dealings at pawn shops and gun shows, reversing a proposal 
it passed a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was adopted after a shooting at a high school in  
Conyers, Ga., about 35 miles east of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	After approving the Republican proposal, the Senate turned to a  
vote on a Democratic amendment that would allow three days to 
complete background checks. The provision backed by the Republican 
majority set a 24-hour time limit, after which the sale could go 
through even if the background check were not completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Georgia school shooting, Sen. Charles Schumer,  
D-N.Y., asked, ``How much longer are we going to embrace the gun 
lobby?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the images of the Littleton, Colo., school shooting last  
month that generated pressure on the Senate to tighten laws 
governing gun sales, particularly at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Six students were injured in the Georgia shooting this morning  
and all were in stable condition, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats renewed their charge that Republicans are resisting  
effective restrictions on gun sales at the behest of the National 
Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they were protecting law-abiding gun owners and  
insisted that law enforcement do more to enforce existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's law enforcement that stops the criminal,'' not more gun  
control laws, said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, an NRA board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans were eager to get the gun control issue  
behind them, at the same time Democrats were declaring victory over 
the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gun lobby was wounded this week,'' Senate Democratic  
leader Tom Daschle told reporters Wednesday. He said last month's 
high school shootings in Littleton, Colo., had produced ``a 
dramatic and pivotal moment'' in the gun control debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the GOP's concessions and reversals on guns in the past  
week, he said, ``There may not be much difference between Democrats 
and Republicans anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans fiercely disagreed, saying their reversal on  
requiring background checks at gun shows and voting to require 
trigger locks with handgun sales weren't big concessions at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, the National Rifle Association board  
member who had appeared to be driving the debate away from gun 
control last week until a half-dozen of his GOP colleagues 
objected, insisted Wednesday that pro-gun interests had not been 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't lost,'' he said with a smile, wagging his forefinger  
in the air. ``It's not over yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Republicans pushed the most controversial gun-related  
measures to the end of the debate, in its ninth day today. A draft 
amendment circulated by the GOP calls for background checks on all 
purchasers at gun shows, including transactions exempted in the 
proposal that Republicans muscled through the Senate last week. In 
addition, the proposal would require a mandatory background check 
for anyone seeking to reclaim their own weapon at a pawnshop. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment negates a measure by Craig that passed last week  
by one vote, but which then drew objections from rank-and-file GOP 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to take up the amendment today.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the concessions, administration officials prepared a  
long list of additional issues that the Republicans didn't address, 
saying the GOP hadn't gone far enough to stop some criminals from 
obtaining weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't get it,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said of  
Republicans. ``The public gets it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While making the latest in a series of retreats, Republicans  
indicated they were drawing the line. GOP aides said the latest 
amendment had been drafted in a meeting with top Senate Republicans 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said party  
leaders hoped that passage of their proposal would persuade enough 
wavering Republicans to help kill a stronger set of provisions 
advanced by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Democratic admendment would remove some of the  
government record keeping and other red tape proposed in connection 
with gun show purchases. But it also would give the government 
three days to conduct a background check -- rather than 24 hours 
proposed by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also want to wait 90 days before expunging background  
check records in cases where the purchases are approved. The GOP 
wants immediate destruction of all records. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun amendments were intended to toughen a sweeping, $5  
billion juvenile crime bill by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that would 
make it harder for kids to get guns and inflict more painful 
punishments on those who use them. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., brought the gun  
control issue to the floor last week to allow lawmakers to stage a 
debate responding to the April 20 massacre in Colorado that left 14 
students and a teacher dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott earlier had threatened to pull the bill if senators didn't  
pare down the list of amendments enough to hold a final vote by 
Tuesday night. But relishing the public relations nightmare that 
the bill had imposed on Republicans, Democrats called Lott's bluff 
and were slow to cut their amendment list. Lott backed down, and by 
this morning, it was still unclear when the Senate would hold its 
final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceaseless political combat in the aftermath of Littleton has  
taken its toll on the patience of GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Democrats are) going to find out that nothing's changed''  
with regard to the gun lobby's influence, Lott fumed outside the 
Senate chamber. ``They will find out that they have hurt their 
relationship with me because I have acted in good faith and they 
have not. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're gonna pay,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the Senate's rebuke of several NRA demands during  
debate, Lott replied: ``The NRA has not lost its influence.''

wants immediate destruction of all records. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun amendments were intended to toughen a sweeping, $5  
billion juvenile crime bill by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that would 
make it harder for kids to get guns and inflict more painful 
punishments on those who use them. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., brought the gun  
control issue to the floor last week to allow lawmakers to stage a 
debate responding to the April 20 massacre in Colorado that left 14 
students and a teacher dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott earlier had threatened to pull the bill if senators didn't  
pare down the list of amendments enough to hold a final vote by 
Tuesday night. But relishing the public relations nightmare that 
the bill had imposed on Republicans, Democrats called Lott's bluff 
and were slow to cut their amendment list. Lott backed down, and by 
this morning, it was still unclear when the Senate would hold its 
final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceaseless political combat in the aftermath of Littleton has  
taken its toll on the patience of GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Democrats are) going to find out that nothing's changed''  
with regard to the gun lobby's influence, Lott fumed outside the 
Senate chamber. ``They will find out that they have hurt their 
relationship with me because I have acted in good faith and they 
have not. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're gonna pay,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the Senate's rebuke of several NRA demands during  
debate, Lott replied: ``The NRA has not lost its influence.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Gun-Show Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Vice President Al Gore casting a  
tie-breaking vote, the Senate today approved a Democratic proposal 
to slap fresh restrictions on gun transactions at gun shows and 
pawn shops. Democrats immediately declared victory over the 
powerful gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you just saw is the NRA losing its grip on the United  
States Senate, at long last,'' declared Senate Democratic leader 
Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a turning point for our country,'' Gore said after the  
vote. ``Finally, this majority is turning the corner and helping to 
protect the children and families of this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called to congratulate Gore for his vote and  
praised the Senate for ``the commonsense approach'' of the 
provision, said spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate vote came a few hours after a school shooting in  
Conyers, Ga., and as Clinton was flying to Colorado to talk with 
survivors of a high school shooting spree a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association refused to concede defeat,  
accusing the White House of backing ``a charade of lawmaking 
without law enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``NRA will continue to hold a mirror up to this dishonest  
process until the American people demand more meaningful and 
substantive action from government,'' the group said in a 
statement. ``Everyone knows this won't stop the crisis in our 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue now goes to the House, where Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and the minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., were 
working out procedures for consideration of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, which would require mandatory background checks  
for all transactions at gun shows, was tied, 50-50. Gore then cast 
his vote. It was the fourth time in his more than six years as vice 
president that Gore has cast a tie-breaking vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, sponsored by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., also  
would require a mandatory background check for anyone seeking to 
claim his or her own weapon at a pawn shop. In addition, it wiped 
out a Republican proposal that had passed moments earlier that 
Democrats said would open fresh loopholes in the nation's gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg's amendment was defeated in a slightly different form  
last week. He recast it in advance of today's vote, and the changes 
won the support of Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga. The vote came a few 
hours after the outbreak of gunfire at an Atlanta-area high school 
in which six students were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier Republican provision was cleared by 79-21. It would  
have limited instant checks to 24 hours, instead of the current 
three days, one of several changes that Democrats said marked a 
retreat in the GOP's gun control position. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came on legislation to crack down on juvenile  
crime. It was not clear when the bill would come to a final vote, 
or whether it could pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Georgia school shooting, Sen. Charles Schumer,  
D-N.Y., asked, ``How much longer are we going to embrace the gun 
lobby?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the images of the Littleton school shooting last month  
that generated pressure on the Senate to tighten laws governing gun 
sales, particularly at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Six students were injured in the Georgia shooting this morning  
and all were in stable condition, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats renewed their charge that Republicans are resisting  
effective restrictions on gun sales at the behest of the National 
Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they were protecting law-abiding gun owners and  
insisted that law enforcement do more to enforce existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's law enforcement that stops the criminal,'' not more gun  
control laws, said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, an NRA board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans were eager to get the gun control issue  
behind them, at the same time Democrats were declaring victory over 
the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Democratic amendment would remove some of the  
government record keeping and other red tape proposed in connection 
with gun show purchases. But it also would give the government 
three days to conduct a background check -- rather than 24 hours 
proposed by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also want to wait 90 days before expunging background  
check records in cases where the purchases are approved. The GOP 
wants immediate destruction of all records. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun amendments were intended to toughen a sweeping, $5  
billion juvenile crime bill by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that would 
make it harder for kids to get guns and inflict more painful 
punishments on those who use them.

<HEADLINE> New INS Rule To Help Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a quarter-million immigrants who  
fled civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala during the 1980s will 
find it easier to become legal U.S. residents under a new rule 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, which also will affect about 10,000 Eastern Europeans,  
would allow the illegal immigrants to apply for relief from 
deportation through a simplified procedure overseen by the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Such cases would be decided by INS asylum officers, rather than  
immigration judges, and the immigrants would be exempt from having 
to prove they would suffer ``extreme hardships'' if they were to be 
sent back to their homelands -- a key test of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consistent with the commitment President Clinton made when he  
visited Central America in March, the new program is the 
culmination of the administration's efforts to create as accessible 
and straightforward a process as the law permits,'' INS 
Commissioner Doris Meissner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule is expected to affect 290,000 Central Americans,  
including 240,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans. It would go into 
effect June 21 after a public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Congress passed a law that granted amnesty to some  
Nicaraguans and Cubans in the United States and allowed them to 
apply for status as legal permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was intended to help the thousands of Central Americans  
who illegally entered the United States after fleeing civil wars in 
their homelands during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, Guatemalans and Salvadorans who qualify would be  
considered for a suspension of deportation under the less stringent 
rules that existed before 1996 immigration legislation, but on a 
case-by-case basis requiring them to prove ``extreme hardship'' if 
they were returned to their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary  
subcommittee on immigration and claims, criticized the rule change, 
saying it was ``not what Congress intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Amnesty rewards those who break the law and encourages more  
illegal immigration. It is a slap in the face to all those who 
patiently waited their turn to come to the U.S.,'' Smith said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> ESPN Anchor Takes Long, Hard Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Through it all, Kenny Mayne didn't care much about landing his  
dream job at ESPN. The money and fame were great, but he had more 
important things on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayne and his wife, Laura, had recently lost the second of their  
twin sons as a result of difficulties during her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys, Creighton, died a day after he was born on May  
28, 1996, while Connor fought in the hospital for nearly six months 
before dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Laura had a miscarriage a year later. And another last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wakes you up to what is real in life,'' said Mayne, who was  
promoted to the 11 p.m. ``SportsCenter'' late in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife is pregnant again, and this time the couple has made it  
past the point when all of their previous problems occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're totally grateful and optimistic,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Mayne keeps a photo of Connor on his desk during  
each show. He doesn't hesitate when asked about the greatest moment 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't even involve me,'' he said. ``Connor was actually  
doing well at a point and they called me when I was at ESPN and 
told me that Laura was giving him a stroller ride. I just started 
crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His personal tragedies were far more difficult to handle that  
his struggle to get to Bristol, Conn., of course. Nonetheless, he 
endured many disappointments before finally getting a job on ESPN's 
biggest showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayne was a senior quarterback at UNLV in 1981 when Randall  
Cunningham was a freshman. After college, Mayne had an unsuccessful 
tryout with the Seattle Seahawks and then went to work at an 
independent Seattle TV station as the person who ``called to see if 
it was a two or three-alarm fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayne paid his dues and eventually became a news-sports  
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he began his relentless plan to get a job at ESPN. He  
pestered executives for two years, finally got an interview -- but 
didn't get hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``We brought Kenny in for an audition and he did pretty well,  
but I was higher on him than most people here,'' said Al Jaffe, 
vice president of talent. ``He has a different outlook and 
perspective and although he's had real tough times personally, he's 
thrived and flourished here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being ignored by ESPN, he quit the Seattle TV station and  
picked up a variety of jobs -- including assembling garbage cans, 
telemarketing and a sales position with MCI -- until he finally was 
hired for ESPN2 in 1994 after doing some free-lance work for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Then about three years later, Keith Olbermann left ESPN and  
Mayne was offered the 11 p.m. slot with Dan Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after all of his personal setbacks, Mayne knows that  
mispronouncing a name or stumbling over a line isn't the worst 
thing that could happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that people think it's a big deal that I do the 11  
o'clock show, but I'm pretty grounded,'' Mayne said. ``The biggest 
thing for me is getting home so I can hang out with Laura and the 
baby.'' 
</P>

	OUT-FOXED: Go figure.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what Fox executives are saying after the NHL told them  
they won't get the prime Colorado-Dallas playoff matchup because of 
a scheduling conflict with figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox spent $30 million this season, but got the second pick of  
the NHL playoff games this weekend due to the ``Champions on Ice'' 
show at Dallas' Reunion Arena on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of getting the prime Western Conference matchup of  
Colorado-Dallas, the network was left with the Toronto-Buffalo game 
Sunday afternoon. Disney's ESPN, which along with ABC will get the 
NHL package beginning next season, lucks out and gets the 
Avalanche-Stars matchup on Saturday night.

	TURNING THE PAGE: Paul Page is no longer the voice of the Indy

to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the split between the CART series and the IRL happened,  
fans started taking sides and it really got ugly,'' said Page, who 
won't work the Indy 500 on May 30, after calling the race for the 
last 10 years for ABC. ``As a result, they walked away from both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR picked up many of the disgruntled fans when the leagues  
split in 1996 and has been booming ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the CART series and IRL want their own broadcasters and  
there are so few IRL races on ABC, Page moved to the CART series. 
Bob Jenkins takes over his play-by-play duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indy 500 had a 5.5 rating last year, the lowest mark on its

<HEADLINE> Calif. Bill Targets Oil Tankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A bill approved by the California  
Assembly would prohibit oil companies from using tankers to 
transport oil in California's coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the bill approved Thursday by a 43-26, would require  
companies to move oil by pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill by Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara,  
now moves to the Senate for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Coastal Commission has said that oil moved  
through pipelines is safer for the environment, but the commission 
has yet to mandate pipeline usage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major accidents occur when we transport by tanker,''  
Jackson said. ``This bill will help put an end to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The oil industry has not expressed an objection to such  
requirements, Jackson added. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said the state cannot make oil transportation  
completely safe and that such efforts would amount to futile 
micromanaging. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does a disservice to the oil industry, and the people who  
will pay for it are the consumers at the pumps,'' said Sam 
Aanestad, R-Grass Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's bill would apply only to oil transported through  
California's coastal waters, which extend three miles off the 
state's coast. The bill would not affect oil transportation in 
federal or international waters, said Janice Rocco, a spokeswoman 
for Jackson.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Missile Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation approved Thursday by the House and  
sent to the White House would commit the United States to an 
anti-missile national defense system. President Clinton was 
expected to sign the measure, which the Senate modified to meet 
administration objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed 345-71, states that it is the policy of  
the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, 
an effective system capable of defending U.S. territory against 
limited ballistic missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	It also states there will be continued negotiations with Russia  
on arms reductions. Russia has opposed construction of a U.S. 
missile defense system, saying it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said it will not decide until June 2000  
on firm plans for an anti-missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed similar legislation in 1995. He also opposed an  
earlier House version passed March, saying it did not make clear 
that the defense system would be limited and focused against 
threats from rogue states rather than existing nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate changed the bill to reflect those concerns and the  
House agreed to the revised version Thursday, despite some 
reluctance by supporters of the original House plan 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy with the legislation,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon,  
R-Pa., chief sponsor of the House version. The changes, he said 
``are simply cover for liberal Democrats who don't support missile 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weldon and Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House  
Armed Services Committee, said it should be clear that when the 
president signs the bill he is changing U.S. policy and committing 
the nation to a national defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of ballistic missile attack is real, and it is here  
today,'' Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, a leading Democratic  
defense expert, cited military testimony that it will be at least 
2005 before tests can determine whether a credible defense system 
can be build. ``We ought to be very sober about any of these 
exhortations ... from people who want to wish this into 
existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has budgeted $10.5 billion between 1999 and  
2005 to develop a limited national missile defense system. It 
became more positive toward eventual deployment of such a system 
after North Korea last year tested missiles that flew over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The system envisioned by both Congress and the White House is a  
scaled-back version of the space-based Strategic Defense 
Initiative, or ``Star Wars'' program, proposed by President Reagan 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan's plan was aimed mainly at stopping an attack from the  
former Soviet Union, while current research is designed more to 
stop a limited attack from a rogue or terrorist state. It would not 
be space-based.

                          *William Alfred    	
</P>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- William Alfred, a playwright and Harvard  
professor, died Thursday in his sleep. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Known to students as ``The Professor,'' Alfred specialized in  
early English literature and taught courses on ``Beowulf'' and 
playwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	His play, ``Hogan's Goat,'' had a long and successful  
off-Broadway run in 1966 and gave Faye Dunaway her first starring 
role. The play earned him the New York Drama Desk Award in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Other works included ``Agamemnon,'' 1982's ``The Curse of an  
Aching Heart'' (also starring Dunaway); ``Nothing Doing,'' and 
``Who to Love,'' a musical adaptation of ``Hogan's Goat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was credited with influencing a number of Harvard students  
who went on to theatrical careers, including Stockard Channing, 
John Lithgow and Tommy Lee Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	His social circle included several writers and poets, among  
them, Gertrude Stein, Archibald MacLeish, Robert Lowell and Seamus 
Heaney. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred served on the poetry panels of the Pulitzer Prize and  
National Book Award committees and also authored a book of poems, 
``The Annunciation Rosary,'' and a translation of ``Beowulf.'' 

</P>
<P>
                            *Henry Jones    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tony Award-winning actor Henry Jones, whose  
career on Broadway and in movies and television spanned more than 
half a century, died Monday from injuries suffered in a fall at his 
home. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	His bulldog face was familiar from dozens of Broadway plays and  
films and 350 television shows. His mild manner and steely scowl 
were put to use playing everything from judges to janitors, 
murderers to ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, he was the handyman killed by deadly child Patty  
McCormack in the Broadway play ``The Bad Seed,'' a role he would 
later repeat in the film version. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Louis Howe,  
confident of Franklin D. Roosevelt, in ``Sunrise at Campobello.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His three dozen films included ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance  
Kid,'' ``Arachnophobia,'' ``The Grifters'' and Alfred Hitchock's 
``Vertigo,'' in which he played a coroner and delivered a 
four-minute monologue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones began his career with theater work in the 1930s and made  
his Broadway debut in 1938 in a version of ``Hamlet.'' 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	He began his newspaper career as a bookkeeper for Waco-based

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jerome Jay Wolken, a Carnegie Mellon  
University biophysicist who invented a lens system that gave sight 
to some legally blind people, died May 10 at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Wolken's patents for his Light Concentrating Lens System  
involved a pear-shaped lens 10 times more sensitive to light than a 
standard camera lens. 
</P>
<P>
	The lens system developed in the 1980s is used in eyeglasses. It  
reproduced the lenses in deep-sea creatures' eyes that they use to 
see at depths of up to 1,500 feet in almost total darkness. People 
with cataracts were the main beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolken researched deep-sea optics at the Marine Biological  
Laboratory and the Oceanographic Research Institute at Woods Hole 
on Cape Cod, Mass., as well as similar institutions in Miami, 
Bermuda, the Bahamas, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolken taught at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1950s and  
was named a professor of biophysics biology in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Carnegie Mellon appointed him a professor and  
head of the biological sciences department at Morrison Carnegie 
College. He wrote nine books in his field and edited two others in 
additions to contributing many papers to scientific journals.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen Thursday  
following the release of a central bank report showing the nation's 
economy remains weak. Japanese stocks finished higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 124.44 yen at midafternoon, up 0.74 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
124.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 71.81 points,  
or 0.44 percent, closing at 16,199.99. On Wednesday, the index fell 
250.44 points, or 1.53 percent. Before Thursday's rise, the Nikkei 
had lost 819.19 points over the previous five full trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's strength was boosted by the  
Bank of Japan's latest monthly report saying that the economy 
appears to have stopped deteriorating, but that no signs of 
recovery can yet be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese companies are still struggling to bail out of the  
nation's worst recession in 50 years, mostly through restructuring 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted that the yen has weakened recently on the  
back of the interest rate differential between the United States 
and Japan. U.S. rates are higher. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the dollar rose to a seven-month high against the  
yen, trading above 124 yen. Higher interest rates make a nation's 
currency more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar stayed in a narrow range in afternoon trading as  
market participants were taking a rest after somewhat volatile 
trading in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 132.90 yen, up from  
131.60 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened moderately higher on buying  
of shares in technology companies but turned lower at midday as 
investors sold shares of companies whose earnings are linked to 
strength in domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors turned bearish on worries that Japan's  
economy is not gaining momentum and frustration that the government 
appears reluctant to push new stimulus measures anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average moved into positive territory within 30  
minutes of the closing bell as institutional investors picked up 
selective shares on dips. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained  
50.44 points to close at 10,887.39 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 1.26 points, or 0.10 percent, to 1,301.87. The 
TOPIX fell 23.54 points, or 1.78 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.295 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.325 
percent, driving its price up to 101.82 yen from 101.55 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Mostly Mixed in Quiet Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds were mixed in quiet trading Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/16  
point, or $3.13 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.83 percent from 5.80 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of the Treasury market fared better Thursday, ending  
little changed from the levels of late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term Treasury has been gyrating following a report  
Friday of a surprisingly big increase in inflation at the consumer 
level during April. Yields Friday rose to 5.92 percent, the highest 
level in a year, amid worries that rising prices would lead the 
Federal Reserve to push up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation eats into the value of investments, such as bonds,  
that promise periodic fixed payments to investors. Rising interest 
rates make returns less attractive on existing bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities ranged from a drop of  
1/32 point to a gain of 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities 
ranged from a rise of 1/32 point to a decline of 1/16 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount was unchanged from Wednesday at 4.48 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.75 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 percentage 
point to 4.57 percent. One-year yields were 4.85 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.01 percentage point to 4.62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.50 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds ended at 122 1/32, unchanged from late 
Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was flat at 5.36 percent.

<HEADLINE> Congress Set To OK Kosovo-Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite conservatives' discontent, the Senate  
moved Thursday toward final congressional approval of a $15 billion 
package financing the fighting in the Balkans, aid to hurricane 
victims and a stew of projects for lawmakers' home districts. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, President Clinton said he would sign the  
legislation ``as soon as it gets here'' and urged lawmakers to rush 
it to him. Until last week, administration officials had threatened 
a veto because Congress doubled the defense spending Clinton sought 
and included provisions on mining, fishing and tobacco that he 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things in the bill that I did not support,''  
the president said. ``But it is terribly important that this aid be 
released as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the compromise measure Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives lambasted the package because it is stuffed with  
local provisions that they said were hardly the emergencies the 
bill proclaims them to be. These included $250,000 to help 
revitalize a downtown Los Angeles neighborhood; $2 million to 
intensify security at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington, D.C.; and increased federal payments to some 
northwestern wheat farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The freight train has stowaways hidden all the way through,''  
said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	They also complained that all but $2 billion of the measure's  
price tag would come from this year's federal surplus, which comes 
completely from Social Security -- money Republicans have pledged to 
leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not use Social Security to pay for a war in the  
Balkans,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders focused on the bill's $12 billion -- twice Clinton's  
request -- for the conflict with Yugoslavia, the Kosovar refugees, 
Balkan countries near the fighting and U.S. forces around the 
globe. They said rejecting the package would hurt American troops 
in combat -- something few lawmakers want to be accused of doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to watch how you vote on this bill, and they  
should,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska, referring to members of the U.S. armed forces. 
``This is not the time for petty differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance of senators to block the package was underscored  
when an effort by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to pay for more of the 
bill by cutting most domestic programs failed, 70-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's Senate debate marked the culmination of a process  
that began in February, when Clinton asked Congress for nearly $1 
billion to help Central American and Caribbean nations recover from 
last fall's two deadly hurricanes, Mitch and Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation providing that aid was passed by the House and  
Senate in March. But it languished until congressional leaders 
decided to use it to rush Clinton defense money and a host of other 
items the measure collected in its sojourn through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, the measure picked up $900 million so the  
government could help victims of this month's killer tornadoes in 
the Midwest and be prepared for other natural disasters yet to 
come. The bill also has $574 million to help American farmers, 
mainly those facing low prices for hogs, wheat and other 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, one of America's Middle East allies, would get $100  
million for its role in helping to arrange the Wye River peace 
accord between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by all 50 governors, Republicans won a provision barring  
the federal government from claiming any of the $246 billion the 
states have won from tobacco companies in a legal settlement. 
Clinton wanted to use some of that money for health care and 
anti-smoking initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeats for the environmental lobby, the measure also has  
language delaying tighter restrictions on mining companies using 
government lands. Higher royalties on oil companies that drill on 
federal property would also be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would allow House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,  
D-Mo., and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, an additional 
$333,000 a year each for office expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens successfully inserted language making reindeer ranchers  
eligible for a $70 million program helping livestock producers. And 
there is $2.3 million for the government to temporarily house in 
Calverton, N.Y., the wreckage of TWA Flight 800, which crashed off 
Long Island in July 1996.

<HEADLINE> Software Maker To Take on Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A tiny software maker that once did  
business with Microsoft is taking on the maker of Windows next 
month in a trial some say could break new ground in antitrust 
challenges against Bill Gates and company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Technology Inc., a Danbury company with just 70  
employees, is scheduled to go to trial June 2 in a lawsuit that 
claims Microsoft is improperly withholding software code that 
Bristol says is vital for its survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is not directly related to the larger lawsuit filed  
against Microsoft by the U.S. Department of Justice and 19 states. 
However, it has a similar theme. 
</P>
<P>
	The government suit contends that Microsoft illegally wielded  
the power of its dominant Windows computer operating system to 
expand into new markets, such as Internet software, and thus crush 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol contends Microsoft is abusing the market power of its  
Windows NT business software, which runs powerful corporate 
machines that direct networks of smaller personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about here is the brain and the central  
nervous system of corporations,'' said Ed Black, president of the 
Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association, a trade group. ``So 
one of the concerns beyond pure economics is that all of those 
central nervous systems of many companies wind up potentially 
dependent upon, reliant on and subservient to the wishes of a 
powerful monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another small software maker, Orem, Utah-based Caldera, also has  
a suit pending against Microsoft alleging abusive business 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry  
Association, said the outcome of both cases, while uncertain, could 
have implications for the larger antitrust lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the Bristol and Caldera cases explore novel issues  
related to the responsibility of the dominant operating system 
vendor in working with independent software vendors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs  
such as word processors and spreadsheets written to work with 
Windows to be converted to run on computers with different 
operating systems such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	Unix is sold by a number of companies including Sun  
Microsystems, an arch-foe of Microsoft. It is a major competitor to 
Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to make Wind/U, Bristol needs access to the source code  
-- the programming blueprints -- for Windows NT. Bristol had a 3-year 
licensing agreement for Windows NT source code with Microsoft, but 
that expired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, Bristol claims Microsoft is illegally preventing  
it from obtaining the Windows source code, in effect severing 
Bristol's customers from the latest Windows technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denies the allegations and says Bristol's lawsuit is  
merely an attempt to negotiate a more favorable licensing 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Tom Pilla said his company was able to  
negotiate a licensing agreement with Mainsoft, one of Bristol's 
competitors, under the same terms it offered Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bristol turned down those terms, then hired an economic  
expert, a public relations firm and a legal team to sue Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Bristol's attempt to use the court system to obtain  
something that isn't theirs in order to obtain an unfair advantage 
over Mainsoft,'' said Pilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Chief Executive Keith Blackwell dismissed Microsoft's  
claim that his lawsuit is a strong-arm negotiating tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really just ridiculous,'' he said. ``That would be a very  
time-consuming and expensive negotiating ploy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will square off in court just as the Microsoft  
antitrust trial in Washington, D.C., is expected to resume after a 
three-month recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera's antitrust suit against Microsoft claims the company's  
pricing practices and marketing techniques effectively destroyed 
the market for a desktop computer operating system its sells called 
DR-DOS, while building a monopoly for Microsoft's MS-DOS, the 
precursor to Windows. That case is scheduled to go to trial in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft dismissed any comparisons between the Bristol and  
Caldera cases and the Department of Justice case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that these cases are linked in any way,'' Pilla  
said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Gun Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Propelled by a shocking outbreak of school  
violence, the Senate passed legislation Thursday night to require 
the sale of safety devices with handguns and expand a system of 
background checks for firearms purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 73-25, and came a few hours after Vice President Al  
Gore eagerly broke a 50-50 tie in favor of a politically popular 
gun control amendment that most Republicans opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage sent the measure to the House, where Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., has signaled support for fresh restrictions on 
guns. Republican and Democratic leaders were discussing plans to 
bring the issue to the House floor as soon as mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have seen today is for the first time in a major kind  
of gun control issue, rejection of the National Rifle Association 
and a vote for common sense,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., 
said as the bill neared final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Democrats  
``think gun control is a good political issue and that will solve 
everything. I say we got all these laws on the books that are 
already there'' that should be more strongly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	A triumph by gun control advocates in the Republican-controlled  
Senate was improbable at best until the shootings in a Colorado 
high school a month ago caused a marked shift in public opinion. A 
shooting at an Atlanta-area high school earlier in the day gave 
fresh impetus to the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation requires background checks for all sales at gun  
shows. It also would close what gun control advocates said was a 
loophole that allows anyone to pawn a gun and reclaim it without 
undergoing a check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secure gun storage or safety devices'' would have to be sold  
with handguns. But the measure also extends liability protections 
for a gun owner who uses a safety lock and whose gun is stolen and 
used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure continues current gun law that majority  
Republicans had succeeded in changing briefly earlier in the day. 
Under the measure as passed, for example, background checks could 
still take up to three days instead of the 24-hour ceiling that 
Republicans wanted on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Importing high-capacity ammunition clips would be banned, and  
any juvenile convicted of a felony would be denied the right to 
purchase a gun for life. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure calls for $5 billion over five years to help crack  
down on juvenile crime. It provides money for prosecutors, and 
makes it easier to try some juveniles as adults. In addition, it 
mandates a study of the entertainment industry to gauge the impact 
of its violent products on the young. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats struggled successfully to turn the events of  
Colorado into a rallying crime for fresh gun controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes came one month to the day after the Colorado high  
school shootings in which two students are alleged to have killed 
12 fellow students, a teacher and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	And only hours before the roll was called in the Senate, there  
was new gunfire at a high school east of Atlanta. Six students were 
injured by another student, who later surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Democrat Max Cleland, who had voted against similar gun  
controls last week, lined up in favor this time. He said he had 
made up his mind to do so Wednesday night, after Democrats had 
agreed to changes. But he added the day's home state bloodshed 
``really confirmed for me that I was on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By themselves, the measures adopted were relatively minor in  
scope. Democrats conceded they had decided not to force votes on 
more sweeping proposals likely to lose, including one to limit an 
individual's purchases to one gun per month. 
</P>
<P>
	But in political terms, the developments were striking, with  
Republicans backpedaling consistently on an issue that has suddenly 
taken on new importance after the Littleton shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA was defiant in defeat. ``It's more  
made-for-television-lawmaking,'' the organization said. ``Now they 
want more gun laws they won't enforce,'' it said of the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Gore's turn in the spotlight, and after enduring a  
rocky period in his presidential campaign, he was clearly pleased 
to be there. Twice, after all 100 senators had cast their votes, he 
prodded the Senate clerk to announce the tie. That done, he cast 
his vote in favor of gun controls that enjoy overwhelming 
popularity in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the morning's shootings in Georgia, he said later,  
``We're reminded again that until we get more controls in a 
sensible way on the easy availability of guns in our society to 
children, to criminals, to those who are mentally disturbed, then 
these tragedies will continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the vote, 44 Democrats and six Republicans were in favor.  
There were 49 Republicans and one Democrat, Sen. Max Baucus of 
Montana, opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans who cast their votes in favor were John Chafee  
of Rhode Island, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Mike DeWine and 
George Voinovich of Ohio, Dick Lugar of Indiana and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	A critical vote was supplied by Georgia's Cleland, who noted  
that Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the principal author, had made 
several changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on Lautenberg's amendments marked a stinging defeat for  
the GOP leadership, which has presided over several days of 
Republican disarray on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Republicans muscled through an amendment that left  
some background checks voluntary at gun shows. Some GOP lawmakers 
changed their minds overnight, and forced Republicans to bring the 
issue back to the floor for a reversal. But Clinton claimed the 
revised proposal was ``riddled with high-caliber loopholes,'' and 
Democrats pressed for a third vote on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the GOP leadership crafted an amendment designed to  
close the loopholes at pawnshops and gun shows yet satisfy the 
numerous Republicans not sympathetic to gun control. Their aim was 
to pass their own proposal and hold enough wavering Republicans in 
line to defeat the stronger, Democratic alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	But that strategy failed.  
</P>
<P>
	While the GOP amendment passed, it was wiped out moments later  
on the strength of Gore's tie-breaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting for final passage were 42 Democrats and 31 Republicans.  
In opposition were 23 Republicans and two Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Traces Watercolors' Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- From the rain-soaked battlefields of the Civil  
War where he worked as an illustrator for Harper's Weekly, Winslow 
Homer created the foundation of an art career that spanned 50 years 
and led some to declare him America's ``national'' painter. 
</P>
<P>
	He painted first in oils, then in watercolors, and it's the  
latter for which he is best-known today. ``You will see, in the 
future I will live by my watercolors,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Englander with a panache for depicting coastal life, Homer  
shares the walls of the Terra Museum of American Art with a host of 
other watercolorists, including famed portraitist John Singer 
Sargent, in the museum's newest exhibit, ``Masters of Color and 
Light: Homer, Sargent and the American Watercolor Movement.'' It 
runs through July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is literally a once-in-a-generation exhibition,'' John  
Hallmark Neff, the museum's curator and director, said as he 
explained the watercolors' extreme sensitivity to light. ``After 
this, they'll go back into their boxes in deep storage, and they 
won't come out for a very long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these 140 paintings were briefly displayed at the  
Brooklyn Museum of Art last year where they were a surprise 
blockbuster hit with art patrons. This showing, a mere eight weeks, 
is the second and last before the collection is locked away for 
another decade or more, museum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition, which covers more than 200 years, is a study in  
contrasts -- from Homer's ``The Turtle Pound'' to Sargent's ``Arab 
Gypsies in a Tent'' through Georgia O'Keeffe's abstract ``Blue 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naturalists were some of the first painters to use watercolor  
because its transparent and translucent nature makes it effective 
at capturing the subtleties of outdoor light and atmosphere. Their 
works fill a small corner of the gallery and pay tribute to 
America's natural wonders from the Catskills to Virginia's Natural 
Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Couched among pictures of delicate apple blossoms and a dancing  
Isadora Duncan are a few heavily gilded frames. Their thick, dark 
colors seem out of place on the Terra Museum's walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Called ``exhibition watercolors,'' these works of art were  
painted when watercolor, which was considered secondary to oil, was 
fighting for its place in the world of art and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Claude Raguet Hirst's ``The Bookworm's Table'' is one such  
showpiece. The details -- the rich mahogany wood, the glint of light 
bouncing off a blue vase -- are clear and precise. Edwin Austin 
Abbey's ``Stony Ground'' is another. 
</P>
<P>
	Watercolor, once considered the domain of women, eventually  
triumphed over its American naysayers. With the help of the 
American Watercolor Society, it was elevated from a sketching tool 
to being declared the ``American medium'' by some art lovers. 
</P>
<P>
	But even those who mastered its techniques didn't always share  
their enthusiasm. Sargent didn't show his watercolors publicly 
until about 1900, and then only to distance himself from his 
previous work as a society portraitist. 
</P>
<P>
	Art historians counter that Sargent's tight control on the sale  
of his watercolors -- requiring them to be kept together for public 
exhibition -- proves he valued them. It also explains how 83 of his 
86 watercolors ended up in the hands of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, 
the organizer of the Terra exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``His watercolors were mostly for himself,'' Neff said. ``He got  
very sick of doing those portraits. The joy in his watercolors is 
quite amazing.''

<HEADLINE> Royals Coach Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City Royals bullpen coach Tom  
Burgmeier will be sidelined much of the season because of injuries 
sustained in a car-bicycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgmeier, 55, was hurt while riding his bicycle to Kauffman  
Stadium on Wednesday. He underwent surgery Thursday after 
sustaining several fractures in the left knee area and two 
fractures of the right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Royals trainer Nick Swartz said Burgmeier's leg will be  
immobilized about two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to need extensive therapy after that to get his  
range of motion back,'' Swartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgmeier's rehabilitation of the knee will be hampered by the  
wrist injury, which will make it difficult to use crutches. 
</P>
<P>
	A car turned in front of Burgmeier, the Royals said, causing him  
and the bike to become airborne over the automobile.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Woman Taken Off Life Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Paralyzed by a bullet to her spine and  
barely able to speak, Georgette Smith nevertheless was able to make 
her point unmistakably: She didn't want to live this way. 
</P>
<P>
	She died Wednesday, one day after a court granted her wish and  
gave her permission to disconnect the ventilator that was keeping 
her alive. 
</P>
<P>
	For her family, the ordeal is far from over. Her frail and aging  
mother, already charged with shooting Ms. Smith, now may be charged 
with her murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith, 42, was shot in March, the bullet tearing through her  
neck and spinal cord and leaving her unable to speak without 
effort, incapable of swallowing and unable to control her bladder. 
She was fed through a tube and ran a high risk of pneumonia, 
infections, ulcers and bedsores. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is wink my eyes and wiggle my nose, wiggle my  
tongue. I can't move any other part of my body,'' she said in court 
papers. ``I can't live like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ruled in her favor Tuesday and said she could have  
life support removed after 5 p.m. Wednesday. She died at 5:46 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lucerne Medical Center spokeswoman would not say what time the  
ventilator was disconnected, but said Ms. Smith was sedated 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith's daughters, Candace Smith, 22, and Joeleen Hill, 19,  
had supported their mother's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's prepared herself,'' Candace Smith said in court last  
week, ``because she knows she's lived a good life and she doesn't 
want to finish her life in this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before her death, Ms. Smith gave prosecutors a videotaped  
deposition from her hospital bed. It will be among the evidence 
against her 68-year-old mother, Shirley Egan, who is already jailed 
on an attempted murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Ms. Smith made the decision to die, prosecutors were  
likely to charge Ms. Egan with murder, creating a highly unusual -- 
and perhaps unprecedented -- case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan, an 85-pound woman who is blind in one eye, allegedly  
shot her daughter after overhearing her and her boyfriend talking 
about putting Ms. Egan in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan's attorney has said she did not mean to shoot her  
daughter and didn't want to see her suffer. But he argued against 
removing Ms. Smith from the ventilator because prosecutors had said 
they would seek a murder indictment against Ms. Egan. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said the prosecutors were within their duties to  
upgrade the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's sound law,'' said Milwaukee County District  
Attorney E. Michael McCann, who prosecuted serial killer Jeffrey 
Dahmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have upgraded charges to murder when comatose  
victims have died after family members decided to take them off 
life support. But Robert Moffat, a law professor at the University 
of Florida, said this case is unique because Ms. Smith made the 
choice herself. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong case could be made that the cause of Ms. Smith's death  
was the removal of life support, not being shot, said Andrew 
Kayton, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an important legal issue -- whether the mother's  
shooting was the legal cause of death,'' Kayton said.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Debate Over Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The gun control debate among  
presidential candidates was fueled by the latest school shooting 
episode Thursday, with demands for tough new restrictions mixed 
with calls for caution. 
</P>
<P>
	New polling showing increased support for gun control  
initiatives was certain to warm that debate even further. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore voted to break a Senate tie and approve  
fresh restrictions on gun transactions. ``This is a turning point 
for our country,'' Gore said in touting his vote, which drew a 
congratulatory call from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only announced  
rival for the Democratic nomination, scornfully said White House 
gun control initiatives ``are minimums'' and much stronger actions 
must be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before this is over, we are going to have to do something much  
stronger,'' said Bradley, at a news conference while campaigning in 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he was formulating a proposal on the issue and  
would offer that ``sooner rather than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned,'' said Bradley. ``I have some ideas but not for  
this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley declined reporters' invitations to take a direct shot at  
Gore for not being aggressive enough on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of us should be more aggressive,'' said Bradley.  
``It isn't a matter of one person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore believes ``there's no one  
answer to helping to protect our kids'' but the new restrictions 
will help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do everything we possible can from availability of  
guns and today's tie-breaking vote in the Senate is a good step in 
that direction,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the aisle, some Republican contenders took  
care to note they do not flatly oppose gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I first started running for office, I've been for  
background checks, instant background checks,'' said Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. ``I think background checks are important to make 
sure that guns don't get in the hands of felons and-or people who 
shouldn't be carrying guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Elizabeth Dole noted that she began calling for gun  
control three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did it first,'' said spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``She did it  
when it wasn't popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio noted that he voted for a ban on  
assault weapons and ``there's some legitimate tightening we can 
do.'' He urged caution, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at gun control as a way to pass three laws and think  
we've fixed the problem,'' Kasich said. ``I'm going to look at 
additional restrictions that make sense, but I'm going to be very 
careful about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to former Dan Quayle said the former vice president  
preferred to focus on what he sees as declining cultural values 
that are the root cause of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan Quayle believes there's one issue and that's the  
culture,'' said spokesman Jonathan Baron. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for former Education Secretary Lamar  
Alexander, said Alexander favored some restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would sign legislation requiring background checks at gun  
shows,'' said Schmidt, who said Alexander opposes ``unreasonable'' 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates spoke hours after the latest school shooting  
episode at a suburban Atlanta high school, where six students were 
wounded, and after the Senate approved new gun restrictions it had 
rejected just last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It adds another impetus for doing something very significant  
on gun control,'' said Bradley. ``The things that have been 
proposed by the White House are minimums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, seeking the GOP nomination, said he  
would focus on the school shooting issue during a speech Saturday 
to the Georgia Republican Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there are some real and important steps local, state  
and national leaders can and must take to keep our kids safe and 
bring real discipline and values back into our classrooms,'' Forbes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Bush announced a $420,000 grant to create a Texas  
School Safety Center to examine ways of curbing violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obviously a part of the American tragedy that children  
are coming to school and shooting people and our society has got to 
do everything we can to figure out ways to prohibit violence,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a new poll released by the Pew Research Center for  
the People &AMP; Press indicated that large majorities of Democrats and 
of Republican women were more inclined to say it was more important 
to control gun ownership than to protect the rights of gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was taken before the Georgia shootings. Other surveys  
taken after the deadly shooting spree in Littleton, Colo., showed 
public support for gun control elevated by the school incident.

<HEADLINE> Does Sarazen Caddy Own `The' Club?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- The late Gene Sarazen, whose famous  
double-eagle in 1935 helped make the Masters a major tournament, 
later gave a 3-wood to a teen-age caddy in St. Paul and said it was 
the club he used for that shot. 
</P>
<P>
	But was it?  
</P>
<P>
	``Gene said this is the club he used for the double-eagle when  
he gave it to me,'' said Thor Nordwall, 78. ``Late in his life, he 
said he didn't remember what he had done with it. Is the club as he 
presented it or was it a lie? Was he the good guy he was supposed 
to be to all kids or wasn't he?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's autobiography, ``Thirty Years of Championship Golf,''  
says the club used to hit the famous double-eagle was a 4-wood. 
That 4-wood and the ball Sarazen hit at the '35 Masters are in a 
trophy case in the Augusta National clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen died May 13 at age 97.  
</P>
<P>
	Nordwall, then 17, carried Sarazen's bag for five days in the  
St. Paul Open in 1939. He says he received the 3-wood as part of 
his pay. 
</P>
<P>
	A newspaper story from July 31, 1939, seems to validate the  
tale. In part, it says, ``... one kid just as happy must have been 
the boy who looped for Gene Sarazen. Sarazen said this boy, Thor 
Nordwall, was the best caddy he'd ever had. To show his 
appreciation of the lad's services, Gene gave the kid the famous 
No. 3 wood with which he holed his great double-eagle in the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene stated that he missed three shots on his final round.  
'Each time I did I had used clubs against Thor's advice. He's the 
best caddy I've ever had.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's famous double-eagle was a spoon shot that sailed 230  
yards and settled in the cup for a 2 in the final round of the 
second Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordwall said he didn't realize what he might have until about  
1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't dazzled when he gave me the club in '39. All the  
dazzling came later,'' Nordwall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The club hangs on the wall in Nordwall's home.

<HEADLINE> McCain Says Dole Supports Wife's Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful John McCain  
wants to thank his old friend Bob Dole for his offer of support 
this week, but he has not been able to get in touch with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't installed a phone in his woodshed,'' McCain  
deadpanned in speech Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole raised eyebrows in the political world this week when he  
said he was not sure his wife, Elizabeth Dole, would continue her 
pursuit of the Republican nomination, and that he was considering 
donating to McCain's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he thought Dole's comments were taken ``out of  
context'' and that there was no lack of support for his wife's bid 
for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I in no way interpreted that as any erosion of his leadership,  
his advocacy, or his desire to see Elizabeth Dole as the nominee of 
our party,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite his several runs for the presidency, McCain noted  
that, Dole still had ``his desire to be 'First Man'.''

	Trade Deficit Hits Record High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States monthly trade deficit soared  
to a record high for the third straight month in March as the 
politically sensitive deficit with Japan shot up to the highest 
level in more than four years. The Commerce Department said today 
that the March deficit of $19.7 billion was 2.9 percent higher than 
the previous record of $19.1 billion in February. So far this year, 
the U.S. trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $222.6 
billion, nearly one-third higher than the all-time high of $169.3 
billion set last year as the global financial crisis continues to 
wreck havoc with America's trade performance.

	Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 38.34

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today as the market weighed  
the meaning of two new economic reports. Just before 11 a.m. EDT, 
the Dow Jones industrial average was up 38.34 at 10,925.73. Broader 
stock indicators also posted slim gains. The Nasdaq composite index 
was up 4.06 at 2,581.46. A rising trade deficit may have turned 
some investors away from the market. The Commerce Department said 
today the nation's monthly deficit rose to a record high in March, 
led by a widening gap with Japan. However, the Labor Department's 
report on weekly jobless claims indicated the U.S. economy remains 
strong.

	Greenspan Backs U.S. Reform Efforts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told  
Congress today that Fed policy-makers support Clinton 
administration efforts to make the global financial system less 
susceptible to future Asian-style currency crises. Greenspan and 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin sounded the same reform themes in a 
joint appearance before the House Banking Committee. They outlined 
steps policy-makers have taken to deal with the 22-month-long 
crisis that has plunged one-third of the global economy into 
recession. Rubin mentioned steps to strengthen rules to encourage 
greater financial disclosure by developing countries and to put 
into place guidelines that will discourage these countries from 
taking too many risks when they borrow money.

	LONDON (AP) -- Barclays Bank PLC plans to slash 6,000 jobs,  
almost 10 percent of its work force, in a cost-cutting move aimed 
at countering sagging profits and widespread doubts about the 
future of Britain's third-largest bank. Barclays said today it 
hopes the job cuts will help it save more than $320 million a year. 
The cuts will come mostly in the form of voluntary resignations and 
retirements by workers in its retail branches and corporate lending 
areas, the bank said. At the same time, Barclays plans to 
computerize and centralize more of its operations in a 
restructuring program set to cost almost $650 million.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two major drug and chemical companies have  
reached an agreement with federal prosecutors to pay a record $725 
million settlement of allegations that they engaged in a worldwide 
conspiracy to raise and fix the prices of vitamins, according to 
lawyers familiar with the case. The total settlement will top the 
$100 million paid in 1997 by Archer Daniels Midland Co., the U.S. 
agribusiness giant, for its role in fixing prices for two food 
additives, lysine and citric acid, according to a Justice 
Department official who requested anonymity. In the settlement, 
Roche Holding AG of Switzerland agreed to pay $500 million, and 
BASF AG of Germany agreed to pay $225 million, officials said.

	Arbitrator Rules Against Disney

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. breached its contract  
with former film boss Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1994 and owes him a 
potentially huge interest payment on top of what could be a sizable 
bonus, an arbitrator ruled yesterday. The case now moves to another 
phase in which the referee, retired Superior Court Judge Paul G. 
Breckenridge, considers more testimony to determine exactly how 
much money Disney should pay Katzenberg, who has contended he's due 
at least $250 million in an incentive bonus. If Katzenberg's final 
bonus ends up being close to what he wants, the compounded interest 
could be worth tens of millions of dollars. Disney stock was up 
1/16 at 30 this morning.

	Survey: Microsoft Browser Winning

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new survey purports to show that Microsoft  
is winning the Internet browser war in the nation's offices, 
traditionally the domain of its software rival, Netscape. Zona 
Research Inc. said almost 60 percent of 308 companies in its new 
survey now use Microsoft's Internet browser, an important trend 
that could be a Pyrrhic victory for the software giant. Microsoft 
Corp.'s aggressive push to persuade consumers to use its Internet 
software rather than one from Netscape Communications Corp. is at 
the core of the government's antitrust case against Microsoft, 
scheduled to resume June 1.

television company, which already owns Madison Square Garden as 
well as the New York Knicks and Rangers, has agreed to bear half of 
the $206 million cost to construct the new venue above the Hoboken 
commuter rail station, Devils president John McMullen said 
Wednesday night. The plan would still need some public subsidies, 
and Hoboken officials are worried about crowded streets and a 
parking shortage. Still, McMullen called the plan ``an outstanding 
opportunity'' for the state.

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's largest  
business conglomerate, said Thursday it will invest $2 billion to 
make electric cars and auto parts, primarily for export. Chairman 
Wang Yung-ching said the chemical giant hopes to capitalize on 
lower tariffs on Taiwanese cars following Taiwan's admission by the 
World Trade Organization, which is expected late this year. The 
group chose to make electric cars because Taiwan's conventional car 
production has fallen too far behind other countries for it to 
catch up, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Diplomas Awarded to Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDNER, Mass. (AP) -- Harding Mason waved his diploma aloft on  
the Gardner High School stage as his grandchildren gave him a 
standing ovation -- a tribute to a man who left during his junior 
year to fight in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he and 39 other veterans received the  
long-abandoned diplomas. Said Mason, now 75: ``It fills a void.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was the first held by Operation Recognition, a  
program developed by the Massachusetts Department of Veterans 
Services to award diplomas to honorably discharged veterans and 
those who earned high school equivalency degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	About 600 Gardner students, veterans' relatives and former  
teachers gathered with government officials to witness the 
graduation. Former President Bush, former Sen. Bob Dole and 
director Steven Spielberg sent letters of congratulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid cries of ``Grandpa, Grandpa!'' the veterans received  
diplomas on a stage draped with patriotic bunting. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine honorees were killed in combat and received diplomas  
posthumously. Mason accepted a second diploma for his older 
brother, Leslie, who was killed in the North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Students decorated the library with old yearbooks and student  
newspapers from the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have made it through what they did,'' said Chris  
Hancock, a senior at Gardner. His grandfather, Edward Misiewicz, 
and great uncle, Edward Gallant, were among Thursday's graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Riley, who left for the Army Air Corps in 1944, the  
first month of his senior year, said the awarding of his degree 
carried a surprising significance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize how much that diploma would mean to me,'' he  
said, ``until now.''

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Life for Torture Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A man was convicted of murder and sentenced to  
life in prison in the slaying of a retarded 59-year-old who 
prosecutors say was tortured and beaten to death in a plot to 
collect on his life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Terence Singleton, 28, was the fourth of six people to be tried  
in the slaying of Louis ``Buddy'' Musso, whose body was found in a 
ditch Aug. 26. Singleton was found guilty Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other people have been convicted on murder charges. Two  
more, including the alleged ringleader, are awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Musso died after weeks of beatings at the apartment of one of  
the defendants. He was forced to kneel naked on a mat during the 
last days of his life. Between beatings, he was denied food, bathed 
in cleaning fluids and scrubbed with a wire brush. 
</P>
<P>
	A $50,000 life insurance policy had been taken out on Musso,  
with a provision that more would be paid if he died as the result 
of violent crime.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator Rules Against Disney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. owes former film division  
chief Jeffrey Katzenberg a potentially huge incentive bonus, plus 
interest, for his role in creating smash hits like ``The Lion 
King,'' an arbitrator ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Superior Court Judge Paul Breckenridge issued his  
decision Wednesday and will next hear testimony to determine 
exactly how much money Disney should pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, who left Disney in 1994 after he was denied a  
promotion, is suing Disney for what he says is at least $250 
million from an incentive bonus promised in his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims the bonus is worth 2 percent of all future profits  
from every Disney product -- from such blockbuster movies as ``The 
Lion King'' and ``Aladdin'' to T-shirts and games -- generated 
during his decade with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bonus ends up being close to what Katzenberg wants, the  
compounded interest could be worth tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, Breckenridge found that Disney breached  
Katzenberg's contract on Oct. 1, 1994, and ``was obligated to pay a 
post-termination bonus'' with interest. In addition to the amount 
of the bonus, the judge left undecided the date from which the 
interest should start accruing. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also decided that Katzenberg's bonus should include  
profits from merchandise sold in Disney stores and at theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	In rulings for Disney, the judge found that Katzenberg was not  
entitled to any bonus money from profits at the three Club Disney 
play centers, and restricted the amount of money that could come 
from Disney's on-line service. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg's lawyers declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Disney had argued that Katzenberg forfeited his bonus because he  
left two years before the end of his six-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties reached a partial settlement, but most of the terms  
have been placed under seal. What is known is that Disney has 
already paid Katzenberg some money -- more than $100 million, 
according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement authorized Breckenridge to resolve disputes on  
whether certain products fall under the bonus, and the exact value 
of that bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceeding has been portrayed as the messy aftermath of the  
disintegration of a Hollywood power marriage, with the trial 
turning into a bitter personal battle between Katzenberg and his 
former boss, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
	In an extraordinarily unusual airing of Hollywood grievances,  
Katzenberg argued the dispute boiled down to Eisner's animosity 
toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner, under questioning by Katzenberg's lawyer, acknowledged  
he may have once said of Katzenberg, ``I think I hate the little 
midget.'' But he said that remark and other statements were 
probably made in anger after Katzenberg left the company.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Microsoft Browser Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new survey purports to show that Microsoft  
is winning the Internet browser war in the nation's offices, 
traditionally the domain of its software rival, Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Zona Research Inc. said almost 60 percent of 308 companies in  
its new survey now use Microsoft's Internet browser, an important 
trend that could be a Pyrrhic victory for the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp.'s aggressive push to persuade consumers to use  
its Internet software rather than one from Netscape Communications 
Corp. is at the core of the government's antitrust case against 
Microsoft, scheduled to resume June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A Zona survey in October -- which was cited as evidence in the  
trial -- indicated that 60 percent of companies used Netscape's 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden told the judge that the earlier  
survey ``completely undermines the government's case.'' Lawyers 
also cited the earlier results two other times as they challenged 
government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new survey of 308 corporate technology professionals  
showed that 59 percent identified Microsoft's browser as the one 
they ``personally use the most at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results put Microsoft in the awkward position of playing  
down a survey that trumpets the company's own success. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan argued that the results show  
only which browser the professionals used personally, not 
necessarily which browser was used by all employees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survey also said more than two-thirds of the companies  
encourage or require all employees to use specific Internet 
software, and that of those, 62 percent encourage or require the 
use of Microsoft's browser over Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply offering choice, and the best product  
winning,'' Cullinan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the results support the government's allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It reconfirms the underlying facts of the case, and the  
problems and the tactics shown,'' said Ed Black, president of the 
Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group 
that has been critical of Microsoft. ``Microsoft has always made 
the point, you have to have real damage (to Netscape). Here's 
obviously real damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape early on targeted companies as its prime market for  
browser sales. Companies' software managers recognized Netscape as 
an Internet pioneer, and a 1996 Zona survey found more than 70 
percent of companies used Navigator. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Internet Explorer generally has been more popular  
among consumers at home, especially since the company began 
bundling its browser within Windows, the operating system used to 
run most of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which released a new version of its browser in March,  
also enjoys unusual popularity for its browser among home consumers 
because America Online distributes Microsoft's Web software to all 
its more than 18 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL recently purchased Netscape, but is contractually obligated  
to continue distributing Microsoft's browser until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Zona said its survey was taken of 308 randomly selected  
technology professionals who have software purchasing 
responsibilities, and whose companies have at least 20 employees 
and $1 million in revenues.

<HEADLINE> Intel Develops Portable Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLSBORO, Ore. (AP) -- You may not be able to take a moon  
shuttle or spend a night in space like characters in the movie 
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' but the kind of thin computer pad they 
carried could be on shelves by the real 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp., the world's largest chip maker, is testing a device  
about the size of an Etch-a-Sketch that taps into the Internet 
without a wire and can be passed around the house from husband to 
wife to kid to check the latest headlines, e-mail, stock quotes and 
even the school lunch menu. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have to come out here and pry it out of my hands,''  
said Katherine Cowan, whose suburban Portland family recently 
tested a prototype that designers based loosely on the ``newspad'' 
in the classic 1968 movie. 
</P>
<P>
	She praised the convenience of a computer that can be carried  
from room to room and ``held in your lap like a book or a 
newspaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than having to go upstairs, start the computer, log  
onto the provider and do a search, I could be on the Internet 
anywhere in the house,'' she said. ``I could do it on the phone, I 
could do it while I was cooking, I could sit on the patio and have 
a glass of wine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Web Pad, which will sell for about $500, has a completely  
different audience than the newspads portrayed in the Stanley 
Kubrick film. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think about 2001, you have these cute little devices,  
but who's using them? It's the scientists, it's the engineers,'' 
said Walter Bender, assistant director of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology media lab. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the fact that these devices are consumer products now is  
so different from the vision of 2001, and it's so different from 
what people's expectations were even a decade ago,'' Bender said. 
``The computer has way outstripped the imagination of people in the 
'60s, even people like Kubrick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the Intel development team that created the Web  
Pad says it was designed to be simple as possible to use, yet fast, 
durable with plenty of advanced features that match a desktop 
computer -- without being stuck in one room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's how people live in their homes, how they communicate,''  
said Ed Arrington of the Intel Architecture Lab, one of the Oregon 
divisions of the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try not to position ourselves as too `out there,'''  
Arrington said. ``This is more real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts doubt the Web Pad will replace the desktop  
computer, noting the test homes had to be wired for a radio 
connection between the pad and a desktop machine with a dedicated 
phone line that gave it round-the-clock access to the Internet. 
Also, there is no keyboard, but users can call up an image of a 
keyboard to type with a special pen. 
</P>
<P>
	``People talk about the age of the conventional PC being over,  
but I don't think that's true,'' said Kurt Scherf, a home network 
analyst for Parks Associates in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of the device will depend as much on Internet  
access and security as the technology that goes into the Web Pad, 
added Alexis Gerard, publisher of The Future Image Report, in San 
Mateo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	If Internet speed and capacity improves as fast, Gerard says  
people will buy something that can call up a digital photo of their 
grandchildren as quickly it can find a recipe for pesto sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were still trying to figure out how to use the computer  
before the Web came along,'' Gerard said. ``But that changed the 
way people looked at the computer, and the way they communicated 
with each other.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Monitors Inspect N.Korea Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 14-member team began inspection of an  
underground facility in North Korea today as the White House 
announced that former Defense Secretary William Perry will lead a 
team of U.S. officials next week to assess progress in the 
communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department officials confirmed that inspections had begun  
and would be ``open-ended,'' but said results of the inspection -- 
to determine if the facility was being used for nuclear weapons 
development -- would have to be analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House announcement on the visit by Perry, a  
presidential adviser on North Korean issues, said he would be 
accompanied by Ambassador Wendy R. Sherman, counselor of the State 
Department, and a ``small team of U.S. officials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit is intended to assess views of the communist regime  
first-hand, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, talking about the  
inspections Wednesday, said, ``The U.S. will have satisfactory 
access to the site in order to remove fully our concerns about the 
nature of the site and the activities of the site.'' He declined to 
identify members of the team, described as technical specialists, 
and said there is no time limit for them to do their work. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether Perry and his group would  
have any contact with the inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rubin criticized new legislation in Congress aimed at  
getting more out of North Korea in exchange for oil shipments and 
food aid under the agreement designed to halt any North Korean 
nuclear weapons development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that we're getting access ... should take the  
steam out of some of those ill-advised ideas to throw away an 
agreement that has helped us prevent North Korea from becoming a 
major nuclear power threatening our vital national interests ...'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee, said, ``We should be getting 
more for our money.'' His legislation would limit Clinton's 
discretion in providing aid under the program and impose new 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1994 agreement, North Korea agreed to curtail its  
nuclear weapons program in exchange for fuel oil for its 
conventional power plants and international assistance for 
developing new nuclear power generators, mostly from Japan and 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton requested $55 million in his budget for fiscal year 2000  
for the oil program, up from $35 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman and other congressional critics of the program contend  
North Korea has not lived up to its end, citing concerns over the 
underground facility and other indications that North Korea may be 
developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	They have also criticized North Korea's 1998 launch of a  
multistage rocket over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation it would permit humanitarian food shipments to  
North Korea only if food ``is not diverted to the North Korean 
military and that North Korea is taking steps to regain 
self-sufficiency in food production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House last year voted to block the oil payments, but they  
were restored in later negotiations with the Senate and the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting another concern of some Americans, a Massachusetts  
man called The Associated Press on Wednesday to register his 
objection to deals with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred Gregori of Longmeadow, Mass., said his brother, Joseph,  
has been missing in North Korea since he was a 19-year-old soldier 
serving in the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregori said his 86-year-old mother, Lena, who lives in West  
Pittston, Pa., is still waiting for word of her son. She still has 
his wardrobe, Purple Heart medal and an American flag given by the 
military, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before she passes away, she would love to know whatever  
happened to my brother,'' Gregori said. He said no aid -- oil or 
food -- should go to North Korea until it accounts for all Americans 
missing from the war. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say North Korea has been cooperating in efforts  
to account for American soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Lots of Series Finales, but... </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You and that TV series have had a long, happy  
relationship. But it's clear, the end is near. Which means: series 
finale. 
</P>
<P>
	On a night you greet with wistful resignation, there's the long  
goodbye (last shows are usually fluffed up) ... that parting glance 
through glistening eyes ... then, over and out. 
</P>
<P>
	And then?  
</P>
<P>
	And then the show proceeds to mock you forever in reruns! Old  
series don't die. They don't even fade away! 
</P>
<P>
	Consider CBS' ``The Nanny,'' which recently concluded six  
seasons of sitcom twaddle with the birth of twins and a tearful 
curtain call. But wait! Besides its eternal afterlife in 
syndication, ``The Nanny'' lives on at CBS with several unaired 
episodes (the twins presumably still in the womb) scheduled for 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	What else?  
</P>
<P>
	--''Melrose Place,'' which premiered on Fox in July 1992, airs  
its finale Monday at 8 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Mad About You,'' which NBC launched two months later, wraps  
with a one-hour special Monday at 9 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Home Improvement,'' which debuted on ABC in September 1991,  
has a one-hour conclusion Tuesday at 8 p.m. EDT, followed by a 
half-hour of interviews and outtakes. 
</P>
<P>
	You're not choked up by their imminent leave-taking? You're not  
alone. According to Electronic Media magazine, this season has been 
the ratings nadir for these shows, which ``find themselves limping 
toward the finish line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far more poignant is the departure of ``Homicide: Life on the  
Street,'' thanks to a death warrant NBC signed only last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Its end wasn't wholly unexpected. Since its beginning in January  
1993, ``Homicide'' has stubbornly resisted hit status, while 
stumbling creatively this season, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
	But what has set ``Homicide'' apart, year in and year out, has  
been its bottomless capacity to surprise, and surprise in the most 
meaningful ways. Prime-time's reigning drama laboratory, 
``Homicide'' never stopped investigating ways to move its audience 
-- and to do TV proud. That should have been enough to win renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's episode, airing at 10 p.m. EDT, now stands as the  
series finale. There's a dark Baltimore street, a shooting death, 
and a closing exchange that hangs in the air long after fadeout: 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is a mystery,'' Detective Sheppard (Michael Michele)  
tells her partner. ``Just accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, well,'' grunts Detective Lewis (Clark Johnson), ``that's  
what's wrong with this job: Ain't got nothin' to do with life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, ``Homicide'' had everything to do with life. Now it  
leaves you with this mystery: What new places would the show have 
taken you next season? 
</P>
<P>
	``Melrose Place'' had everything to do with life as it exists in  
a stucco-finished pleasure dome. In that Los Angeles apartment 
complex, the diabolical cohabited with the clueless, and residents 
were oversexed, fabulous and young. 
</P>
<P>
	In its day, ``Melrose Place'' was obligatory viewing, but in  
recent years? Hey, who knew it was even still on? 
</P>
<P>
	While you wait for visual proof in the form of Monday's finale  
(not available for preview), you can see how much ``Melrose'' 
minutiae you recall by entering the ``Win a Piece of the Place'' 
Sweepstakes (www.fox.com). 
</P>
<P>
	Sample questions: Sydney's stage name as a stripper was (a) Sexy  
Syd, (b) Jungle Jane, (c) Loose Laura? Kimberly planted the bombs 
that blew up the Melrose complex (a) on the roof, (b) in the 
laundry room, (c) in Amanda's apartment? 
</P>
<P>
	Win, and you might get a vial of water from the Melrose Place  
pool. It will keep you young forever. 
</P>
<P>
	But the conclusion of ``Mad About You'' may make you feel old.  
</P>
<P>
	A typical finale ties up loose ends and then, with the audience  
duly reassured, fondly sends its heroes off to a graceful tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Not ``Mad.'' Here, a young woman (played by Janeane Garofalo)  
introduces herself as Mabel -- the daughter of Jamie and Paul 
Buchman who, last time you checked, was just a year old. Then, from 
her futuristic vantage point, circa 2030, Mabel recounts what 
happened to her parents in a personal film she calls ``The Reason 
I'm Like This.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to this ambitious but uneven finale, some of what the  
graying Buchmans faced after 1999 is sitcom-silly. Some is -- well, 
disillusioning and maybe more than you really wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
	Say what you will about the Buchmans, played so richly by Helen  
Hunt and Paul Reiser: They are no fairy-tale couple (apart from 
their Fifth Avenue co-op). When, at hour's end, Mabel declares that 
her parents ``lived happily ever after,'' her assessment rings 
false. After what she has shown you, it's a warm-and-fuzzy 
contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, ``Mad About You'' goes out echoing the premise with  
which ``Home Improvement'' came in: Men and women should never ever 
live together, because they are two different animals. But inasmuch 
as they do ... how? 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Home'' hour-long finale, a reminiscence clip-job, vividly  
displays the show's nuts and bolts -- power-tools slapstick 
interspersed with marital sparring: 
</P>
<P>
	``You gonna cry through this wedding like you did through  
ours?'' asks Tim (Tim Allen). 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' replies Jill (Patricia Richardson), ``but this time I'm  
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And for viewers who care, there's a bonus: Wilson's face, long  
obscured by the backyard fence, is finally revealed. As dramatic 
revelations go, that's even beyond the capacity of ``Homicide.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Rose in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds rose by $429 million in the latest week to $857.12 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $150.9 million to $710.86 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets rose by $579.9 million to $146.26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $6.95 billion  
to $595.05 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $5.93 billion to $546.06 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $1.02 billion to $48.99 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.452 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.445 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.30 percent from 4.27 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield held steady at the previous week's 4.30 percent, IBC 
Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.39 percent from 4.37  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield was 
unchanged at 4.39 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
61 days, up from 60 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.06 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.07 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts was unchanged from the previous week at 0.91 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.13 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.12 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.37 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.36 
percent; 4.49 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.48 percent; and 
4.66 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.64 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Goes to World Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Jonas Bjorkman breezed to a  
straight-set victory over an impatient Greg Rusedski Thursday as 
Sweden swept Britain to reach its fifth final at the World Team 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden won the Red Group match 3-0, wrapping it up early by  
taking both singles as Bjorkman rolled past Rusedski 6-2, 6-2, and 
Thomas Enqvist outlasted Tim Henmann 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bjorkman and Niklas Kulti then beat Rusedski and Henman 6-3,  
5-7, 6-1 in a meaningless doubles at the $1.65 million event, which 
pits eight top tennis countries against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Group winner will be decided in a showdown of unbeatens  
Friday with Pat Rafter-led Australia facing the United States and 
its top player, Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care who we play -- both countries have excellent  
individual players,'' said Enqvist. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-serving Rusedski, still trying to prove his power game  
functions on the slow clay, made numerous errors while gambling on 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went into the match with a lot of self-confidence since I  
had already beaten Rusedski five times,'' said Bjorkman, a former 
top player who has slipped to No. 37 in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't play badly, but I made it hard for him with my  
return of serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden, a three-time winner under Stefan Edberg, advanced to  
Saturday's final on the strength of its 2-1 record and a victory 
over Spain, which also finished 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain finished second in the Red Group after beating Germany  
2-1, with defending French Open champion Carlos Moya and Alex 
Corretja wrapping up the match with singles wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya beat Tommy Haas 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 and Corretja struggled for  
two hours, 20 minutes before putting away Nicolas Kiefer, 6-3, 4-6, 
6-4 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Becker and David Prinosil gave Germany its point, beating  
Albert Costa and Jairo Velasco, 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain finished third in the Red Group with a 1-2 record, while  
1-2 Germany was fourth after losing the head-to-head tie between 
the two teams.

<HEADLINE> Reds Agree To Lease for New Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds have agreed to a 30-year  
lease for a new baseball park along the Ohio River that will open 
in 2003, baseball sources confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds owner Marge Schott and managing executive John Allen have  
signed off on the lease, removing the last major hurdle to getting 
the project under way, according to once source familiar with the 
agreement who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Architects are still working on a design for the ballpark, which  
will slightly overlap Cinergy Field. A final drawing is expected 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton County and Reds officials declined comment pending an  
announcement Friday morning at Cinergy Field, where the Reds have 
played since 1970. A $403 million stadium project for the 
Cincinnati Bengals is under construction just west of the stadium 
and is expected to be finished for the 2000 NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' lease agreement, first reported in The Cincinnati  
Post, closely resembles the preliminary deal signed last July, 
which provides the Reds with a 45,000-seat park. The cost of the 
stadium alone is estimated at $297 million, not including land 
acquisition and related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the stadium lease was one of Schott's final acts as the  
Reds' controlling partner. She agreed to sell all but one of her 6 1/2 
shares to three of the current limited partners for $67 million on 
April 20, ending her 15-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has to approve the sale before the team  
switches hands. Cincinnati financier Carl Lindner will become the 
new controlling partner once it is approved. 
</P>
<P>
	County voters approved a half-cent increase in their sales tax  
in March 1996 to build new stadiums for the Bengals and the Reds, 
who have shared Riverfront Stadium/Cinergy Field since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals reached an agreement with county officials first,  
giving them first choice of a stadium site and getting their 
project underway. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds supported a plan to build their stadium between  
Cinergy Field and an arena formerly known as Riverfront Coliseum, 
some residents backed a ballot initiative that would have moved the 
ballpark to a northeast corner of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, voters supported the Reds' plans by a nearly  
2-to-1 margin, leaving the lease agreement as the final major step 
in getting the construction process rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen has been running the team since June 1996 while Schott  
serves her latest punishments for inflammatory remarks. She agreed 
to leave him in charge rather than face another suspension while 
negotiating to sell the team.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The trade deficit broke a record for the third  
straight month in March as countries struggling to recover from 
economic turmoil continued to unload their products in the United 
States' booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the pace of economic growth in the United States slows  
and the rest of the world picks up, the deficit will continue to 
grow. It is just that simple,'' said David Orr, chief economist 
with First Union Corp., in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The March trade deficit of $19.7 billion was 2.9 percent higher  
than the previous record of $19.1 billion set in February, the 
Commerce Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate  
of $222.6 billion, nearly one-third higher than the all-time high 
of $169.3 billion set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are glimmers of hope for improvement now that some  
countries in Asia and elsewhere have begun a fragile recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports, which had fallen for four straight months, staged  
a small rebound in March, climbing by 0.9 percent to $77.5 billion. 
Exports of farm goods were up 2.5 percent, led by rising sales of 
soybeans and corn. Farmers have been among the hardest hit by the 
loss of markets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a separate report Thursday showed that steel imports fell  
by 14 percent in April, based on preliminary data, a good sign for 
the country's beleaguered steel industry that has been battered by 
cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
	However, eager American shoppers -- continuing to enjoy the  
lowest unemployment in nearly three decades and healthy stock 
market gains -- caused overall imports to rise much faster than 
exports, climbing 1.3 percent to a record $97.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that increase reflected rising oil prices, which jumped  
by nearly $1 dollar a barrel, increasing America's bill for foreign 
crude oil by $213 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a striking example of the impact of cheaper imports on  
American manufacturers, foreign car imports jumped to an all-time 
high of $14.9 billion in March, a 2.5 percent increase. Meanwhile, 
American car makers saw their exports fall by 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has argued that the trade deficit  
reflects American strength. As the only major world economy doing 
well, the United States plays a valuable role by providing a market 
for countries struggling to emerge from deep recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists also note that the influx of low-priced imports  
has helped keep U.S. inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wide trade deficit may cause some to fret, but given the  
labor shortages in this country, let's be glad there is an outlet 
for our demand,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist with Naroff 
Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if the trade deficit gets much worse, Congress may face  
irresistible pressure to erect barriers to protect industries hurt 
by foreign competition. The steel industry has already won a House 
vote to impose global quotas on steel imports into the U.S., 
despite a threatened Clinton veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley on Thursday reiterated the  
administration's warnings to Japan and European nations that the 
United States can't go it alone forever and they must take steps to 
improve their domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	For March, America's overall trade deficit with Japan shot up  
23.2 percent to $6.5 billion as Japanese imports to the United 
States reached an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade deficit with the 15-nation European Union,  
meanwhile, soared 30 percent to $2.6 billion. America's deficit 
with Mexico, one of its partners in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, hit a record $2.5 billion, up 26 percent from the 
previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit with China declined by 10.5 percent in March to $4.1  
billion, but was still the second largest for any nation. China has 
been negotiating an agreement to lower barriers to American goods 
in hopes it will clear the way for its entry into the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	However, NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in  
Yugoslavia and tensions over human rights have threatened any quick 
deal.

<HEADLINE> Students Thought Shots Were a Prank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- For seniors at Heritage High, it was a time  
to revel in their last full day of school before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bell for the first class of the day was still 20 minutes  
away. Students were chatting and laughing in the common area and 
others were eating breakfast in the adjacent cafeteria when a 
sophomore allegedly walked in wielding a .22-caliber rifle and 
began firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just crazy and chaos,'' said Alaina Mitchell, 16,  
hugging her brother who had come to school to pick her up after the 
shooting prompted officials to send students home for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students first thought the loud popping sounds they heard  
were a senior prank. Just a day earlier, a student had released 
2,000 crickets into the school. 
</P>
<P>
	But others feared their suburban school had turned into another  
Columbine High, the Colorado school where 15 died a month ago 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day since then I've been thinking about whether it could  
happen here,'' Chris Scroggs, 15, who recalled watching the 
Colorado school attack unfold on live television in his drama class 
at Heritage. ``Last night I was thinking that this might be the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, small groups of students stood outside  
waiting for rides and trading versions of how the event unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Thomas, 14, said he was standing and talking to friends in  
the common area when he heard what sounded like gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody yelled he's got a rifle and we started running,''  
Thomas said, shaking his head outside the school as police and news 
media helicopters hovered overhead and investigators moved through 
the school and grounds. ``It's hard to believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Janice Pugh, her voice cracking and her eyes red, kept one arm  
wrapped around her son, William, while her other hand gripped up 
balled-up tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	She had waited at home for a while after the first news report,  
hoping for a phone call from her son, then decided she couldn't 
wait any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not knowing what exactly had happened, not knowing what I  
would find, I just prayed that he would be all right,'' she said of 
her only child. ``I'm just happy that he's OK and I pray for the 
others.''

<HEADLINE> Two Plead in Murder of Ala. Gay Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKFORD, Ala. (AP) -- Two men accused of fatally beating an  
acquaintance and burning his body because he was a homosexual 
pleaded innocent today. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Monroe Butler Jr., 21, and Steven Eric Mullins, 25,  
could receive the death penalty if convicted on the capital murder 
charges in the death of 39-year-old Billy Jack Gaither. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are accused of beating Gaither to death with an ax  
handle Feb. 19 and burning his body atop a pile of kerosene-soaked 
tires after luring him from his home with a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said Mullins and Butler confessed to killing  
Gaither because he made a pass at one of them. All three men lived 
in or near Sylacauga, a town of about 12,500 people about 45 miles 
southeast of Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	At today's arraignment, Butler pleaded innocent by reason of  
mental defect or disease. Mullins pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Gaither's family said they want both men put to  
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took my brother's life. Why can't the state take their  
life?'' Randy Gaither said today.

<HEADLINE> Stress, Gulf War Illnesses Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Studies of Gulf War veterans with unexplained  
illnesses suggest stress may be a cause, an independent report 
released by the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific studies reviewed by the Rand Corp., the research  
group based in Santa Monica, Calif., provide no proof of the link 
between stress and the illnesses of thousands of Gulf War veterans, 
the Pentagon said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The review was commissioned by the Pentagon, which has struggled  
in recent years to find an explanation for Gulf War veterans 
suffering neurological and other disorders. Many veterans groups 
have dismissed the possibility that combat stress could account for 
the health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rand concluded that the available scientific literature shows a  
``generally modest'' association between stress exposure and 
veterans' health problems, although the link was more marked in 
people who saw combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rand analysts looked at 15 studies evaluating the relationship  
between American troops' exposure to deployment and combat stresses 
during the 1991 war against Iraq and the later development of 
symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The disorder results 
from a trauma associated with actual or threatened death or serious 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``In sum, the possibility that stress may have either  
contributed to or exacerbated the health problems of some 
(veterans), can neither be ruled out nor proven,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 700,000 men and women served in the war, and an estimated  
2 percent of them have reported symptoms that have eluded 
traditional medical explanation, including chronic fatigue, joint 
pain and memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are convinced their illnesses may be related to exposure to  
toxins or other chemical or environmental factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has been fighting a climate of mistrust regarding  
Gulf War syndrome since the end of the war. Defense officials 
initially played down veterans' complaints and did not fully 
investigate the possibilities of exposure to chemical and 
biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has not ruled out chemical or environmental  
explanations and continues to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of evidence suggesting stress likely plays a  
role,'' said Matt Puglisi, assistant director of the American 
Legion, the nation's largest veterans' group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes total sense,'' Puglisi said in an interview  
Wednesday. ``As a human being, we know that stress isn't good for 
you, and ... the Gulf War, although short, was pretty stressful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puglisi was a Marine Corps artillery officer during the war and  
was stationed in the Gulf region for four months in 1990 and 1991, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Demjanjuk Again Faces Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- John Demjanjuk is again facing the loss of his  
U.S. citizenship and deportation, 22 years after he was first 
accused of being ``Ivan the Terrible,'' the infamous guard who 
operated a gas chamber at the Treblinka death camp during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigation filed a  
civil complaint in federal court Wednesday accusing the retired 
79-year-old Cleveland auto worker of participating ``in the process 
by which thousands of Jews were murdered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the same agency of Nazi-hunters which was criticized by  
a U.S. appellate court for ``reckless'' withholding of evidence 
that might have cleared Demjanjuk years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint drops the charge that Demjanjuk was Ivan the  
Terrible. It instead alleges that he was a guard at the Sobibor 
death camp in Poland and at the Majdanek and Flossenburg 
concentration camps. It also accuses him of serving in the Nazi-run 
Trawniki unit that participated in a campaign to annihilate the 
Jews of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Demjanjuk was first accused of operating the gas  
chamber at Treblinka. His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981, and 
five years later he was extradited to Israel where he was convicted 
and sentenced to die. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the United States in 1993 when evidence indicated  
he was a victim of mistaken identity. Despite overturning his 
conviction in the Ivan the Terrible case, the Israeli Supreme Court 
said it was convinced Demjanjuk had worked for the Nazis during the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	With Wednesday's complaint, the case against Demjanjuk is the  
longest-running attempt by the U.S. government to revoke an alleged 
Nazi's citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	His son-in-law, Ed Nishnic, said the Justice Department was  
unfairly targeting a broke and broken man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a darn shame that a government with a blank-check  
budget can pick out one person with very limited means and 
basically run him into the ground,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk, a native of the Ukraine in the former Soviet Union,  
has denied serving as a guard in any concentration camp. He has 
said he was a Soviet Red Army soldier who spent most of the war in 
a German prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed effort by the Office of Special Investigation won  
praise from Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Demjanjuk worked at a Cleveland auto plant, he built cars  
for a living. When he served at Sobibor, he killed Jews for a 
living'' said Neal Sher, who headed the OSI from 1983 to 1994 and 
is now head of the International Commission on Holocaust Era 
Insurance Claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department will try to have him deported, said  
agency spokesman Myron Marlin. Where Demjanjuk would be sent is 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	If deported, Demjanjuk could choose what country he would go to,  
but that nation would have to accept him. Meanwhile, a country that 
wants to bring a criminal case against Demjanjuk can ask at any 
time for his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Israel would extradite Demjanjuk again, Elan  
Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress in New 
York, said: ``I doubt very much whether it would happen as a matter 
of practical reality because of the wrenching effect of the 
previous extradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit Shemesh declined to  
comment on the case, saying the issue is for U.S. courts to decide.

<HEADLINE> Sandy Alomar To Undergo Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Indians catcher Sandy Alomar will have  
arthroscopic surgery Friday to have two bone chips removed from his 
left knee and will be out for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, who last week said he couldn't remember exactly how many  
knee operations he has had, was placed on the 15-day disabled list 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He had hoped a cortisone injection would get rid of the pain in  
his knee, but it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar's knee was examined Thursday, and it was decided he would  
have the operation. Team physician Dr. Louis Keppler will perform 
the procedure at Lutheran Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	With Alomar sidelined, the bulk of the Indians' catching duties  
will fall to rookie Einar Diaz. In 20 games, Diaz is batting .257 
with two home runs and 10 RBIs. Diaz has made the most of his 
at-bats with 11 of his 19 hits going for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you lose an All Star-caliber player you're  
concerned,'' said Mark Shapiro, the team's assistant general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, one of the strengths of our team thus far, and  
hopefully for the rest of the season, has been our bench. We'll 
look at it as an opportunity to develop Einar further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz will be backed up by Chris Turner, who was recalled from  
Triple-A Buffalo when Alomar went on the DL. Turner started 
Wednesday night's 13-7 win over the White Sox and went 1-for-5 with 
a single. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, 32, was batting .317 with three home runs and 16 RBIs in  
22 games for the Indians, whose 29-10 record is baseball's best. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-time All-Star has been reunited this season on the same  
team with his brother, Roberto, the Indians' starting second 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a storybook season in 1997 in which he set offensive  
career-highs, won MVP honors in the All-Star game at Jacobs Field, 
had a 30-game hitting streak and homered off New York's Mariano 
Rivera in the division series, Alomar was limited to 117 games last 
season because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	He batted just .235 -- his lowest average since 1991 -- during the  
regular season and went 1-for-16 in the ALCS while playing with 
severe back spasms.

<HEADLINE> 'Toledo Bashing' Ruffles Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Sure, calling the minor-league baseball team  
the Mud Hens is a bit demeaning. 
</P>
<P>
	And yes, this is a blue-collar city where coney dogs are the  
most popular items on restaurant menus and people follow bowling as 
a competitive sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But is that reason enough to make Toledo a standard punch line  
for comedians, ad writers and cartoonists? 
</P>
<P>
	A recent outbreak of ``Toledo bashing'' has stirred up this Lake  
Erie city's ire even though most of its 300,000 residents are 
accustomed to being kicked around. The latest shot came in the May 
10 edition of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Political cartoonist Don Asmussen drew a newspaper headline  
reading, ``Smart bombs hit Montenegro as planned, Toledo, Ohio, by 
mistake.'' That was followed by ``President apologizes, says, Hey, 
at least it was Toledo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before that there was a newspaper advertisement for Fannie Mae,  
the federal mortgage company, that said ``Jennifer Cooke's job took 
her to Cincinnati. Her down payment only got her to Toledo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Washington, D.C., lawyer Brendan Sullivan Jr. told a judge  
that ``Toledo, Ohio, is the worst place in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae changed the ad, and Sullivan later apologized.  
</P>
<P>
	It seems the city has long been the tail end of jokes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember watching old movies and the actors would say ``Oh  
no, we gotta play Toledo,'' said the city's favorite son Jamie 
Farr, who made Toledo famous in his role as the cross-dressing Cpl. 
Klinger on the popular television series ``M-A-S-H.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It had the reputation of being a tough town,'' Farr said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	No one tried more to change that image than Farr.  
</P>
<P>
	His love of Tony Packo's Hungarian hot dogs and the Mud Hens  
brought worldwide fame to the city. He still returns every year to 
host the Jamie Farr Classic, a women's pro golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sell me short on the city,'' Farr said from his home  
near Los Angeles. ``Everybody who's ever been there says it's a 
great city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what is it about this blue-collar city between Cleveland and  
Detroit that makes it such an easy target? 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't know,'' Farr said. ``It's just a stigma it  
has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Carty Finkbeiner has a few ideas: ``I think the old  
impression of the city was that we were a withering, dying city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene, a native of suburban  
Columbus and a defender of his home state, advised Toledoans not to 
take the attacks personally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier to take shots at people you don't know,'' he  
said. ``A lot of people have never been to where we're from and 
because of that it's easy to take advantage of the stereotypes.''

<HEADLINE> Ortiz, Nathan Emerging as Fixtures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Russ Ortiz was an aspiring closer. Joe  
Nathan played shortstop most of his life. Both have pulled off 
pitching transitions for the San Francisco Giants with startling 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz, just two years removed from being considered the top  
relieving prospect in San Francisco's farm system, has emerged as a 
top-flight starter. And Nathan, pitching above Double A for the 
first time this season, already has made an overpowering impression 
in the rotation and the bullpen with his 97 mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have been central to San Francisco's solid start,  
figuring in eight of the team's 23 wins. Their success also has 
helped San Francisco withstand an injury to opening day starter 
Mark Gardner and the ongoing struggles of Shawn Estes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, who have played the past month without Barry Bonds,  
began Thursday tied with Arizona for first place in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at them as young pitchers but they're pitching like  
they've been around a long time,'' outfielder Stan Javier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz has gone 5-2 with a 2.53 ERA, both ranking near the top of  
the league. He has won his last four decisions, a career best, and 
the Giants have wins in 11 of his last 14 outings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun for me to see younger guys do well and prove they can  
play up here,'' said Ortiz, who has his first career complete game 
in a 7-2 win over Colorado on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just throwing better pitches and getting my breaking  
pitches over for strikes. Last year, I would throw the fastball and 
not even worry about location.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Ortiz used to throw a  
fastball almost exclusively, which was one of the main reasons he 
mostly worked out of the bullpen in the minor leagues and in 
college at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz split time between the bullpen and rotation and between  
San Francisco and Triple-A Fresno last season but settled into a 
starting role after filling in for the injured Estes much of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	His ability to diversify his pitching style accelerated his  
transition from reliever to starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the biggest factor in his last 5-6 starts is when  
he makes a pitch, he's not overthrowing,'' Perranoski said. ``Right 
now, he's got the hot hand and he's our most consistent pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan, though, rates as an even bigger surprise for the Giants  
than Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
	He began as an infielder in San Francisco's minor league system  
but Giants scouts were dubious about his hitting prospects and 
intrigued by his powerful throwing arm and suggested he switch to 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a tall skinny kid at shortstop but he had a great  
arm,'' Perranoski said. ``We thought he could be a pitcher and as 
it turned out we were right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan agrees now but he wasn't sold on the idea at first,  
leaving the organization and returning to State University of New 
York-Stony Brook for a year to complete his degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding to give baseball one more shot, he rejoined the Giants  
in 1997 and rose to become one of the Giants top pitching 
prospects, nearly making the team out of spring training prior to 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants recalled Nathan after shoulder problems forced  
Gardner on the disabled list and Nathan responded by pitching seven 
scoreless against Florida on April 21 to win his major league 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to think too much about what's happened because I  
don't want to change anything in what I've done to get where I 
am,'' Nathan said. ``Basically, I've just tried to keep things 
simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won his next start against Montreal by allowing two runs in  
eight innings, becoming the first Giants pitcher since Osvaldo 
Fernandez in 1996 to win his first two starts. He just missed 
becoming the first San Francisco pitcher since Juan Marichal in 
1960 to win his first three starts, leaving a May 3 contest at 
Pittsburgh with a 6-4 lead but the Pirates rallied for a 9-8 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, he moved to the bullpen as Gardner returned  
from the disabled list to reclaim his starting spot and setup man 
Julian Tavarez, suffering from pneumonia, went on the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday at Houston, Nathan worked a scoreless 11th inning,  
fanning Jeff Bagwell for the final out, to pick up his first major 
league save. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great because he had never been in that situation  
before at any level and it was a big game for us,'' Javier said. 
``When you have a 97 mph fastball and you throw it past Bagwell, 
that's something.''

<HEADLINE> Social Security Fund Plan Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of lawmakers on Thursday proposed  
raising new money for Social Security by raising taxes through 
reduced inflation adjustments in the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan seeks to strike a compromise between Republican desires  
to replace some Social Security benefits with a new system of 
personal retirement accounts and Democrats' concerns about the 
risks of that proposal to low-income workers and women. 
</P>
<P>
	Income taxes raised from trimming back inflation adjustments  
would help pay for the new programs, including subsidies to boost 
the personal retirements accounts of low earners and new benefits 
for women who left the work force to rear children. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said they hope their plan can help jump-start  
congressional action stalled by political tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is precisely because of the growing skepticism that Social  
Security reform will not happen this year that we are pushing,'' 
said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	Others endorsing the proposal include Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.,  
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., Fred Thompson R-Tenn., Craig Thomas R-Wyo., 
Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Chuck Robb, D-Va., and Reps. James 
Kolbe, R-Ariz., and Charles Stenholm, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists argue that the government's traditional measure  
of changes in the cost of living -- the Consumer Price Index -- 
overstates inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the measure more conservative is one option President  
Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress have said could be part 
of a solution to the cash shortfall Social Security is expected to 
face when baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous proposals have focused on the money that could be saved  
by reducing the yearly cost-of-living raises senior citizens get in 
their retirement checks. The plan introduced Thursday would go 
further by also capturing for Social Security any increases in 
income taxes resulting from a partial restoration of so-called 
``bracket creep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans pay income taxes at different rates based on what  
income level, or bracket, they fall into. People in higher brackets 
pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year the Internal Revenue Service adjusts the income  
brackets to account for inflation. A more conservative measure of 
inflation would tend to widen the higher tax-rate brackets over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the money that would be raised for Social  
Security over the next 75 years if the CPI's measure of inflation 
were trimmed by one-half of 1 percent could be expected to be about 
the same as if there were a 0.78 percent increase in the special 
payroll taxes now used to finance the retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	Outright tax hikes, likely to be unpopular, have been sworn off  
by both political parties as a possible solution to Social 
Security's looming problems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigates N. Korea Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In two steps aimed at penetrating North Korean  
secrecy, a U.S. team began inspecting a suspected nuclear facility 
there Thursday and the White House announced a visit to the country 
by former Defense Secretary William Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department officials confirmed that long-anticipated  
inspections had begun at an underground site U.S. officials believe 
may be part of a North Korean nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials hope Perry will be able to meet with North Korean  
leader Kim Jong Il but have no guarantee of such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	His visit, as an envoy of President Clinton, is part of his  
review of U.S. policy toward North Korea. He has been a special 
adviser to Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on 
relations with North Korea. The United States is a close ally of 
South Korea but has no diplomatic relations with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin on Wednesday expressed  
confidence that the inspections by a 14-member U.S. team would end 
U.S. concerns about activities at the Kumchangni site and its 
purpose. The facility, first detected by satellite last summer, has 
been a major obstacle to a multinational deal aimed at halting 
North Korea's nuclear weapons development. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics of the administration have been pointing  
to Kumchangni as a major example of North Korea's unwillingness to 
cooperate with the rest of the world. U.S. officials still rank the 
peninsula as one of the world's most dangerous trouble spots, 
rating its communist regime as unpredictable. More than 37,000 U.S. 
troops are based in South Korea as a deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Perry would be accompanied by Ambassador  
Wendy R. Sherman, counselor of the State Department, and a small 
team of U.S. officials. They will be in Pyongyang May 25-28 and 
have no plans to meet with the U.S. inspection team, which may 
still be in the country then. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit is intended to assess views of the communist regime  
firsthand, the announcement said. It will be Perry's first 
opportunity to get the views of high-level North Korean officials 
and is part of the review he is expected to complete shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	He is meeting with a range of high-level officials, according to  
a State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
However, the official said he had no list and did not know if the 
contacts would include North Korea's top leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1994 agreement, North Korea agreed to curtail its  
nuclear weapons program in exchange for fuel oil for its 
conventional power plants and international assistance for 
developing new nuclear power generators, mostly from Japan and 
South Korea. Clinton requested $55 million in his budget for fiscal 
2000 for the oil program, up from $35 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department officials expect to hear little from the  
inspection team until its work is finished. With no diplomatic 
mission in Pyongyang, secure communications with the team are 
impossible and any communication is limited. 
</P>
<P>
	No time limit has been set on its inspection activity and  
officials do not expect details of its findings until after the 
inspectors leave the country. Led by Joel Wit, a Korean affairs 
officer at the State Department, the team will return to 
Washington, where officials will evaluate its findings before 
making any statements to Congress or the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they are confident that arrangements made with  
North Korea for the inspection will allow satisfactory access at 
the site in order to get all the information needed.

<HEADLINE> Military Hospital Abortions Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Armed Services Committee voted  
Wednesday to impose new spending restrictions on President 
Clinton's conduct of the military operation in Yugoslavia. 
Democrats denounced the action as the latest in a series of 
conflicting signals by the Republican-led House. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, working on a $288.8 billion defense spending bill for  
the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, endorsed a provision stating 
that none of the funds ``may be used for the conduct of combat or 
peacekeeping operations'' in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic attempt to block it was rejected on a largely  
party-line 31-27 vote. ``That's a heck of a message to send to that 
23-year-old climbing into the cockpit of an F-16 tonight,'' said 
Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., sponsor of the Democratic effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor noted recent conflicting votes by the full House refusing  
to endorse the air campaign but also rejecting efforts to withdraw 
troops or declare war on Yugoslavia. He said the GOP-sponsored 
language would be interpreted as ``pulling the plug'' on U.S. 
forces there. 
</P>
<P>
	But committee Republicans insisted they were just trying to  
reclaim congressional decision-making over the war powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C., said the measure would  
force Clinton to come to Congress first to request funds in a 
separate piece of legislation if he wants to continue the military 
campaign beyond Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's wrong with that?'' Spence asked, saying the Pentagon  
budget was ``already overstretched'' by the conflict in the Balkans 
and other overseas missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the panel voted to tighten restrictions on abortions at  
military hospitals, prohibiting them when a pregnancy results from 
the statutory rape of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law prohibits abortions at military hospitals except to  
save the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 30-29 vote, the committee agreed to modify that restriction  
to apply only to ``forcible'' rapes instead of all rapes. Rep. 
Steve Buyer, R-Ind., the sponsor said it would prevent federal 
facilities and funds from being used when an underage woman becomes 
pregnant after consensual sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also voted 33 to 26 to retain a 3-year-old prohibition  
barring women who are serving in the military overseas from 
obtaining abortions in U.S. military hospitals -- even if they use 
their own money. That reversed a subcommittee's decision to lift 
the restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pressed their accusations that the Clinton  
administration had shortchanged long-term Pentagon needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill goes next to the full House. A Senate version does not  
include the new abortion restrictions nor the language on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill is about $8 billion more than requested by  
President Clinton, as is a similar one approved last week by the 
Senate. It pays for virtually all the programs requested by the 
administration and adds millions of dollars to other ones, 
including a 4.8 percent military pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also authorize the Pentagon to replace the cruise  
missiles it has used in the Kosovo conflict and would seek to speed 
up development of a national missile defense by cutting through 
some bureaucratic paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, however, put aside a proposal that would have also  
exempted the missile defense program from meeting some 
environmental requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, House and Senate leaders reached agreement on the  
language of a measure to make deployment of a system to protect all 
50 states against a limited ballistic missile attack official U.S. 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A final House vote is expected on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had originally threatened a veto, but  
now says it favors the Senate-passed bill because it promotes 
continued negotiations with Moscow to reduce nuclear warheads and 
stresses that missile-defense funds must be reviewed annually by 
Congress. The Senate bill also states that the missile defense be 
deployed ``as soon as technologically possible,'' a phrase not 
included in the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., chief sponsor of the House version,  
said in an interview he was willing to accept the Senate language 
to get the measure to the president quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like it. It gives political cover to the liberals who  
don't support a missile defense,'' Weldon said. But he said he was 
inclined to support it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to wait until next June before deciding  
whether to go ahead with such a system. The Pentagon has already 
spend about $50 billion on research and tests on various 
missile-defense proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Army chief of staff, Gen. Dennis Reimer, told the  
Senate Appropriations Committee that the fiscal 2000 defense budget 
Clinton submitted doesn't go far enough -- but will help meet 
essential needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying that the Army would probably miss its recruitment goals  
this year by as many as 5,000, Reimer said the most important thing 
was ``to be able to give our soldiers a little more pay, fix their 
retirement system. ... We have to make that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the committee chairman, suggested  
that the administration's budget not only shortchanges the 
military, but it complicates the problem with what he said were 
accounting sleights of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``This budget isn't smoke and mirrors, it's just puff,'' Stevens  
said. ``It's a cloud. It isn't even good smoke.''

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Breaks Opening Day Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Stars Wars'' prequel ``The Phantom  
Menace'' grossed a record $28.5 million on its opening day, topping 
the single-day box office mark set in 1997 by ``The Lost World: 
Jurassic Park,'' figures showed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, whose entire title is ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace,'' collected an average of $9,610 at each of the 
2,970 locations, some of which have been playing the movie 
around-the-clock starting at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-hour receipts totaling $28,542,349 beat the one-day  
record of $26.1 million set by ``Lost World'' on a Sunday of 
Memorial Day weekend in 1997, according to box office tracker 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	It also topped ``Lost World's'' opening-day record of $21.6  
million, set on the Friday of that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say ``The Phantom Menace'' should gross $100 million to  
$140 million by the end of its five-day opening frame Sunday, 
setting more records. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is so big that some employers decided to not fight the  
Force and just pay to send their workers to theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to see this movie, and we thought it would be  
fun to send our whole company,'' said Steven J. Lund, president and 
CEO of Provo, Utah-based cosmetics seller Nu Skin Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has reserved a theater for all 1,600 employees and  
one guest each for ``The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those who didn't get ``Star Wars'' tickets as a company  
perk, there were long lines outside the nation's theaters, dozens 
of which scheduled around-the-clock showings to accommodate the 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Fyfe, wearing the brown robe of a Jedi master, was shaking  
and nearly unable to speak after emerging from a 3:30 a.m. 
screening Wednesday at Hollywood's Mann's Chinese Theater, where 
the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to see it again today,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The mainly male, 20-something audience that packed the theater  
for the 12:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. shows raved about George Lucas' 
$115 million prequel to the famed ``Star Wars'' series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so awesome. I think I'm going to hit double digits, and  
see it at least 10 times,'' said Larry Crouse, 24, who also wore a 
Jedi costume. 
</P>
<P>
	In Waite Park, Minn., Mike Kunkel stood in line for more than 12  
hours to get his ticket to the midnight showing. The 19-year-old 
said he and his friend planned to see the movie repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding like a Jedi master, he summed up his philosophy this  
way: ``The first time to see it. The second time to notice things. 
And the third time to know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were fears of mass labor shortages due to ``Star  
Wars,'' companies with big Force fans -- particularly computer and 
electronics firms -- reported no serious problems, due in part to 
lots of understanding from management. 
</P>
<P>
	At River Park Computer Group, a consulting company in San Jose,  
all five so-called ``home and small office gurus'' said they would 
be pulling a Silicon Valley Skywalker Walk-Out during the next day 
or two, said owner Frank Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared for no one to be here,'' he said. ``I'm going  
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And at Electronic Theater Controls in Middleton, Wis., about 500  
employees were told they would be bused to downtown Madison for a 
Friday matinee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't call myself a rabid 'Star Wars' fan but I did see  
the original about a dozen times,'' said company president Fred 
Foster, who also had closed down ETC when the first ``Star Trek'' 
movie opened in 1979. The company makes lighting control systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The main problem was how they would handle the phone lines. When  
the company shut down for ``Star Trek'' it was much smaller and 
simply put the phones on hold. Now, with operations in New York, 
Hollywood, Orlando, Dallas, Copenhagen, Rome, London and Hong Kong, 
that might not work so well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of theater people in our customer base,'' said  
Foster. ``I hope they'll be tolerant of us.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan's Brother Sought by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A brother of presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan is arranging to surrender to police on charges he used a 
gun to threaten occupants of a home owned by a relative of a top 
State Department official, relatives said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brother, Hank Buchanan, 61, has a history of mental illness  
and checked into a hospital earlier this week for treatment, his 
family said. ``This is a terrible setback for Hank and his 
family,'' said Bay Buchanan, his sister and a former U.S. 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from an episode last weekend at the home of  
Cody Shearer, the brother-in-law of Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer reported that an intruder broke into his garage Sunday,  
slashed the tires of his cars and then brandished a handgun at two 
guests in the home who confronted him in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	The intruder then fled the site, but one of the guests obtained  
the license plate of the car he fled in, Shearer's lawyers said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer also reported he had received death threats from  
anonymous callers earlier in the week after a television show aired 
unsubstantiated allegations that Shearer may have been involved in 
threatening presidential accuser Kathleen Willey in January 1998. 
Shearer denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Shearer is concerned about the breakdown in journalistic  
standards that has led to his personal safety being jeopardized,'' 
his lawyers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Police traced the car and on Wednesday contacted Hank Buchanan's  
lawyer to arrange for a surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hank, through me, is fully cooperating with the authorities  
and hopes to resolve this to everyone's satisfaction,'' said a 
brother, Tom Buchanan, who is the lawyer representing him. 
</P>
<P>
	The family said Pat Buchanan, a former Nixon White House aide  
and television commentator who is making his third bid for the GOP 
presidential nomination, has visited his brother since he checked 
into the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Buchanan ran his own accounting firm but has had a history  
of manic depression, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been years. He has had lots of problems. It is a tragic  
situation,'' Bay Buchanan said in an interview from her brother's 
campaign headquarters. ``He had been doing very well and this is a 
terrible setback.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Gun-Show Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Vice President Al Gore casting a  
tie-breaking vote, the Senate today approved a Democratic proposal 
to slap fresh restrictions on gun transactions at gun shows and 
pawn shops. Democrats immediately declared victory over the 
powerful gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you just saw is the NRA losing its grip on the United  
States Senate, at long last,'' declared Senate Democratic leader 
Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a turning point for our country,'' Gore said after the  
vote. ``Finally, this majority is turning the corner and helping to 
protect the children and families of this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called to congratulate Gore for his vote and  
praised the Senate for ``the commonsense approach'' of the 
provision, said spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came a month after a killing spree at a Colorado high  
school and only hours after a second shooting at a high school in 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, which would require mandatory background checks  
for all transactions at gun shows, was tied, 50-50. Gore then cast 
his vote. It was the fourth time in his more than six years as vice 
president that Gore has cast a tie-breaking vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, sponsored by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., also  
would require a mandatory background check for anyone seeking to 
claim his or her own weapon at a pawn shop. In addition, it wiped 
out a Republican proposal that had passed moments earlier that 
Democrats said would open fresh loopholes in the nation's gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg's amendment was defeated in a slightly different form  
last week. He recast it in advance of today's vote, and the changes 
won the support of Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga. The vote came a few 
hours after the outbreak of gunfire at an Atlanta-area high school 
in which six students were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier Republican provision was cleared by 79-21. It would  
have limited instant checks to 24 hours, instead of the current 
three days, one of several changes that Democrats said marked a 
retreat in the GOP's gun control position. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came on legislation to crack down on juvenile  
crime. It was not clear when the bill would come to a final vote, 
or whether it could pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Georgia school shooting, Sen. Charles Schumer,  
D-N.Y., asked, ``How much longer are we going to embrace the gun 
lobby?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the images of the Littleton school shooting last month  
that generated pressure on the Senate to tighten laws governing gun 
sales, particularly at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Six students were injured in the Georgia shooting this morning  
and all were in stable condition, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats renewed their charge that Republicans are resisting  
effective restrictions on gun sales at the behest of the National 
Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they were protecting law-abiding gun owners and  
insisted that law enforcement do more to enforce existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's law enforcement that stops the criminal,'' not more gun  
control laws, said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, an NRA board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans were eager to get the gun control issue  
behind them, at the same time Democrats were declaring victory over 
the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Democratic amendment would remove some of the  
government record keeping and other red tape proposed in connection 
with gun show purchases. But it also would give the government 
three days to conduct a background check -- rather than 24 hours 
proposed by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also want to wait 90 days before expunging background  
check records in cases where the purchases are approved. The GOP 
wants immediate destruction of all records. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun amendments were intended to toughen a sweeping, $5  
billion juvenile crime bill by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that would 
make it harder for kids to get guns and inflict more painful 
punishments on those who use them. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., brought the gun  
control issue to the floor last week to allow lawmakers to stage a 
debate responding to the April 20 massacre in Colorado that left 14 
students and a teacher dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott earlier had threatened to pull the bill if senators didn't  
pare down the list of amendments enough to hold a final vote by 
Tuesday night. But relishing the public relations nightmare that 
the bill had imposed on Republicans, Democrats called Lott's bluff 
and were slow to cut their amendment list. Lott backed down.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 20.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Thursday as lingering concerns about  
high-tech companies sapped the modest gains of a market still 
struggling to find a direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.65 to close at  
10,866.74. The index of blue-chip stocks was higher for much of the 
session, and the decline was concentrated in the final half-hour of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
dipped 5.40 to 1,338.83, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index fell 35.17 to close at 2,542.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have traded in a narrow band for several days as  
investors struggle to determine whether a recent rise in inflation 
will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an 
effort to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Federal Reserve offered fresh evidence Thursday  
that the economy is growing at a steady but not inflationary rate. 
The group reported that manufacturing growth eased slightly in 
April, which calmed an anxious market and set the stage for some 
mild, broad-based gains. 
</P>
<P>
	For a fourth consecutive day, light volume indicated that many  
market players want a clearer picture of the U.S. economy before 
they return to active trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the markets are still paying attention to interest  
rates and to unemployment, said Robert Freedman, chief investment 
officer for the John Hancock Funds in Boston. ``People are still 
wondering whether the inflation scare is really something to worry 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a definitive answer, analysts said investors began  
moving their money from some big-name technology companies that are 
seen as somewhat risky. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer, which disappointed analysts earlier this week  
with a profit report that merely matched expectations, fell again, 
dropping 1 9/16 to 38 1/4 and pulling other computer stocks down with 
it. IBM, one of the Dow stocks, dropped 3 to 232 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks suffered as well. Amazon.com dropped 3 7/8 to 135  
11/16 after the company said it plans to sell $2 billion in stocks 
and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said many investors, in search of security, are  
just moving their money to other sectors. Utility stocks, often 
seen as a safe haven, have mostly risen in recent sessions. 
Investors were also seeking bargains in the long-neglected 
small-capitalization stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer products companies, which are seen as relatively immune  
from the economy's ups and downs, also rose Thursday. Procter &AMP; 
Gamble, a Dow component, rose 1 11/16 to close at 96 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money isn't leaving this market,'' said Larry Wachtel, a  
market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mergers set the stage for some gains Thursday. Healtheon soared  
20 3/8 to 100 5/8 as it announced it will merge with WebMD Inc. to create 
an Internet-based health care services company. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck was among the Dow's biggest advancers, rising 1 1/2 to 72 as  
it nears approval for a new painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Paper and forest products stocks rose after Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter raised earnings estimates for the group. International Paper 
rose 13/16 to 54 13/16, and Georgia Pacific rose 1 9/16 to 91 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was room for at least one successful new issue. EToys  
soared from its initial price of 20 to 76 9/16 in its Nasdaq debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.12 to 639.42. The American Stock  
Exchange composite index rose 3.67 to 792.03, and the Russell 2000 
index of smaller companies rose 1.88 to 448.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 905.9 million shares, 
slightly behind Wednesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume will most likely increase Friday, analysts said, as the  
market faces a ``double witching'' day. Stock and index options are 
both set to expire, which traditionally stimulates volume as 
traders settle their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.45 percent.  
European markets were mostly higher, as Germany's DAX index rose 
0.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.6 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 closed up 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Threats Aside, Schools To Stay Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite another school shooting, districts  
nationwide say they won't let threats or copycat incidents bring an 
early end to the 1998-99 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the districts nor the department want to send the  
message to kids that they can shorten the school year,'' said Greg 
Doyle, spokesman for the Wisconsin Department of Public 
Instruction, which has decided not to grant waivers for districts 
to shorten their 180-day school year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, with just two or three weeks to go for many  
schools, six students were wounded at a high school in Conyers, Ga. 
The incident came one month after the shooting in Littleton, Colo., 
that left 15 dead, including the two assailants. 
</P>
<P>
	Since April 20, rumors and unconfirmed bomb and shooting threats  
have disrupted schools nationwide. Officials frustrated with the 
frequent alarms struggled with ways to cope. While some schools 
dismissed students early on days when there were specific threats 
or anniversary-fueled rumors, they have chosen not to end the 
school year altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an incredibly bad situation for school administrators to  
be in,'' Doyle said. ``Especially since uppermost in all of their 
minds is the safety of the kids. But we've got to educate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first of Wisconsin's 426 school districts were scheduled to  
close the first week in June. But instead of closing, some schools 
have added extra days to make up for time missed from earlier 
threats, Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a district in Allen, Texas -- which received eight  
bomb threats in two weeks -- began limiting its schedule to classes, 
exams and activities necessary for graduation, promotion or to 
otherwise conclude the school year, which ends next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's shooting has not changed the board's decision, said a  
district spokeswoman, Stacey Cheatham. 
</P>
<P>
	Districts are re-evaluating safety policies, said Renee Williams  
of the National School Boards Association, but the association is 
not advising school boards to close schools prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	Dewey Cornell, director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project  
at the University of Virginia, said schools have mainly been 
interested in how to react to threats and to ease student and 
parent anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of  
Teachers, said Thursday that gun control was a better response than 
school closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it's the right thing to do,'' Feldman said of  
school closings. ``This is not school violence. This is violence 
coming from outside of schools. The bottom line is getting guns out 
of the hands of kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after shooting in Conyers, Vice President Al Gore cast a  
tie-breaking vote for Senate approval of a Democratic proposal to 
require mandatory background checks for gun transactions at gun 
shows and pawn shops. Also on Thursday, House leaders agreed to 
begin working on a juvenile crime bill next week.

<HEADLINE> Immunity Sought for WWII Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imposing sanctions against insurance companies  
that are trying to resolve unpaid claims of families of Holocaust 
victims would undermine the work of an international commission, a 
top State Department official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat appealed to all state  
insurance commissioners to give insurance companies immunity from 
lawsuits while an international commission tries to move quickly to 
settle Holocaust claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the commission is the best vehicle for resolving  
Holocaust-era insurance claims because it brings together many of 
the interested parties in a cooperative, nonconfrontational 
process,'' Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was pleased with the decision by the International  
Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims this month in London 
to pay the families of Holocaust victims the real value of their 
life insurance policies to compensate for post World-War II 
currency devaluations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many European Jews bought life or property insurance policies to  
protect their assets in the uncertain days leading up to World War 
II. But thousands of survivors and relatives of those who died 
claim insurers refused to honor policies after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 50,000 to 100,000 Holocaust survivors live in the  
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The international commission, which is headed by former  
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, is expected to meet again 
next month in Jerusalem. It includes representatives of the World 
Jewish Congress, the World Jewish Restitution Organization and 
Israeli and U.S. insurance regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Elan Steinberg of the World Jewish Congress said firms that were  
not working with the commission might be subject to sanctions. 
These include Aegon of the Netherlands and Munich RE of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said five European insurance companies participating  
in the commission have already contributed $90 million toward claim 
resolution and humanitarian issues. The companies are Assicurazioni 
Generali of Italy, Allianz of Germany, AXA of France and Winterthur 
and Zurich of Switzerland. Eizenstat said they estimate their 
market share from the pre-World War II era to be about 30 percent 
of the total. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of these developments, sanctions against companies  
participating in the Eagleburger commission would gravely undermine 
the commission's work to the ultimate disadvantage of Holocaust 
survivors,'' Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said insurance commissioners in California, New York and  
Florida were getting restless and had called him to complain the 
process was not moving fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners could bar insurance companies and their  
U.S.-owned subsidiaries from doing business in their states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be enormously counterproductive'' if this were to  
happen, Eizenstat said. He said litigation to settle claims would 
take years while the commission process promised faster payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat will continue to be the Clinton administration's point  
man on Holocaust issues when he becomes deputy treasury secretary 
in July. He spoke at a news conference to present the 1,146-page 
proceedings of the Washington Conference on Holocaust-era assets 
held last December.

<HEADLINE> Jack Nicklaus Returns at Pro-Am  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVONDALE, Pa. (AP) -- The comeback began with a wave to the crowd  
and then a short, slicing tee shot that landed in the rough. Jack 
Nicklaus laughed it off, caring little about the location of the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, warming up for his first round of competitive golf in  
nearly a year, shot an even-par 72 Thursday in a pro-am round just 
four months after having his left hip replaced. The Golden Bear 
tried to look beyond the windswept treetops and mushroom farms that 
surround the course, dreaming of one final charge that will cap his 
brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play a little bit this fall, just because I want to play  
next year,'' said Nicklaus, who will test his new hip Friday in the 
first round of the Senior PGA Bell Atlantic Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal next year is to try to play the four majors and try to  
be as competitive as I can be. Beyond that point, I'm not saying 
that's going to be the end of my playing major championship golf, 
but it'll probably be the end of my playing all four of them in one 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Nicklaus, eight months shy of his 60th birthday, can see the  
end after all these years. He has to struggle to keep his mind from 
wandering beyond the present. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beyond that, heck, I don't know,'' Nicklaus said. ``I haven't  
even gotten to the first round of the Bell Atlantic yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out of habit, impatience, or a little of both, Nicklaus clutched  
a microphone as if it were a 9-iron while discussing his quick 
comeback from surgery that replaced his deteriorated left hip with 
an experimental ceramic one. He had the operation in January, 
forcing him to miss his first Masters in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	When he tees off Friday, Nicklaus will end a 299-day layoff from  
competitive golf -- his longest since turning professional in 1961. 
He last played in the U.S. Senior Open on July 26, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told him he couldn't return for six months, and Nicklaus  
eagled that estimate, so to speak, beating it by two months. If all 
goes well this weekend at this senior tournament in the 
Philadelphia suburbs, Nicklaus will play the Memorial Tournament on 
the course he designed in Dublin, Ohio, June 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he plans to play in the U.S. Open, U.S. Senior Open and  
Senior Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that I'll go to the British this year,'' Nicklaus  
said. ``That's too many weeks in a row. I might play the PGA 
Championship and I might not. I haven't made up my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus teed off on No. 10 in the pro-am, bogeying the first  
hole, double-bogeying the fifth. He finished with four birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't have my strength yet,'' Nicklaus said. ``I mean,  
I'm not terrible. I surprise myself every once in while and hit one 
pretty good. But I'm 85 percent top form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus' four amateur partners, picked randomly to spend an  
afternoon with one of the greatest golfers who ever lived, tried to 
hide their nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
	The lucky hackers were Frank Pension of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; Charlie  
Parks of Akron, Ohio; Bob Sokol of Long Beach, N.Y.; and Larry 
Sullivan of Baltimore. Pension, a Christopher Lloyd lookalike from 
the ``Back to the Future'' movies, seemed to have the most game. 
Sokol took a carefree approach, walking up to the ball and just 
whacking it like Adam Sandler in ``Happy Gilmour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All right, guys, this is what I say to you,'' Nicklaus told  
them before they teed off. ``We're out to get them today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pension swore he wasn't nervous, then fumbled his sunglasses  
after shaking Nicklaus' hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I swing, I want you to throw my ball as far as  
possible,'' Sokol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing to the crowd and signing autographs, Nicklaus walked  
nearly all of the hilly course. He plans to do the same in the 
tournament, even though carts are legal on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think that I played great, but I played better than  
I've been playing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus made a terrific second shot on the par-3 11th, coaxing  
a short chip 3 feet from the cup before sinking the easy putt for 
par. He has come a long way since first clutching a club in his 
hands after the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Nicklaus, the six-time Masters champion, starting from  
scratch in the weeks after the surgery -- with half swings, 
three-quarter swings and finally full swings that drove the ball 
only 170 yards or so. He joked that he's not even a four-handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get back to a four,'' Nicklaus said. ``I was a  
four when I was about 12 years old and haven't worried about it 
much since then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nicklaus stirred memories of his triumphant, youthful  
days when he became the oldest player to finish in the top 10 at 
the Masters, shooting a final-round, 4-under-par 68 to tie for 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	If his bid for one last shot at the four majors goes as planned,  
he wonders how his mind and body will respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``You find something inside you that will sort of drive you on,  
like at the Masters,'' Nicklaus said. ``I remembered how to finish 
a golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that will come back. I'll remember.''

<HEADLINE> Rock Music Used To Define Psychoses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Call it Rorschach Rock, ink spots for the  
ears. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force psychiatrist is using rock 'n' roll music as a key  
to understanding the symptoms of mental illness, a training aid to 
help technicians understand and remember symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a rock, I am an island. ... I have no need for  
friendship, friendship causes pain,'' sang the recorded voices of 
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel at an American Psychiatric Association 
workshop Thursday, as Henry B. Nelson III discussed schizoid 
diseases that make people want to be loners. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Rolling Stones' ``(Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' to the  
Doors' ``Light My Fire'' and Steppenwolf's ``Born to be Wild,'' 
Nelson had a room of psychiatrists singing along. 
</P>
<P>
	Blame the long winters in Alaska, says Nelson, who began asking  
rock 'n' roll trivia questions at staff meetings while stationed in 
Alaska in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, based in Utah, he finds the music handy in training  
technicians and others to recognize diseases set forth in the 
psychiatrists' DSM-IV, a book listing mental disorders and their 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	While some psychiatrists ask patients to look at inkblots and  
describe them, the traditional Rorschach test, Nelson's thoughts 
turn to music. 
</P>
<P>
	Relationship problems? ``You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling,'' sing  
the Righteous Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokey Robinson's ``Tracks of My Tears'' tells the tale for the  
depressed while those rebounding from the winter blues might relate 
to ``Here Comes the Sun'' by the Beatles or Johnny Nash's ``I Can 
See Clearly Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Buffet's ``Margaritaville'' provides a crash course in  
alcoholism and therapy, Nelson reports. While the first verse 
claims ``it's nobody's fault,'' Nelson notes that by the end, 
Buffet is singing, ``It's my own damn fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simon and Garfunkel's ``Sounds of Silence'' may reflect  
selective mutism, a disease of children in which they refuse to 
speak except in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly the Beatles are singing, ``You say yes, I say no,'' as  
Nelson discusses children who oppose parental direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Fab Four appear regularly in his presentation,  
including the optimistic ``We Can Work It Out'' in the section on 
partner relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Goin' Out of My Head'' by Little Anthony and the Imperials is  
a logical selection in the delirium category, while the same group 
provided ``Hurt so Bad'' for the discussion of pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Light My Fire'' is logical for pyromania, and Neil Diamond's  
``Solitary Man'' for discussions of schizoid disease that cause 
people to be loners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come a Little Bit Closer'' by Jay and the Americans gives a  
glimpse into the world of those with the histrionic disorder that 
causes them to become seductive. For the narcissistic, on the other 
hand, there's ``You're So Vain'' by Carly Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end what it may all come down to is a lyric by Simon,  
``Still Crazy After All These Years.''

<HEADLINE> MTV Gets SonicNet From TCI Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Capitalizing on a hot Internet stock even before  
it has gone public, MTV Networks is trading 10 percent of its 
online music subsidiary for a set of music Web sites and The Box, a 
pay-per-view cable music video channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday with TCI Music, the online  
entertainment company controlled by cable TV veteran John Malone, 
marked the latest effort by MTV to beef up its profile on the 
fractured online music scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is first and foremost an online play for us to bolster  
our position as a music player on the Internet,'' MTV chairman Tom 
Freston said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the 10 percent stake in its online music unit,  
which is expected to go public within the next 12 months, MTV will 
get SonicNet, a leading music news and information site, along with 
several other associated sites including Addicted to Noise and 
Streamland. The sites are mainly aimed at younger listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, MTV will also get The Box, a cable TV  
channel that allows viewers to order music videos in a way similar 
to getting pay-per-view movies. 
</P>
<P>
	For MTV, the deal helps expand the footprint of its online music  
unit, which already include the Web sites for MTV and its sister 
network VH1. Both networks are owned by media conglomerate Viacom 
Inc., which also controls the kids' channel Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of SonicNet was the second transaction for MTV's  
fledgling online music unit following its February purchase, for an 
undisclosed amount, of online broadcaster Imagine Radio, which will 
allow MTV to offer some 100 channels of Internet radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors welcomed the news of MTV's latest online deal, pushing  
up Viacom's stock 62 1/2 cents to close at $41.75 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI Music is positioning itself as an Internet entertainment  
company with its digital music cable channel DMX and other Internet 
properties transferred from its parent company, Malone's Liberty 
Media Group, which has stakes in some 100 cable channels. In order 
to reflect its broadening beyond music and into video 
entertainment, TCI Music is renaming itself Liberty Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Corp. gained ownership of Liberty Media Group as part of  
its purchase of Malone's huge cable TV company TCI. But Liberty 
continues to operate independently with its own tracking stock and 
Malone as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV's parent Viacom also owns the Paramount movie studio, the  
consumer publishing operations of Simon &AMP; Schuster, ``Beverly Hills 
90210'' producer Spelling Entertainment and half of the UPN 
network.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Floor Broker Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four New York Stock Exchange floor brokers and  
the owners of a Wall Street brokerage pleaded guilty Thursday to 
federal criminal charges of making trades for themselves instead of 
their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pleas raised to 13 the number of people, including nine  
floor brokers, who have pleaded guilty to charges in a case in 
which prosecutors for the first time brought charges against those 
who make personal trades on the floor of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor brokers paid a commission to conduct trades for client  
brokerages and their customers are not permitted to make trades for 
themselves or for any account in which they have an interest -- 
their positions on the floor can provide them with immediate access 
to market-moving news, giving them an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a release that Congress  
realized floor brokers had advantages over the general public and 
``sought to achieve a level playing field by prohibiting them from 
profiting from those advantages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These criminal prosecutions reflect our commitment to  
maintaining that level playing field,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Killeen, Thomas William Bock, their company Oakford  
Corp., and four other stockbrokers entered their pleas before U.S. 
Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Manhattan.

<P>
	Killeen, 39, of Colts Neck, N.J., was the president of Oakford,  
a now defunct brokerage firm which opened in 1992. Bock, 46, of 
Garden City was the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Killeen and Bock both admitted engaging in a securities  
conspiracy and evading taxes by kicking back commissions to Oakford 
customers by paying their personal expenses, including beach club 
dues and rent on apartments. They also admitted using company money 
to pay for vacations, car leases and mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	The pleas came a day after Rakoff interrupted Killeen's plea by  
expressing surprise that the government was unable to calculate the 
trading profits among eight floor brokers charged in the case in 
February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers were at first concerned that the inability to  
calculate profits -- a key factor in determining the length of each 
sentence -- might cause their clients to risk stiffer sentences, 
though later became satisfied their clients would not end up worse 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	The pleas resumed this morning as the defendants admitted that  
they set up accounts for floor brokers to execute personal trades 
ahead of orders from their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rakoff told Killeen and Bock that federal guidelines would  
require a sentence of 15 months to 21 months. He set sentencing for 
Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The pleas and the difficulty of calculating trading profits were  
not expected to affect a government probe that continues into as 
many as 64 NYSE brokers, according to a source familiar with the 
government's prosecution who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The floor brokers who pleaded guilty Thursday to unlawfully  
exercising investment discretion by entering into on-floor 
purchases and sales of securities without proper customer orders 
were John Savarese, 40, and Mark Savarese, 37, both of Garden City, 
Edward Mueger, 64, of Port Washington and Thomas Cavallino, 42, of 
Shrewsbury, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the defendants would comment on their pleas.  
</P>
<P>
	Previously, five NYSE floor brokers pleaded guilty to conspiracy  
in the case.

<HEADLINE> Termites Cited As Bus Crash Factor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A bus crashed through a guard rail and  
plunged down an embankment in part because the safety barriers were 
weakened by termites, according to lawyers representing families of 
victims of the Mother's Day crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Custom Charters bus veered off Interstate 610 in New Orleans  
during a gambling trip to a Mississippi casino, killing 22 of the 
43 mostly elderly passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	If the oak posts hadn't been weakened, the bus probably would  
have stayed on the highway, sparing some of the victims, said 
Stephen Rue, who represents relatives of Jewell Williams, a retired 
teacher killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``They crumble to your touch,'' Rue said, sticking a butter  
knife into a post. The hole he made exposed hundreds of squirming 
little bugs. ``This is obviously a contributing factor in the 
tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board did not  
know if investigators had checked the posts. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by Rue names as defendants the charter bus  
company, the driver and Casino Magic in Bay St. Louis, Miss., the 
intended destination of the trip. He would not say if he intended 
to add the state as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the driver's condition has improved enough for  
doctors to remove a ventilator, but he will not immediately talk to 
investigators about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Bedell, 46, was in critical condition for more than a  
week. He was to be interviewed Wednesday by authorities, but his 
lawyer declined to grant permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't believe he's well enough to be interviewed by  
anybody,'' Jay Zainey said. He did not know when Bedell could be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the crash, authorities said they uncovered evidence  
that Bedell had congestive heart disease, had lost two bus-driving 
jobs because he used marijuana, had failed a test for cocaine and 
was undergoing dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 12 hours before the crash, Bedell received treatment in a  
hospital emergency room for dehydration and extremely low blood 
pressure. In addition, tests found traces of marijuana in Bedell's 
blood after the crash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB investigators say Bedell should not have been driving, but  
it is not clear whether his health problems or drug use contributed 
to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say they are looking into reports about a car  
cutting in front of the bus, but don't know whether they are 
credible. Zainey said his client insists it's true.

<HEADLINE> $725M Deal Reached in Vitamin Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two major drug and chemical companies have  
reached an agreement with federal prosecutors to pay a record $725 
million settlement of allegations that they engaged in a worldwide 
conspiracy to raise and fix the prices of vitamins, according to 
lawyers familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	A $725 million settlement would be the largest criminal fine  
ever obtained in any type of federal case in U.S. history, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The total settlement will top the $100 million paid in 1997 by  
Archer Daniels Midland Co., the U.S. agribusiness giant, for its 
role in fixing prices for two food additives, lysine and citric 
acid, according to a Justice Department official who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche Holding AG of Switzerland agreed to pay $500 million, and  
BASF AG of Germany agreed to pay $225 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, antitrust chief Joel I. Klein and  
his criminal enforcement director, Gary Spratling, were to announce 
the deal at a news conference later today. Asked whether the 
department was settling with two vitamin companies, Reno told her 
weekly news conference this morning, ``An announcement should be 
made later this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third company was to be accepted into the leniency program of  
the Justice Department's antitrust division under which prosecution 
can be avoided if the company volunteers evidence of its role in 
price-fixing before prosecutors learn of it through their 
investigations, Justice officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yearlong investigation has looked at whether drug and  
chemicals companies met to fix prices and carve up markets for 
vitamins such as A, B, C and E. The investigation targeted Roche 
Holding, which controls 40 percent of the market, Rhone Poulenc SA 
of France and BASF AG, along with several smaller U.S. and Japanese 
companies, a Wall Street Journal report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies produce the raw ingredients that are sold to  
companies that make vitamins for human or animal use. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen from all three companies said they were cooperating  
with the Justice Department. But they refused to say Wednesday when 
they expected the probe to be completed or a settlement reached. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a Swiss vitamin manufacturer and five U.S. executives  
agreed to plead guilty to participating in a worldwide conspiracy 
to fix the prices of vitamins. The company agreed to pay a $10.5 
million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation, Lonza AG, was charged in previously sealed  
court documents with scheming to fix the prices and allocate the 
sales of vitamin B3, also known as niacin and niacinamide, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five executives were charged with plotting to fix prices and  
allocate customers and sales of vitamin B4, also known as choline 
chloride. 
</P>
<P>
	Both vitamins are used to enrich human and animal nutritional  
products and are sold around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	These were the first cases made public from the antitrust  
division's investigation of the vitamin industry. Both the company 
and the executives agreed to cooperate in the continuing probe, 
which is centered in Dallas, where the charges were filed in U.S. 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cooperation of these defendants, in combination with  
information being provided by others who are cooperating, will 
substantially advance the division's investigation of international 
cartels in the vitamin industry worldwide,'' said Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General Spratling.

<HEADLINE> Discovery Back on NASA Launch Pad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery was back on  
the launch pad today following repairs to its hail-damaged fuel 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery is scheduled to blast off next Thursday with 1 1/2 tons  
of gear for the new international space station. Launch time is a 
little before 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA returned the shuttle to the pad this morning, the same day  
it should have lifted off. The mission was delayed a week by a 
hailstorm that punched 648 holes into the insulating foam on the 
external fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger holes in the insulation were sanded or patched. The  
insulation prevents ice from forming when the tank is filled with 
super-cold fuel. Engineers feared ice forming in the holes could 
break off during liftoff and damage the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven astronauts from three countries are assigned to the 10-day  
mission, the first of the year for NASA's shuttle program.

<HEADLINE> Belo To Sell Stations in 2 States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A Texas company that owns television station  
KHNL has hired a firm to help it sell the station as well as one in 
Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of Dallas-based A.H. Belo Corp. said Wednesday the  
stations were not part of its core media holdings in Texas, the 
Pacific Northwest and the Mid-Atlantic region. 
</P>
<P>
	No buyers have stepped forward, KHNL general manager John Fink  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	KHNL also handles programming for local station KFVE; Fink said  
there were no changes planned in day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo purchased KHNL in 1996 and spent several million dollars to  
create a news division for the station, an NBC affiliate. The 
station remains near the bottom of the local television news 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo also is looking to sell KASA-TV in Albuquerque, and had  
hired ING Baring Furman Selz LLC to find a buyer.

<HEADLINE> MTI Gets SonicNet From TCI Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest move to build up its presence in  
cyberspace, MTV Networks is acquiring several music Web sites from 
TCI Music, the online entertainment company controlled by cable 
magnate John Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal announced today, MTV will get SonicNet, a  
leading music news and information site on the Internet, along with 
several other associated sites including Addicted to Noise and 
Streamland. The sites are mainly aimed atcollege-aged listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, TCI Music will get a 10 percent stake in MTV's online  
music subsidiary, which is expected to go public within the next 12 
months. TCI Music is also handing over The Box, a pay-per-view 
cable channel for music videos. 
</P>
<P>
	For MTV, the deal helps expand the footprint of its online music  
unit, which already include the Web sites for MTV and its sister 
network VH1. The subsidiary, which was formed earlier this year, is 
also developing several other online music projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is first and foremost an online play for us to bolster  
our position as a music player on the Internet,'' MTV chairman Tom 
Freston said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of SonicNet was the second transaction for MTV's  
fledgling online unit following its February purchase, for an 
undisclosed amount, of online broadcaster Imagine Radio, which will 
allow MTV to offer some 100 channels of Internet radio. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI Music is positioning itself as an Internet entertainment  
company with its digital music cable channel DMX and other Internet 
properties transferred from its parent company, Malone's Liberty 
Media Group, which has stakes in some 100 cable channels. In order 
to reflect its broadening beyond music and into video 
entertainment, TCI Music is renaming itself Liberty Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV is owned by Viacom Inc., a media conglomerate that also owns  
the Paramount movie studio, the consumer publishing operations of 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, ``Melrose Place'' producer Spelling Entertainment 
and half of the UPN network. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Corp. gained ownership of Liberty Media Group as part of  
its purchase of Malone's leading cable TV company TCI. But Liberty 
continues to operate independently with its own tracking stock and 
Malone as its chairman.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Tells `E.T.' Motivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steven Spielberg says his 1982 hit ``E.T.: The  
Extraterrestrial'' is about divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmaker said in the latest issue of Life magazine that the  
movie about a boy seeking friendship and trust in the otherworldly 
was a message to his own father, Arnold. Spielberg's parents 
divorced when he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a distance between us,'' the director said of his  
father. ``And when my father remarried, it separated us even 
further. ... I wanted my father to remarry my mother and he 
didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``E.T.,'' he said, was ``a manifestation of my feelings about my  
mom and dad. The whole movie is really about divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg's own divorce from Amy Irving and marriage to Kate  
Capshaw changed his bitter feelings about his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look. You're 16, 17 years old, blaming your parents for  
something that you know very little about,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Allianz Plans NYSE Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- With profits expected to rise at least 10  
percent this year, insurance giant Allianz said today that it is 
weighing acquisitions in the United States and Britain to boost its 
presence in those markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz, Europe's biggest insurer, reported group premium income  
rose 26 percent to $17 billion in the first quarter, at the high 
end of analyst forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on those developments, Allianz said it expects group  
premium income to rise as much as 8 percent to $53 billion this 
year. Profits should improve by at least 10 percent, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz posted net premium income of $50 billion in 1998, up 20  
percent on the year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the company's annual earnings news conference, chairman  
Henning Schulte-Noelle said Allianz planned to expand its business 
in financial services as well as health and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz also is weighing acquisition opportunities in the United  
States and Britain -- markets in which it's underrepresented, 
Schulte-Noelle said, adding the firm is also eager to acquire 
insurers in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz, which is still in the process of consolidating  
Assurances Generales de France SA, acquired in 1997, announced two 
more purchases in the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the group's U.S. life insurance subsidiary  
fully acquired Life USA Holding Inc., in which it had a 23-percent 
stake. It also said earlier this month it plans to acquire South 
Korea's fourth-largest insurer, First Life, subject to regulatory 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Allianz also reiterated it intended to list its shares in New  
York as soon as possible, most likely next year.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Accused of Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Five black vacationers who went to Daytona  
Beach for its Black College Reunion have sued their hotel, claiming 
they were singled out as security risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday, alleges the Adam's Mark Hotel made  
black guests wear orange wristbands and used security guards to 
intimidate them during the annual spring break weekend last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also alleges the hotel gave black guests rooms without  
phone service and basic housekeeping. Pictures were stripped from 
hotel room walls, and minibars were kept locked, according to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is yet another wake-up call to white America and white  
folks who don't think discrimination happens,'' said John Relman, 
an attorney for the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights 
and Urban Affairs, one of the groups representing the hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs -- mostly professionals in their 20s-- also claimed  
they were overcharged for rooms, refused valet parking, and were 
limited in the number of people they could have visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel officials declined to comment on the lawsuit but said they  
had always supported Black College Reunion and maintain a racially 
diverse workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adam's Mark Hotels have a corporate-wide commitment to  
diversity not simply because we believe it's the right thing to do, 
but because it makes good business sense,'' the hotel said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> Utah Won't Relax Liquor Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Legislative leaders aren't willing to make  
even minor changes to Utah's strict liquor laws to please 
foreigners at the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The state gave its blessing to the Olympic bid on the condition  
it wouldn't have to bend its alcohol rules, said Senate President 
Lane Beattie, R-West Bountiful, and House Speaker Marty Stephens, 
R-Farr West. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we're going by the commitment that was  
made,'' Beattie said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Stephens: ``I'm not a big proponent of making changes to  
our liquor laws to accommodate the international community. We have 
a society here we are proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee Wednesday asked Salt Lake  
organizers to seek permission for unfettered alcohol sales at the 
main press center, which will be set up at the Salt Palace 
convention center downtown for some 9,000 members of the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, Olympic officials said they had some kind of variance  
in mind, not a repeal of alcohol restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no attempt to change the laws and we are not  
lobbying to change the laws,'' said Mitt Romney, president of the 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee. ``We'll just have to see how the 
laws apply to the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, who heads up IOC's Olympic coordination commission,  
said ``we just want to be good guests and apply by the laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the Utah Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission  
is considering a new banquet license that sponsors say could 
authorize full beverage service for events at the dry Salt Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission scheduled a public hearing for 10:30 a.m. Friday  
on the new uniform license sought by Utah's restaurants, lodges and 
convention centers, including Snowbird Resort. The ABC isn't 
expected to immediately take a position and can only recommend a 
change to the full state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Cap Ferry, a lobbyist for restaurants and lodges, said the Salt  
Palace could use the banquet license to set up a private bar for 
two weeks for Olympic reporters and technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, convention centers can serve alcohol only with  
a special permit good for 72 hours and can get only two of the 
permits each year, ABC licensing attorney Earl Dorius said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferry said some organizations need as many as seven permits, all  
with their own terms and conditions, to sponsor private events 
where alcohol is served. A single banquet license would streamline 
the process and impose one set of rules the ABC could more easily 
enforce, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation authorizing a banquet license went nowhere in the  
legislature earlier this year during the 1999 session. But the 
legislature typically waits for an ABC recommendation before 
changing licensing procedures, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House speaker said he found the IOC request odd.  
</P>
<P>
	``When Salt Lake was bidding for the Games, all of our  
competitors used what they call our strange alcohol laws against us 
before the IOC as a negative,'' Stephens said. ``So everybody knew 
what our liquor laws were before the IOC voted to have the Games 
here in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beattie said Salt Lake bid organizers assured the state and  
legislators that ``we would not have to change our liquor laws'' 
for the duration of 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Beattie said he thinks that ``people who sell or serve alcohol''  
are behind the IOC request.

<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A radio station fired a disc jockey  
after he suggested to a child caller that he take a rifle to school 
and shoot people. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Payer, known on the air as Rob-O, was fired Wednesday from  
WEMX after the station was flooded with telephone calls complaining 
about what he said on the air earlier that day, said Peter 
Moncrieffe, president of Citywide Communications, which owns the 
radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just thought it wasn't a responsible thing to do,''  
Moncrieffe said, recalling the school shooting last month at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	During the morning show, Payer took a call from a fourth-grader  
who had been thrown out of school for cursing, Moncrieffe said. 
Payer suggested that the child take an automatic rifle to school 
and shoot people, Moncrieffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later during the same telephone conversation, Payer made another  
remark about shooting people, Moncrieffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payer is not considered a shock jock. The station plays hip-hop  
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Payer did not immediately return a telephone message left at his  
home today.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Juneau Looking for Memories / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Joe Juneau is working on a few more  
memorable moments as he tries to help the Buffalo Sabres win the 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Sabres prepare for Game 1 of their Eastern Conference  
final against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sunday, Juneau recalled a 
chat he had a few years back with buddy Patrick Roy, the Colorado 
goalie getting ready to lead the Avalanche against Dallas in the 
Western Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it was not to win the Cup ... the more fun he had was  
actually during the time -- the good times he had getting there,'' 
Juneau said of Roy, who has played for three Stanley Cup winners. 
``and it's just the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau stored away a few highlights last season, when he made it  
to the Stanley Cup finals with the Washington Capitals. One was an 
overtime goal in Game 6 that gave the Capitals the Eastern 
Conference title, and ended the season for his current team. 
</P>
<P>
	The center was dealt to Buffalo in March and has nine points --  
two goals, seven assists -- in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we didn't win in Washington, but it was such a  
great time just getting there,'' he said. ``Those two months of 
just great things happening all the time. So far, things have been 
great this year as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a philosophy shared by coach Lindy Ruff, who encourages his  
team to appreciate its accomplishments while working hard to 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the requirements. You've got to have fun,'' Ruff  
said after Thursday's practice. ``It's work hard, have fun and 
enjoy it. We want them to enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the players know the difference between work and play,  
captain Michael Peca says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ruff gives us the days off to do whatever we want, whether its  
play some golf or something like that,'' he said, ``but the day 
before the series starts, it's back to business and focus on our 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, looking for their first Stanley Cup, play the first  
two games of the best-of-7 series at Toronto, which hasn't won the 
Cup since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	In five regular-season meetings, Buffalo won the first three and  
Toronto the next two.

	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- Officials in charge of this growing  
sanctuary for Albanian refugees have converted barracks classrooms 
into prayer rooms and brought in Muslim clerics. They have also 
bought 1,000 copies of the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer rooms are used five times a day by refugees who  
practice Islam. The jumma, an hour-long community prayer service 
that marks their weekly Sabbath, takes place on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army chaplains and civilian clerics say such observances  
are especially important for the disenfranchised Albanians because 
of what they have endured. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Eric Wester, an Army chaplain, observed: ``... because  
everything else has been stripped away, their faith becomes a 
cornerstone for renewing and rebuilding their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each dormitory in the refugee village has two prayer rooms, one  
for women and one for men. In each, a picture of a mosque is 
mounted on an East wall, the direction of Mecca and the birthplace 
of Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
	During the jumma, a black-robed cleric from Staten Island, N.Y.,  
stood in front of the congregation praying in Arabic. ``God is 
compassionate, God is merciful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kneeling or sitting on prayer rugs, the refugees listened  
intently, occasionally bowing their heads to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly capable of providing bedding, good meals and  
medical care,'' Wester said. ``But the biggest challenge will be to 
try to make meaning out of what they've experienced and to move 
into the future with a sense of hope and direction.'' 
</P>

 *Jewish activist opposes sainthood for pope    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A leading Jewish activist says Pope Pius XII  
should never become a Catholic saint because the notion 
``desecrates the memory of the Holocaust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center said Pius ``sat  
on the throne of St. Peter in stony silence, without ever lifting a 
finger, as each day thousands of Jews from all over Europe were 
sent to the gas chambers, with his full knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Pius historians maintain that the pope felt public protest  
would have worsened things for Jews and Catholics alike and also 
hoped to be in a position to mediate peace between the Allies and 
the Nazi regime. 
</P>
<P>
	During an address on the state of world Jewry, Hier said ``the  
Vatican adamantly refuses to open its files on this period.'' If it 
agreed, he said, the files ``would prove conclusively that Pius XII 
knew all about the 'Final Solution'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rabbi acknowledged that Pius helped the Jews of Rome in late  
1943 and 1944, and that his efforts won praise from Jewish leaders 
of the day. But he said by then Pius knew Hitler would lose the 
war. ``In the critical years, when millions could have been spared, 
he preferred silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wiesenthal Center, based in Los Angeles, does research on  
Jewish rights and the Holocaust.

 *U.S. Muslims ask action on Turkey    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Council on American-Islamic Relations has  
asked the State Department to back religious freedom for Muslims in 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The council's executive director, Nihad Awad, in writing to  
Robert A. Seiple, the ambassador for international religious 
freedom, said his group had defended the right of Muslim women in 
America to wear religious headgear and said Turkey should do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	Awad said Turkish Muslim women ``are routinely harassed,  
discriminated against and denied access to an education or 
government offices simply for choosing to practice their faith by 
wearing a scarf.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 *Episcopal parish leaves diocese    	
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A small Episcopal parish has voted to leave  
the diocese in a dispute between the conservative congregation and 
the denomination's liberal leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the moment, we will be essentially independent,'' the Rev.  
David Ousley, rector at the Church of St. James the Less, said. 
``Our goal is to be faithful to classical Anglicanism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ousley said the overwhelming vote came after years of growing  
tension and soul-searching at the North Philadelphia congregation. 
Nonetheless, Pennsylvania Bishop Charles E. Bennison Jr. said the 
vote came as a surprise. He said he has asked to meet with 
parishioners to try for a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute stems from a decision at a 1997 general convention  
of the Episcopal Church USA in which four conservative dioceses 
were ordered to ordain and hire women as priests. It also endorsed 
ordaining noncelebate gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	About a half-dozen parishes in the United States have seceded  
from the Episcopal Church in the past decade, said William 
Franklin, the dean of the Berkeley Divinity School at Yale 
University. Most joined the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>

 *Hispanic priests on the increase    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A survey of men to be ordained as U.S.  
Catholic priests this year shows 25 percent are from minority 
groups and nearly 20 percent were born outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was commissioned by the U.S. bishops' committee on  
vocations. It was directed by Dean Hoge of the Catholic University 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that 10 percent are Hispanic, a higher  
proportion than in the past, but below the 25 percent to 30 percent 
of U.S. Catholics who are Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Black-American ordinands account for 2 percent of the total,  
compared with 3 percent to 4 percent of American Catholics who are 
black. On the other hand, 9 percent are Asian or Pacific Islanders, 
well above those ethnic groups that are Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 46 percent of the ordinands are 35 or older, 3 percent have  
law degrees and 1 percent are physicians; 63 percent attended 
Catholic elementary schools, well above the average for U.S. 
Catholics.

<HEADLINE> StarKist Reviving Charlie the Tuna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, Ky. (AP) -- Charlie the Tuna is making a comeback.  
</P>
<P>
	StarKist Seafood plans to return Charlie to television screens  
on Monday. It will be the character's first appearance in a 
national advertising campaign in nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The animated fish will appear in an ad for StarKist's Solid  
White Albacore tuna. He urges a courtroom jury of ``consumers'' to 
judge for themselves the quality of the product. The ``jury'' 
retires to deliberate and munch tuna sandwiches, then returns to 
court to ask for more evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are to run in as many as 15 television markets  
nationwide, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tuna category has shown significant growth in the albacore  
segment and other premium items,'' said Joe Clancy, group vice 
president of sales and marketing. ``StarKist is building on that 
growth with a new and improved Solid White Albacore. There is no 
better way to capture attention and build loyalty for this new, 
improved product than by using our strongest, most beloved 
spokesperson, Charlie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie the Tuna has appeared in 85 commercials and guest  
appearances for StarKist since his creation in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	StarKist Seafood is a unit of Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co.

<HEADLINE> Iverson To Play Desperate Early  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The scripts for Indiana's two playoff  
victories over Philadelphia have been nearly identical. 
</P>
<P>
	It goes like this: The 76ers' fall behind by early double  
figures, then rally late before succumbing to the Pacers' playoff 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson thinks it's time for a rewrite. His new storyline  
-- previewed Thursday -- is for the 76ers to play with abandon as 
soon as the clock starts ticking and race past the slower Pacers 
all the way to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for us to play like we're down in the beginning  
of the game,'' Iverson said Thursday after the team concluded 
practice for Game 3 of its Eastern Conference semifinal series. 
``We're waiting till we get 13, 14, 15 points down, and then we 
start playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the Pacers warned. They know they could be headed east  
with the series tied at 1-1 after missing six free throws in the 
final 67 seconds and running into trouble against the Sixers' 
full-court press late in their 85-82 victory in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't given up, if anything they probably feel good  
about what they've done, and they should,'' said forward Chris 
Mullin, 2-of-9 from the field for eight points Wednesday night. 
``We don't feel like we've played great. We feel we've played well 
enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put themselves in a position where they could have stolen  
two games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the two-game deficit, the young Sixers seemed loose and  
restless during a 45-minute practice session Thursday. Matt Geiger 
ribbed a teammate over 3-point attempts that banged off the rim 
while Rick Mahorn gave bear hugs to Iverson as the franchise guard 
cried out in mock pain. 
</P>
<P>
	And as reporters and photographers jockeyed for position to  
offer questions at ``The Answer,'' Iverson cooly sank down in a 
chair and nibbled on white grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure, Iverson said, is not a word in his vocabulary.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like there's pressure in basketball. Why not be  
loose? They still have to win two games,'' said Iverson, the NBA's 
regular-season scoring champion who has averaged 28.5 points in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But to avoid another early letdown, the Sixers will need a  
better shooting performance from their flashy guard. After scoring 
35 in Game 1, Iverson was held to 7-of-28 for 23 points by an 
Indian team that played him more physically. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't stop him with one guy,'' said Pacers guard Mark  
Jackson. ``He's a great, great basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he's shooting good, you don't give the defense credit. No  
one guy is going to stop him, you just try to contain him and make 
him work for everything. Fortunately, he missed some shots last 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's something Sixers coach Larry Brown hopes will happen  
Friday for the Pacers' Rik Smits, whose used his outside shooting 
to score 25 points in Game 2, after totaling 34 in Indiana's four 
previous playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a tremendous long-range shooter,'' Brown said. ``t we  
didn't trap very well, and that enabled Mark to find Rik. And when 
we did trap, it was late, so we have to adjust to that a little 
bit. If you give them enough open looks, he can hurt you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pacers guard Reggie Miller is sure his playoff-savvy team will  
adjust to whatever the Sixers -- and their success-starved fans -- 
throw at them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we did what we had to do by holding serve here at  
home, now we get to go on the road with an 'us-against-the-world 
attitude,''' Miller said. '' We had only one playoff game in 
Milwaukee, and we were fortunate to clinch there. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, this is different circumstances against a very different,  
and talented young team. ``There ain't no way we're going to sweep 
Philadelphia, they're too good.''

<HEADLINE> Wounds Linger in '98 Ore. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ore. (AP) -- Teresa Miltonberger's bangs cover the  
scar from the bullet that pierced the side of her head. She no 
longer has to wear a hockey helmet when she leaves the house, and 
she's back at school every day. 
</P>
<P>
	But life is hardly back to normal. She still has a bullet lodged  
in her brain. And the friends she sat with in the cafeteria exactly 
a year ago don't come around anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want to look at me,'' said the redheaded  
17-year-old. ``Because then the whole thing comes back for them. 
They look at me and they relive the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On May 21, 1998, Teresa was eating breakfast in the cafeteria at  
Thurston High School when 15-year-old Kip Kinkel allegedly pulled a 
rifle from his trench coat and opened fire. Two students were 
killed and 22 others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa was the most seriously wounded. She was not expected to  
be among the survivors. In addition to the bullet that went into 
her skull, another grazed the back of her head and a third drove 
into her thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	She lay comatose in the hospital, her head so horribly swollen  
that her mother had to examine her hands and feet to recognize her. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, word spread around town that Teresa had died. Her  
father, though, had just been with his daughter in the hospital, 
and when he heard the story, he knew it wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of rehabilitation, Teresa is back, a smiling young  
woman in a Winnie the Pooh sweatshirt, though she sometimes has 
trouble expressing her thoughts, and for reasons she can't 
understand her voice sometimes takes on a harsh, biting tone. 
</P>
<P>
	As for memories of the shooting, she has none. The bullet in her  
brain saw to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a miracle, but I made it,'' she said. ``I'm glad I'm  
stubborn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa and other survivors of what has become just one in a  
string of school shootings are stubbornly working to regain what 
they lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Betina Lynn, 19, counts herself lucky that the bullet that  
caught her in the back missed her spine by half an inch before 
coming to rest permanently in her body. ``Most of us still have the 
bullets inside us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Betina said that when classes resumed at Thurston a week after  
the shooting, she felt pressure from others who weren't shot to 
sweep the painful memories under the rug. But she couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all the scars and stuff to look at every day,'' she  
said. ``It wasn't something we could just block out like they 
could, or tried to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the first semester, Betina gave up on Thurston, though it  
meant giving up the only two things she liked about school, playing 
violin in the orchestra and learning Spanish. Now she attends 
another school. 
</P>
<P>
	Betina has been flying around the nation promoting gun-control  
legislation. She and her mother even joined Hillary Rodham Clinton 
at the White House for a Mother's Day pledge against gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so awful and it's so forever,'' Betina said. ``It's not  
like the movies. The hero doesn't get up and get the shooter and 
save the girl. You sit there and you bleed and you cry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her hope was that the recent shootings at Columbine High School  
in Littleton, Colo., costing 15 lives this time, would shock people 
into action. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are waking up to the fact that this is a real  
problem that isn't going away,'' she said. ``It's not a one-time 
thing, not a big-town thing, not a West Coast thing. It's a big 
thing everybody needs to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More reminders are set to come in September, when Kinkel goes on  
trial on charges he murdered his parents in their home and then 
drove the next day to school and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel's 22-year-old sister, Kristen, was in school in Hawaii at  
the time of the slayings, but has returned to Springfield and still 
lives part-time in the home where her parents bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a day has gone by that I have not thought of the other  
victims and their families, and share their sorrow, their pain, 
their grief and their loss,'' she said in a statement Monday. ``We 
must turn the horror of last May into something helpful. Our 
feelings must be turned into positive energy to continue the 
healing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When school started last fall, Teresa was back with her  
classmates, though she had to wear the hockey helmet to protect the 
spot where an L-shaped piece of her skull almost as big as her hand 
had been cut out to allow room for her brain to swell. The piece of 
skull was replaced last December. 
</P>
<P>
	She overcame her initial fears of returning to the cafeteria.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the school that did it,'' she said. ``It was someone  
in the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has a new circle of friends, spends more time at home, and  
is closer to her mother than she was before the shooting. Though 
she was not religious before the shooting, she now feels God spared 
her for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not supposed to go up there yet,'' she said, casting her  
eyes upward. ``Sometime I'm going to do something for Him.''

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Breaks Opening Day Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The new ``Stars Wars'' movie made $28.5  
million on its opening day, shattering the box-office record set in 
1997 by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened at 2,970  
locations, some of which have been playing the movie 
round-the-clock since 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-hour receipts totaling $28,542,349 beat the one-day  
record of $26.1 million set by ``Lost World'' on a Sunday of 
Memorial Day weekend in 1997, box office tracker Exhibitor 
Relations Co. reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' also topped the ``Lost World'' opening-day  
record of $21.6 million, set on the Friday of that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ``Phantom Menace'' should gross $100 million to  
$140 million by the end of its five-day opening Sunday, setting 
more records. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is so big that some employers decided to not fight the  
Force and just pay to send their workers to theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to see this movie, and we thought it would be  
fun to send our whole company,'' said Steven J. Lund, president and 
chief executive of Provo, Utah-based cosmetics seller Nu Skin 
Enterprises, which reserved a theater for all 1,600 employees and 
one guest each.

<HEADLINE> Internet Health Companies May Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A $5 billion merger is in the works between two  
fledgling Internet companies that aim to bring doctors, patients, 
insurers and drug makers together to offer a diverse array of 
Web-based health care services. 
</P>
<P>
	Healtheon Corp. and WebMD Inc. said Wednesday they are  
negotiating a merger, but the dealmaking doesn't stop with these 
two relative unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement is reached, Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and the  
Web directory company Excite are reportedly considering investments 
in the new company, an endorsement by leading technology concerns 
that will give the new venture a significant boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet has for several years been a primary source of  
information for consumers about illnesses, drugs and treatments. 
Patients frequently log on to the Web to do research or chat with 
others who may offer advice and consolation. 
</P>
<P>
	While health sites have proliferated, few large corporate  
players have been able to turn this intense interest into a viable 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Health care is 15 percent of the economy, and yet the amount  
of electronic commerce, or content or revenue generated from health 
care on the Internet is minuscule,'' said Alec Ellison, a managing 
director for Broadview International, an investment banking firm. 
``So it should be a huge opportunity, the question is when?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors and industry players think the answer is now.  
</P>
<P>
	A merger between Healtheon and WebMD would be the third health  
care deal this week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, CVS Corp., the nation's second-largest pharmacy  
chain, said it would buy Soma.com, and online drug retailer, for 
$30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, Synetic Inc., a competitor to Healtheon, agreed to pay  
$1.3 billion in stock for Medical Manager Corp., the largest maker 
of software for physician practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Clara, Calif.-based Healtheon operates a Web service that  
provides consumers and health-care providers an easy way to monitor 
insurance claims and get referrals. Doctors also can use the system 
to order supplies and check lab results. 
</P>
<P>
	Healtheon was co-founded by James H. Clark and W. Michael Long.  
Clark, now chairman, was the former co-founder of Netscape Inc., 
the Internet browser pioneer that was acquired by America Online 
Inc. Long, now chief executive officer, came from a unit of 
Computer Sciences Corp., a computer firm that helps companies cut 
costs by contracting out computer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Healtheon's shares, which were sold to the public in February at  
$8 each, soared $24.37 1/2, or 44 percent, Wednesday to $80.25 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	WebMD, based in Atlanta, offers extensive medical information,  
drug prescriptions and other services to both doctors and 
consumers. The company was started by Jeffrey Arnold, who is 29 
years old. WebMD is privately held, and was expected to go public 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most other Web businesses, the two companies have yet to  
make a profit and are banking on the rapid growth of Internet use 
for their future. 
</P>
<P>
	WebMD had a loss of $7.8 million on sales of just $75,000 for  
the first nine months of 1998. Healtheon lost $54 million last year 
on sales of $48.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits, however, are not as important as being first, analyst  
Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about being positioned to be No. 1 when the market  
takes off,'' he explained.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin Price-Fixing Probe Wraps Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal prosecutors are reportedly in settlement  
talks with several major drug companies over allegations that they 
conspired to fix wholesale vitamin prices across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	A report Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous  
sources who said a settlement could be announced within days that 
could involve huge criminal fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-long investigation has looked at whether drug and  
chemicals companies met to fix prices and carve up markets for 
vitamins such as A,B, C and E. The investigation targeted Roche 
Holding AG of Switzerland, which controls 40 percent of the market, 
Rhone Poulenc SA of France and BASF AG of Germany, along with 
several smaller U.S. and Japanese companies, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies produce the raw ingredients that are sold to  
companies that make vitamins for human or animal use. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen from all three companies said they were cooperating  
with the U.S. Justice Department. But they refused to say Wednesday 
when they expected the probe to be completed or a settlement 
reached.

<HEADLINE> Lab-Designed Corn May Harm Insects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Research that found pollen from a genetically engineered strain  
of corn can kill monarch butterflies has sparked concern over 
whether the crop is harming other insects -- and doing damage to the 
food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The strain is called Bt corn and has been touted by the industry  
as a way to fight a major pest without using chemicals. It 
accounted for more than 25 percent of the 80 million acres of corn 
planted in the United States in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufactured by agricultural giants Novartis AG, Pioneer Hi-Bred  
International Inc. and Monsanto Co., it is laboratory-designed to 
produce a natural pesticide that kills the corn-destroying European 
corn borer. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers led by Cornell University entomologist John Losey  
found that monarch caterpillars eating milkweed leaves dusted with 
pollen from the altered corn ate less, grew more slowly and died 
more quickly. After four days, 44 percent of them had died vs. none 
of the caterpillars that didn't feed on the pollen, according to 
the study published in today's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Monarchs are not an endangered species. But environmentalists  
fear that more damage may be going on if the corn is killing the 
orange-and-black butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disturbing,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, whose  
Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends is pushing for a 
moratorium on genetically engineered crops until their environment 
effects can be more thoroughly studied. ``It's a smoking gun. This 
now is a red flag everyone is going to have to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losey, however, said that while he thinks the crop's harm to  
other insects deserves more research, studies have shown that the 
corn does not harm humans or other mammals. He added: ``I still 
think the proven benefits of Bt corn outweigh the potential 
risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto spokesman Randy Krotz said the finding is not very  
important. Many monarch butterflies would not be exposed to the 
toxic pollen, he said, since most milkweed does not grow near corn 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis said today that further study is needed to determine  
any real threat to monarch butterflies and other species. ``We know 
-- and the most stringent review processes from government agencies 
around the world confirm -- our products are safe for humans, 
animals and non-target insects,'' said a Novartis statement. 
</P>
<P>
	And Val Giddings, vice president for the Biotechnology Industry  
Organization, said: ``Whatever the threat to monarch butterflies 
that is posed by Bt corn pollen, we know it's less than the threat 
of drifting pesticide sprays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials said they were not surprised by the finding,  
because the larvae of monarch butterflies are similar to the corn 
borer. They also called the study sloppy because the researchers 
didn't precisely measure the amount of pollen ladled onto the 
milkweed leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 years, biotech laboratories have been altering the  
genetics of vegetables to make them taste better or resistant to 
pests, raising fears among environmentalists of ``Frankenstein 
foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time scientists found possible unintended  
consequences of genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	A Swiss study last year showed an indirect effect of Bt corn on  
the food chain: Insects called lacewings died more quickly if they 
fed on corn borers reared on Bt corn. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Chicago study published in September found that  
a weed altered by scientists to resist an herbicide developed a far 
greater ability to pollinate other plants and pass on its traits. 
The findings raised fears that genetic engineering could lead to 
the rise of ``superweeds'' impervious to weedkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Scotland, a toxicologist who added insect-resistant genes and  
proteins to potatoes and fed them to rats reported that the animals 
suffered damaged immune systems, growth problems and shrunken 
brains. But his findings were sharply disputed by other scientists.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Doobie Mulls Run For House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former lead guitarist of the Doobie  
Brothers is thinking about takin' it to the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff ``Skunk'' Baxter has retained a campaign consultant for a  
potential run next year against Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still deciding whether to run, but from my perspective,  
it looks like a great opportunity for him,'' said the consultant, 
Dale Neugebauer. ``He has natural appeal. The rock star image plays 
to the younger voters, and he was in a band that is very familiar 
to baby boomers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter is a Republican who supports the National Rifle  
Association and the ballistic missile defense system. Neugebauer 
said Baxter would run as a moderate, promoting his support for 
abortion rights, and could be attractive to Hispanic voters because 
he speaks Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter, 50, is a college dropout who favors a black beret,  
droopy mustache and jeans. He has jammed at GOP gatherings with 
Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to throw his beret in the ring,'' Rohrabacher said.  
``He is trying to reach out to a variety of voters that Republicans 
have traditionally ignored.''

<HEADLINE> Students Thought Shots Were a Prank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- For seniors at Heritage High, it was a time  
to revel in their last full day of school before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bell for the first class of the day was still 20 minutes  
away. Students were chatting and laughing in the common area and 
others were eating breakfast in the adjacent cafeteria when a 
sophomore allegedly walked in wielding a .22-caliber rifle and 
began firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just crazy and chaos,'' said Alaina Mitchell, 16,  
hugging her brother who had come to school to pick her up after the 
shooting prompted officials to send students home for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students first thought the loud popping sounds they heard  
were a senior prank. Just a day earlier, a student had released 
2,000 crickets into the school. 
</P>
<P>
	But others feared their suburban school had turned into another  
Columbine High, the Colorado school where 15 died a month ago 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day since then I've been thinking about whether it could  
happen here,'' Chris Scroggs, 15, who recalled watching the 
Colorado school attack unfold on live television in his drama class 
at Heritage. ``Last night I was thinking that this might be the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, small groups of students stood outside  
waiting for rides and trading versions of how the event unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Thomas, 14, said he was standing and talking to friends in  
the common area when he heard what sounded like gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody yelled he's got a rifle and we started running,''  
Thomas said, shaking his head outside the school as police and news 
media helicopters hovered overhead and investigators moved through 
the school and grounds. ``It's hard to believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Janice Pugh, her voice cracking and her eyes red, kept one arm  
wrapped around her son, William, while her other hand gripped up 
balled-up tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	She had waited at home for a while after the first news report,  
hoping for a phone call from her son, then decided she couldn't 
wait any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not knowing what exactly had happened, not knowing what I  
would find, I just prayed that he would be all right,'' she said of 
her only child. ``I'm just happy that he's OK and I pray for the 
others.''

<HEADLINE>  Annan Calls for U.N. Role in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Encircled by cheering refugees, U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday that the United Nations 
should play a key role in resolving the Kosovo crisis and 
resettling hundreds of thousands of displaced people. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan arrived by helicopter in this dusty frontier town and  
toured refugee camps on the edge of Kukes, temporary home to 
100,000 refugees from Kosovo, the largest single concentration of 
the nearly 800,000 people who have fled the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all doing our best to get them home before the  
winter,'' Annan said. ``I hope we succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has been largely sidelined in diplomatic  
efforts to settle the conflict between NATO and Yugoslavia, but 
Annan said there was a growing consensus that the world body would 
have to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the parties engaged in this conflict have agreed that the  
(U.N.) Security Council should play a central role and that a 
Security Council resolution would be necessary for us to move 
forward,'' Annan said at a brief news conference inside one of the 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is important is that we get the Yugoslav soldiers and  
paramilitias and police to withdraw, (that) we are able to put in 
an international military force that will secure and protect the 
refugees when they go back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan and his wife, Nane, visited one camp hospital and spoke  
briefly with a woman who had been shot in the foot as she was 
fleeing from Kosovo. The woman was also caring for her 
seven-week-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan said the conditions in the camps appeared ``reasonably  
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, aid groups have had trouble persuading the refugees to  
move further south into Albania, away from the unstable border 
region. Kukes is only 15 miles from the border, and more than half 
the refugees coming out of Kosovo have passed through here. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees want to remain close to the border in hopes that  
they will be able to return soon. But their presence is straining 
the limited resources of Kukes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukes authorities have threatened to turn off the water if the  
refugees don't start leaving soon. Water consumption has tripled 
since the Kosovo Albanians began arriving almost two months ago, 
and the town could run dry in two to three weeks, officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees were  
trying to negotiate a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few dozen Kosovo refugees have crossed the Albanian  
border in the past week, while the number of departures from Kukes 
has been running at around 2,000 a day. Aid groups say they have 
the capacity to move out around 5,000 refugees a day, but will not 
force them to leave.

<HEADLINE> Bertelsmann, Microsoft May Make Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUETERSLOH, Germany (AP) -- Bertelsmann is considering a joint  
bid with Microsoft Corp. for part of the cable television network 
owned by the German phone company Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Middelhoff, Bertelsmann's chairman, said in a speech that  
the German media group was ``in talks'' with Microsoft about a 
joint bid, according to a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company was willing to comment directly on the  
discussions, but a spokesman for Microsoft said all three ``are 
part of a circle which meets regularly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Deutsche Telekom said a recent roadshow to  
present the cable network to potential buyers led to ``an 
exceedingly pleasing response,'' though he wouldn't say how many 
parties want to bid for the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom said at the start of the year it would split its  
17-million-subscriber network into nine regional companies, 
possibly maintaining a stake in some. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported that Bertelsman and  
Microsoft were prepared to offer up to $5.6 billion for the cable 
network, just above the $5 billion that rival bidder Deutsche Bank 
is believed to be willing to pay. 
</P>

include the publisher Random House, Bertelsmann Music Group and 
half of barnesandnoble.com.

<HEADLINE> A Nervous Flood Watch in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTRAL CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Instead of going to school, the 180  
students at Central City High School spent hours under the sun 
filling sandbags and stacking them around flood-threatened homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, it was a nice day. I could get a tan, and I could help my  
town at the same time,'' senior Christine Ciha said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her classmates helped fill some 20,000 sandbags as the  
Wapsipinicon River threatened the town of 1,000 people with its 
worst flooding since 1968. About 30 families were evacuated Tuesday 
evening and Wednesday while others nervously watched the river lap 
at their doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depending on how high the river gets, my kitchen may be under  
water,'' said Lori Kuchera, who waited anxiously for the river to 
crest. ``You live by a river, it's inevitable. You just have to 
roll with the punches -- or ride with the tide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violent storms struck Iowa on Sunday, killing two people in the  
western half of the state before dumping heavy rain and hail 
elsewhere. The crest of the swollen Wapsipinicon isn't expected 
until later this week in Central City, some 135 miles east of Des 
Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Wednesday, the river breached a sandbag dike and swept  
into tiny Troy Mills, chasing 12 families from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were kicking the crap out of the river, but the  
dike started leaking in so many places and we ran out of 
sandbags,'' said Joel Peyton, a sophomore at Coggon North Linn High 
School. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> St. James Gets Another Try at Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- After a struggle to find sponsorship, Lyn  
St. James now has the backing she hopes will make her latest 
Indianapolis 500 effort a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	St. James recently was hired to drive for Team Pelfrey as Robby  
Unser's teammate, but did not have a major sponsor until Garden 
Fresh potatoes and the Kroger grocery chain came on board 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But St. James -- one of only two women ever to drive in the  
Memorial Day weekend classic -- knows financial backing is only part 
of the equation if she is to race May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal ultimately is to have my best-ever Indy,'' she said .  
``But my expectation is first to make the field. I've learned that 
is not a given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her first practice session Wednesday, she made 33 laps on the  
2 1/2-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway Oval, topping out at 214.408 
mph. That's not fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Stewart had the day's fast lap at 226.683 mph, followed by  
Greg Ray at 226.086, Arie Luyendyk at 225.096, Kenny Brack at 
224.411, Stephan Gregoire at 224.193, Unser at 224.042 and rookie 
Robby McGehee at 224.025. 
</P>
<P>
	A few others didn't do nearly as well, in fact not even as well  
as St. James. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Dave Steele crashed in the first turn and was treated at  
Methodist Hospital for a mild concussion and back strain before 
being released. Tyce Carlson and Mark Dismore also hit the wall in 
separate crashes, but were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	St. James has persevered in a sport where women remain a  
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still perceived as a male-dominated sport,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But things are getting better.  
</P>
<P>
	Until 1971, women were not even allowed in the pits at Indy. In  
1976, Arlene Hiss became the first woman granted a competition 
license by the U.S. Auto Club, and in 1977 Janet Guthrie became the 
first to drive at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Before St. James arrived in 1992, the only other woman to enter  
and attempt to qualify at Indy was Desire Wilson in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	St. James was the Indy rookie of the year in 1992, when she  
finished 11th. In five other starts, her best finish was 13th in 
1997 with Hemelgarn Racing. She entered her own car last year, but 
did not qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	St. James and Unser, the son of three-time Indy winner Bobby  
Unser, are driving Dallara-Aurora cars for Team Pelfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been in a Dallara before, but not in a few years, so  
this will be a new experience a bit,'' St. James said. 
</P>
<P>
	She knows she must find speed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of work to do,'' St. James said. ``It's a very  
competitive field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched how the numbers have gone, and there are a lot of  
cars going fast and going very close. A couple of tenths (of a 
second) make a huge difference here.''

<HEADLINE> Tribe Is Hitting on All Cylinders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- While in Chicago, several Cleveland Indians  
attended a taping of the ``Jerry Springer Show.'' It was the only 
time in three days they were outhit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland did more than just sweep three games from the White  
Sox. Baseball's top hitting club thoroughly dismantled Chicago's 
young pitching staff, scoring 13 runs in each game to extend an 
offensive assault on AL pitchers this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Indians came into Comiskey Park, the White Sox led  
the AL with a 3.86 ERA. Three games, 39 runs and 48 hits later, 
Chicago's ERA had swelled to 4.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, Cleveland's lineup is scarier than Darth Maul.  
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are out of control,'' said Charles Nagy, the latest  
Indians pitcher to benefit from Cleveland's offensive firepower. 
``All you can do is sit back and watch them hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And hit, and hit. Since opening day, the Indians have swung  
right through some shaky starting pitching, suspensions and 
injuries. They're batting .310 as a team, scoring runs at a record 
pace and showing no signs of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at their numbers,'' White Sox pitcher Jim Parque said  
after getting rocked Wednesday. ``Everyone is batting above .300. 
The ones who aren't are hitting .299.9.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite, but Parque isn't far off. The Indians are at the top  
of nearly every team offensive category in the AL. They also are 
well represented among the individual leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering Thursday's games, Roberto Alomar, Kenny Lofton and  
Manny Ramirez ranked 1-2-3 in runs scored, while Ramirez led the 
majors in RBIs and was tied for the AL lead in hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians are averaging 7.4 runs per game -- 8.6 per game in  
May -- and have scored 10 runs or more in a game 10 times. Since a 
20-11 win over Tampa Bay May 7 when they scored 18 runs in their 
final three at-bats, the Indians have scored 10 runs or more in 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not just how many runs the Indians are scoring, it's  
how quickly. The Indians outscored the White Sox 19-7 in the first 
two innings of the series with Chicago getting six of those runs in 
the first inning of the opener only to lose 13-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to ride this thing as long as we can,'' said  
David Justice, batting .440 with seven homers and 25 RBIs in his 
last 12 games. ``It's a very humbling game. There will be times 
when we don't score like this, but right now we're riding it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bit of bad news did emerge from the 5-1 road trip to Detroit  
and Chicago. Catcher Sandy Alomar will undergo arthroscopic surgery 
to repair two bone chips in his left knee Friday, and will miss 
4-to-5 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar's absence will place the burden of handling the Indians'  
staff on rookie Einar Diaz, who will be backed up by recently 
promoted Chris Turner. Cleveland also has veteran Pat Borders at 
Triple-A Buffalo if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Of concern to the rest of the AL is this fact: Cleveland's  
starting pitching appears to be straightening out. Dwight Gooden's 
seven scoreless innings Tuesday night were followed by eight strong 
innings from Nagy on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Cleveland's starters have only one complete game and a  
combined 5.13 ERA, a stat which gets glossed over by a lineup that 
has scored at least five runs in 17 of its last 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every morning I wake up and say, `Thank God I'm on this team,'  
'' Nagy said.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Company Recalls Mascara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH ARLINGTON, N.J. (AP) -- A company issued a worldwide recall  
of nearly 30,000 tubes of mascara that may contain bacteria that 
could be dangerous to users who already have other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said A.M. Cosmetics of North Arlington is  
recalling Wet 'n Wild Megalash Mascara distributed about five 
months ago. The recall applies to Lot Nos. 161298 and 171298. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the mascara may  
contain the bacterium Burkholderia cepacia, which can be fatal to 
people suffering from cystic fibrosis or weakened immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they believe the bacteria entered the  
mascara through contaminated water used in the manufacturing 
process in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The mascara was tested before it was shipped for sale, A.M.  
Cosmetics vice president Ron Bowen said. A second backup test 
revealed the contamination. Most of the mascara was recalled before 
it was sold, but some has reached the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took the safest possible route,'' Bowen said.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very small amount of product,'' Bowen said. ``The  
population at risk is a very small one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No infections caused by mascara use have been reported, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gandhi Party Expels Three Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's Congress party expelled three  
politicians Thursday whose questioning over foreign-born Sonia 
Gandhi's right to become prime minister prompted her to quit as 
party president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that could cause a rift in the country's once-dominant  
party, Congress' highest decision-making body forced the three 
factional leaders out of the party for six years, spokesman Pranab 
Mukherjee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the prerogative of people to decide who will be prime  
minister,'' Mukherjee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi resigned as president of the Congress party Monday  
after the three suggested amending the constitution to allow only 
native-born Indian citizens to become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, who was born in Italy but has taken Indian  
citizenship, had been expected to be Congress' choice for prime 
minister if the party prevailed in parliamentary elections set for 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi inherited the mantle of India's foremost political  
dynasty from her assassinated husband. Her mother-in-law was Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi, who was also assassinated. Indira's father 
was India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the expelled politicians, Sharad Pawar, said he was  
relieved by the expulsion decision. ``I'll decide my strategy after 
speaking with others,'' he told reporters in the western city of 
Pune. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bombay, capital of the western state of Maharashtra that is  
Pawar's stronghold, his supporters said at least 80 percent of 
Congress party legislators in the state would quit Congress to join 
Pawar. 
</P>
<P>
	``A split is inevitable. We will form another party,'' said  
Chaggan Bhujbal, a Congress legislator and Pawar supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions of Pawar, Purno Sangma and Tariq Anwar apparently  
did not have the support of all members of the decision-making 
Congress Working Committee. Mukherjee said the decision was made by 
a majority of the members, but he refused to say it was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	Disciplinary action will be taken against party members who  
supported Pawar and the other dissidents, party officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since her abrupt resignation, Mrs. Gandhi has retreated from  
public view and canceled appointments, including a planned 
pilgrimage Friday to the site in southern India where her husband, 
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated eight years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	She has also resisted repeated entreaties by party bosses and  
rank-and-file supporters to retract her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has decided, to hell with everybody. Now she is citizen  
Sonia,'' said Rajiv Desai, a family friend and former media adviser 
to Rajiv Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, the avenue facing Mrs. Gandhi's high-security mansion  
has been clogged with hundreds of supporters beating drums and 
shouting slogans, pleading with her to reconsider. One woman doused 
herself in oil and tried to burn herself Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds gathered again Thursday, and belted out pro-Gandhi  
songs. ``Bring back Sonia! Save the nation!'' the protesters 
chanted in Hindi rhyme.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Europe Clash Over Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The United States remains committed to  
imposing retaliatory tariffs on European Union goods because of the 
EU's refusal to accept hormone-treated North American beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement from both sides came after two hours of  
discussions here today. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and his European  
Union counterpart, Franz Fischler of Austria, stood side-by-side 
afterward to emphasize that even if America retaliates as 
threatened, it wouldn't amount to a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-nine percent of the trade between the United States and  
Europe is unaffected by this dispute,'' Glickman said, Fischler 
nodding in agreement beside him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a frank and open discussion, but Dan Glickman and I  
didn't negotiate,'' Fischler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is threatening to impose $202 million in  
tariffs on EU exports June 3 in retaliation for the EU's rejection 
of a World Trade Organization decision requiring the 15-nation 
union to begin accepting hormone-treated beef, which Canada also 
wishes to export to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has ruled three times that the EU has not produced  
enough evidence to satisfy international trade rules allowing 
states to ban items on public health grounds. Fischler insists 
EU-instigated research indicates hormone-treated beef is unsafe and 
that more thorough studies need to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman and Fischler said they had agreed to step up phone  
discussions between their chief civil servants and scientific 
advisers, though no date had been established for further top-level 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether he thought the United States would accept  
compensation payments from the EU while the beef ban remained, 
Fischler said: ``It's not the right moment to make speculations 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said he had received no specific compensation proposal  
from Fischler. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischler emphasized his desire to avoid a lengthy public  
argument between Europe and the United States on this issue. Such 
bickering would likely lower consumers' confidence in beef products 
generally, he said, ``and this can't be in anybody's interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, the pair sparred politely on stage as the  
star attractions at the World Meat Congress, a meeting of 600 
international meat industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischler rejected Glickman's proposal that U.S. beef sold in  
Europe could be clearly labeled hormone-treated or hormone-free. 
That, he said, would amount to giving consumers the choice 
``between dangerous or risky meat and safe meat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when asked if he thought Americans were putting their health  
at risk by eating domestic beef, he said: ``Yes, absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman's chief science adviser, Dr. Ifi Siddiqui, said the  
latest EU scientific claims looked like ``nothing new,'' compared 
to previous material already rejected by WTO panels. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU does accept up to 11,500 tons of hormone-free U.S. beef  
annually. Fischler has previously suggested that raising this 
figure could form part of a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Disaster Losses Higher Than Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shortsighted development policies have  
increased the nation's vulnerability to major natural disasters 
rather than lessening it, a new report warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are responsible for the losses in future disasters. It is  
not God. It is not nature. Because we make the decisions on what to 
put in harm's way,'' said Dennis S. Mileti, a University of 
Colorado sociologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a fundamental flaw in the way our nation and culture  
have tried to solve the problem of natural disasters. It is based 
on the fantasy that technology can make us safe,'' said Mileti, who 
headed a panel of 132 experts who spent five years studying how the 
United States copes with disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Disasters over the past 20 years have cost the United States  
more than $500 billion and the toll is rising, due to an 
increasingly complex society and more people moving to 
disaster-prone areas, according to the report ``Disasters by 
Design: A Reassessment of Natural Hazards in the United States,'' 
released Wednesday by the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, attempts to head off disasters made some worse, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example the chain of dams and levees built along the  
Mississippi River was able to contain most floods. But the system 
was not designed to work together, so in the great floods of 1993 
some levees trapped water after breaking and made the damage worse, 
Mileti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation needs to take responsibility for containing disasters  
by designing systems that can handle the greatest events -- or by 
understanding the potential damage and being prepared to accept the 
loss when it happens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	All development and the people involved should be made aware of  
the risk of disaster so they can make their own decisions on what 
needs to be done and whether they want to take the risk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has managed to reduce deaths and injuries from  
hurricanes over the past two decades. Casualties from floods, the 
nation's most frequent and injurious natural hazard, have failed to 
decline substantially. Deaths from lightning and tornadoes have 
remained constant, Mileti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says that while disasters often are predictable,  
research has shown people ``plan only for the immediate future, 
overestimate their ability to cope when disaster strikes and rely 
heavily on emergency relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The experts recommend preparing for possible disasters, making  
long-term plans, including limiting where development can occur, 
and involving the whole community in preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	The study warns that there is no ultimate solution to hazards  
``since technology cannot make the world safe from all the forces 
of nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report observes that 80 percent of natural disasters involve  
weather and climate -- drought, flood, dust storms, cold, fog, hail, 
heat, ice, sleet, snow, hurricanes, tornadoes and wind. 
Earthquakes, landslides, tsunami and volcanoes make up another 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1975 and 1994 the states at highest risk for disasters  
were California, Florida and Texas, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
	At medium risk were Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois,  
Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, 
North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining states were listed as low risk.  
</P>
<P>
	The $750,000 study was financed by the National Science  
Foundation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Geological 
Survey, U.S. Forest Service and Environmental Protection Agency.

Yugoslavia and other items that Congress sent to President Clinton 
on Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
	--Attack on Yugoslavia, general defense: $12 billion. To  
Clinton's $6 billion request, adds $2.3 billion for spare parts, 
maintenance and training; $1.8 billion for improved military 
benefits; $475 million for projects at military bases. Includes

million in U.S. food aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--Natural disasters: $1 billion, mostly for Central American  
countries hit by last fall's Hurricane Mitch and for Hurricane 
Georges, which walloped Caribbean nations, Florida and Mississippi. 
An additional $900 million is for damage from recent Midwestern 
tornadoes and disasters that may occur in coming months.

<HEADLINE> 1928 Gold Medal Winner Schwartz Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Elizabeth Robinson Schwartz, the first woman to  
win an Olympic gold medal in track, is dead at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schwartz, who in 1928 won the gold medal in 100-meter dash  
in a then-world-record 12.2 seconds, died Tuesday in Colorado. She 
was suffering from cancer and Alzheimer's disease, according to her 
son, Rick. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of the Chicago suburb of Riverdale, Schwartz also won a  
gold in the 400-meter relay during the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz began her track and field career at Thornton High  
School in suburban Harvey, Ill. Her biology teacher at the time was 
on a commuter train when he saw her running to catch the train. 
</P>
<P>
	Astounded at the girl's speed, he suggested that they start  
training together, Rick Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100-meter Olympic race in Amsterdam was Schwartz's fourth  
competitive race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember standing in the middle of the field after the  
race and seeing the American flag raised and hearing the `Star 
Spangled Banner' and all the people singing it,'' she said in a 
1988 interview. ``Then I walked off the field and just kind of 
enjoyed the feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz's track and field career nearly ended in 1931 when she  
was seriously injured in a plane crash south of Chicago. Doctors 
said she wouldn't live, then they said she wouldn't walk, according 
to her son. She began training again shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was no longer able to crouch down for the sprint  
position. So she began running relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz retired from track shortly after the 1936 Olympics. She  
married Richard Schwartz in 1939, and often traveled the country 
speaking on behalf of the Women's Athletic Association and the 
Girls' Athletic Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz also is survived by a daughter and three grandchildren.  
Services will be private.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Duke star Elton Brand has signed with David  
Falk, adding another big name to the agent's clientele. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who helped lead the Blue Devils to a 37-2 record and a

sophomore and is certain to be one of the top picks in the NBA 
draft on June 30.

	Falk also signed Obinna Ekezie, a 6-10 senior center from  
Maryland, the agent's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the consensus national college player of the year,  
averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He's the first star player in this year's draft to sign with  
Falk, who also represents Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Alonzo

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Breaks Opening Day Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The new ``Stars Wars'' movie made $28.5  
million on its opening day, shattering the box-office record set in 
1997 by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened at 2,970  
locations, some of which have been playing the movie 
round-the-clock since 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-hour receipts totaling $28,542,349 beat the one-day  
record of $26.1 million set by ``Lost World'' on a Sunday of 
Memorial Day weekend in 1997, box office tracker Exhibitor 
Relations Co. reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' also topped the ``Lost World'' opening-day  
record of $21.6 million, set on the Friday of that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ``Phantom Menace'' should gross $100 million to  
$140 million by the end of its five-day opening Sunday, setting 
more records. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is so big that some employers decided to not fight the  
Force and just pay to send their workers to theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to see this movie, and we thought it would be  
fun to send our whole company,'' said Steven J. Lund, president and 
chief executive of Provo, Utah-based cosmetics seller Nu Skin 
Enterprises, which reserved a theater for all 1,600 employees and 
one guest each.

<HEADLINE> Fox Adds Eight New Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox is betting on some proven performers for its  
new fall schedule: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Chris Carter and David E. 
Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	The network will premiere a condensed version of Kelley's  
creation, ``Ally McBeal,'' a spinoff series with ``Party of Five'' 
star Hewitt and a drama about a virtual reality game gone awry from 
Carter, the man behind ``The X-Files.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, struggling UPN on Thursday cemented its effort to  
appeal to young men by sinking its ``Love Boat'' remake and adding 
a two-hour weekly World Wrestling Federation show to its fall 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN and Fox were the last of the seven broadcast networks to  
unveil their fall schedules to advertisers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is the fourth-rated network, but near the top among young  
people. It returns three dramas to its schedule -- ``Party of 
Five,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' -- but there's 
a strong possibility this is the final season for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for the next generation of programming, Fox included  
five dramas among the eight new shows that will join its fall 
lineup. One is ``Time of Your Life,'' which moves Hewitt's 
character to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is behind the dark action series, ``Harsh Realm.'' Fox  
also returns ``Cops'' and ``America's Most Wanted'' on Saturday 
nights and premieres a gritty drama about a 19-year-old policeman, 
``Ryan Caulfield,'' at a time when there's a concern about media 
depiction of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sensitive issue and we'll be keeping our eye on it, no  
question about it,'' Fox entertainment president Doug Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesdays, Fox will run a half-hour ``Ally McBeal'' edition  
fashioned from outtakes and material from the show's first two 
seasons. It's an intriguing new programming concept that appeals to 
network executives' search for cheaper shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Herzog promised this winter to cut back on Fox's reality shows.  
He left ``Guinness Book of World Records'' and ``World's Funniest'' 
off the schedule. Most of the reality shows air as specials, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox canceled ``Millennium'' and left the animated comedy, ``The  
PJs,'' off the schedule, although it will return as a sub series. 
``Melrose Place'' has retired. ``Party of Five'' is moving to 
Tuesdays, and the cartoons ``King of the Hill'' and ``Futurama'' 
will be shifted to Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-rated UPN has taken note of pro wrestling's hold on the  
cable TV audience and asked the World Wrestling Federation to 
produce a broadcast version. ``WWF Smackdown!'' will air at 8 p.m. 
Thursdays and will be tamer than the cable shows, UPN president 
Dean Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will probably be toned down a bit in terms of language and  
the upraised finger -- you'll see a lot less of it,'' Valentine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN will spin off its most popular sitcom, ``Moesha,'' with the  
comedy, ``Mo'Nique,'' and shift its comedies that appeal to a black 
audience to Mondays. Its five new series also include ``The Grown 
Ups,'' starring former ``Family Matters'' actor Jaleel White. 
</P>
<P>
	Its other new series are ``Shasta McNasty,'' a modern-day  
version of the Monkees, and the spy drama, ``Secret Agent Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Love Boat,'' the network is canceling  
``Clueless,'' ``The Sentinel'' and ``Between Brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's other new programs include:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Get Real,'' a family drama about a couple and their three  
high school-aged children. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Manchester Prep,'' a drama about a prep school student from  
New York City who moves in with his father's new family, setting up 
a rivalry with his stepsister. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Action,'' a comedy starring Jay Mohr and Illeana Douglas that  
is a satirical look at Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Malcolm in the Middle,'' a family comedy about a 9-year-old  
genius.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Police Find Body in Cooler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) -- For months, residents of Dr. Elaine  
Witterschein's fashionable brownstone complained of a stench that 
made their building unlivable. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said they frequently saw the podiatrist carrying jugs  
of cleanser, bleach and towels into her apartment, and she once 
sprayed so much air freshener in the hallways that she set off 
smoke alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until Monday that the cause of the odor was found: a  
corpse stuffed in a cooler in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are using dental records to make a positive  
identification, but believe the handcuffed, decaying body is that 
of Mary Ann Witterschein, Dr. Witterschein's sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman had been hit on the head with a blunt object and  
strangled, and had been dead for at least six months, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Witterschein has been in an alcohol or drug  
rehabilitation facility in Bushkill, Pa., for several weeks, but 
has hired lawyers and won't allow authorities to question her, said 
Assistant Hudson County Prosecutor Terrence Hull. 
</P>
<P>
	A roommate of Elaine Witterschein pulled the cooler out of the  
doctor's basement storage closet on Saturday, Hull said. A 
paramedic who is friends with the roommate opened the cooler, 
pulled aside a black garbage bag and saw an arm sticking out, Hull 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Witterschein was arrested last week for writing bad checks,  
and had several phony identification cards with her, including one 
belonging to Mrs. Witterschein, Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Witterschein, who was in her 40s, apparently had not been  
reported missing. Authorities were looking for relatives; Hull said 
she once lived in Pennsylvania but didn't have a current address. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Edward Witterschein -- the doctor's brother -- was a  
25-year police veteran who died last year at age 49, shortly after 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the building near downtown Jersey City said they  
had threatened to withhold rent if their landlord didn't do 
something about the unbearable odor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beyond real bad. It was indescribable,'' said Yusef  
Vialet, who has lived on the top floor of the four-story brownstone 
for nine years. ``It got to the point that you just didn't want to 
have company visiting anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Rubin, Greenspan Support Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Current efforts to reform the global financial  
system are gaining momentum and will not falter as did an attempt 
after the 1995 Mexican crisis, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan and outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They assured Congress they had much more confidence that  
necessary reforms will be implemented this time, in part because 
the 22-month-long Asian crisis had demonstrated the need for an 
overhaul of the world's financial structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has come out of the Asian crisis is an enormous global  
focus on architecture, a lot of debate, a lot of different ideas,'' 
Rubin said. ``I would have a fairly high degree of confidence this 
energy will not flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint appearance with Rubin before the House Banking  
Committee, Greenspan said there was added urgency because of the 
long list of countries whose economies have been leveled by 
financial troubles that have struck three continents. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, around one-third of the globe was pushed into  
recession, providing a number of new case studies of how the world 
operates now that billions of dollars in investments can move with 
the speed of clicking computer keys, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have far more information, far more understanding and  
the capability of confronting these things which I don't believe we 
had immediately after the Mexican crisis,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and Rubin gave a generally upbeat status report on  
efforts to institute reforms to prevent future Asian-style currency 
crises. Greenspan stressed that Fed policy-makers agreed with the 
broad thrust of the plan put forward last month by the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, the administration's point man on the Asian crisis,  
announced last week that he will step down as treasury secretary in 
July. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has been nominated 
to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who issued a strong statement of support for Summers  
last week, continued to signal to financial markets that he and 
other Fed policy-makers are working closely with the administration 
on the global crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rubin and Greenspan urged the private sector to share more  
of the burden of bad investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the principal criticisms of the massive bailouts of  
Mexico in 1995, and, more recently of Asian nations, Russia and 
Brazil, has been that much of the money went to repay foreign 
investors who made bad bets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that all creditors who make bad  
investments should get the appropriate remedy -- which is loss,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin reviewed a package of proposals the administration first  
released in April before the spring meetings of the 182-nation 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the IMF already had adopted a key measure: contingent  
credit lines to countries pursuing sound economic policies, before 
a crisis prompted by investors dumping currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the IMF would not disburse any money without approval  
from the agency's executive board, ensuring that qualified 
countries continued prudent economic plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, making the case for better financial reporting  
standards, said misleading information put out by Thailand and 
South Korea had worsened the market's reaction when trouble arose 
in those nations.

<HEADLINE> Man Suffocates in Corn Bin </HEADLINE>

<P>
	MECHANICSBURG, Ohio (AP) -- A farmer trying to empty a corn bin  
fell into the grain pile today and suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur R. Bullard, 69, apparently slipped as he tried to free a  
clump of grain clogging the bin at his farm, about 30 miles west of 
Columbus. It took firefighters nearly three hours to reach Bullard. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullard, who was unloading the corn to sell, apparently went  
inside the bin at the top to check why the grain had stopped 
flowing. He had attached a rope to the bin to hang onto but 
apparently didn't tie it to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The bin held between 10,000 and 15,000 bushels of grain.

<HEADLINE> Envoys Confer in Moscow on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Three top envoys discussed a peace proposal to end  
the Kosovo conflict Thursday, but acknowledged a lot of work still 
had to be done and said it was not clear if Yugoslavia would accept 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is heading  
Russia's mediation efforts for Yugoslavia, briefed U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari on his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said the talks had been constructive and would continue,  
but gave no indication if any progress had been made. The other 
participants also gave few details. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahtisaari said the peace efforts were at a preliminary stage  
even though all sides wanted swift progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still unclear whether we'll be able to persuade the  
Yugoslav leadership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, who has in the past claimed breakthroughs that  
later failed to materialize, gave no details on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men conferred at a government resort on Moscow's  
outskirts after Chernomyrdin visited Belgrade for talks on ending 
the conflict over Yugoslavia's Kosovo province that has killed 
hundreds of people and displaced nearly 800,000 ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tense talk. It took quite a long time,'' Chernomyrdin  
told reporters Thursday, referring to his talks with the Yugoslav 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin and Milosevic discussed a plan by the Group of  
Eight industrialized nations to end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic told Chernomyrdin that Yugoslavia opposes pulling all  
its troops out of Kosovo and allowing an international force to 
control the province -- both of which NATO demands. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chernomyrdin said there had been ``a step forward,''  
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia strongly opposes NATO attacks on Yugoslavia and has been  
working for a diplomatic solution. Talbott, Chernomyrdin and 
Ahtisaari met in Finland twice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahtisaari said earlier Thursday he had no new initiatives to  
discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we don't need now is more proposals,'' he told  
reporters before leaving Finland. ``What we are doing now is 
measuring how ready the Yugoslav political leadership is for a 
peaceful solution and on what conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's office said that ``the solution could be found only  
politically and within the United Nations, and with the active and 
direct participation of Yugoslavia, starting from the principles of 
the G-8.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the G-8 plan include withdrawal of Milosevic's  
``military, police and paramilitary forces'' from Kosovo. NATO 
wants a total withdrawal of all Serb forces, including regular 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry condemned NATO's latest  
bombings, which hit a hospital Thursday and killed at least three 
people. President Boris Yeltsin called for ``an immediate end to 
the senseless, barbaric bombings,'' his office said in a statement 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met in Moscow with the U.N.  
special envoy on Kosovo, Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia's position (is) that the role of the United Nations  
must be the leading one,'' Ivanov told reporters after the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is unhappy with NATO's prominence and wants the United  
Nations -- a body where Moscow has considerable influence -- to call 
the shots in the Yugoslav settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The other top U.N. envoy on Kosovo, Carl Bildt, is due to join  
Kukan in Moscow on Friday for talks on the conflict.

<HEADLINE>  Carr Not the Show on De La Hoya Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oba Carr walked unnoticed Thursday behind dark  
glasses past the posters of Oscar De La Hoya in the hotel lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr fights De La Hoya for the welterweight title Saturday  
night. You might not have known it by looking at posters, which 
featured only the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the plight of an opponent, which is all 10-1 underdogs  
like Carr are expected to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way for me to have my picture up there is to win the  
title,'' Carr said. ``When I do, you'll see my pictures all over 
town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, in the biggest fight of his boxing career, meets De La  
Hoya for the WBC 147-pound title. It's the fight of his life, but 
not many are noticing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me,'' Carr said. ``I don't feel like Oscar  
is overlooking me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not only that Carr is overshadowed by De La Hoya, who makes  
millions each fight and is the biggest non-heavyweight attraction 
in boxing. He's also been overshadowed by negotiations all week 
long for De La Hoya's next fight -- a showdown with IBF champion 
Felix Trindiad. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr fought Trindiad and knocked him down in the second round  
before being stopped in the eighth. His only other loss was to Ike 
Quartey, De La Hoya's last opponent, and he put Quartey down in the 
11th round, only to lose by decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trinidad and Oscar is an attractive fight,'' Carr said.  
``People want to see that fight. But in the future they're going to 
want to see Oba Carr and Trinidad in a rematch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr (48-2-1) beat Frankie Randall on the De La Hoya-Quartey  
undercard to earn a shot at De La Hoya. He'll earn $350,000 to $5 
million for the champion, but he'll also get the opportunity to 
finally make a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at the epitome of my boxing game,'' Carr said. ``I have a  
serenity in myself, a peace in myself that is almost not 
understandable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, of Detroit, and De La Hoya appeared at a final pre-fight  
press conference Thursday, where few listened as Carr delivered a 
sermon-like speech. When it came time for De La Hoya to talk, 
though, they were all ears. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (30-0, 24 knockouts) vowed to mix it up with Carr and  
every other fighter who gets in the ring with him in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone to my old style. Enough about this boxing stuff,''  
said De La Hoya, who has gone the 12-round distance in four of his 
last eight fights. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya said he decided suddenly five weeks ago in training  
camp that he would not box opponents anymore, but would try to 
knock them out instead. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tactic that is more crowd-pleasing but also carries  
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was losing total respect from people,'' De La Hoya said. ``I  
have it now. It's back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and promoter Bob Arum have given Trinidad a Friday  
deadline to accept an $11 million offer for a Sept. 18 unification 
fight. But De La Hoya said he is not underestimating Carr or his 
ability to thwart his future fight plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr is a dangerous opponent. He's experienced, but he has  
had bad luck,'' De La Hoya said. ``When I fight an opponent, they 
lift themselves up to sky. I expect the same from Oba.''

Felix Trindiad. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr fought Trindiad and knocked him down in the second round  
before being stopped in the eighth. His only other loss was to Ike 
Quartey, De La Hoya's last opponent, and he put Quartey down in the 
11th round, only to lose by decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trinidad and Oscar is an attractive fight,'' Carr said.  
``People want to see that fight. But in the future they're going to 
want to see Oba Carr and Trinidad in a rematch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr (48-2-1) beat Frankie Randall on the De La Hoya-Quartey  
undercard to earn a shot at De La Hoya. He'll earn $350,000 to $5 
million for the champion, but he'll also get the opportunity to 
finally make a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at the epitome of my boxing game,'' Carr said. ``I have a  
serenity in myself, a peace in myself that is almost not 
understandable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, of Detroit, and De La Hoya appeared at a final pre-fight  
press conference Thursday, where few listened as Carr delivered a 
sermon-like speech. When it came time for De La Hoya to talk, 
though, they were all ears. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (30-0, 24 knockouts) vowed to mix it up with Carr and  
every other fighter who gets in the ring with him in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone to my old style. Enough about this boxing stuff,''  
said De La Hoya, who has gone the 12-round distance in four of his 
last eight fights. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya said he decided suddenly five weeks ago in training  
camp that he would not box opponents anymore, but would try to 
knock them out instead. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tactic that is more crowd-pleasing but also carries  
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was losing total respect from people,'' De La Hoya said. ``I  
have it now. It's back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and promoter Bob Arum have given Trinidad a Friday  
deadline to accept an $11 million offer for a Sept. 18 unification 
fight. But De La Hoya said he is not underestimating Carr or his 
ability to thwart his future fight plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr is a dangerous opponent. He's experienced, but he has  
had bad luck,'' De La Hoya said. ``When I fight an opponent, they 
lift themselves up to sky. I expect the same from Oba.''

<HEADLINE> Baffert Filly Might Run in Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert is toying with the idea of  
running the sensational filly Silverbulletday in the Belmont 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	If she does start, however, there won't be any side bet with Bob  
Lewis, owner with his wife, Beverly, of Charismatic, who will try 
to win the Triple Crown in the Belmont on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	After Baffert was quoted as saying Silverbulletday was the best  
3-year-old in the country, Lewis offered to bet Baffert $100,000, 
with the money to go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert told The Associated Press on Thursday by phone from  
California that what he had said was Silverbulletday was the best 
3-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no bet,'' Baffert said. ``I was misquoted, and  
when he read that he got fired up. He didn't want people to think 
that I would stay out because of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also trains horses for the Lewises, including Silver  
Charm, winner of the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness and 
runner-up in the Belmont Stakes. Silverbulletday is owned by Mike 
Pegram, whose Real Quiet won the Derby and Preakness and was second 
in the Belmont last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For Silverbulletday, winner of 11 of 12 starts, to make her  
debut against males in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont, Baffert said, the field 
could not have more than 12 starters, and ``then I've got to see 
how she's working to see if I want to send her that far. She's got 
to tell me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible the Belmont could have a full 16-horse field.  
</P>
<P>
	Of all the owners and trainers considering starting a horse in  
the Belmont, Baffert said: ``They must not have been watching 
Charismatic run. The move he put in (in the Preakness) ... this 
horse is for real.''

<HEADLINE> Fed OKs Bankers Trust Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve approved Thursday the  
proposed $10.2 billion merger of Bankers Trust Corp. and Germany's 
Deutsche Bank AG, which would create the world's largest financial 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 6-0 by the central bank's board of governors, who  
determined the merger of the nation's eighth-largest bank with 
Germany's largest would not threaten banking competition in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bankers Trust concentrates on banking for big  
corporations and does no business with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, proposed last November, would create a financial  
powerhouse with $830 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Bankers Trust would be the biggest takeover  
of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank. The institution 
would be larger than UBS AG of Switzerland, currently the largest 
bank, and the recently formed Citigroup Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators apparently were not troubled by Deutsche Bank's  
12 percent stake in the newly formed DaimlerChrysler AG. According 
to U.S. laws that separate banks from other kinds of corporations, 
banks in this country are prohibited from owning more than 5 
percent of a nonfinancial company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's approval was the latest in a series of big hurdles  
cleared by the merger recently, leaving only approval from 
authorities in Canada and New Jersey to be secured. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks said in a statement Thursday they expected the  
merger might be completed as early as next month. They called the 
central bank's approval ``a further decisive step'' towards 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, under pressure from the U.S. State  
Department, New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi withdrew his 
opposition to the deal, acknowledging that the two banks had made 
progress in resolving Holocaust claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Holocaust survivors and heirs have been seeking restitution for  
millions of dollars in Jewish property and financial holdings 
stolen by the Nazis in the World War II era and hidden in various 
European banks. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official had warned that opposition to the  
merger on political grounds could chill the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed noted in its decision that it had received written  
comments from people and groups expressing concern about Deutsche 
Bank's activities during the war and urging it to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently discovered files from eastern Europe showed that loans  
from a Deutsche Bank branch in Nazi-occupied Poland helped finance 
the Auschwitz death camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After a careful review, the Fed said it had concluded that  
Holocaust-related issues ``do not warrant denial'' of the proposed 
merger. The Fed noted that Deutsche Bank had recently joined with 
other German banks, insurers and other companies to set up a 
humanitarian fund to benefit Holocaust victims and compensate slave 
laborers from the wartime era. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state's banking regulators and European Union  
authorities have also approved the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In the resolution of another matter, Bankers Trust agreed in  
March to pay $63.5 million in fines to settle federal prosecutors' 
charges that it boosted its financial performance by unlawfully 
diverting millions of dollars from unclaimed customer accounts into 
its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea entered in a federal court brought a speedy resolution  
to accusations that the bank made false entries in its books to 
conceal the true source of $19.1 million its employees diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust has some $133 billion in assets. Deutsche Bank has  
assets of $734 billion.

<HEADLINE> How Federal Agents Trace Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' tracing center  
in West Virginia, trucks unload boxes of paper records from 
federally licensed gun dealers who have gone out of business. 
Workers scan the handwritten pages onto microfilm -- the basic 
building blocks of the system to trace guns used in crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the time, by using these records and making phone  
calls to manufacturers and dealers, the ATF successfully traces a 
gun used in a crime to its first retail sale. After that, local 
police conduct door-to-door interviews to determine how a gun moved 
from that first owner to a criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	How the process works:  
</P>
<P>
	A police department faxes or calls in a trace request.  
</P>
<P>
	An ATF worker usually begins by checking the gun's style and  
serial number and calls the manufacturer to find out where and when 
the gun was shipped. (A few gun makers share computerized sales 
records with ATF). 
</P>
<P>
	Another ATF worker then moves on to whoever handled the gun  
next, a wholesaler or distributor. Eventually, the trail -- if it 
hasn't gone cold -- should lead to the federally licensed dealer who 
sold the gun to a private individual. 
</P>
<P>
	If the federally licensed dealer is still in business, the ATF  
calls and requests a records check to see who bought the gun. If 
the dealer is out of business, the ATF searches for the gun's 
serial number in its microfilmed records. 
</P>
<P>
	Glitches occur for many reasons: The microfilmed records may  
list the same serial number for many guns, because different 
manufacturers often use the same serial numbers. Or a gun maker has 
gone out of business. Older guns generally are more difficult to 
trace because they've gone through more private, unrecorded sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The tracing center has no access to the instant background  
checks done on everyone who tries to buy a gun from a licensed 
dealer. However, the center does get the records of all multiple 
sales made by dealers and can check those against traces.

<HEADLINE> GE To Invest in Thai Plastics Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- GE Plastics, a division of General  
Electric Co., said Thursday it will invest $20 million in a 
plastics plant in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, which will be located in Rayong on the country's  
industrialized eastern seaboard, is expected to be operational by 
mid-2000, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plant will produce some 30,000 tons a year of compounded  
engineering thermoplastic resins, used in computer monitor 
housings, printers, small electric appliances, compact discs and 
auto parts, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of the plant's output will be for direct  
export, and the rest will be used for making products for export, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investment in Thailand is expected to increase this year  
following a slump caused by Thailand's economic crisis, which began 
in July 1997.

<HEADLINE> Court Sentences Kurd Rebel to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) --The top lieutenant to Kurdish rebel leader  
Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to death today for masterminding 
hundreds of deaths in Turkey in a bid to win autonomy for the 
Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of three judges gave Semdin Sakik the death penalty for  
treason. He was held responsible for the slayings of 283 people in 
191 acts of violence carried out by the Kurdistan Workers Party, or 
PKK. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has not carried out a death penalty in more than a decade  
and the court's decision for Ocalan's second-in-command does not 
bode well for the PKK leader. Ocalan himself has been accused in 
the deaths of over 30,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakik's brother, Arif, was also sentenced to death for treason  
in the trial today in Diyarbakir, the main city in Turkey's 
southeast, where the guerrilla war has been carried out since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict between the separatist PKK and the Turkish army has  
killed some 37,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers have the right to appeal. Their trial, which  
started in June 1998, was held in a state security court. One 
military and two civilian judges presided. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the sentencing, Sakik expressed remorse and asked for  
mercy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the one who carried out the most radical struggle  
against armed conflict within the organization, because I saw that 
what was being done amounted to terrorism,'' he told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984. The death penalty  
requires the approval of Parliament and it was unclear if lawmakers 
would approved the Sakik's execution, which in Turkey is carried 
out by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakik, 40, known by his nom de guerre ``Fingerless Zeki'' for  
his missing finger, was the mastermind of PKK operations in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	He reportedly fell out with the PKK leader after military  
crackdowns on the group and found refuge with an Iraqi Kurdish 
group before being captured last year in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is awaiting trial on the prison island of Imrali, where a  
special court has been set up for security reasons. The first 
hearing is scheduled May 31.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin Makers To Pay $725M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two giant foreign companies agreed Thursday to  
pay $725 million in fines for plotting to raise and fix the prices 
of vitamins used in virtually every American home and added to 
bread, milk and breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500 million fine to be paid by F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., a  
Swiss pharmaceutical company, is the largest federal criminal fine 
ever imposed in any type of case, Attorney General Janet Reno told 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A German firm, BASF AG, agreed to pay a $225 million fine for  
its role in the conspiracy to increase vitamin prices in the United 
States and around the world. Both companies pleaded guilty in U.S. 
District Court in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and aides said Americans unwittingly paid hundreds of  
millions of dollars in illegally inflated prices for vitamins and 
food staples such as vitamin-enriched bread. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a daily basis for the past 10 years, every American  
consumer paid to eat and drink or use a product whose price was 
artificially inflated,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vitamin cartel was the ``most pervasive and harmful criminal  
antitrust conspiracy ever uncovered,'' said Assistant Attorney 
General Joel I. Klein, Reno's antitrust chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The criminal conduct of these companies hurt the pocketbook of  
virtually every American consumer -- anyone who took a vitamin, 
drank a glass of milk or had a bowl of cereal,'' Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartel boosted the price of more than $5 billion in products  
sold in this country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme lasted from January 1990 into February 1999. The  
plotters boosted the cost of vitamins A, B2, B5, C, E and beta 
carotene -- those most commonly taken as pills or added to enrich 
human foods like bread, milk, orange juice and breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	These illegal price increases also reached consumers through the  
cost of animal products, because the vitamins are added to animal 
feeds. The plotters are the world's largest producers of the most 
commonly used vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	The former director of worldwide marketing for Hoffmann-LaRoche  
Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division, Dr. Kuno Sommer, agreed to 
plead guilty to helping run the cartel and lying to Justice 
investigators in 1997 to cover up the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer, a Swiss citizen, agreed to serve a four-month prison  
term and pay a $100,000 fine. ``For the first time in our history, 
a European national will plead guilty and, subject to court 
approval, will serve four months in prison'' for price-fixing, 
Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another three Hoffmann-LaRoche executives and four from BASF  
were not given immunity under the agreements reached Thursday, and 
additional prosecutions are possible, said Gary R. Spratling, 
deputy assistant attorney general in charge of criminal antitrust 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was broken open when another conspirator,  
Rhone-Poulenc, SA, a French pharmaceutical company, began 
cooperating with Justice investigators several months ago, 
Spratling said. ``The information provided by Rhone Poulenc was 
what the division needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhone-Poulenc was accepted into the antitrust division's  
leniency program, which protects companies from criminal 
prosecution if they voluntarily report their involvement in a crime 
before prosecutors learn of their role. 
</P>
<P>
	But all the companies still could face private class-action  
lawsuits from victims of the scheme. Private lawyers already have 
met to discuss such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhone-Poulenc said its animal nutrition division ``acknowledged  
there were instances in the past in which the company's global 
business practices did not meet U.S. legal standards,'' but said 
changes have been made ``to ensure compliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials said the attempted cover-up was a factor in  
the larger fine for Hoffmann-LaRoche. In addition, Hoffmann-LaRoche 
was a repeat offender, Klein said -- caught earlier by the antitrust 
division in a global cartel that raised prices for the food 
additive and feed additive citric acid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, members of the vitamin cartel, including  
Hoffmann-LaRoche, continued to regularly meet and carry out their 
global agreement even while Hoffmann-LaRoche was being 
investigated, prosecuted and fined $14 million in March 1997 for 
participating in the citric acid cartel,'' Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Swiss vitamin manufacturer Lonza AG and five U.S.  
executives agreed to plead guilty to participating in the global 
vitamin plot. Lonza agreed to pay a $10.5 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonza schemed to fix prices vitamin B3 prices and the executives  
vitamin B4 prices.

<HEADLINE> Details of Federal Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The federal laws that govern the sale of guns in the United  
States are designed to funnel most interstate commerce in firearms 
through federally licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	State and local officials can impose additional restrictions, if  
they choose. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, all those ``engaged in the business'' of selling  
firearms must acquire a federal license that requires them to do 
several things: 
</P>
<P>
	--Run a Brady Law background check on anyone who wants to buy a  
gun to ensure the person is not a convicted felon or otherwise 
unqualified to own a firearm; 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep a record of all purchases and sales back 20 years, and  
make it available to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms if 
it seeks to trace a gun. When dealers go out of business, they must 
ship their old records to ATF, a branch of the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	--Report immediately to the ATF all multiple gun sales to one  
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of federally licensed firearms dealers dropped to  
just over 100,000 in recent years, from more than 200,000, after 
the Brady Law set higher fees and tighter restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	After an initial gun sale by a federally licensed dealer, all  
sales between private individuals not engaged in the business are 
exempt from the background check and recording requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is no specific definition of ``engaged in the  
business.'' Collectors and hobbyists are exempt, for example. But a 
person who sells many guns without a license can often operate for 
years without ATF discovering him, says Harvard University 
researcher David Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	At gun shows -- a flashpoint in recent debates in Congress -- all  
licensed dealers must run background checks and keep sales records, 
just as if they were operating from a store. But private sellers, 
again, need not run background checks or keep records. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control groups contend some private sellers abuse the system  
by selling large numbers of guns at shows. The National Rifle 
Association disputes that, saying there's no proof gun shows are a 
major source of illegal trafficking.

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw Gets Jordan's No. 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw finally got her No. 23.  
</P>
<P>
	``My baby's back,'' said Holdsclaw, stretching the black  
practice Washington Mystics jersey and patting the two white 
numerals as she sat down after Wednesday's practice. ``I'm excited 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the No. 1 overall pick in the WNBA draft and hailed  
as the ``female Michael Jordan,'' did not wear a number her first 
two days at training camp. Twenty-three was her number when she won 
championships in high school in New York and in college at 
Tennessee, but Rita Williams wore that number last year for the 
Mystics. 
</P>
<P>
	The team decided to leave it in the hands of the players.  
Earlier this week, the two sat and talked about it. Williams 
finally gave in. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a special attachment to it, so I'd figure I'd give it  
to her,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw originally chose No. 23 because of Jordan, but she  
says it also has come to represent Psalm 23. At public appearances 
since the draft, the Mystics have given her ceremonial jerseys such 
as No. 99 -- for 1999 -- and No. 1 -- for first overall pick -- while 
fans yelled comments such as ``Where's No. 23?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt kind of strange,'' Holdsclaw said.  
</P>
<P>
	And what did Holdsclaw have to give up to get the number from  
Williams? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to buy her golf clubs,'' Holdsclaw said. ``We're  
going to take lessons together, and today she told me I had to pay 
for her lessons, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Williams, she has a new favorite number. She wore No. 13,  
her overall draft position last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirteen was my lucky number last year,'' Williams said, ``so  
I just picked this one.''

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Charged in Copper Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, seeking to close the books  
on a scandal in the world copper market three years ago, have 
charged Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. with allegedly helping a commodities 
firm manipulate copper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Thursday that  
Merrill Lynch worked with Global Minerals and Metals Corp. and 
Japan's Sumitomo Corp. to artificially force prices higher in late 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Aronow, the CFTC's enforcement director, said the  
charges capped a three-year investigation of ``one of the most 
serious worldwide manipulations'' of a commodity in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch and Global Minerals denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Merrill said it fully cooperated with the CFTC's investigation  
and was ``extremely disappointed'' that the agency decided to 
proceed with charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC also announced charges against New York-based Global  
Minerals, its president and chief executive officer, R. David 
Campbell, and its chief copper trader, Carl Alm. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Haveles, an attorney for Global Minerals and Campbell,  
said the CFTC's complaint was ``based on an Alice-in-Wonderland 
view of the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Haveles said the company's trading activities  
occurred in a market with a big copper deficit due to a dramatic 
increase in demand in the mid-1990s, which would have pushed up the 
metal's price. He also said British commodities regulators were 
``fully informed'' about Global Minerals' activities at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Alm's attorney, David Frankel, didn't immediately return a  
telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stems from a scandal that rocked the world copper  
market in 1996, based on trades that occurred as much as 10 years 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuo Hamanaka, a former Sumitomo star trader who has been  
convicted of fraud and forgery by a Japanese court, caused $2.6 
billion in losses in unauthorized copper trading over a decade 
after cornering as much as 5 percent of the market. When the losses 
were exposed in 1996, copper prices plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	According to traders, Hamanaka's activities kept the price of  
copper high on the New York and London commodity futures markets in 
1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	CFTC Chairwoman Brooksley Born has said the alleged manipulation  
caused serious harm to the U.S. copper market and American users of 
the metal by driving up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Sumitomo agreed to pay $150 million to settle the  
CFTC's charges that it manipulated the world copper market. The big 
Japanese trading house, which also agreed to pay $8 million to 
British regulators, neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC alleged Thursday that Merrill ``knowingly and  
intentionally aided, abetted and assisted'' the manipulation scheme 
by providing substantial credit and financing that Global Minerals 
and Sumitomo used to corner warehouse stocks of copper. The 
regulators also accused Merrill of intentionally advising Global 
Minerals and Sumitomo on how they could best corner the market. 
They alleged that Merrill benefitted from the scheme in its own 
copper trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Merrill said it had no knowledge that Sumitomo's  
conduct was unlawful and had no intention of aiding any improper 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business transactions that occurred more than three years  
ago between Merrill Lynch and Sumitomo, including copper trading 
..., were conducted in a commercially reasonable fashion and were 
fully visible to the regulators at the time,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Merrill spokesman said the company similarly had no knowledge  
of unlawful conduct by Global Minerals and had made reasonable 
transactions with the commodities firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC filed a civil complaint against the companies and  
individuals, asking for a hearing before an administrative law 
judge at the agency to determine if the charges are true and what 
penalties may be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible penalties include an order requiring the companies and  
individuals to refrain from future violations of federal 
commodities laws and civil fines and restitution of damages, the 
agency said.

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw Gets Jordan's No. 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw finally got her No. 23.  
</P>
<P>
	``My baby's back,'' said Holdsclaw, stretching the black  
practice Washington Mystics jersey and patting the two white 
numerals as she sat down after Wednesday's practice. ``I'm excited 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the No. 1 overall pick in the WNBA draft and hailed  
as the ``female Michael Jordan,'' did not wear a number her first 
two days at training camp. Twenty-three was her number when she won 
championships in high school in New York and in college at 
Tennessee, but Rita Williams wore that number last year for the 
Mystics. 
</P>
<P>
	The team decided to leave it in the hands of the players.  
Earlier this week, the two sat and talked about it. Williams 
finally gave in. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a special attachment to it, so I'd figure I'd give it  
to her,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw originally chose No. 23 because of Jordan, but she  
says it also has come to represent Psalm 23. At public appearances 
since the draft, the Mystics have given her ceremonial jerseys such 
as No. 99 -- for 1999 -- and No. 1 -- for first overall pick -- while 
fans yelled comments such as ``Where's No. 23?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt kind of strange,'' Holdsclaw said.  
</P>
<P>
	And what did Holdsclaw have to give up to get the number from  
Williams? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to buy her golf clubs,'' Holdsclaw said. ``We're  
going to take lessons together, and today she told me I had to pay 
for her lessons, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Williams, she has a new favorite number. She wore No. 13,  
her overall draft position last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirteen was my lucky number last year,'' Williams said, ``so  
I just picked this one.''

<HEADLINE> Mom Convicted of Starving Her Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A young mother who blamed breast-feeding  
problems for the death of her emaciated 2-month-old son wept as she 
was convicted of criminally negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabitha Walrond, 21, faces up to four years in prison when she  
is sentenced. She was acquitted Wednesday of the more serious 
charge of manslaughter, which could have brought her a 15-year 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Walrond starved 2-month-old Tyler in 1997  
to spite his father, who left her shortly after she got pregnant -- 
or, at the very least, ignored signs that the baby was starving. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said she was a doting mother who didn't realize that  
her surgically reduced breasts were failing to nourish her child. 
Defense attorney Susan Tipograph said Tyler may have suffered from 
an adrenal gland disorder -- not malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	But autopsy photographs showed the boy was emaciated, having  
dropped from his birth weight of nearly 8 pounds to about 5 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a child of that size, with skin folds creasing over  
the legs and the arms, would have been hard to not notice,'' juror 
Anthony Bosco, 24, said outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond testified that she never noticed Tyler's weight  
loss. She said she took natural-childbirth classes, went to night 
school to finish high school before Tyler was born and chose to 
breast-feed because doctors and family told her ``breast is best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All those actions, Ms. Tipograph said, demonstrated motherly  
love. She said Ms. Walrond brought Tyler to a clinic for a checkup 
but was turned away because she did not have a Medicaid card for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond sobbed on the witness stand as she described how she  
found Tyler looking lifeless and foaming at the mouth and rushed 
him to the hospital in a taxi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `Faster, faster! ... Something's wrong with my baby!'''  
she said. ``He left me, he died in the cab. I felt him leave.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., EU Still at Odds on Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The United States and the European Union  
have agreed to keep talking about their trade dispute over 
hormone-treated beef but otherwise senior officials had no progress 
to report after concluding two hours of discussions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is committed to imposing retaliatory tariffs  
on European Union goods because of the EU's refusal to accept 
hormone-treated North American beef. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and his European  
Union counterpart, Franz Fischler of Austria, said even if 
Washington retaliates as threatened, it wouldn't amount to a trade 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is threatening to impose $202 million in  
tariffs on EU exports June 3 in retaliation for the EU's rejection 
of a World Trade Organization decision requiring the 15-nation 
union to begin accepting hormone-treated beef, which Canada also 
wishes to export to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has ruled three times that the EU has not produced  
enough evidence to satisfy international trade rules allowing 
states to ban items on public health grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischler insists EU-instigated research indicates  
hormone-treated beef is unsafe and that more thorough studies need 
to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether he thought America would accept compensation  
payments from the EU while the beef ban remained, Fischler said: 
``It's not the right moment to make speculations about that.'' 
Glickman said he had received no specific compensation proposal 
from Fischler. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fischler was emphasized his desire to avoid a lengthy public  
argument between Europe and America on this issue. Such bickering 
would likely lower consumers' confidence in beef products 
generally, he said, ``and this can't be in anybody's interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EU does accept up to 11,500 tons of hormone-free U.S. beef  
annually. Fischler has previously suggested that raising this 
figure could form part of a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Student in Custody for Ga. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A student with two guns opened fire at his  
high school today, shooting six schoolmates exactly one month after 
the Colorado massacre, authorities said. The suspect tearfully 
surrendered after putting a gun into his own mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously wounded student was listed as stable after  
surgery for a gunshot wound to the intestines. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after today's shooting, the U.S. Senate approved a  
Democratic proposal -- with Vice President Al Gore casting a 
tie-breaking vote -- to place fresh restrictions on gun 
transactions. The proposal would require mandatory background 
checks for all transactions at gun shows and for anyone seeking to 
reclaim a weapon at a pawn shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was described as a 15-year-old sophomore at Heritage  
High School who according to a friend had recently broken up with 
his girlfriend. The gunman had two weapons, a .22-caliber rifle and 
a .22-caliber revolver, District Attorney Richard Read said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked to my left and saw this guy in front of the girls  
bathroom,'' said Jessie McCumber, a 15-year-old freshman. ``He 
started running sideways and shooting his gun at no particular 
person. Everyone's screaming, 'Oh, my God, he's got a gun!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not identify the suspect or announce what  
charges might be filed against him. This afternoon, the boy and his 
parents were at the Rockdale County jail. Police did not 
immediately interview him because he wanted to speak to an attorney 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings happened about 7:55 a.m., or about 20 minutes  
before classes were to begin in this middle-class suburb 20 miles 
east of Atlanta. Today was the final day of classes for seniors at 
Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was firecrackers until I saw the kids running  
toward me,'' math teacher Tony Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Joe Watts said the gunman dropped the rifle as he fled.  
Once outside, he pulled out a revolver, dropped to his knees and 
put it in his mouth, Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant principal embraced the gunman, who began crying and  
said, ``Oh, my God, I'm so scared,'' Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ``complete pandemonium,'' senior Michael Ramos said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, 15, said the gunman had broken up with his  
girlfriend three days ago and since then had told Deeter, ``I have 
no reason to live anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he was crazy,'' Deeter said. ``I thought he was  
just feeling sorry for himself because a lot of kids feel like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dunn, a sophomore and friend of the suspect, said he had  
seen guns at his friend's home but never heard him mention plans to 
shoot anyone at school. He did notice the boy's grades had been 
falling. ``He wasn't even trying anymore, which I was kind of 
concerned about,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously wounded, a 15-year-old girl, was airlifted to  
Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta where she underwent surgery for 
a shot that had pierced her intestines. The hospital gave no detail 
on her condition other than that it was stable. The others injured 
had superficial wounds: Three were held for observation at Rockdale 
Hospital in Conyers and two were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Students gathered outside the school on a track after the  
shooting, then began boarding buses to head home. Classes were 
canceled for the rest of the week, but school officials said 
graduation would go on as scheduled May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, two students with guns and bombs killed 13 people  
before taking their own lives at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was preparing to leave for Littleton today  
when he received news of the Rockdale County shooting. The news 
``is deeply troubling to me, as it is to all Americans. We thank 
God that the injuries to the students do not seem to be 
life-threatening,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shoels, the father of Littleton victim Isaiah Shoels,  
expressed dismay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said since this thing happened that they better beware  
because it's going to happen again and again,'' Shoels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage High, which has about 1,300 students, has no metal  
detectors but does employ a campus policeman and has surveillance 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured were identified as: 15-year-old Stephanie Laster, in  
stable condition at Grady Memorial Hospital; Brian Barnhardt, 16, 
Jason Cheek, 17, and Cania Collins, 15, all admitted to Rockdale 
Hospital for evaluation with superficial wounds; and Drake Hoy and 
Ryan Rosa, both 18, treated and released.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Sign $15B Kosovo Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is ready to sign a bill that  
provides $15 billion for the air assault on Yugoslavia, aid for 
disaster victims, farm aid and other programs. But he's warning 
Congress that veto battles over upcoming budget bills may lie 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping three months of wrangling, lawmakers sent Clinton the  
Kosovo legislation Thursday on a 64-36 Senate vote. The House 
approved the measure on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he would sign it, citing its funds for the U.S.  
military, farmers, and residents of Honduras and other Central 
American nations still struggling to recover from last autumn's 
devastating Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a written statement after the vote, he warned that he  
opposed provisions lawmakers included ``that reward special 
interests, weaken environmental protection, and undermine our 
campaign to stop teen smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I call on Congress to end these stealth attempts to  
weaken environmental and public health protections. I have vetoed 
bills in the past because they contained anti-environmental riders 
and, if necessary, am fully prepared to do so again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also criticized language forbidding the federal  
government from claiming any of the $246 billion the states have 
won from tobacco companies in a legal settlement. Clinton wanted to 
use some of that money for health care and anti-smoking 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's governors, who wanted to keep the money from  
going to Washington, were jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
	``States now have the certainty and flexibility to meet the  
health and welfare needs of the citizens in their own states,'' 
said the chairmen of the National Governors' Association, 
Republican Michael Leavitt of Utah and Democrat Thomas Carper of 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans voted for the bill 32-23, with many of the  
most conservative members voting against it. Democrats supported it 
by 32-13, with opponents citing excessive spending or objectionable 
environmental amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	In a split at the top of the GOP hierarchy, the measure was  
supported by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., but 
opposed by Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the No. 2 Senate 
Republican and a leader of the chamber's conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives criticized the package because it is stuffed with  
local provisions that they said were hardly the emergencies the 
bill proclaims them to be. These included $250,000 to help 
revitalize a downtown Los Angeles neighborhood; $2 million to 
intensify security at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington; and increased federal payments to some Northwestern 
wheat farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The freight train has stowaways hidden all the way through,''  
said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	They also complained that all but $2 billion of the measure's  
price tag would be paid with this year's federal surplus, which 
comes completely from Social Security -- money Republicans had 
pledged to leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders focused on the bill's $12 billion -- double Clinton's  
request -- for the conflict with Yugoslavia, the Kosovo Albanian 
refugees, Balkan countries near the fighting and U.S. forces around 
the globe. They said rejecting the package would hurt American 
troops in combat -- something few lawmakers want to be accused of 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think for one minute that I'd vote not to give them the  
equipment they need?'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said of 
U.S. troops. ``It would be unthinkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance of senators to block the package was underscored  
when an effort by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to pay for more of the 
bill by cutting most domestic programs failed, 70-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's Senate vote marked the culmination of a process that  
began in February, when Clinton asked Congress for nearly $1 
billion to help Central American and Caribbean nations recover from 
last fall's two deadly hurricanes, Mitch and Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	As the measure moved through Congress, it picked up $900 million  
so the government could help victims of this month's killer 
tornadoes in the Midwest and be prepared for other natural 
disasters yet to come. The bill also has $574 million to help 
American farmers, mainly those facing low prices for hogs, wheat 
and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeats for the environmental lobby, the measure also has  
language delaying tighter restrictions on mining companies that use 
government lands. Higher royalties on oil companies that drill on 
federal property would be postponed.

	Georgia School Shooting Wounds 6  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy who opened fire in a  
suburban Atlanta high school today was apparently aiming below 
student's waist so as not to fatally injure them, witnesses said. 
Six people were hit by the shots at Heritage High School, with none 
of the injuries being life-threatening. The student was carrying a 
.22-caliber rifle and a .22-caliber revolver. Authorities said the 
boy has been charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, and may 
face other charges.

	Senate OKs Gun-Show Restrictions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With gunshots ringing out in yet another high  
school, legislation restricting firearms sales at gun shows and 
pawnshops barely passed the Senate today. Vice President Al Gore 
broke a tie vote in order to pass the curbs opposed by most 
Republicans. The proposal would require background checks for all 
sales at gun shows. It also would close what gun control advocates 
said was a loophole that allows anyone to pawn his gun and reclaim 
it without undergoing a check.

Deutsche Bank AG, passed on a 6-0 vote by the central bank's board 
of governors, who determined the merger of the nation's 
eighth-largest bank with Germany's largest would not threaten

	Merrill Lynch Charged in Copper Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators charged Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.  
today with allegedly helping a commodities firm manipulate the 
world copper market. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
said that Merrill Lynch worked with New York-based Global Minerals 
and Metals Corp. and Japan's Sumitomo Corp. to artificially force 
prices higher in late 1995. Possible penalties include an order 
requiring the companies and individuals to refrain from future 
violations of federal commodities laws and civil fines and 
restitution of damages.

vitamins used in virtually every American home and added to bread, 
milk and breakfast cereal. One fine of $500 million is to be paid 
by F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., a Swiss pharmaceutical company, and it 
is the largest federal criminal fine ever imposed in any type of

minutes a game while coming off the bench in 35 of 50 games.

<HEADLINE> US-Israeli Music Team Has New Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Gabriel and Eddie Butler grew up in a  
dusty Israeli desert town listening to gospel, blues and soul, the 
music their parents brought with them when the family moved from 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the sound coming from other Israeli homes but it was  
the favorite among the Black Hebrews, a clan including the Butlers 
who believe they are a lost tribe of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	That's probably why ``Lover,'' a sugary ballad sung mostly in  
Hebrew about a man desperate to stay in his woman's arms, sounds 
more like the stuff of an American boy-band than a typical Israeli 
song, with serious lyrics and soft guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	The love-sick lyrics and the hint of rhythm 'n' blues are the  
touches of the Butler brothers who make up half of the singing 
foursome Eden, a new Israeli group hoping to break onto the world 
stage by peppering Hebrew songs with English lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs were originally written in English but then translated  
into Hebrew to familiarize Israelis with the group before it is 
showcased at the Eurovision song contest May 29. Even the band's 
name was chosen to appeal in both languages; ``Eden'' also means 
paradise in Hebrew. The back-and-forth on language and style is 
indicative of the group's search for an identity of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	A leggy Israeli transsexual with a sultry voice won the contest  
last year. Dana International's agents and promoters have also 
taken on Eden, hoping the contest will do for them what it did for 
Dana and many others -- bring an international recording contract 
and spots on MTV Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Eden, which has yet to make a name in Israel, is eager for the  
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to start at the top,'' said singer and lyricist  
Gabriel Butler, ``but we realized we needed a home base, a place to 
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Chicago-born singer-songwriter, that meant rewriting  
most of the group's songs from English into Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
	``We translated many of our songs into Hebrew and where the  
words didn't work with the melodies, we sort of adapted 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Hebrews first began immigrating to Israel in the  
1970s. Some of them gravitated toward the country's music scene, 
singing back-up and harmony for Israeli musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, 34, and his brother Eddie, 26, are no strangers to life  
in two languages. They spoke English at home, and Hebrew in school. 
The mixed cultural upbringing was the driving force behind Eden's 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	``At home my parents listened to gospel music, The Temptations  
and The Platters,'' said the elder Butler. Those are the sounds he 
hopes to infuse in his own music. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the band's other two members, Israeli-born Doron Oren  
and Rafael Dahan, inspiration comes from homegrown artists and 
their Jewish roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started singing at my Bar Mitzvah,'' said Oren, 29, whose  
youthful looks and piercing eyes give Eden a ``boys band'' appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	When Oren joined the group, the other three had already started  
writing songs in English. ``I prefer to sing in Hebrew, it's my 
language,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hebrew language may not be enough to convince Israeli  
audiences that the band is from their own backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Israeli music has a very, very serious attitude toward  
music and words,'' said Michal Palti, music critic for the Haaretz 
newspaper. ``Even musicians who appeal to teen-age girls use 
sophisticated lyrics and sing about powerful social and political 
issues. I'm not sure how far `baby, baby, baby,' will go,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a surprise that a panel of Israeli judges connected to  
the state-run Israel Broadcast Authority chose the band's song 
``Happy Birthday,'' with a chorus song in English, to represent 
Israel at the May 29 Eurovision contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many countries experiencing an American cultural invasion,  
Israel is trying to keep Hebrew at the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the language, the birthday message has been another  
subject of concern raised. The band's promotions agency billed the 
song as a millennium greeting -- in other words, 2,000 years since 
the birth of Jesus Christ -- not exactly the kind of theme one would 
expect from the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing the criticism, the Butler brothers, who prefer not to  
talk about their religious upbringing, said the song had nothing to 
do with Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a birthday song, for anyone,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Student Says Wounds Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A classmate of students killed in the  
Columbine High School shooting exactly one month ago said today's 
school shooting in Georgia has reopened fresh wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do now?'' asked Kim Blair, who saw Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold open fire on fellow students on April 20. ``It's 
happening again. What school is going to be next? It's kind of 
scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other classmates and relatives of Columbine victims agreed that  
the country may be in for more school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said since this thing happened that they better beware  
because it's going to happen again and again,'' said Michael 
Shoels, whose 18-year-old son, Isaiah, was among those killed. 
Witnesses said the gunmen singled out Isaiah because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has some kind of organization to it, so we better  
beware,'' Shoels said in an interview with KOA radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoe Bruschke, grandmother of Columbine student Grant Taylor, 16,  
who got out when the shooting started, said she was shocked by the 
Georgia shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be more,'' Bruschke said. ``Where does this start?  
Aren't there warning signs?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair said she was troubled that anyone would want to emulate  
Harris and Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like how people are trying to copycat the Columbine  
shooting. It was a big tragedy. Those two kids are famous because 
they killed people, and that's not what this should be about,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Good, a classmate and neighbor of Harris, said the latest  
shooting shows school violence ``needs to be stopped somehow,'' but 
he has no solution. He said the Jefferson County school district is 
doing what it can to make students feel safe as they try to finish 
out the school year at another high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal under black  
trench coats, killed 12 classmates and a teacher before turning 
their guns on themselves. They also wounded 23 people and planted 
more than 50 bombs at the school and in their homes. Diaries show 
the plot had been planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, a student opened fire at Heritage High School in  
Conyers, Ga., exactly one month after the Colorado shootings, 
authorities said. Six students were injured and a suspect was 
quickly taken into custody.
