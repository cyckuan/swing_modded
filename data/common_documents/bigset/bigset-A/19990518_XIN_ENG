ROME, May 17 (Xinhua) -- No decision is at hand or expected in
the near future to engage in ground action in the Balkans, while
development are expected from the peace efforts by Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, NATO
assistant secretary general Sergio Balanzino said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Balanzino also said that any proposal for suspension of Allied
bombing of Serbia, including the one which could come out of
Monday's meeting in Bari between Italian premier Massimo D'Alema
and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, would have to be
presented to the Atlantic Council.
</P>
<P>
Balanzino made his remarks at the European University Institute
in Florence where he was taking part in a seminar on the expansion
of NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Balanzino said that "the solution to the crisis in the Balkans
is necessarily political and diplomatic but it must have military
means to give it muscle and make it credible and irrefutable."
</P>
<P>
Turning his attention to the future role of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, Balanzino observed that "we will have to see,
it will be up to the governments or at least some of the parties
involved, which will decide whether he is an acceptable talking
partner or not."

<HEADLINE> New Rice Techniques Promise 25 Percent Less Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- New, water-saving techniques are
being developed that could save up to 25 percent of the water now
used to grow rice, the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such techniques are especially important for Asia, where demand
for water is expected to increase sharply over the next 25 years
-- more than 50 percent in Southeast Asia and India alone, and 40
percent in China -- and where about half of irrigated land is
planted in rice, the CGIAR said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new rice techniques include wet seeding, intermittent rice
irrigation, land leveling, improved weed management, and mangement
of cracked soils.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the scientific developments comes on the
eve of the CGIAR's mid-term meeting in Beijing, China, from May
24-28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It takes twice as much water to produce rice than any other
cereal crop -- more than 2,000 tons of water is used to grow one
ton of rice," said Ismail Serageldin, Chairman of CGIAR and World
Bank Vice President for Special Programs.
</P>
<P>
"With the projected growth of Asian cities and industries and
their increased need for fresh water, rice farming must become
more water efficient," he added.
</P>
<P>
The link between water and rice is crucial, especially since
fresh water is a scarce resource that is getting scarcer.
Currently, the CGIAR said, 31 countries are facing water
shortages, a number that is expected to increase to 48 countries
by 2025, peaking at 55 countries by mid-century, 2050.
</P>
<P>
Rice is one of the most important grains in the world, but it
is number one in Asia, where farmers till about 90 percent of the
world's harvested rice area and account for 90 percent of global
rice production.
</P>
<P>
CGIAR, established in the early 1970s, works to promote food
security, poverty eradication and the sound management of natural
resources in the developing world. It pursues these objectives
through the diverse activities of 16 international agricultural
research centers located throughout the world, and its secretariat
located in the World Bank in Washington.

Los Angeles, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation introduced
Monday a 550-MHz version of its Pentium III processor, meanwhile
expecting faster chips next month as well as cuting prices for
slower chips.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Abdullah Visits U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- King Abdullah of Jordan
started his first official visit to the United States on Monday
since he became sovereign in February.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
at the State Department in his first day of the visit.
</P>
<P>
They talked about the Middle East peace process and the king
told reporters after the talks that he believed "the core issue
is the Palestinian-Israeli peace process."
</P>
<P>
Both King Abdullah and Albright said they will work to
support resumed peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians
when a new israeli government is formed after Monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan has always had a commitment to move the precess
forward and stand by our friends in Israel and the
Palestinians," King Abdullah told a joint news conference with
Albright. "After the elections we will be there."
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States will stay in "very close
touch with Jordan" to work with the Israelis and Palestinians to
launch permanent status talks and pursue a comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah also expressed his determination to press on
with reform of the Jordanian economy so that it could join the
World Trade Organization as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We need to move as quickly as possible to be part of the
WTO. We will pay a high price if we don't move fast enough," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Albright was more cautious, saying any applicant to join
the WTO should meet all the conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we would like to see Jordan be a part of the WTO,
but also we believe that it is important for the terms under
which any country comes in to be viable and that it is important
that some progress be made on intellectual rights and a whole
host of issues," she said.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah is due to meet with President Bill Clinton at
the White House on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Focus on Poverty Reduction in 2000 session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Poverty reduction is among
the topics to be addressed at a special session of the U.N.
General Assembly in 2000 on the implementation of the outcome of
the World Social Summit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy U.N. Secretary-General Louise
Frechette at the U.N. headquarters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-week Preparatory Committee meeting for the
session scheduled for Geneva from June 26-30 next year, Frechette
said that achieving the summit goals depends not only on national
policies, but also on "supportive external economic environment".
</P>
<P>
Since the 1995 summit in Copenhagen, 300 million people have
been added to the ranks of the poor, numbering 1 billion in 1995,
the deputy U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
In the developing countries, population is growing faster than
available income, and poverty is steadily gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
In some countries, especially in Africa, over 90 percent of
the population are living in abject poverty, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She said unemployment is another issue to be focused as in
developed countries, the average rate o unemployment has remained
close to 7 percent and in the developing countries, gains in
employment are being threatened by the financial crisis, local
and regional conflicts and the fall in commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
She called for an increase of official development assistance
by developed countries, the need to address indebtedness of the
least developed countries and to establish the international
financial system based on sound and fair principles.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Official Predicts Oil Prices Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh
Saud Nasser Al-Sabah on Monday voiced optimism over the world oil
market, saying the present upward trend in oil prices will be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices are expected to edge up further as they have been
remaining firm at this period of the year, when prices are usually
at their lowest level, the minister told a seminar held here on
relations between Gulf Arab states and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He indicated the upward trend could continue till the end of
this summer.
</P>
<P>
"We were aware that prices are subject to supply and demand
and when supply dropped, prices promptly improved," Sheikh Saud
said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the present hikes of the oil prices which
resulted from the production reductions executed by major oil
producers.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) reached an agreement in March to trim their output by
about 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
OPEC member Kuwait pledged to implement an output cut of
144,000 bpd from a total of 1.98 million bpd. It has completed the
reduction process in May.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have climbed back to about 17 U.S. dollars per
barrel since April 1, when OPEC members began to make their
pledged cuts.
</P>

Oil prices in the global oil markets plunged to below 10
dollars per barrel at the end of last year, or a nearly ten-year
low.

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebels Oust Political Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The rebel military of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has ousted all the Congolese
Democratic Coalition (RCD) political structures and its top
leadership has resigned.
</P>
<P>
''The decision was taken during Sunday night meeting,'' Bizima
Karaha, the head of the RCD Intelligence Department, told the
Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Other rebel officials said the dissolution of the movement's
organs was motivated by the need to end the crisis rocking the
rebellion since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
An interim committee has been set up and is mandated to set up
new structures as well as appoint new people to head the movement.
</P>
<P>
However, the RCD chairman did not attend the meeting and was
apparently not satisfied with the move which was unilaterally
taken by his rival group.
</P>
<P>
About three months ago, a special meeting was held in Kigali,
capital of Rwanda, to try to solve the crisis which was at its
beginning, but failed to level differences between the rival
groups.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania sent delegations led respectively
by Patrick Mazimhaka, minister in the president's office, Col.
Kahinda Otafire, former Ugandan minister for local government, and
former Tanzanian ambassador Adam Malwa.
</P>
<P>
A statement red on rebel-controlled radio Goma said the
conclusions of the interim commission will be communicated during
a meeting that will be held late Monday night, in which the new
leaders of the rebellion will be announced.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Commander Sylvain Mbuki called on the population
of Goma to remain calm and carry on their usual activities. It
said the RCD military was in charge until new leaders were chosen
to take over the old guard.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem is that this is an issue that some would like
to resolve the current crisis by force," Wamba dia Wamba, RCD
chairman, told the news agency in protest against the decision to
dissolve the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
As the crisis broke out two months ago, Wamba decided to flee
the rebels' Goma headquarters to Kisangani, the third largest city
in the central African country, where he appointed his new staff
made of Kasaian politician Kalala Shambuyi, the ethnic Lega Mbusa
Nyamwisi, and former RCD secretary general, Jacques Depelchin.
</P>
<P>
The Goma group, allegedly supported by Rwanda, include rebel
commander Jean Pierre Ondekane, Gen. Celestin Ilunga, RCD
Vice-chairman Moise Nyarugabo, and Laurent Kabila's former foreign
minister Bizima Karaha, and former politicians of the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo /Zaire.

JOHANNESBURG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa said Monday it
would do everything possible to help tighten United Nations
sanctions on the Angolan rebel movement, National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Marco Boni, spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Department said
his country was one of the firm backers of the embargo against the
Angolan insurgents, and his department was looking for ways to
tighten the boycott.
</P>
<P>
Boni said the governments of Angola and South Africa would seek
a common strategy to isolate UNITA because of its consistent break
of the accords meant to bring peace to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The South African government had also offered to assist Robert
Fowler, chairman of the United Nations Sanctions Committee, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, Canada's ambassador to the world body, is touring a
number of African nations for talks aimed to tighten the sanctions
against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Boni made the announcement as Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda arrived in South Africa to discuss the sanctions issue.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed an embargo against UNITA for its
 continued abuses of international accords.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Denies Report on Ground Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen on Monday denied a report that he had received a letter from
Pentagon chiefs calling for ground troops to be sent to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a brief news conference while touring a military
base at Fort Polk in Louisiana, Cohen did not deny receiving some
communication from top military leaders pressing for the use of
ground troops, but he said he did not receive a letter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. magazine of Newsweek reported on Sunday that the U.S.
Joint Chief of Staff had sent Cohen a letter a few weeks ago
saying that only ground troops would guarantee fulfilment of the
U.S. political objectives.
</P>
<P>
Newsweek said that "there are some in the Pentagon who see the
letter as just a classic case of the brass covering its collective
backside."
</P>
<P>
"A ground war would have to commence by the beginning of
August, and the forces required must start assembling by the
beginning of June," Newsweek said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a letter as such, but I have talked to the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. (Henry) Shelton, and he
believes (the air war) is the correct way to go," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Shelton believed the air campaign would be
increasingly successful as it progressed because Milosevic had
less and less infrastructure with which to wage war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secretary also denied a report in the New York
Times on Sunday that said the Pentagon was blocking NATO Supreme
Military Commander Wesley Clark from sending Apache helicopters
into combat against Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Apache helicopters sent to Albania last month
for use against Serb tanks "are a tool Gen. Clark can use when
appropriate."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon deployed 24 Apaches to Albania and planned to
attack Yugoslav tanks. However, the helicopters have never been
used while two of them have crashed during training operations.

<HEADLINE> Roman Well Dug Up in Constanta of Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A Roman well has recently been
discovered in central Black Sea port of Constanta, known as Tomis
in Antiquity.
</P>

new Justice Palace of Constanta, according to the official Rompres
news agency.
</P>

CoWtanta lies nowadays, was founded in the seventh century B.C. by
Ionians, and served as a repository in Greeks' trade with native
Dacians. The Roman poet Ovid spent his last years here in exile,
after being expelled from Rome due to some of his poems reckoned as
immoral.

<HEADLINE> UK Cabinet Undergoes Mini-Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- British Transport Minister John Reid
was appointed secretary of state for Scotland on Monday in a
mini-reshuffle, a Downing Street spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish secretary position became vacant when Reid's
predecessor Donald Dewar was elected first minister of the new
Scottish Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Dewar was bound by the Scotland Act to resign from the Cabinet
as it does not permit the same person to hold both the posts of
first minister and secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Office Minister Helen Liddell was promoted to Reid's
job as minister for transport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Geoff Hoon was promoted from minister at the lord
chancellor's department to become minister of state at the Foreign
Office. He succeeded the late Derek Fatchett, who died earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Hoon was replaced by Keith Vaz, currently unpaid parliamentary
aide to Attorney General John Morris and Solicitor General Ross
Cranston.
</P>
<P>
In other moves resulting from devolution, Downing Street said
Scottish Office ministers Henry McLeish and Sam Galbraith -- both
elected to the new Scottish Parliament -- would stand down from
their government jobs.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's National Revenue Up 12.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Planning and
Finance Tomaz Salomao announced here Monday that the government's
income in 1998 was about 440 million U.S. dollars, up 12.7 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Salomao revealed this at the opening of a five-day fourth
coordination council meeting of the ministry which is focused on
summarizing the performance last year and planning for the next
year, according to the Mozambique News Agency.
</P>
<P>
However, last year's revenue is still 10 million short of the
projected plan. The minister attributed this to tax dodging and
hence urging all departments of the government to pay tax in
accordance with law and punish tax evaders harder.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging, he said, that the country's economy has
witnessed relatively fast growth in 1997 and 1998, with a
respective increase of 11.3 percent and 11.8 percent in gross
domestic product. He also noted the low inflation rate and steady
exchange rate between local currency the metical and the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The challenge facing 1999 is to maintain the momentum of
economic development in the recent years and the confidence of
international cooperation partners, to reduce poverty and achieve
sustainable economic growth, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The close-door meeting of the ministry is reportedly to discuss
 privatization process, reform of the Customs and the
establishment of the country's first stock exchange.

<HEADLINE> Return of Refugees Key to U.N. Mission: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The return of refugees and
displaced people in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia is key to the
mission of the United Nations, one high-ranking U.N. official said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N. under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator told the
press that his team would gather information for the U.N.
secretary-general and the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member U.N. team arrived in Belgrade on Sunday and is
planned for a 10-day stay in the Balkan country where it would
visit the southern province of Kosovo for two and a half days.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. under-secretary-general said that he would present the
trip as a "mission of hope" that focuses on the fate of the
civilian population in Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
But he described the trip as a non-political mission which was
made possible by the cooperation of the government of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The success (of the mission) depends on the credibility of the
information provided by the government and the main purpose is to
establish what can be done in short term to help the refugees
before winter sets in," said de Mello at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
But he did not want to raise too many expectations, de Mello
added, and only expected to do his utmost to gather "first-hand"
information for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"I am conscious of the difficulty of the job," said de Mello.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the safety of the U.N. team on its
fact-finding trip around the country that is now under NATO
bombing around-the-clock, the under-secretary-general said that
his team would have to provide precious location 48 hours in
advance to NATO but no safety can be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would like to include more places on the
team's itinerary in Kosovo, places like Prizren where an ethnic
Albanian refugee convoy was bombed in mid-April killing more than
70 people.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Tables Foreign Policy Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Acting Prime Minister
Sergei Stepashin on Monday described peace in Yugoslavia and
cooperation with other member states of the Commonwealth of
Independent States as the government's top foreign policy
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference following his meeting with
visiting Spanish premier Jose Maria Aznar, Stepashin Said Russia's
foreign policy is determined by President Boris Yeltsin and "there
will be no serious changes in this field."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to do what was mapped out earlier," said
Stepashin, who was nominated premier following the dismissal last
Wednesday of the cabinet of Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
If he is confirmed by the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, Stepashin said, his first trip abroad would be to
Minsk to take part in a meeting of the CIS heads of state
scheduled for June 4.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma is set to discuss Stepashin's candidacy
Wednesday and Stepashin has been meeting leaders of various Duma
faction leaders as well as members of the Federation Council, or
upper house of parliament, to rally support.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, Stepashin expressed strong objection to a NATO
ground operation, saying that it "would put the negotiation
process on the brink of collapse."
</P>
<P>
Aznar, for his part, emphasized that Spain is doing everything
possible to bridge the gap in the positions of NATO and Russia on
the Yugoslav settlement.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the need for Belgrade to comply with such
conditions as the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo, return
of refugees and the deployment of an international force in the
breakaway Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said the Bosnia experience could be used during the
deployment of such a force in Kosovo, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish premier, who arrived here Sunday on a three-day
official visit, also met with State Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov
and Yeltsin's special envoy for the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
early Monday.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet Yeltsin and other Russian political
leaders Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Reports on Clash on Afghanistan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday dismissed as
"baseless" the reports by Pakistani press that clashes erupted on
Iran's eastern border with Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An informed source at the Iranian Foreign Ministry expressed
regret over the reports and said Iran was the target of similar
allegations in the past, but those claims later turned out to be
all unfounded.
</P>
<P>
Iran's armed forces were stationed in eastern regions of the
country per their mission to safeguard peace, stability and
security there, the unnamed source said, adding the forces would
crack down smuggling gangs in case they try to cross into the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Afghan Taliban militia on Monday lodged a protest
with Iran over alleged attacks by Iranian troops on Afghanistan's
western provinces.
</P>
<P>
"We have handed over a letter to the Iranian embassy in
Islamabad, protesting against the unprovoked attacks of Iranian
troops at Afghanistan's western provinces," Taliban officials
based in Islamabad said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Pakistan said the Iranian troops had been
attacking border areas in Afghanistan's provinces of Farah and
Nimruz since Saturday night by using artillery and heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iran deployed tens of thousands of troops along its eastern
borders with Afghanistan after some Iranian diplomats were killed
by Taliban forces in northern Afghanistan last August.

budget deficit of 43 billion liras (860 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Syrian agricultural exports are also expected to retreat this
year as a result of drought.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The resignation letter of Sonia Gandhi was dated May 15 and was

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Military Support for UNITA  Does </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 17 (XInhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda admitted here Monday that military support from South
Africa for the rebel UNITA movement does exist, but it has nothing
to do with the current South African government.
</P>
<P>
Miranda made the remarks to the press before departing for
Pretoria for a three-day official visit at the invitation of the
South African government.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) still has obtained support from South Africa,
Miranda said "I don't believe it has much, but there does exist
some, not only from South Africa but also from other regions of
the world as well, especially from Europe. However, it has nothing
to do with the South African authorities, neither is it the policy
of the government."
</P>
<P>
On South Africa's implementation of relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions, the foreign minister said his government
realized that "the South African authorities has done its best to
ensure such accidental support will diminish in the end."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that his current visit will include discussion on
some bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Angola and South Africa now share a general accord for
cooperation, an agreement between the two foreign ministries and
trade ministries as well as a bilateral agreement on
consultations.
</P>
<P>
"We will review all these agreements so as to bring bilateral
friendly cooperative relations to a new level," he added.
</P>
<P>
Miranda also admitted that the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) will also top his talks with South African
government.
</P>
<P>
Local media here including some official institutions often
carries articles accusing South Africans of providing military
support for the rebel UNITA movement, including secretly
transporting weapons for UNITA, helping it smuggle diamonds
abroad, and employing former apartheid soldiers as mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
The South African government also admitted some "individual
behavior" in this regard, promising it will punish mercilessly
such illegal actions.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Second Major Cause of Hospital Deaths in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Monday that
abortion is the second leading cause of hospital deaths, following
tuberculosis (TB), in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Nigussie Tefera, head of the
National Office of Population, as saying that unsafe abortion is
the leading cause of hospitalization for women, with 12.2 percent
of all admitted cases in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 7th annual conference
of the Ethiopian Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ESOG), Nigussie said hospital based study carried out in Addis
Ababa recently has revealed that abortion related maternal deaths
contributed to 52.2 percent of the total maternal deaths recorded.
</P>
<P>
He said 50 percent of hospital admissions in obstetric and
gynecology wards are due to abortion, most of which was performed
under septic condition.
</P>
<P>
Maternal morbidity and mortality rate is estimated at 560-850
per 100, 000 live births, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, TB patients in Ethiopia are estimated
to be 250,000. About 100,000 people in the country are infected
with TB annually while 40,000 of them die of the disease. Most of
the patients are reported to be within the age from 15 to 49.
</P>
<P>
ESOG was established in 1992 to spearhead and promote quality
reproductive health services in the country.

<HEADLINE> S.African Health Minister Receives WHO Award for Tabacco Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Health Minister of South Africa Dr.
Nkozasana Dhlamini Zuma received the "Tobacco Free World Award"
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the award to Zuma, World Health Organization (WHO)
Director General Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland said South Africa's
efforts to contain the tobacco industry and focus on controlling
the tobacco pandemic would send a clear message to the rest of the
world that tobacco deaths are an unnecessary burden of disease on
individuals and countries.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela recently signed
legislation developed by Mrs. Zuma that will protect children from
tobacco advertising and exposure to tobacco smoke. The South
African new tobacco laws also prohibit smoking in public places
and ban all forms of materials that promote tobacco.
</P>
<P>
WHO regards tobacco use as one of the greatest public health
threats of the 21st century. While tobacco use is decreasing in
the developed world, consumption is rising steeply in developing
countries where an estimated 48 percent of men and seven percent
of women smoke, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco control is among the issues to be discussed at the 52nd
World Health Assembly which takes place on May 17-25 in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Nepal Parliamentary Elections End Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- To the great relief of the Nepali
Election Commission and the government, the first- and
second-phase parliamentary elections concluded generally
peacefully with a satisfactory turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
Joint Secretary at the Home Ministry Kul Chandra Shrestha told
a press conference Monday evening that the just-concluded
second-phase elections in 39 districts were "generally peaceful."
</P>
<P>
He said there were no major incidents in the polls but 31
persons were injured in clashes between party workers.
</P>
<P>
Puruswottam Dhakal, secretary at the Election Commission, told
the press that elections in 20 polling centers of eight districts
were delayed due to disturbances, and one village in Mahottari
district of central Nepal did not vote in protest against the
arrest of two villagers by the police Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the voter turnout was primarily estimated at 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase polls conducted on May 3 in 35 districts were
also described as generally peaceful and orderly by the Election
Commission and national and foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
The elections were the third in the Himalayan kingdom since the
multi-party parliamentary system was restored in 1990. The past
two elections held on May 12, 1991 and November 15, 1994 were
generally peaceful with voter turnout respectively at 65.15
percent and 61.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
What made the third elections different from the past two was
that the ultra-left guerrillas have launched a violent war
campaign since February 1996 with a view to establishing a
republic in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 people have been killed since then, raising concern
over security in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Despite vehement opposition from almost all the political
parties, the Election Commission decided to hold the elections in
two phases instead of in one single day as in the past, citing
inadequate police personnel.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25,412 police personnel were put on duty for the
first-phase polls and 25,987 for the second phase with the army
being mobilized to consolidate the security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Though there were reports of guerrillas preventing voters from
voting on May 3, there was not much election-related violence in
the guerrillas-affected districts. But in these districts, a poor
30-35 percent voter turnout was registered as against the national
average of 55-60 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Rautahat and Dhading districts of central Nepal, five people
were killed as a result of clashes between party workers.
Elections in 68 polling centers were delayed on May 3 due to
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, both national and foreign observers found on May 3
some incidents like booth-capturing, vote-rigging, armed violence,
manipulation and presence of candidates inside the polling
centers.
</P>
<P>
As usual, the political parties accused one another of rigging
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
However, with the voting over, the nation's attention now
shifts to vote counting which began at 17:00 (1115GMT) Monday and
was under way in 58 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Except Nepali Congress candidate Palten Gurung, who was
declared elected unopposed on March 30 as the only candidate to
file nomination from the Manang district of western Nepal, the
other candidates including Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala
are undoubtedly praying for their fortunes to enter the 205-seat
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the election story does not end here. Due to the death of
four candidates, the Election Commission has refixed May 19, June
8, June 23 and June 26 as the new dates for elections respectively
in the No. 1 constituency of Palpa district, the No. 1 and 3
constituencies of Kathmandu, the No. 5 constituency of Siraha
district and the No. 3 constituency of Sunsari district.

KAMPALA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has hailed the country's universal primary education program,
saying the ultimate aim of the program is to end backwardness in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments when addressing the people of Adjumani
district in northwestern Uganda Monday afternoon, a press release
from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the program is aimed at developing the
human resource, eliminating ignorance and enabling the people to
tap other abundant resources the country is endowed with, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that there are still problems in the
implementation of UPE such as the high teacher/pupil ratio and the
lack of adequate classrooms to accommodate all school-going
children.
</P>
<P>
The president, who started his visit to the West Nile region
Monday, pledged that the government plans to solve these problems
through training of more teachers and mass construction of 15,000
classrooms per annum.
</P>
<P>
The Universal Primary Education program, launched in January
1997, provides free primary school education for four children of
each family. This program enabled the school enrollment to double
in a period of two years. Now there are about 5.4 million
children at school.

NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ghana Muslim Mission has
appealed to NATO to stop its air raids in Yugoslavia and find a
peaceful solution to the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued Monday and signed by Abubakar Aryeetey,
its general- secretary, said apart from the untold hardships the
people in Kosovo are facing as a result of the current air raids
by NATO, the destruction in Yugoslavia is enormous and pathetic,
the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore call on NATO and all concerned to halt all
military operations, including the withdrawal of forces from the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said to keep peace in the region, the formation
of a military force contributed by several states and some NATO
member states, whose intervention may be accepted by the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, should be organized as a matter of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
It called for the deployment of an effective international
civil and security presence endorsed and adopted by the United
Nations which is capable of guaranteeing the achievement of the
common objectives and establishment of an interim administration
for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We pray that Almighty Allah will grant the required wisdom and
 guidance in handling the Kosovo crisis for eventual peaceful
settlement," said the statement.

According to the report by independent watchdog Taskforce 2000,
eight British police forces, including London's Metropolitan
Police, are running "unacceptably late" in making preparations for
the problem and are causing "great concerns".
</P>
<P>
Among them, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and
Sussex police force are at "serious risk", the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also highlighted the "poor shape" of individual fire
brigades, local authorities and overall "a depressing picture"
throughout Britain's emergency services.
</P>
<P>
"Some fire brigades could be in very poor shape indeed. Local
authorities in the main are well behind stated benchmarks and a
number have done virtually nothing," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Most central government departments have made significant
progress defending themselves against the bug, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. interest rates on short-term
Treasury securities increased in Monday's auction to the highest
level since September, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department sold 7.5 billion dollars in three-month
bills at a discount rate of 4.570 percent, up from 4.480 percent
last week. An additional 7.5 billion dollars was sold in six-month
bills at a rate of 4.630 percent, up from 4.510 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors -- 4.700 percent for three-month bills, with a 10,000
dollars bill selling for 9,884.50 dollars, and 4.821 percent for a
six-month bill selling for 9,765.90 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report of Monday, the Federal Reserve said that
the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular

<HEADLINE> Rich Individuals Worldwide Getting Richer, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The wealth of the world's high net
worth individuals (HNWIs) with financial assets exceeding one million
U.S. dollars is expected to grow to 32.7 trillion dollars by 2003,
according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite global financial turmoil in 1998, the wealth of the nearly
six million HNWIs around the world grew by 12 percent, to
approximately 21.6 trillion dollars, said the report from the world's
leading financial institution Merrill Lynch. The report estimates that
the rise in these individuals' assets will grow at approximately 9
percent annually over the next five years, or by more than 50 percent
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The rise in HNWI assets last year was driven by the continued
growth in the world economy and the recovery of European and U.S.
stock markets in the latter part of the year, according to the report.
In addition, those wealthy individuals with well-structured and
globally diversified portfolios were protected from last year's
decline in the stock markets of the world's emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
According to Merrill Lynch, the wealth of U.S. and Western European
HNWIs, accounting for 58 percent of the world's total, increased
slightly in 1998, while those in Asia and Latin America lost ground.

<HEADLINE> Fifth African-African american Summit Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth African-African American
summit opened Monday in Accra, capital of Ghana, with little pomp
and pageantry, but serious business sessions focusing on trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
The week-long summit, which has already registered over 5,000
government officials, business executives and tourists from the
United States, Europe, Asia and Africa will be climaxed by an
official opening Wednesday with about 12 heads of states
attending, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under a theme of "Business, Trade and Investment", "Africa Can
Compete", the bi-annual summit is important both symbolically and
substantially, according to Ghanaian Vice-President John Atta
Mills who cut the tape to open the trade and investment
exposition, a key activity of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The exposition has assembled private sector business
enterprises as well as trade and investment promotion
organizations from the world to identify business and investment
opportunities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Exhibiting are the world's major oil companies, including
Chevron, computer and automobile firms, mining companies, among a
host of others.
</P>
<P>
Mills said the summit which is a brain-child of Reverend Leon
Sullivan, an African American, will re-engage African sons and
daughters both home and abroad toward the continent's new path
to development.
</P>
<P>
"We Ghanaians are proud and happy to be the hosts of the 5th
Summit, which is the last of these gatherings before the end of
the millenium.
</P>
<P>
"It was during the millennium which is now drawing to a close
that millions of Africans were dragged from the mother continent
and literally scattered across the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
"Let us be thankful that as we meet today on those same shores
of departure, we can celebrate the renaissance of our kinship,"
Mills said to declare the summit opened.
</P>
<P>
To him, the significance of the summit is not just a
celebration of survival and return, but it also points the
continent into the future.
</P>
<P>
At the dawn of a new millennium, he said, all the lessons of
the past drawn from extreme adversity and the determination to
rise again can be deployed in the creation of a more humane,
dignified and prosperous Africa.
</P>
<P>
"For, as Africans, it is by our efforts in business, by
assiduous engagement in trade and by making astute and productive
investment that we can redeem ourselves from the bondage of
poverty, oppression and all the indignities forced on our people
in the past," Professor Mills put the summit into perspective.
</P>
<P>
Rev Sullivan, the visionary of the summit expressed
satisfaction about the participation and said Ghana stands as
the "flagship for African nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the vision of the summit which actualized in 1991 is
to help improve the quality of life among Africans, strengthen
their individual and institutional capacities, and improve
infrastructure in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the summit is trade and investment, but will also
examine such issues as democracy and governance and the importance
of political stability and the rule of law, corruption, human
rights, education, health care and HIV/ AIDS, all topics of major
concern.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the event, Mel Foote, executive director of
the Constituency for Africa, called on African-Americans and
Americans in general to be "much more progressive" and proactive
in the new millennium to expand the U.S.-Africa relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said not only does the summit help create closer links
between the United States and Africa -- that is between
governments, countries and peoples -- but it helps create closer
bonds between Americans of African heritage as well.
</P>
<P>
Regarding trade and investment opportunities, which will be
centerpiece of discussions, Foote said "what we are finding is
that the most compelling reason to support Africa is trade...
and not just with big businesses such as Mobil Oil, Chevron and
mining companies, but also with small and medium sized
businesses.".
</P>
<P>
Previous summits were held in Cote d'ivoire, Gabon, Senegal
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader in Cameroun for Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's outgoing military leader
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar left for Cameroun Monday on a one-day
visit, which is expected to be dominated by the dispute between
the two countries over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
During he visit, Abubakar and his counterpart President Paul
Biya are expected to explore avenues for the international court
of justice at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are claiming this swathe of territory close to
their common border. About five years ago, there were skirmishes
between their troops during which some Nigerian troops were held
as prisoners of war until early this year when they were turned
over to the International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Since then they have massed troops on the peninsula while
waiting for the judgement of the court on its ownership. A high
ranking Nigerian official on the trip described the visit of
Abubakar as a diplomatic master- piece intended to ensure the
negotiated resolution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The official said the trip, a last ditch attempt by his
administration to promote the peaceful resolution of the crisis,
has also shown the determination of the Nigerian government to
pursue the resolution of the dispute through dialog.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Nigeria's Minister of Internal Affairs Musa Yakubu
warned during a press conference that the country would not "cede
any inch of its territory" and was determined to "preserve its
territorial integrity."

<HEADLINE> UK Medical Body Calls For Moratorium on GM Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The British Medical Association
(BMA) Monday called for a halt to the commercial planting of
genetically modified (GM) crops in Britain until more is known
about their effects.
</P>
<P>
A report from the BMA claimed that sufficient evidence that GM
organisms are safe has not yet been gathered, and that they should
not be released into the environment until the level of
"scientific certainty" makes it acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The ban should continue, it said, until there is scientific
consensus about the likelihood of long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
"Once the GM genie is out of the bottle, the impact on the
environment is likely to be irreversible," said Sir William
Asscher, the chairman of the BMA's Board of Science and Education.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the precautionary principle is so particularly
important on this issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the first report of its kind by a medical body in the UK,
the BMA urged a cautious approach to so-called "Frankenstein
foods" in a bid to re-establish public trust.
</P>
<P>
Noting that effects of GM foods on the environment and people's
health were not yet known, the BMA also called for more research
into the environmental, agricultural and health impacts of GM
foods.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "The Impact of Genetic Modification on Agriculture,
Food and Health", the BMA report said more scientific evidence is
needed about the risks or benefits of genetically modified
organisms.
</P>
<P>
It added that evidence from the United States of the
environmental safety of such crops may not be applicable in
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Italian, German PM Hold Talks on Kosovo Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder held talks Monday in
Italian southeastern city of hari, working together on a joint
proposal for a fresh Kosovo peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Italian government spokesman said Monday evening that the text
of the proposal will be released Tuesday morning, adding that a
peace plan put forward by D'Alema had met with German approval.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's proposal is that air strikes against Belgrade could
be halted if Russia and China supported a United Nations Security
Council resolution based on the conditions laid down by the Group
of Eight western powers.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that NATO bombings could cease even before
the beginning of the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo,
providing there was a U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government spokesman stated that the two countries
had found themselves in agreement over Kosovo policy and that the
document being prepared would "declare the convergence between the
two countries and take into account the conditions necessary for
obtaining a useful result, that of stopping the barbarism in
Kosovo and helping diplomatic efforts."
</P>
<P>
Schroeder flew Monday afternoon into Bari, which is one of
Italian cities closest to and most affected by the Balkan
conflict, for talks with D'Alema in a climate which saw both
leaders under increasing pressure at home to press for a
unilateral NATO truce.
</P>
<P>
Within D'Alema's ruling coalition, the Green and Communists
parties are deeply critical of the air strikes, while elements of
the premier's own Left Democrat party have also expressed serious
doubts about NATO strategy.

At a joint press conference with Albanian Foreign Minister

"But this does not depend on us," he said.

in July or August if there could be a NATO ground operation in

"There are in essence two issues here, one is that the savage
act, the aggressive nature of which is abundantly clear, can
hardly be concealed by flaunting as an excuse the issue of human
rights, humanitarianism, democracy, and freedom," said the article,
"the other is that we shall, as a result, concentrate on
developing productive forces and upgrade our comprehensive
national strength."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have come to further realize that practising
hegemony by neglecting morality and justice will surely be the
road to one's doom, it says, while upholding justice, being poor
and backward and lacking power means a country is obviously
vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have become more aware of the aggressive
nature of imperialism and the important role of the development of
productive forces in historical progress, which were part of the
basic theory of Marxism. It was the basic knowledge and
theoretical weapon adopted by Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
members in the early 1920s when the CPC was founded and later when
new China was founded in 1949. The CPC was therefore able to
achieve a tremendous victory in the revolution and construction.
</P>
<P>
"We began to further understand these two issues when China
started its reform and opening up drive in the late 1970s," the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Chinese people seem to have become much more clear-
minded, mature and much stronger than ever before, it says.
</P>
<P>
The awareness and power of the Chinese people have been focused
by unity and sharing a bitter anger at the brutal actions.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people's great patriotism and unity were fully
displayed when, with popular feeling running high there was no
chaos," it says.
</P>
<P>
China has showed the whole world that it is a great and proud
country with an excellent cultural tradition whose people share
responsibility for its fate.

<HEADLINE> State Council Approves Draft Law of Meteorology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A draft law of meteorology and
draft regulations for administrating fodder and its additives were
approved today at the 17th executive meeting of the State Council,
which was presided over by Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
As a basic part of public welfare and providing a service for
the national economy and social development, meteorology plays an
important role in disaster prevention and economic construction,
especially in developing agriculture and the rural economy and in
the building of national defense, said participants at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said that the law is aimed at regulating meteorological
activities and helping make timely and accurate weather forecasts
to prevent weather disasters and rationally utilize and protect
climate resources.
</P>
<P>
The draft law makes stipulations on such aspects as the general
principle of meteorological work, the construction of
meteorological installations and their management, weather
forecasts and warning of disastrous climate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, participants agreed that the draft regulations are
conducive to improving the management of fodder and its additives,
improving their quality, promoting the development of fodder and
animal breeding industries and safeguard people's health.
</P>
<P>
The draft law and regulations will be submitted to the National
People's Congress for deliberation.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Commentary on Awareness, Power of Chinese People (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary goes on to say that the awareness and strength
of the Chinese people has been vindicated by their transformation
of grief into motivation and concrete deeds to develop the economy,
shore up its national strength and beef up its international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The lexicon that "those left behind shall be humiliated" has
been a historical lesson to the Chinese people, it says.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the Chinese people to unwaveringly pursue the
country's economic development in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"We have maintained stability and development, and made
achievements that the enemy forces in the West could no longer
tolerate," the daily said, explaining "that is why they attempt to
disquiet us, so as to take action against us in a time of chaos
and with menace.
</P>
<P>
They were harboring intentions more vicious than the bomb
attack, the daily says.
</P>
<P>
But in the face of the enlightened Chinese people, none of the
conspiracies would put the nation in a disadvantageous position.
</P>
<P>
The most forceful condemnation made by the Chinese people is to
resolutely maintain the unity and stability of society and
maintain their duty, which is in the fundamental interests of the
nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has long cultivated a tradition of standing
up to big powers in the course of its fight against humiliation
by Western invaders.
</P>
<P>
"Such awareness and strength that the Chinese people are in
possession of today is part of the inheritance and incarnation of
the spirit of the Chinese nation, an inevitable result of the
development and crystallization of Deng Xiaoping Thought, as well
as the result of the tangible efforts of reform and struggle under
the leadership of the Party with Jiang Zemin at the core, the
newspapers says.
</P>
<P>
The awareness and power of the Chinese people is proof of the
staunch and mature leadership of the CPC Central Committee, it
says, explaining that the leadership, while handling the Embassy
attack issue, has demonstrated its ability to think out
complicated internal and international situations, and proved its
ability to handle major breaking events.
</P>
<P>
Through such staunch leadership, the Chinese people will
further consolidate their belief in the socialist cause with
Chinese characteristics, the newspaper concludes.

<HEADLINE> Ye Zhaoying Ousted in Badminton Worlds (adding Ye's quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Kelly Morgen of Wales produced
the day's biggest surprise on Tuesday when she defeated defending
champion and world number one Ye Zhaoying of China in the first
round of the women's singles at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set 5-11, Morgen, Commonwealth Games
champion in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last year, rallied back to beat
top favorite Ye Zhaoying 11-9 and 13-12.
</P>
<P>
Morgen, who is ranked 22 lower than Ye, displayed a brilliant
performance at the court and took the victory as her biggest
achievement in her careers.
</P>
<P>
"It means more than Commonwealth Games champion to me, as Ye is
the world's best player," said Morgen.
</P>
<P>
When Morgen was left behind at 2-8 in the second set, the Welsh
managed to rally around the court and took seven points in a run
to lead the set at 9-8 before winning the set at 11-9.
</P>
<P>
While in the third and final set, Ye came from behind to level
the score at 7-7 and led the score at 10-7. At the edge of a
victory, Ye who looked nervous at the moment, lost grip of the
court and allowed Morgen to trail to 10-all.
</P>
<P>
Morgen continued her pace and won the match at 13-12.
</P>
<P>
"I still cannot believe it," said Morgen, who thought before
the match that she had an unlucky drawn to play against world
champion in the first round of the championships.
</P>
<P>
"But now, I think it is a lucky one," she added. "I am just
enjoying the victory."
</P>
<P>
To Ye Zhaoying, it was nothing more than a defeat which she
encountered in other first round matches. "Anything could happen
in competition, and it is not my first time to lose in opening
round.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have regular training for two weeks before we left
Beijing for the championships and I did not pick up my racket for
another ten days after we arrived here. I could not perform to my
top form today," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhaoying, two time world champion in 1995 and 1997
respectively, admitted that she was nervous during the match.
</P>
<P>
"I felt much pressure and I was a little bit nervous. I wished
to display my best tactics in the match, but on the contrary, I
made too many mistakes."

<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Greater efforts should be made in
the fight against corruption and the building of a clean Party and
government must be intensified, a senior CPC leader has said.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the

"With the deepening of China's reform and opening up and the
development of the socialist market economy, corruption has
expanded into more areas, which poses many new problems in the
fight against corruption," said Wei, who is also secretary of the
CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
"This calls for higher requirements for anti-corruption work,"
he said.
</P>

Wei urged officials in the discipline inspection and
supervision departments nationwide to study and master modern
economic knowledge, including finance and banking, and constantly
improve their ideological quality and professional proficiency to
keep up with the changing situation.

COPENHAGEN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Ye Zhaoying
failed to make a hat-trick of world crown when she was eliminated
by Kelly Morgen of Wales in the first round of the women's singles
event here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shuttler, who won her first world championship in
1995 and retained it two years later, was brushed aside by Morgen
at 5-11,11-9 and 13-12.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Morgen, with her previous best achievement of
winning in Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games, could well establish
her status in the badminton world.
</P>
<P>
"I still could not believe it," she said. "To me, the victory
means more than the Commonwealth Games gold medal."
</P>
<P>
Morgen was left behind at 2-8 in the second set, but she
managed to rally back to win the set and continued her pace to
take the final one.
</P>
<P>
"When I won the last point, I just felt so relieved. When I
trailed 8-2 in the second, I just thought I was so far down I
might as well relax and enjoy it," the Welsh said. "I know that
the pressure was on her, not on me."
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhaoying was the only seeded player who was eliminated in
the first round after afternoon's session.
</P>
<P>
Other two Chinese shuttlers playing the first half of the
women's singles had smooth path in the opening round when fourth

COPENHAGEN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Kelly Morgen of Wales produced
the day's biggest surprise on Tuesday when she defeated defending
champion and world number one Ye Zhaoying of China in the first
round of the women's singles event of the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set 5-11, Morgen, Commonwealth Games
champion in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last year, rallied back to beat
top favorite Ye Zhaoying 11-9 and 13-12.
</P>
<P>
Morgen, who is ranked 22 lower than Ye, displayed a brilliant
performance Tuesday night and took the victory as her biggest
achievement in her career.
</P>
<P>
"It means more than Commonwealth Games champion to me, as Ye is
the world's best player," said Morgen.
</P>
<P>
When Morgen was left behind at 2-8 in the second set, the Welsh
managed to rally around the court and took seven points in a run
to lead the set at 9-8 before winning the set at 11-9.
</P>
<P>
While in the third and final set, Ye came from behind to level
the score at 7-7 and led the score at 10-7. At the edge of a
victory, Ye, who looked nervous at the moment, lose grip of the
court and allowed Morgen to trail to 10-all.
</P>
<P>
Morgen continued her pace and won the match at 13-12.
</P>
<P>
"I still cannot believe it," said Morgen, who thought before
the match that she had an unlucky drawn to play against world
champion in the first round of the championships.

enjoying the victory."

<HEADLINE> New Measures Taken to Reform Grain Distribution System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
announced a series of new measures in a bid to further reform its
grain distribution system and push the state-owned grain firms to
become more market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The new reform package includes promoting readjustment of the
mix of farm produce, relinquishing administrative protection for
prices of part of grains and exercising a limit on financial aid
to state-owned grain enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as a result of a national meeting on
reforms last week, when Premier Zhu Rongji urged governments at
all levels to earnestly carry out the measures.
</P>
<P>
Describing the move as an important follow-up of the reform
measures taken last year, Zhu said he expected that it will help
cope with new problems which have emerged during the past 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Since the central authorities began a reform of the grain
distribution system last May, remarkable progress has been made
nationwide in protecting farmers' interests and ensuring normal
grain production, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
During the reform process, the state has exercised
administrative protection for grain prices, asked state-owned
grain enterprises to improve management to stop losing money and
strictly prohibited the misuse of funds for grain purchasing
appropriated by the government.
</P>
<P>
"Those measures have been well carried out," Zhu said, noting
that state-owned grain enterprises have begun to pull themselves
out of the heavy losses and farmers have been encouraged to expand
grain production, factors which are of huge significance to the
nation's economic development and social stability.

<HEADLINE> New Measures Taken to Reform Grain Distribution System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"While the reform is in line with the demands of developing a
market economy and is correct, we should have a deeper
understanding of the new situation and the problems which have
emerged at this time," Zhu told the officials participating in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
As China has witnessed good grain harvests for the past four
consecutive years, grain supply has generally met or outstripped
demand, leading to mounting stockpiles and increasing pressure on
the state's fiscal expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that it is now an urgent task for farmers to improve
the mix of grain crops and the government should adopt relevant
policies and measures to speed up the improvement.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the central government has decided to
reduce administrative protection for the prices of a range of
grain varieties that are oversupplied and poor in quality.
</P>
<P>
"Prices for state purchasing of such grains will be lowered
this year in an attempt to send a signal to producers and make
them aware of market demand, and the government will then phase
out protection for prices of those varieties next year," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu again vowed to turn state-owned grain
distribution enterprises into profitable ones by putting a lid on
the amount of government subsidies for them, which will also help
alleviate the burden on state budgets.
</P>
<P>
"Grain enterprises should operate in line with the market and
increase their competitiveness, and should not merely live off
government subsidies," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The premier also asked government departments to tighten
supervision over the grain market and take strict measures to
maintain normal order.
</P>
<P>
Vice premier Wen Jiabao also addressed the meeting, which was
held by the State Council, China's top governing body, on May 13
and 14.

<HEADLINE> More Feasibility Studies on Dhaka Eastern Bypass Road Suggested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Donors have suggested the Bangladeshi
government conduct more feasibility studies covering the issues
like environment, resettlement, location and urban land
development before entering into a negotiation for the Dhaka
Eastern Bypass Road (DEBR) project, the national news agency BSS
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion came against the backdrop of the Bangladeshi
government's request to the donors to finance the planned 750
million U.S. dollar-DEBR project.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the project is to ease traffic congestion
in capital Dhaka and ensure smooth transportation from
southeastern port city of Chittagong and southeastern parts to
northwestern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government has sought financial assistance to the tune of
200 million dollars each from the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund for
the project, and discussions have also been initiated with the
World Bank and other potential co-financiers about the project,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The donors have responded positively to the government's
request, but several studies on the project, particularly the
issues of resettlement and environment, will have to be completed
prior to negotiations sometime in 2001, they stated.
</P>
<P>
Although the work of the project is at the preliminary stage,
the government has prepared a project profile earmarking the
portion of both domestic and foreign currencies, they said.
</P>
<P>
When implemented, the project will help facilitate the
transport of industrial and agricultural goods and alleviate
poverty through raising income by reducing transport costs and
generate temporary employment during the construction of the road,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Halcrow, a consultancy firm commissioned by the government, has
already spent 50 million take (1.03 million dollars) for
conducting a primary feasibility study, and nearly 250 million
take (5.2 million dollars) more will be required for more studies
on the project.

<HEADLINE> HK International Airport's Second Runway to Be Ready for Daily Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The north runway at Hong Kong
International Airport -- its second runway -- will be available
for daily operation from May 26, the Airport Authority said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This marks the second of three phases for the commissioning of
the north runway. Phase one began on April 12, when the runway was
declared open for contingency use.
</P>
<P>
In phase two, the north runway will be used at first during
the peak traffic period from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and in a few other
time slots to allow maintenance and calibration of navigation
facilities on the south runway.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the north runway will be used mainly for landings
while the south runway will be used for departures.
</P>
<P>
The north runway runs parallel to the south runway for the
same length of 3.8 km. At 75 meters wide, it is wider than the 60m
of the south runway, enabling it to cater to the new generation of
ultra large aircraft expected to enter commercial operation within
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Phase three is expected in August this year. The north runway
will then be made available for use throughout the day. By late
October, the maximum scheduled aircraft movements should rise to
40 from the current level of 37 per hour. By then the north runway
will be rated Instrument Landing System (ILS) Category Three, the
highest for civilian airfields, meaning aircraft equipped with
appropriate instrumentation can land in virtually all weather and
zero visibility.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the north runway significantly reduces the
problems associated with operating with one runway. The airport
will be far less affected if either runway needs to be closed in a
contingency. As the north runway will be ILS Category Three, there
will be fewer disruptions from bad weather and poor visibility.
</P>
<P>
Airport Management Director Howard Eng said the operation of
the north runway marked a major transition for Hong Kong
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that Hong Kong has had dual runway
operations. It will greatly boost the performance of the new
airport, adding extra capacity and flexibility for airlines and
their passengers. We can really begin to reach our potential as
one of the world's great airports," he said.

<HEADLINE> Election Campaign in Indonesia to Kick Off Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The heat is on. The capital of
Jakarta and other big cities in Indonesia are going to burn with
enthusiasm as the campaign period begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some political parties have been busy promoting themselves
since last week. Posters, banners, flags and other party
attributes are found in strategic places in both urban and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's election campaign will start with senior political
leaders throughout the country meeting their supporters.
</P>
<P>
Main streets of Jakarta were bathed in a riot of color - flags
of the contesting parties Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of the General Election Commission,
there are about 10 political parties conducting their campaign
every day in each big city. So, many people fear clashes between
supporters of different parties would take place.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people were killed in the election campaign in
1997, most of them died in clashes and traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
The contenders will also campaign through public gatherings,
meetings and through national television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
This year's general election will be contested by 48 political
parties, the first multi-party election in 30 years in the
country. When former president Soeharto was in power, only three
political parties were allowed to take part in the elections.
</P>
<P>
At present, Indonesia has a total of 148 political parties,
most of them established after May last year after Soeharto
stepped down amid the country's worst political and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The country's 128 million eligible voters will elect 462
candidates to the 500-seat House of Representatives (parliament).
The remaining 38 seats will be reserved for the Armed Forces which
does not vote.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the election campaign, a 62,000-strong security
force has been deployed in Jakarta. Many troops, policemen and
security forces are also prepared for other cities and villages,
the Indonesian National Police said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Send Legal Experts to Cambodia's Trial of KR Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. human rights organization
will send its legal experts to help Cambodia set up the laws on
trial of the Khmer Rouge (KR) leaders as well as to join the
process of the trial, Om Yentieng, advisor to Prime Minister Hun
Sen, told reporters here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. secretary general's special
representative for human rights in Cambodia, Tuesday met with
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen at his Takhmau residence for two
hours, focusing on the details of proposed mixed
international-Cambodian tribunal for KR leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen recently agreed to allow foreign prosecutors and judges
for KR trials, but legislation still must be passed to allow for
that.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hammarberg said U.N. human right
organization will send its legal experts to participate in the
drawing of the laws as well as the process of the trial. But he
did not say which countries the experts will come from or how many
persons will be sent.
</P>
<P>
Hammarberg said that the experts will arrive here next month
and the legislation concerned will be finished within two months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen insisted that the legislation will be drawn
up by the Supreme Court and not the government, then it will be
submitted to the National Assembly for approval.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hun Sen expressed his hope that the KR
leaders be tried in accordance with the international standard as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the way put forward by Hun Sen to try
the KR leaders has already won support from the parties concerned,
including Hammarberg.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government has two key KR leaders in custody --
former KR leader Ta Mok and former KR prison chief Duch. They were
charged under the law outlawing the Khmer Rouge passed in 1994.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Takes Biggest Drop in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Tuesday that construction of new homes and apartments dropped by
10.1 percent in April, the biggest monthly decline in more than
five years.
</P>
<P>
Housing starts last month dipped to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.57 million units, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
April marked the third straight month of declines in housing
starts. According to Tusday's revisions, construction fell by a
tiny 0.06 percent in March, better than the 1.3 percent estimate
previously reported. In February, housing construction fell 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The three months of declines follow a 12-year-high construction
rate of 1.82 million units in January. They have set back the rate
of housing starts to the lowest level since May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The April's sharp drop, the biggest since a 17 percent decline
in January 1994, came as a surprise to economists. They said it is
mainly due to the shortages of materials and labor in some parts
of the country this year, and there have also been signs that
inflation and mortgage rates may be starting to edge up.
</P>
<P>
Building permits, a sign of future activity, fell 5.1 percent
in April. there were also declines in February and March.
</P>
<P>
The drop of April in housing construction reflected an 11
percent dip in single-family homes started and a 6.5 percent
decline in apartment building.
</P>
<P>
However, the West was the only region of the country that
experienced growth in housing construction, rising 2 percent
there.

<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Drivers on Britain's busiest road
faced heavy traffic jams as lorry drivers threaten to block
London's orbital motorway, the M25.
</P>
<P>
They were protesting about the costs of diesel and road tax
announced in this year's Budget.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 truckers started a 48-hour demonstration from
midday on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said the action was not a blockade, but police have warned
motorists to avoid the 119-mile M25 if possible.
</P>
<P>
At noon, the truckers left South Mimms service station in
Hertfordshire on the northern section of the motorway, and from
the Clacket Lane service area in Surrey on the southern section.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting good support for the demonstration but this
should not be seen as a blockade," said Kent-based haulier Frank
Stears, the organizer of the lorry drivers' protest group,
Transaction, which was taking part in the protest.
</P>
<P>
The M25 action follows Monday's protests in Middlesbrough, a
demonstration in Newcastle last Saturday and other nationwide city
center protests in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Hauliers are furious over recent fuel price increases and some
fear they could go out of business.
</P>
<P>
Others have threatened to base their businesses abroad to take
advantage of less stringent tax regimes.

KATHMANDU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The second-phase parliamentary
elections held Monday in Nepal were "free, fair, peaceful and

</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Joint International Observer Group

However, net income of PLDT declined by 55.2 percent to 3.52
billion pesos (88 million U.S. dollars), Philippines News Agency

</P>
<P>
According to the report, consolidated operating revenues of
PLDT are broken down into five categories -- fixed line service,
cellular service, international long distance service, national

Despite lower earnings, PLDT continued to generate strong cash
flows, with net cash provided by operating activities declining
only 7.5 percent, the report said.

</P>
<P>
However he stressed that such a process should be a gradual and

During his stay in Beijing, Sugisaki is expected to meet Dai

"It is perhaps too early to say the Asian crisis is over," he
said. "It is reasonable to say that the corner has been turned."

He cited examples of Malaysia and the Philippines where stock

The economic and social upheaval the crisis caused reminded
relevant authorities that they must continue to carry out
structural adjustments in the macro-economy, pay attention to the
enormous debts of the banking and corporate sector, and maintain
good social order in carrying out structural reforms, he said.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Tuesday that
Tehran and London had promoted their diplomatic relations to
ambassadorial level, putting an end to a decade-long cool between
them caused by the death verdict against British writer Salman
Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told the
Islamic Republic News Agency that the decision came after the
meeting between foreign ministers of the two countries on the
sidelines of the 53rd session of the United Nations General
Assembly in New York last September.
</P>
<P>
The two governments announced their approval of the appointment
of their present charge d'affaires as the future ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were lowered down after the
late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini issued a
religious verdict against Residue's life for alleged blasphemy
against Islam in his novel "the Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his British
counterparts Robin Cook agreed to promote Tehran-London ties last
September by putting aside the Rushdie issue after Tehran
promised that the Iranian government would not send commandos to
kill Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen by European countries as Iran's withdrawal
from its former stance on Khomeini's verdict, but Tehran soon
reiterated that the death sentence on Rushdie is irrevocable.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Gov't Committed to Promoting IT Education: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) is committed to promoting
information technology in education so that the young people can
grow up with the knowledge, skills and vision to play an active
part in the next century, an SAR official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Education and Manpower Joseph W P Wong made the
remarks at the AT&AMP;T Virtual Classroom Contest.
</P>
<P>
To turn the vision into reality, he said, the SAR government
announced a five-year strategy entitled "Information Technology
for Learning in a New Era" last November.
</P>
<P>
The four key components of the strategy are to enhance Hong
Kong students' access to IT and the Internet, to provide training
and support for all teachers, to use IT to support teaching in the
school curriculum, and to foster a community-wide culture which
helps promote IT in education, according to Wong.
</P>
<P>
The SAR Government has set aside a capital sum of 3 billion HK
dollars (384.6 million U.S. dollars) and will spend an annual
amount of 560 million HK dollars (71.8 million U.S. dollars) to
implement various initiatives in its strategy, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
"It is my firm belief that while the government should
demonstrate its commitment and provide the necessary resources to
promote IT in education... the whole community must join hands in
this important endeavor," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A seminar to help publicize nuclear
information, which was sponsored by the State Atomic Energy Agency
(SAEA) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to clear up misunderstandings on the use of
nuclear energy, especially on nuclear power and its security.
</P>
<P>
Li Donghui, vice-director of the SAEA, said at the opening
ceremony that the gathering has great significance in helping the
public understand nuclear technology and the development of
China's nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to promote China's exchange and
cooperation with other countries in the utilization of nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 Chinese nuclear experts and an expert group from the
IAEA will discuss topics including China's nuclear energy policy
and development, the administration of nuclear security, the
status quo and the future of nuclear power during the three-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Qian Jihui, deputy director general of the IAEA, spoke highly
of the serious attitude of the Chinese government, news media and
people in relation to their positive attitude to science.
</P>
<P>
"China has a correct understanding and clear policy concerning
nuclear power," he said, adding that the IAEA has enjoyed wide and
successful cooperation with China in the utilization of nuclear
energy and safeguarding nuclear security.
</P>
<P>
"China leads the world in the public's acceptance of nuclear
energy," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a nuclear power generating capacity of 2.1 million
kilowatts. Nuclear power is expected to contribute about three
percent of China's total power output by 2006, some two percent
more than at present, sources say.
</P>
<P>
China's State Development Planning Commission is now working
out an overall nuclear power development plan aimed at bringing
the country's nuclear power generating capacity up to 20 million
kilowatts by 2010.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Condemns NATO Air Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
Tuesday that NATO's air raids on Yugoslavia disrupted the
achievements of world politics of the past years.
</P>
<P>
"The only so-called 'accomplishment' of NATO's action has been
a deterioration of the humanitarian catastrophe," the Kremlin
press service quoted Yeltsin as telling visiting Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar in a telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian president stressed that NATO's continuing
aggression against Yugoslavia is not only hampering finding a
peace solution to the Kosovo problem, but is also undermining the
most important achievements of the past years, aimed at overcoming
the legacy of the Cold War," the press service said.
</P>
<P>
During their conversation, the two sides "expressed
satisfaction with the results of the talks, which reflect the fact
that both countries give much importance to bilateral relations
and that those relations are readily developing."
</P>
<P>
Aznar, who arrived here Sunday on a three-day official visit,
met Monday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Stepashin, and
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov as well as parliamentary
leaders.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, announced Tuesday that an official visit of
the Russian parliamentary delegation to Britain, which was
scheduled for late May, has been postponed in connection with the
continuation of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO planes, the Itar-
Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Consultations with some British lawmakers and the ambassador
showed that London's stand on the problem was the toughest, Tass
said, quoting Viktor Cheremukhin, head of the press service of the
Duma Council.

BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China is genuine when adopting the

<P>
"We will by no means eliminate religion by administrative
forces, nor will we develop religion by administrative forces", he
said.

"We will enhance the education of atheism to the children, but
at the same time we also emphasize that our atheism education and
publicity should strictly observe the policy of freedom in
religious belief and not hurt religious people", he added.

<P>
According to him, at present there are about 100 million people
believing in various religions, and the purpose of the CPC is to
unite with as many as possible people for the rejuvenation of the

PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Air France suspended on Tuesday for
one year its agreement on sharing codes with the national carrier
of South Korea, Korean Air.
</P>
<P>
Air France said that it has made the decision because the
Korean air company's image has been damaged by a series of
accidents over the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
"The suspension of the agreement for one year was decided in a
common agreement by the two companies, for commercial reasons due
to the problem of image affecting Korean Air," said Air France.

Since 1990, Korean Air had 11 serious accidents, nine of them
taking place over the past eight months, including a cargo plane
crash in Shanghai, China, last month.

<HEADLINE> Fixed Assets Investment Leads Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua)-- China invested 202.3 billion yuan on
fixed assets expansion during the first quarter of 1999, up 22.7
percent over the same period last year, according to today's
Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report from the National Statistics
Bureau as saying that the fixed assets investment has become the
engine for China's economy. It compares well with exports, which
slipped by 7.9 percent on a year on year basis, and a sluggish
consumer market.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the robust growth of fixed assets investment, the
national industry had an added value of 617 billion yuan during
the first four months of the year, which is 9.7 percent more than
that for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural and service sectors witnessed much more
substantial growth during the first quarter, with rates of 122.1
percent and 34.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drastic increase in fixed assets
investment to state fiscal investment, loans and bonds, adding
that foreign funds decreased by nearly 30 percent on an annual
basis.

<HEADLINE> Cold Weather Affects Growth of Crops in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Low temperatures in northeast
China's Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces have hindered the spring
sowing and the growth of crops, according to the Chinese Academy
of Meteorology.
</P>
<P>
The growth of corn and paddy rice, which have already been sown,
has been affected by the cold weather, experts with the academy
said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the warm spring seems to have arrived more
slowly than in previous years and the thawing out of the ground
after winter has happened much later than usual. In addition to
the cold spring, the high moisture of the soil resulted from last
year's flooding, also delayed the spring sowing.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-April, the temperature began to rise in northeast
China, but the sowing period for wheat in Heilongjiang Province is
still five to 11 days later than usual.
</P>
<P>
In the early part of May, the average temperature in west
Heilongjiang and most part of Jilin was one degree lower than the
same period last year. The cold weather has also hindered the
growth of corn and soybean while also resulting in a number of
plant diseases and insect pests.
</P>
<P>
The temperature in the middle of the May in northeast China
will also be lower than the same period in previous years,
according to the Central Meteorological Station.
</P>
<P>
Affected by low temperature and water-logging, Heilongjiang
Province will have the worst conditions for spring sowing than in
the previous ten years.

He will meet Indonesian veteran Haryanto Arbi in the second
round. Arbi, four time All England Open Championship title winner,
trounced qualifier Sergio Llopis of Spain 15-5, 15-6.
</P>
<P>
Gade Christensen, who has been dominating the world top ranked
position for the last 12 months, outplayed Arbi twice in their
previous two meetings.
</P>
<P>
Chinese shuttler Chen Gang is the only seeded player who
managed to survive in the first round when he needed three sets to
beat Indian Pulella Gopichand 15-12, 5-15 and 15-10.
</P>
<P>
Chen Gang, seeded 9th in the tournament, trailed from 6-8 in
the third set and tried hard to rally back for the victory.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese national champion will take on Tjitte Weistra of
the Netherlands in the second round. The Dutch player overwhelmed
Anupap Thiraratsakul of Thailand 15-13 and 15-9.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Chen Hong had a easy match, beating Thomas
Johansson of Sweden 15-8, 15-6.
</P>
<P>
However, his path in the world championship might be blocked in
the second round when he faces third seed Budi Santoso of
Indonesia, who beat Sachi Ratti of India 15-10, 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Peter Rasmussen of Denmark, who did not win
a championship after Glasgow in 1997, beat Kevin Han of the United
States 15-8, 15-3.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar soared
Tuesday after Standard &AMP; Poor's announced an upgrading to
Australia's sovereign debt ratings.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was driven almost one U.S. cent higher,
trading up to 67.38 U.S. cents before finishing at 67.28 U.S.
cents from Monday's close of 66.47 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Craig James, chief economist at Colonial State Bank, said the
upgrade did improve the sentiment and outlook on Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The ratings upgrade provides further de-coupling of Australia
from the Asian region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The ratings upgrade has highlighted that Australia needs to be
assessed on inherent qualities than merely its linkages with Asia
or commodity prices," he noted.
</P>
<P>
At the close of local dealings, the Australian dollar was
buying 0.6291 euro from 0.6216 Tuesday, and 82.72 Japanese yen
from 81.84 yen.

ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Five military personnel were
wounded Tuesday in a mine explosion in southeastern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the mine, planted by rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), exploded Tuesday morning
when a military vehicle was passing near Ozluce Dam in Karakocan
town of Elazig province.
</P>
<P>
One officer and four soldiers of the Turkish security forces
on the vehicle were wounded in the blast, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that the wounded were rushed to Elazig Military
Hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between
government troops and the PKK have claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured by Turkish special
agents in Kenya in mid-February and has been detained on Imrali
Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa for

<HEADLINE> Would-be Buyer Doubts Deal of Zambia's Copper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Anglo-American Corporation, which
signed in late 1998 a non-binding memorandum of understanding with
the Zambian government over the sale of Zambia's major copper mine
assets, has expressed doubts over the deal.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Anglo-American Corporation, Julian Ogilvie Thompson
 reportedly said recently that the deal could be either sealed
this year or drop out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
The South African company has cast doubts on the future of its
investments in the copper projects in both Zambia and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Anglo-American Corporation said earlier that it had missed the
March deadline to tie up a partner in the Zambian project but
added that negotiations were still continuing.
</P>
<P>
Last December Zambian Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi said
Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, which account for more than
two-thirds of Zambia's total copper mine assets, had been sold to
Anglo-American Corporation at the price of 72 million U.S. dollars
and that the new owner were expected to take them over by the end
of March of this year.
</P>
<P>
She said there was a tentative agreement on the sale of the
mines and all that remains is the finalization of the legal
aspects of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will retain a 20 percent share holding
and establish a team to monitor Anglo-American Corporation.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistani
senator and spouse of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, Monday
night attempted to kill himself but failed, reported the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The APP quoted police sources as saying that Zardari, who was
in custody for several accusations, tried to cut his throat with a
broken glass at about 11:30 p.m. local time (0630 GMT) at the
Central Investigation Authority (CIA) Civil Lines Center.
</P>
<P>
He was taken to a hospital and after some treatment there, he
was brought back to CIA Center where he was kept for interrogation
in a murder case.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that during interrogation Asif Zardari
became enraged and broke the drinking water glass and tried to cut
his throat with a broken piece.
</P>
<P>
However, policemen who was present there pounced upon him and
snatched away the glass piece.
</P>
<P>
Zardari was brought to CIA Center Sunday on a seven day remand.
</P>
<P>
"He is now safe and sound and under interrogation," a senior
police officer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zardari was put into jail soon after the collapse of Benazir's
government in November 1996. The couple were awarded by an
anti-corruption court disqualification for public office, five
years' imprisonment and a fine of 8.6 million dollars in April
this year.

<HEADLINE> China Lacks Experts for Cultural Relics Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- While accumulating a huge amount of
treasured cultural relics during its history of 5,000 years, China
now urgently needs skillful personnel able to keep them in a good
state.
</P>
<P>
"Only 400 restoration professionals are working in nationwide
relics protection departments, one hundredth of the total workers
in the sector," according to Jia Wenzhong, a senior expert with
the restoration committee under the China Cultural Relics Society.
</P>
<P>
"This tiny number of experts are entrusted to take good care of
nearly 12 million treasured relics," Jia said.
</P>
<P>
"And most of the experienced staff workers are actually
reaching retirement," Jia said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey carried out by the committee shows that only
240 full time people and 63 part-timers are working in the 86
surveyed museums, research institutes and archaeology teams.
</P>
<P>
Among those workers, only two, or 0.7 percent of the total,
have postgraduate degrees and some 30 percent have had a college
education.
</P>
<P>
"In the existing mechanism within museums and other
organizations, these experts are not fully respected and new
techniques for restoration are not encouraged," Jia said.
</P>
<P>
However, every year China has lots of archaeological finds with
many relics to be excavated and restored.
</P>
<P>
Because of ineffective maintenance and restoration, some of
these relics get damaged. Relics protection authorities in
localities are even obliged to re-bury some relics to keep them
preserved.

<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo has said he will not give places in his government to
people with a history of wrong-doings.
</P>
<P>
"I'll disappoint lobbyists," the president-elect told a seminar
Monday aimed at concluding his world tour and domestic "Tank-You
Trip", and "tapping the wealth of experience of friends", as
described by him.
</P>
<P>
"Our national institutions have been virtually destroyed, our
public services, the military and police are all demoralized and
rudderless. In the eyes of the world, we are a corrupt and
fraudulent people," said Obasanjo, who will be sworn in as the new
president of Nigeria in late May.
</P>
<P>
He said since his election as president in late February, "the
plea and message coming to us from Nigerians at home and abroad is
"please stop the rot".
</P>
<P>
"Our administration will be unequivocally committed to
transparency and accountability," he pledged.
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate objective will be that there will be no sacred
cows", Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
Looking back on his tours abroad and at home, he said, they are
useful for deep introspection and reflection on the responsibility
executed by voters of the leadership.
</P>
<P>
The tours took him to all the six geographic zones of Nigeria
and about 20 countries in the world including China.
</P>
<P>
On Nigeria's foreign policies, he said he fully understand and
recognize the fundamental importance of maintaining good
relationships with all peoples of the world.
</P>
<P>
Abasanjo is to take government over from the military on May
29, forming a new civilian administration, which is widely hoped
could rescue the west African country from increasingly deepening
economic and political crisis.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Find Cell Phones Harmless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Talking on a cellular phone or
living close to a cellular-phone tower doesn't cause cancer or any
other illness, according to a report released Monday by the Royal
Society of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The panel of eight scientists with the Society who looked at a
wide range studies on cellular phones did not find evidence of a
radio-frequency radiation sickness syndrome. But it said that one
of the main dangers of using a cell phone remains driving one-
handed while using them.
</P>
<P>
The independent report was requested last year by Health Canada,
which is reviewing its safety guidelines for devices that produce
radio-frequency fields. Changes to the guidelines are expected
this summer.
</P>
<P>
The scientific review looked at the newer PCS networks, hand-
held devices, transmitter towers and rooftop antennas. Some people
fear that cellular phones, which emit radio-frequency fields
similar to radios, could cause cancer or lesser ills such as
headaches.
</P>
<P>
The panel states that the weight of evidence "does not support
the conclusion that exposure to (radio-frequency fields) of the
type and intensity produced by wireless tele-communications
devices contributes to the production or growth of tumors in
animals or humans.
</P>
<P>
Still, the study says Canada's safety code needs to be updated
to better protect the eyes of workers in the cellular-phone
industry.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the unique physiological characteristics of the eye,
including its limited ability to dissipate heat, the panel is not
satisfied that the local exposure limit of 8 watts per kilogram (8
w/kg) for worker exposures to the head, neck and trunk is
adequately protective of the eye," the report says.
</P>
<P>
The w/kg measure refers to the amount of energy in watts that a
device deposits per kilogram of body weight in a living being. The
authors of the study say there are not enough data to define an
acceptable limit of localized exposure for the eye, but suggested
that 1.6 w/kg for the head, neck and trunk would be appropriate
for those working on cellular sites.
</P>
<P>
The panel said more research on acceptable exposure limits for
the eyes is needed. Health Canada has already started a project on
the issue that should be finished in a year and a half.

SINGAPORE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong will pay a visit to Japan from May 20 to 25 at the

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan anti-Taliban alliance
has accused the Taliban militia of killing civilians after they
took over the central city of Bamiyan last week.
</P>
<P>
"Following the fall of Bamiyan city, reports reaching the
alliance confirmed the massacre of hundreds of innocent civilian
families and the destruction of residential houses which were
mostly burnt to the ground," Sayed Husain Anwari, a commander of
the opposition, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Anwari told the News Network International here from
Afghanistan's Kunduz province that the actions of the Taliban
prompted many people to take refuge in Koh e Baba where the bitter
cold weather has claimed even more innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces launched a major offensive on the province
of Bamiyan a fortnight ago and succeeded in capturing the
provincial capital city of Bamiyan last week, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwari also said that fighting between the opposition and the
Taliban had now reached west Bamiyan, where the Taliban had shown
little hesitancy in extending their terror campaign.

<HEADLINE> China to Combat Chain Store Thefts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to estimated figures, the retail sales sector lost 25
billion yuan (US$ 3 billion) in 1997 due to theft, and chain store
theft is the most serious of all.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qiyu, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, put forward a proposal
for the protection of lawful rights and interests of chain store
enterprises to the conference, which was held in March this year.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium held here today, experts in the sector said that
it is common, according to international standards, to lose 0.3
percent of annual profits as a result of theft.
</P>
<P>
But it seems that the ratio of most Chinese chain store thefts
hits 3 percent or even 5 percent; and some are on the verge of
bankruptcy due to the heavy theft burden.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 200 legal provisions to protect consumers'
rights and interests, and it has yet no laws or regulations to
protect the interests of chain stores.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer in Beijing said that any theft involving more than 1,
000 yuan or three thefts in one year is enough for the accused to
be given serious punishment under the larceny laws. "And chain
stores can demand economic compensation for theft involving less
than 1,000 yuan," he added.
</P>
<P>
"But there are no legal grounds for demanding ten-fold
compensation as most chain stores are doing," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Wu Gaohan, an official with the China Consumers' Association,
the major protector of consumers' rights in China, said that
complaints of improper allegations of theft cases have obviously
increased in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He urged chain stores to discipline their supervision staff and
also consumers to observe the rules in the stores.
</P>
<P>
China's public security department is fully aware of the
problem and is stepping up efforts to combat and punish store
thieves.
</P>
<P>
It is said that 70 percent of such cases actually fall under
the category of larceny in China.

<P>
SINGAPORE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed sharply
higher on the Singapore Stock Market Tuesday as the program
introduced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to
liberalize the commercial banking sector and update local banks
prompted a rally in the local tranches of banks.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index gained 37.37 points to end at
1917.82 points, holding above the 1,900 level and falling from its
intraday high of 19.4307 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume increased to 682.83 million shares valued at
1,387.66 million Singapore dollars (about 811.35 million U.S.
dollars). Losers edged out gainers by 163 to 148 with 133 counters
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Rumor on Nigerian President-elect Debunked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National Council for
Genuine Democratic Development, Chief Samson Abiri, said that the
rumor about the death of Nigerian President-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo might be spread by " ambitious soldiers who might want to
truncate the incoming civilian government."
</P>
<P>
But he added that this would also now let the whole world know
that Obasanjo "enjoys popular support of Nigerians, north, west
and east."
</P>
<P>
Rumor of Obasanjo's death was quickly debunked Monday night
following his televised conversation.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect, who is now attending a seminar in Abuja,
the country's capital, said he is busy with preparing for "the
great challenge" of May 29 take-over.
</P>
<P>
He is to attend a "Corporate Nigeria Dinner" Tuesday at the
Golden Gate Chinese Restaurant in Lagos. He is expected to share
with his audience the economic policies of his incoming
administration.
</P>
<P>
When the rumor swept in Lagos, unrest appeared in areas
including Oshodi, Agege, Iyana and Iaja. As the rumor went, the
President-elect had been assassinated in his Ota farm home in Ogun
State about 60 kilometers from Lagos, the country's largest city.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Manufacturing Production Declines in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Production and sales of the
manufacturing sector in the Philippines continued to decline,
although at a slower rate compared with a year ago, the National
Statistics Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a monthly survey of selected industries released here, the
office said that the year-on-year volume of production declined to
3.3 percent in March from 7.7 percent in February, while the
year-on-year volume of net sales decreased to 4.9 percent in March
from 13.8 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The negative performance was seen in consumer-oriented
manufactures and in construction-related commodities, the office
said.
</P>
<P>
"These sectors appeared to be among those which have been
drawing down from their existing inventories," it said.
</P>
<P>
But, the office said, the situation in March was somehow better
when compared month-on-month to February
</P>
<P>
The volume of production grew by 7.9 percent in March compared
to 1.2 percent in February, but the volume of net sales
decelerated to 2.9 percent in the month from 33 percent in
February, it said.
</P>
<P>
On capacity utilization, the office said that the
establishments operating below 70 percent capacity were 39.2
percent in March compared with 39.1 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's manufacturing sector posted a 1.1
percent growth, down from 4.2 percent in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Two S. African Black Parties to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's two well-known
black parties, Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and Azanian
People's Organization (Azapo) are studying to merge, the Citizen
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
PAC President Stanley Mogoba and his Azapo counterpart Mosibudi
Mangena reportedly have given the thumbs to a possible merger
between their two parties. Mogoba was quoted as saying that the
merger would be a "natural situation".
</P>
<P>
Both the PAC and Azapo are contesting the coming general
elections set for June 2. The latest opinion polls have put the
PAC's support at less than two percent, with Azapo not even
featuring in some surveys.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations have so far admitted that they do not
differ much ideologically, and that there was a need to unite as
they came from the same background of the broad liberation
movement.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said that with only two weeks left for the
elections, the PAC and Azapo will contest the election separately.
</P>
<P>
Both Mogoba and Mangena have confirmed that unity talks would
be pursued after the elections.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Party's Leader Stresses Party Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu
emphasized that in the current situation the tasks of
strengthening and building the party are especially urgent to
enable it to perform its new historic mission.
</P>
<P>
Phieu made the remarks at a meeting held in Hanoi Tuesday to
mark the 109th birthday of Vietnam's late president Ho Chi Minh
(May 19, 1890-1999).
</P>
<P>
Phieu said that the party's leadership is the decisive factor
behind all successes of the Vietnamese revolution.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, together with the great achievements
recorded by the people, the party has grown in terms of politics,
ideology and organization, the party leader noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the majority of party officials and members have
maintained their revolutionary nature.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have realized with concern that a group of party
officials and members have shown signs of degradation in ideology,
political consciousness, morals and lifestyle," Phieu said.
</P>
<P>
Phieu criticized such a group of party officials and members
who only cared for their own interests, got involved in corruption
and bribery, and asked for privileges and preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese party leader reiterated an important decision of
the central committee to launch a drive to build and strengthen
the party, conduct criticism and self-criticism among party
members.
</P>
<P>
Phieu called upon all party members and officials to be
determined to carry out the party building campaign. He also
called on all the people across the country to respond to the
campaign and regularly participate in party building work and
supervision of party members and officials' activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Likud cabinet
ministers met here Tuesday to discuss the party's future after
losing the elections on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial polling results showed Benjamin Netanyahu, the
Likud's chairman and incumbent Prime Minister, was beaten by
opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak after receiving 44
percent of the total votes compared to Barak's 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Likud's Knesset (parliament) seats dropped from 32
to 19.
</P>
<P>
Although no details of Tuesday's meeting was disclosed,
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was reported to have told the
ministers that the Likud should try to join the coalition headed
by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the meeting also raised the issue of
possible replacement of the party leadership after Netanyahu
announced Monday his intention to resign from this post.
</P>
<P>
The race for the Likud leadership actually began early Tuesday
morning, with Finance Minister Meir Shetreet declaring his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders include Likud's Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert,
Communication Minister Limor Livnat and Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Till now, Barak did not disclose which political parties will
be included into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
But almost all parties, including the right-wing National
Religious party and Shas party, said they are willing to join
Barak's coalition if asked.
</P>
<P>
Barak has 45 days to form a coalition and submit it to the
Knesset for endorsement.

<HEADLINE> Non-Devaluation Policy Wise Decision for China: IMF Officer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- As the Asian financial crisis has
turned around the corner, China's policy not to devalue its
currency in the worst period of the crisis has been commended as a
"wise" decision by a leading officer of the International
Momentary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"The stable Renminbi has served well, not only for this country
(China), but also for the world at large," said Shigemitsu
Sugisaki, deputy managing director of IMF, who arrived here Sunday
for one of his regular visits to China, in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China's non-devaluation policy after the Asian financial crisis
went full-blown has been beneficial in a sense that "it did not
trigger a second round of exchange rate adjustments in Asia," he
said, adding that the IMF is pleased with China's decision.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the various measures China has taken in the
prevention of a possible outbreak of financial crisis since last
year, saying all those measures are "very important."
</P>
<P>
China stepped up efforts to stop illegal foreign exchange
transactions, enhanced supervision over banks and other financial
institutions, established asset management companies and resolved
the financial difficulties of trust and investment companies.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the structural reform agenda for Chinese
authorities is still enormous, those various measures are the
reason that China weathered the crisis.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Hosts International Logistics Workshop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) sponsored an International
Logistics Workshop here today, hoping to promote China's logistics
industry and upgrade services in transportation, storage and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Vice-Minister Zhou Keren said the National Economy and
Social Development: the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the Long-Term
Plan for the Year 2010 issued by the Chinese government has
pointed out that the development of the logistics industry should
be enhanced to meet the needs of a fast growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Logistics are defined as the process of transferring physical
materials from the place of supply to the place of consumption at
the lowest possible total cost and for the purpose of conforming
to customer requirements.
</P>
<P>
This process involves mainly such activities as transportation,
storage, packing, loading and unloading, distribution, processing
in circulation and information processing.
</P>
<P>
International freight forwarding agents have been pioneers of
the international logistics industry, according to Wang Faxing,
director of MOFTEC's Department of Transportation Coordination.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the shift from traditional freight agents to
logistics enterprises will help create a more efficient
environment for transportation, cut the cost of exports and make
products more competitive.
</P>
<P>
The high-level logistics industry will offer more convenient,
efficient and extensive services to China's economy, trade and
production, he noted, adding that to enhance the logistics
industry is an important task for promoting China's foreign trade
and absorbing more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Managers and experts from seven renowned logistics companies
including Kuehne &AMP; Nagel, Schenker Logistics, American Express
Incorporated and Nippon Express Co. Ltd., described the
development of logistics in developed countries to participants,
who were from local foreign trade departments and international
freight forwarding companies.

<HEADLINE> Computer Mapping of Australian Streets Almost Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Computer mapping of Australia's
roads and streets for in-car navigation systems was ahead of most
of Europe and the United States, Pacific Access, a company
involved in developing the database, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Access said the November release of its Whereis
(Whereis) Navigation compact disc would extend street level cover
to all Australian capitals, including Canberra, as well as smaller
cities in east Australia, including the Gold Coast, Newcastle and
Wollongong.
</P>
<P>
The release would also see the addition of much of Australia's
rural road network in Australia's most populous states Queensland,
New South Wales and Victoria, with country roads in South
Australia state to be included in March next year.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Access general manager Adam Game said the cover now
included about three-quarters of the Australian population, a
level ahead of that available in the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
At present a number of cars available in Australia come either
equipped with navigation systems or offer them as optional extras,
including models from BMW, Holden and Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
The systems use a series of maps displayed on an in-car screen
in combination with satellite positioning equipment to generate
turn-by-turn instructions to help drivers get to their
destinations without the distractions of turning pages in a street
directory.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's
visit to Moscow beginning on May 27 will help Russia firmly
establish its role in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,
visiting Itar-Tass New Agency President Vitaly Ignatenko said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Russia's role will be substantially improved
after President Kim's visit. Russia is also preparing for this
role. President Kim will come up with concrete initiatives during
his Russia visit," Ignatenko told reporters at the Press Center in
downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Ignatenko, who met President Kim at the presidential palace
Blue House early Tuesday, quoted President Kim as saying that his
visit to Russia will bring far-reaching consequences not only to
the Korean peninsula, but also to Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass president hoped the four-party peace talks will
bear more fruits, as the dialogue mechanism comprising South
Korean, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), China
and the United States has so far produced little progress.
</P>
<P>
Ignatenko said that Moscow is to join the current four-party
talks.
</P>
<P>
"If Russia joins the talks, it would become much more effective,
" said Ignatenko, who has visited South Korea 11 times.
</P>
<P>
"Following President Kim's visit to Russia, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov will visit Pyongyang," he said.

CANBERRA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's merchandise imports
fell to 7.70 billion Australian dollars (5.08 billion U.S.
dollars) in April as imports of most products declined, according
to official figures released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was a fall from 8.709 billion Australian dollars (5.74
billion U.S. dollars) in March, in original terms.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures showed
imports of machinery and transport equipment fell to 2.44 billion
U.S. dollars in April from 2.78 billion U.S. dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
Imports of miscellaneous and manufactured articles fell from
1.23 billion Australian dollars (0.82 billions U.S. dollars) to
1.07 billion Australian dollars (0.72 billion U.S. dollars), while
imports of manufactured goods classified chiefly by material
dropped from 1.09 billion Australian dollars (0.73 billion U.S.
dollars) to 985 million Australian dollars (660 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ABS said that imports of food and live animals fell from
328 million Australian dollars (220 million U.S. dollars) to 291
million Australian dollars (195 million U.S. dollars) while
beverages and tobacco dropped from 57 million Australian dollars

<HEADLINE> Philippine Kids to Be Taught in Dialect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A trailblazing program to use the
local dialect as the medium of instruction for gradeschoolers will
be implemented this coming school year in keeping with the
Philippine government's goal to improve the achievement levels of
public school students.
</P>
<P>
For school year 1999-2000, three major dialects -- Tagalog,
Ilocano and Cebuano -- will be used in teaching Grade 1 pupils in
pilot schools all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Andrew Gonzalez of the Department of Education,
Culture and Sports (DECS) said Tuesday the DECS is implementing
this project in selected areas where these dialects are used "to
test a theory that pupils learn faster and better when their
subjects are taught in the vernacular or their native tongue."
</P>
<P>
When these pupils move on to Grades II to IV, the subjects will
be taught in Filipino, except when the subject is English. Upon
entering Grades V to VI, all subjects will be taught in Filipino,
except in their English, Math and Science subjects.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has ordered the DECS to
broaden the poor's access to quality basic education because, he
said, such policy would arm underprivileged Filipinos with the
weapons in the "New Revolution" he had launched against poverty
and social injustice.
</P>
<P>
This experimental project is anchored on the latest findings of
language scholars who traced the low achievement levels of, and
high dropout rates among, students to the difficulties they
encounter in the use of English, a foreign language, as the medium
of instruction in schools.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for this undertaking, a "writeshop" was
sponsored last week by DECS to provide teachers with literacy
materials and manuals written in the dialects to be used for this
project.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hurt in Party Supporters Clash in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were injured
and 14 houses damaged in a clash between supporters of two parties
in three villages near Pekalongan, Indonesia's Central Java
province, at dawn on Tuesday, according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The unrest broke out when a United Development Party (PPP)
supporter allegedly pelted stones at the People's Awakening Party
(PKB) supporters who have just completed a PKB socialization
program on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The clash was pacified by the local police but at 2:30 a.m.
local time on Tuesday, PKB supporters allegedly hurled stones at
the houses of PPP supporters, who then retaliated.
</P>
<P>
Head of PKB's local executive board Slamet Imron expressed
regret over the incident, saying there was already an agreement
among political parties to maintain peace and order as well as
unity during the election.
</P>
<P>
Head of the PPP's local executive board Mahmud Maskur shared
the opinion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief of the Pekalongan Police Lt. Col. Ismu Haryono
said his office will deploy three companies to anticipate more
riots as the election campaign kicks off on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A similarly physical encounter also broke out on April 27
between the supporters of the two parties in Pekalongan, injuring
six people and damaging 40 houses.
</P>
<P>
Five people were killed and six others injured in another
physical encounter between supporters of the two parties in
Jepara, Central Java, on April 30.
</P>
<P>
PPP and PKB are all Muslim parties which will contest in the
June 7 general election along with 46 political parties.
</P>
<P>
Observers said there will be more violence during the poll
campaign period from May 19 to June 4.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Assembly Ratifies Ottawa Land Mine Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian National Assembly
ratified Tuesday the Ottawa land mines treaty the country signed
two years ago in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The assembly's approval means Cambodia became a full member of
the Ottawa treaty. Cambodia signed the Ottawa treaty against the
use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines
on December 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Mouly, president of the Cambodian Mines Action Center
(CMAC), said, "after the ratification, Cambodia will become a full
member of the Ottawa treaty and we can request more aid for
demining in Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
Two decades of civil war and lingering unrest turned Cambodia
into one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
CMAC has reported that mine accidents in Cambodia are still
high, as many as 150 to 300 people are maimed or killed every
month from landmine explosions.
</P>
<P>
So far, land mines have already killed more than 13,000 people
and disabled 100,000 others in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ottawa treaty, all member countries have to
destroy the stock of mines within five years and to destroy all
mines against humanity within ten years.
</P>
<P>
On April 28, 1999, the assembly passed a law to ban the use of
any kind of anti-personnel land mines under any circumstances
except for training purposes. Those who use land mines and kill
people will be punished by law.

Losers outnumbered gainers at 412 against 379 while 96 stocks

Stock dealers said the market rebounded in morning trading but

A cheaper Japanese yen hurts South Korea's export
competitiveness as the two nations vie in similar products in

beneficial friendship with Iran and to work with Iran in its path
of reform and renewed openness to the outside world," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"It fulfills the agreement we secured with the Iranian
government in New York in September 1998," added the Foreign
Secretary.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Britain and Iran plummeted in 1989
when Tehran issued a death edict against British writer Salman
Rushdie, who wrote an novel by the name of "The Satanic Verses"
which then Iranian leader said blasphemed Islam.
</P>
<P>
Nick Browne, charge d'affaires in Tehran in 1989 will be
Britain's ambassador in Iran, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ambassador in London will be Gholamreza Ansari.

<HEADLINE> China Congratulates on Barak's Winning Election (more) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government expressed here
today warm congratulations to Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak for winning the general election.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Israeli people will score greater
achievements in national construction under the leadership of the
new government, said Zhu Bangzao, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman, at a regular news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Barak's election as Prime Minister will help
push forward the overall progress of the Middle East Peace Talks,
and  implement all agreements and understandings reached between
relevant sides, so that comprehensive, just and lasting peace will
be realized to benefit people of various countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also reiterated China's stand on the Middle East Peace
Process. "As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China
has made unremitting efforts to promote the progress of the
process."
</P>
<P>
Even though the peace process is confronted with "serious
difficulties" at present, Zhu emphasized, "it is the only choice
to settle conflicts through peaceful talks".
</P>
<P>
"That the peace process is long mired in predicament not only
brings no good to both Arabian countries and Israel, but also will
bring negative influence to peace and stability in the region and
even peace in the world at large," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we advocate that we push the peace process further
forward based upon relevant UN resolutions on the Middle East, and
the principle of 'land for peace' as forged at the Madrid Peace
Conference."
</P>
<P>
"The international community should also strengthen its bid to
promoting peace and make more efforts to help realize
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East," Zhu
said.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for Japan's adherence to Peaceful Development, Says Chinese Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that Japan will
continue to take the road of peaceful development, Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
state councilor, made the remark during a meeting with Atsushi
Shima, leader of Japan's Forum on China's Politics and Economy,
and his party.
</P>
<P>
This is the 22nd visit to China by a delegation from Japan's
Forum on China's Politics and Economy, which comprises retired
senior officers of Japan's Self-Defence Forces.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Japan are separately only by a strip of
waters, Chi said the further growth of Sino-Japanese friendly and
cooperative partnership devoted to peace and development not only
conforms to the fundamental interests of both peoples, but
contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chi appreciated the efforts made by Japan's Forum on
China's Politics and Economy to promote Sino-Japanese relations
over the years.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan have a long history of friendly exchanges, Chi
said, and there was also a period of unfortunate history in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"Past experience, if not forgotten, can be a guide for the
future, and history can serve as a mirror," said Chi, adding that
Sino-Japanese relations will develop smoothly as long as these
principles are fully observed.
</P>
<P>
Shima, who served as chief of the ground staff of the Japanese
Ground Self-Defence Forces, and paid his first visit to China two
decades ago, said that during his current China visit, he has
witnessed tremendous changes that have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
"Japan hopes to maintain long-term friendly ties with China,"
Shima said, adding that his forum will continue its efforts in
this regard.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Host Africa Training Center for Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has offered to host the
headquarters of the Africa Training Center for Regional
Integration, co-chair of the Society for International
Development, Safwal F. Ayoub, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has offered 15.5 million U.S. dollars
for the center, Ayoub told Xinhua in an exclusive interview
outside the meetings of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) policy organs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, also current
chairman of COMESA Authority of Heads of State and Government, has
approved the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The center will focus on training officials from COMESA member
countries, especially people who are working on integration, like
those from the customs, finance and taxes departments, said Ayoub.
</P>
<P>
He noted that even parliamentarians should be trained so that
the process of integration will be accelerated because a law goes
to parliament and an integration bill might stop there.
</P>
<P>
He said that the center will add value to capacity building for
the sub- regional organizations like COMESA, which aims to make a
free trade area in the sub-region by October, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Integration should be achieved gradually, Ayoub pointed out,
saying that efforts will first be focused on the COMSEA, then the
ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) and then
all the African countries.
</P>
<P>
The training center will be situated at the site of Zambia's
National College for Management and Development Studies in Kabwe
town, two hours' drive from Lusaka, the country's capital. It
covers an area of 398 hectares and can accommodate 170 trainees.
</P>
<P>
Trainers will come from the European Union, who have expertise
and experience in the process of integration, he said. EU has
established training centers for regional integration in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
Donors from Scandinavian countries, North America and elsewhere
have made pledges to support the center.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: It is Time for Change: Israelis Think </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The victory of Ehud Barak in the
Israeli elections was no big surprise, but the huge margin of his
triumph came a bit unexpected. However, people may find something
in one of his campaign slogans, "Israel wants change."
</P>
<P>
In his first victory speech in Tel Aviv early Tuesday morning,
Barak termed the success a victory not only for himself, but also
for a way different from what the outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu took in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
When running for the premiership in the 1996 elections,
Netanyahu promised to bring Israel peace with security. Many of
his supporters in that race believed what he said would come true.
</P>
<P>
But the peace he promised has never emerged. The peace process
with the Palestinians, which started under the former Labor
government, has plunged into total stalemate. The two agreements
he signed with the Palestinians, the Hebron protocol in 1997 and
the Wye memorandum in 1998, were never fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
While claiming time and again that he is for peace, Netanyahu
spared no efforts in expanding Jewish settlements in occupied
Palestinian territory, confiscating Palestinian land and
demolishing their houses, all in defiance of signed agreements and
triggered conflicts and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
On peace-making with Syria, Netanyahu's hard-line Likud
government insisted that the talks be restarted from the beginning
rather than from where they were left in early 1996, when then
Labor government lost to Likud in the elections, making the
resumption virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu refused to make necessary compromise to Syria,
the main power broker behind Lebanon, Israel had to maintain a
costly military presence in south Lebanon, although more and more
Israelis are crying for a resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis found their country not only further distanced by
the Arab neighbors due to Netanyahu's no-compromise policy, but
also alienated by its primary patron, the United States. Foreign
investment has taken a dive after several years of soaring during
the Labor tenures.
</P>
<P>
At home, the bitter division between the secular and the
religious, Jews and the Arabs, Ashkenazi Jews of German
backgrounds and Sephardic Jews of Mideast origins, has been
widening all the time.
</P>
<P>
Further enraging the Israelis, Netanyahu gave in to demands of
extremist groups in his coalition, handing out billions of shekels
to them, ignoring pressing needs for investment in infrastructure,
education and absorption of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
As many voters said, they voted for Barak not necessarily
because they like him, but because they wanted to vote out
Netanyahu. They need changes.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts said that if Barak is concerned about sustaining
the wide support he is now enjoying, he should avoid following
Netanyahu's fault - going against his promises.

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;P upgrades Australia's rating to AA-plus: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Tuesday that rating agency Standard &AMP; Poors Corp has
upgraded Australia's foreign currency rating to AA-plus, from AA,
reflecting the nation's shrinking debt burden and fiscal
restraint.
</P>
<P>
In a statement later, S&AMP;P confirmed the upgrading, and also
said it had affirmed Australia's AAA local-currency and A1-plus
short-term credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
Following a cabinet meeting in Queensland state, east
Australia, Howard told reporters that the upgrading was
recognition at the highest possible level that the economy was now
being run better than it had been for decades.
</P>
<P>
S&AMP;P said that the ratings upgrade reflected the Australian
government's improved external flexibility, with net public sector
external debt burden estimated at about 35 percent of exports this
year, down from a peak of 87 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade to AA-plus from AA is the first in nearly a decade
after S&AMP;P downgraded Australia's foreign currency rating twice in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Australian economy grew by 4.7 percent in 1998 with
interest rates the lowest in 30 years and inflation well below 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade also reflected continued prudent monetary policy,
which had established a low inflation environment, S&AMP;P said.
</P>
<P>
The other major ratings agency, Moody's Investor Services,
rates Australia at Aa2.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 300 Iraqi Contracts Blocked in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi trade ministry said that 294
contracts, worth nearly 500 million U.S. dollars, are blocked in
the United Nations Sanctions Committee, an Iraqi daily newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qadissiya daily reported that among those contracts, which
have been concluded under the fifth phase of the oil-for-food
program which expires on May 24, 29 are for health care, 73 for
the oil sector, 19 for agriculture, 20 for higher education and 19
for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The total number of contracts submitted to the Sanctions
Committee since the implementation of the fifth phase on November
25 till May 12 amounted to 860, but only 566 contracts were
approved by the committee, despite the availability of funds from
the oil-for-food deal, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to export
limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The contracts Iraq signed with foreign companies under the
program must get approval from the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused United States and British representatives
in the committee of impeding the approval of its contracts.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that a number of Iraqi contracts had been kept
in the drawers of the committee for over three months, which
contradicts the valid procedures that require contracts of the
oil-for-food deal be circulated in two days.
</P>
<P>
The daily pointed out that the delay in implementing contracts
in electricity and sanitation has led to an increase in
environmental pollution and the death of a large number of
children, women and the elderly.

<HEADLINE> China Condemns NATO's Barbarous Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China continues to condemn NATO's
barbarous action of killing the innocent civilians in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia has to date killed over 1,200
innocent civilians and left about 600,000 people homeless, Zhu
Bangzao, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman, told a regular news
conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The bombing has created the largest humanitarian disaster since
World War II and seriously damaged peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always held that the Kosovo issue
should be settled through political means, and China supports the
role of the UN in the process," Zhu stressed, adding that "the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia should be
respected, and the just rights of all ethnic groups in the region
be protected."
</P>
<P>
Zhu reiterated that the pre-condition for a political
settlement is NATO's halt to bombing. "There could be no peace
under gunfire," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China strongly calls for an immediate halt to bombing "in order
to create condition for political settlement," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Taiwan's Splitting Activities: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China has strongly opposed the
Taiwan authorities to use the health and sanitation issues as
excuses for the purpose of carrying out political activities of
splitting the mortherland.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark
here today at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 52nd World Health Organization Assembly,
through unanimous consultations, passed a decision rejecting a
proposal to admit Taiwan into it as an observer in the agenda of
the annual conference, a proposal put forward by Honduras and four
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's attempt to squeeze into the WHO has been firmly
opposed by the international community once again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of China's representation in both the U.N. and WHO
has been settled in a just, comprehensive and thorough way by
Resolution 2758 of the U.N. in 1971 and WHA25.1 Resolution in 1972.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the WHO is a specialized organization of the
United Nations, and only a sovereign state is qualified to join it
and attend its activities.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan, as a province of China, has no qualification to join
such organization or attend the World Health Assembly," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the so-called proposal that Taiwan
attend the WHA as an observer is in essence to create "Two Chinas"
or "One China, One Taiwan," adding that it can find little support
and is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always attached importance to the
legal rights and interests of the Taiwan compatriots and is
concerned about their health and is willing to solve relevant
problems through proper channels of both sides across the Taiwan
Straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
The just cause of the Chinese government and people of
safeguarding the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity
will continue to be supported and understood by the people and
countries which uphold justice, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Businessmen Call For Continued WTO Talks With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States and China
should continue their efforts to negotiate on China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) despite NATO's attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, an American entrepreneur said on
Monday
</P>
<P>
In a meeting here with Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing at the
reception hall of the embassy, Richard Latham, Chairman of the
American Chamber of Commerce in the People's Republic of China,
expressed his condolences over the death of the three Chinese
journalists killed in the "tragic and turbulent event" of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Latham is heading a 27-member American business delegation
whose members are all doing business in China. The team is
representing more than 20 American companies in fields ranging
from manufacture, aerospace, telecommunications, to medical system,
including Boeing, Motorola, Unison, Ford, Westinghouse and so on.
</P>
<P>
"We come here to exert our influence and power of persuasion on
the American government to move ahead vigorously on the WTO and
NTR (Normal Trade Relations) (issues)," said Latham, also
President of the United Technologies Corporation in China.
</P>
<P>
"We need a laser-like focus on China's accession to the WTO.
Certainly there are a lot of work to be done by the group," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is in the interests of China as well as the
United States that there are a balanced relationship and both
countries can participate in the world trade organization.
</P>
<P>
"We'll tell people here in Washington that it's terribly
important for both countries to have these negotiations concluded
successfully and put back on track again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Latham urged the American negotiators to go back to Beijing or
to a neutral country in order to resume talks and "to successfully
complete them" with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"If we're not diligent in this respect, we may lose opportunity
that's exceedingly important to both our countries," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing told the American entrepreneurs that China will
definitely pursue its policy of reform and opening to the outer-
side world. "This is a strategic policy to be applied for a long,
long time," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador stressed that China has remained "the
best and most profitable place to do business" since the outbreak
of the financial crisis in Asia as well as in some other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Despite NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, he
said, foreigners in China are working and traveling as normally as
before. "It's safe to travel in China, and it's safe to work in
China. There should be no worry about the security situation in
the country at present," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating China's "consistent" policy on its entry into the
WTO, Ambassador Li relentlessly castigated "a small number of
politicians" in the United States who alleged that China is trying
to take advantage of the tragic bombing and get tougher on the WTO
issue.
</P>
<P>
"This is to turn black into white and wrong into right," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also retorted some American politicians' belief that China "
is begging" to join the world trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
"Some American politicians in the past always emphasized that
the discussions (on China's accession to the WTO) must be put on
commercially meaningful basis. Why not now ?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hopes that the two countries would adopt a "
very pragmatic, flexible and responsible attitude" toward the WTO
issue.
</P>
<P>
The door-knock delegation of American businessmen, who said
they see eye to eye with Ambassador Li on trade issues, will work
hard on the White House and Capital Hill for the promotion of U.S.-
China business relations in the next few days before going back to
China by the weekend.

<HEADLINE> New China-Australia Model Wool Contract Officially Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia officially
launched a new Model Wool Contract Tuesday that visiting
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade Tim
Fischer said would usher in a new stage in the wool trade between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The model wool contract, worked out following negations between
relevant departments of China, Australia and New Zealand over the
past two years, has been in use since March this year, according
to sources attending the China-Australia Wool Workshop which
opened here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said in an opening speech at the workshop that while
the model contract "provides the best way forward for the
expansion of Australia-China wool trade," the wool workshop will
also "foster an improved level of understanding between the wool
and the wool textiles industries of Australia and China."
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister left Beijing in the morning,
concluding his three-day official visit to China after attending
the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, chief trade negotiator of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said at the opening
ceremony of the workshop that Australian wool has been a leading
gross import product for China, and accounted for more than 50
percent of China's total wool imports.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China imported over 100,000 tons of
Australian wool each year and the total wool imports from
Australia approached 1.2 million tons in all, involving
transaction volume of 5.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chief negotiator described the model contract as helpful in
quality guarantee of imported wool and in the resolution of
possible disputes, thus paving the way for a better trade
relations for the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Barak Pledges Peace With Arabs and Unity at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak said Tuesday morning that he will inject trust and
momentum into the Mideast peace process, which was stalled under
the outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remark at the Rabin Square in Tel Aviv when
addressing a congregation of his supporters celebrating his
landslide triumph.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed he mapped out a tough stance for negotiations
on a final peace deal with the Palestinians that includes a pledge
to retain Israeli control over all of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its undivided
and eternal capital while the Palestinians want it to be the
capital of their future state, should be negotiated in the final
status talks between the two sides, which have yet to start.
</P>
<P>
Till 8:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) Tuesday morning, 99.6 percent of the
4.3 million eligible votes have been tallied, showing that Barak
beat Netanyahu by 56.1 percent to 43.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Barak, Israel's most decorated solider, also pledged to
withdraw Israeli troops from south Lebanon, where Israel set up a
self-styled security zone in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic problems, he pledges to heal Israel's internal
wounds, such as the rifts between the religious and the secular,
Jews and the Arabs, immigrants and veterans, Sephardic Jews of
Mideast origin and Ashkenazi Jews of German backgrounds, which
have widened after five months' of bitter elections campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the disputes, we are brothers, and brothers... walk
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
News of the decisive victory has brought a swift welcome from
foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton offered his "warmest
congratulations" to Barak and pledged to work "energetically for
a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that strengthens Israel's
security."
</P>
<P>
Congratulations also poured in from France, Britain, Jordan and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, hoping Barak's election would
mean the peace process could move forward.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the latest results, Barak's Labor
Party-led One Israel coalition, Netanyahu's Likud Party and Shas,
which represents religious Jews with roots in the Middle East and
North Africa, are the three top winners in the 120-member Knesset
(parliament), with 27, 19, 17 seats respectively.

<HEADLINE> GE Seeks New Opportunity in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Big-name multinational General
Electric is to buy 18 million U.S. dollars worth of products from
the Xi'an Aero Engine Corporation this year, and plans to purchase
30 million dollars worth next year.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights of a recent negotiation between a high-
profile GE delegation and concerned authorities in Shaanxi
Province, an industry source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by GE's Asia-Pacific Senior Vice-
President Goran Malm, completed a fruitful business tour of the
northwest China's province earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, whose members include heads of Asian operations
from GE's plastics, aero engine and other groups, will also join
hands with scientific research centers in Xi'an, the provincial
capital, to develop new locomotive and diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
"With a population of 1.2 billion, China is a huge market for
GE... And we endeavor to seek suppliers in China while providing
high-quality products to Chinese partners," Malm said, quoted by
the source.
</P>
<P>
GE has set up representative offices in more than 20 Chinese
cities and nearly 30 joint ventures and wholly-owned ventures in
the country since the early 1980s. It has sold to Chinese
enterprises 420 locomotives, 400 airplane engines, 56 steam
engines, and various types of lighting installations and medical
apparatus.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, GE's purchases from China totaled 300 million U.S.
dollars, up 40 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the import value from the Xi'an Aero Engine Corporation
will grow at an annual rate of 50 percent. GE will seek more such
trading partners in order to increase its purchase value in China,
" Malm was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is one of the inland provinces where many state-owned
enterprises were built. According to Malm, he has found high
quality labor resources in these enterprises and expressed
satisfaction with the investment environment in the province.
</P>
<P>
By purchasing high quality and well-priced products from
Chinese enterprises, Malm said, GE hopes to help them earn more
foreign exchange and become international product suppliers.

<HEADLINE> China Builds Archives for Relics in Potala Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists and scholars
are working hard to set up complete archives for cultural relics
preserved in the Potala Palace, a symbolic architecture in Lhasa,
capital of China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"Counting and registration of varied cultural relics represents
the most arduous task in protecting the palace," said Qamba Gesang,
director of the Management Department of the Potala Palace.
</P>
<P>
Built in the seventh century, the Potala Palace had been
Tibet's political and religious center of Tibet for centuries,
with tens of thousands of Tibetan cultural relics stored there.
However, the exact number of relics in the palace has never been
registered.
</P>
<P>
"Some history books did include lists of certain precious
relics, but they were far from being complete," said Qamba.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, Qamba and his staff, with the
assistance of experts and scholars, have checked 16 halls and five
special relic storages in the palace, registering and establishing
archives for more than 60,000 relic items.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the relics in the palace can be divided
into three major categories, which have historic, religious and
ethnic significance respectively," said Qamba.
</P>
<P>
The palace administrative department has invited scholars to
make lists of Buddhist scriptures and ancient books scattered in
all corners of the palace. To date, more than 25,000 scriptures
and books have been put on catalogues and the scholars have
completed writing four books relating to this work.
</P>
<P>
However, Qamba acknowledged that in the face of the enormous
collections of relics in the Potala Palace, what they have
accomplished was nothing but a small portion of work to be done.
</P>
<P>
"The palace is like a vast ocean of treasures and it could take
us decades to explore its exact reserves," he added.
</P>
<P>
With a floor space of 130,000 sq m, the Potala Palace has more
than 2,000 room units, including 34 large Buddhist worshipping
halls and 10 major relic storages. It was included in the World
Heritage list at the end of 1994.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has criticized South Africa
over unfair trade practice and said it will revise taxes to stem
a flood of "Made-in-South Africa" goods in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho said here Monday that
South Africa subsidized its products before exporting them, but
put a lid on its won market to ward off regional competition.
</P>
<P>
Kenya imports goods worth 20 billion shillings (about 294
million U.S. dollars) annually from South Africa, but exports
only one billion shillings in goods and services in return,
Kamotho was quoted as saying by Tuesday's Daily Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Chris Kirubi of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers
called South Africa a "spoiler that wants to use the region
merely as the dumping ground for its products."

Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) once said that his bloc,

<HEADLINE> 23rd International Conference on Ornithology To be Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The 23rd international
conference on ornithology will be convened in Beijing in August 11-
17, 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Xu Weishu, a well-known Chinese
ornithologist, said more than 2,000 people will attend the
conference, the first in Asia, which will become a venue for
academic exchanges in the field of ornithology in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Xu, a research fellow with the Nature Museum of Beijing, was
elected as secretary-general for the 23rd conference.
</P>
<P>
The international conference on ornithology was first held in
1884 at a call made by a group of bird specialists from the United
States and Europe. The conference is held once in every four years.
</P>
<P>
China, with a vast territory, abounds in bird resources. Among
the world's 9,200 kinds of verified birds, 1,300 kinds of them are
found in China, said Professor Xu.
</P>
<P>
The ornithologist is here in this Chinese coastal city of
Qinhuangdao, best known for the seaside resort of Beidaihe, in
north China's Hebei Province, to attend an international bird
viewers' contest which was hosted by the tourism bureau of
Beidaihe and the Beidaihe International Bird Viewers Association
last week.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day contest attracted seven delegations with 169 bird
fans. Of the seven delegations, five were from overseas, according
to Xu.

<HEADLINE> East China City Encourages Local Enterprises to Invest Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Ningbo in east
China's Zhejiang Province spares no effort to encourage local
enterprises to invest overseas as a way to help them increase
overseas-market shares and ultimately bring along increased local
exports.
</P>
<P>
The city set up its first company abroad in 1984, and the
number of these companies exceeded 100 by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
These companies located overseas in 29 countries and regions
are involved in businesses including trade, industry, fisheries,
construction, and communications. Their creation helped add 160
million US dollars to exports in Ningbo last year, and has so far
aided the city in introducing 150 million US dollars of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese governments at all levels increasingly attach
importance to developing multinational business by encouraging
local investment abroad, instituting a series of preferential
policies to give impetus to this sector.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ancient Trees Survive on Nutrition Diet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Tree doctors in Beijing have
managed to save 30 trees of more than 1,000 years old after
treating them with a nutrition liquid, either by injecting the
nutrients into the trunks, or placing them in the ground under the
trees.
</P>
<P>
Specialists from the city's garden departments first put
electronic probes deep inside an ancient tree to discover the
relationship between a certain cell causing tree senility and an
imbalance in the tree's nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Specialists discovered that the nutritional imbalance leads to
a large increase in the number of these cells which cause tree
senility.
</P>
<P>
They said that in the past, most ancient trees in Beijing
lacked such necessary elements as nitrogen, iron, zinc and boron.
</P>
<P>
After finding which elements are needed by these ancient trees,
the tree doctors then compounded them into the liquid nutrition to
help bolster the rejuvenation of the tree roots.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said they have successfully saved all the 1,000-
year-old trees with this new technique.
</P>
<P>
According to a census of the city's oldest trees, Beijing has
over 5,000 trees that are at least 300 years old.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Reshuffle Cabinet Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
will reshuffle his cabinet after his return from a visit to Russia
and Mongolia, presidential spokesman Park Jie-won said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following his return from the visit, Kim will consult with
Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil to decide the time and scope of the
cabinet reshuffle, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is designed to replace ministers who plan to run
for legislators at the parliamentary election slated for next
April.
</P>
<P>
President Kim is said to appoint career official and experts to
be ministers rather than politicians.
</P>
<P>
It was initially speculated that President Kim will conduct a
wholesale reshuffle of the cabinet in August but the shuffle has
been advanced about two months ahead of the original plan.
</P>
<P>
However, before his departure for Russia on May 27, Kim will
appoint the heads of four new government organizations whose
establishment will coincide with the reorganization of the
government.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for Japan's adherence to Peaceful Development, Says Chinese Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that Japan will
continue to take the road of peaceful development, Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
state councilor, made the remark during a meeting with Atsushi
Shima, leader of Japan's Forum on China's Politics and Economy,
and his party.
</P>
<P>
This is the 22nd visit to China by a delegation from Japan's
Forum on China's Politics and Economy, which comprises retired
senior officers of Japan's Self-Defence Forces.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Japan are separately only by a strip of
waters, Chi said the further growth of Sino-Japanese friendly and
cooperative partnership devoted to peace and development not only
conforms to the fundamental interests of both peoples, but
contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chi appreciated the efforts made by Japan's Forum on
China's Politics and Economy to promote Sino-Japanese relations
over the years.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan have a long history of friendly exchanges, Chi
said, and there was also a period of unfortunate history in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"Past experience, if not forgotten, can be a guide for the
future, and history can serve as a mirror," said Chi, adding that
Sino-Japanese relations will develop smoothly as long as these
principles are fully observed.
</P>
<P>
Shima, who served as chief of the ground staff of the Japanese
Ground Self-Defence Forces, and paid his first visit to China two
decades ago, said that during his current China visit, he has
witnessed tremendous changes that have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
"Japan hopes to maintain long-term friendly ties with China,"
Shima said, adding that his forum will continue its efforts in
this regard.

</P>
<P>
This is the sixth investment and trade fair organized by the

<HEADLINE> SADC in Trade Deficit With S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- All other members of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) last year recorded a huge
trade deficit with one member, South Africa, said Zambia's
Financial Mail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year South Africa exported goods worth 3.4 billion U.S.
dollars to all other SADC member countries while the latter
exported only 600 million dollars to South Africa, according to
the local weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit is causing concerns among South African trade
 bureaucrats and politicians that unless South Africa opens up its
markets to its neighbors particularly the non-SADC and member
countries of Southern African Customs Union (SACU), South Africa's
exports will gradually dwindle because of inadequate foreign
currency in the countries.
</P>
<P>
Next month, SADC is expected to hold a trade negotiating forum
in Lusaka with South Africa to announce a comprehensive offer of
its markets to other non-SACU but SADC member countries.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bad Bank Loans Overshadow Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A further rise of the non-performing
loans (NPLs) ratio of the Philippine banks, caused by credit
crunch, could slow down the government's efforts of pump priming
the economy and dim the prospect of a quick pickup, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As of March this year, the NPLs of the country's 53 commercial
banks climbed to at least 13 percent of the outstanding loan
portfolio of the industry, from 12.8 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the country's central bank attributed the increase
of the NPLs ratio to the deceleration of loan disbursement and
availability.
</P>
<P>
"The trend shows NPLs are still increasing because banks have
not started lending that much," a source from the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The country's lending activities dropped by 4.3 percent in
March this year from the year ago level, a report of the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The net domestic credit (NDC) of deposit money banks, another
barometer of economic activities, further contracted by 0.72
percent and by 1.16 percent in March from its year and month ago
levels.
</P>
<P>
Credit to the private sector, which constitutes the bulk of the
total NDC, declined 4.17 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson earlier admitted it was
possible for NPLs to further expand in the next few months unless
credit operations pick up soon.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts see no rapid credit growth because the
interplay of the NPLs and the weakness in the economy, especially
in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
As a precondition for renewed lending activities, banks will
have to liquidate their non-performing assets first, they said.
</P>
<P>
Leonillo Coronel, executive director of the Bankers Association
of the Philippines, said the banks are also more concerned right
now over the quality of the loans they extend, instead of the
spreads.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, in March this year, production and sales for
total manufacturing continued to decline, a government report
said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of production declined by 3.3 percent from a year
earlier and the volume of net sales decreased by 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total import bill for the first quarter was 7.305 billion
U.S. dollars, down by 9.1 percent from 8.037 billion U.S. dollars
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports of unprocessed raw materials,
semi-processed raw materials and some capital goods could largely
indicate the performance of industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to some extent, the NPLs could block the
government's drive to stimulate the economy by expanding budget
deficit to 1.71 billion U.S. dollars, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit of the Philippines could balloon to as much
as 2.25 billion U.S. dollars this year instead of only 1.71
billion U.S. dollars as originally projected, they said.
</P>
<P>
The scenario is possible, assuming the Bureau of Internal
Revenue continues to underperform or miss its revenue goal this
year, they said.
</P>
<P>
They said the weak revenue collection was due partly to the
increasing incidence of bank NPLs.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial sector taxes totaled only 1.88 billion
U.S. dollars for the first quarter this year against 2.23 billion
U.S. dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"There was a decline in financial sector taxes which was linked
to higher NPLs for the period," a government source said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippine banks remain healthier than many of
their regional counterparts, the NPLs still pose a challenge to
the recovery.
</P>
<P>
Unless the banking system posts significant improvements in the
NPLs, the economy will continue to feel some of the negative
effects, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Macao-Born Portuguese Keen to Learn Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese language has been
increasingly popular among the Macao-born Portuguese, who are keen
to learn this official language of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese language course is now offered to government
functionaries and local college students, and on radio and
television broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The Macao-born Portuguese, especially the Portuguese civil
servants, are eager to learn the Chinese and Putonghua (standard
spoken Chinese), to meet the language demand for their future work.
</P>
<P>
Macao has now some 10,000 residents of Portuguese origin. the
Portuguese and Cantonese are the languages most used in their
lives and work, but most of them cannot read Chinese or speak
Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
Rita Botelho dos Santos, president of the Macao Civil Servant's
Association, has learned Chinese for 13 years. Up to now, she
keeps attending the Chinese language course for eight hours every
week.
</P>
<P>
"If you work hard, the Chinese is not so difficult to learn,"
said Santos, who used to attend training courses at the Beijing
Language and Culture University and the State Administrative
College in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Santos is now proud of her standard Chinese, saying that she is
now able to handle both Portuguese and Chinese documents at ease
and without slight difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Except for herself, Santos engages a private teacher to teach
her children Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Most Macao-born Portuguese take Macao our home," said Santos,
"Faced with the new environment after Macao's return to the
motherland on December 20, we should learn Chinese still better
and seek more opportunities of development in Macao."

<HEADLINE> Time Not Ripe for U.S. Envoy on Bombing Investigation Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China said today that it is still
early for an U.S. envoy to come inform the Chinese side of the
investigation results on the NATO attack against the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia, which killed three and wounded over 20.
</P>
<P>
"Time is still not ripe for the U.S. to send their special
envoy now" although President Bill Clinton has made a commitment
to do it, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao at a
regular press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, the pressing need, Zhu cited what Chinese
President Jiang Zemin told his U.S. counterpart in their recent
telephone conversation, is that the U.S. government should make a
comprehensive, thorough and fair investigation of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government should also make the results of the
investigation public to satisfy all demands of the Chinese
government and the Chinese people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the spokesman noted, "the investigation should be
carried out in a serious and fair manner instead of being done
perfunctorily."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the impact of the bombing on Sino-
U.S. relations, Zhu said that President Jiang had told his U.S.
counterpart that "the incident had damaged China-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted President Jiang as saying that "China has
always placed importance on the ties with the United States. And
the key to the issue is to strictly adhere to the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence, especially the principle of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity."

<HEADLINE> Manila Strengthens Its Anti-transnational Crime Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- In line with his commitment to stamp
out crimes that transcend national borders, Philippine President
Joseph Estrada has placed four agencies with police functions
directly under control of the Philippine Center for Transnational
Crime (PCTC).
</P>
<P>
"There is a compelling need to strengthen the operational,
administrative and information support system of the PCTC in order
that the Center can successfully and effectively carry out its
mission and functions," he said in his Executive Order No. 100
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he expects his EO 100 to rationalize and
coordinate all government activities for the prevention and
control of transnational crimes.
</P>
<P>
Placed under PCTC supervision are the Loop Center of the
National Action Committee on Anti-Hijacking and Anti-Terrorism
(NACAHT) and the International Police National Central Bureau
(Interpol NCB), along with police attaches and counselors for
security matters under the Department of Interior and Local
Government (DILG).
</P>
<P>
The Loop Center aims to assist and support NACAHT in
integrating and orchestrating efforts of the law enforcement
agencies against international and domestic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Interpol's NCB is the main coordinating body for international
police cooperation against transnational crimes.
</P>
<P>
Police and political attaches, the president noted, will be
stationed in Philippine diplomatic missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, there is a need to streamline and systematize
participation in international training activities, seminars and
conferences on transnational offenses.
</P>
<P>
Estrada created the PCTC last January to formulate and
implement a concerted program of action of all law enforcement,
intelligence and other agencies for the prevention and control of
transnational crimes.

<HEADLINE> Women Urged to Prevent Conflicts in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour has called on women in Africa to make joint efforts to
prevent armed clashes on the continent which lead to untold
sufferings.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts and violence had wasted a lot of resources and
damaged infrastructure extensively, thus affecting the development
of Africa, media reports Tuesday quoted Amour as saying.
</P>
<P>
Opening a Pan-African women's conference for the promotion of
peace Monday in Zanzibar, he said it was shocking to note that in
1998 alone, 14 of the 53 African states got embroiled in armed
conflicts, which caused more than half of the deaths related to
wars worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The number of displaced persons in Africa, as a result of the
conflicts, was close to eight million people, 80 percent of whom
were the vulnerable groups of women and children, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have witnessed wanton killings, pregnant women delivering
babies on their way to seek asylum and malnutrition among
refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said women should join the fight against the sowing of seeds
of hatred based on religion, ethnicity or political affiliation
among people.
</P>
<P>
Africa must work out better strategies to build a culture of
peace and tolerance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar president called on Africans to strive for
diplomatic and political solutions rather than opting for civil
wars as the means of solving internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe, said at the conference
that although women are the major labor force, they reaped very
little from their production.
</P>
<P>
She called on women to play their role to avoid civil wars and
be at a forefront in poverty alleviation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, attended by 200 women from various
African countries, is co-sponsored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and
the Organization of African Unity (OAU).

<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China said today that the election
last Saturday of the Macao Special Administration Region (SAR)
Chief Executive candidate has demonstrated the principles of
fairness, impartiality, openness, democracy and honesty.

The election completely conformed to the Basic Law of Macao SAR
and relevant resolutions of China's National People's Congress,
said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao at a regular

Government, Ho will begin the work of organizing the Macao SAR
government in accordance with the Basic Law of Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>

SAR Government, Macao will be ushered in a new period in which the
police of "one country, two systems", the principles of Macao
people administering Macao and high-degree autonomy of Macao will
be achieved," he added.

MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The head of the largest labor union
in Philippine Airlines (PAL) threw his support behind airline
chairman Lucio Tan's last-ditch bid to keep the flag carrier
flying through a novel "no strike" pledge in exchange for investor

unorthodox solutions to save PAL," he said in an obvious reference
to Tan.
</P>
<P>
"In our desire to save PAL, though it is unpopular, I will
certainly open myself again to criticism from some sectors in the
labor movement," he added in reference to the urgent need for
suspension of the union's Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
for 10 years, a condition laid out by prospective investors in the
ailing carrier.
</P>
<P>
In his own letter to PAL staff the same day, Tan pleaded for
union support to buttress his efforts to find investors willing to
bail out the cash-strapped airline.
</P>
<P>
"I need your support to convince our investors. We need to
assure them with a no-strike pledge and the suspension of your CBA
for 10 years. This will help elicit trust and confidence from
them, which in turn will make our creditors trust us to keep our
airplanes," Tan wrote to employees.
</P>
<P>
To make up for the CBA suspension, Tan has offered each PAL
employee 60,000 shares of stock from his personal holdings in the
airline and allocated three seats in the company's 15-man board of
directors for union representatives.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that he had managed to "pull together enough
resources" to meet the 200 million U.S. dollar fresh capital
infusion into PAL demanded by creditors but that he was afraid of
encountering the "same historic fatal strikes and
misunderstandings" that plagued PAL in the past.
</P>
<P>
The airline has a history of industrial discord, particularly
during periods of financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Last year, both PALEA and the pilots union staged wildcat
strikes that worsened PAL's financial distress in the midst of the
Asian economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Strong Economies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has urged that it is imperative for Africa to build a strong
economic base for itself as its plight is not on the agenda of
major world powers.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting Monday the construction of an exhibition site,
Moi said Africans had realized that their problems were casually
treated as a peripheral issue, the Kenya Times newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The President noted that for political independence to be
meaningful, it has to be founded on a strong local economic base.
</P>
<P>
"We can not survive on an economy based entirely on foreign
investment," he said, adding that local businessmen should
diversify their investment for creating more job opportunities to
cater for the growing population.
</P>
<P>
African leaders, Moi said, should not over-concentrate their
energies on political power at the expense of the economic
well-being of the continent, and should use local resources to
improve agriculture, education and health.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all the members of the COMESA to give full
support to the organization, saying that it was bound to be a
strong economic pillar in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Island Residents Benefit from Fresh Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 30,000 island residents, off
the northeast China city of Dalian in Liaoning Province have bid
farewell to long-standing shortage of fresh water, as the
country's largest sea water desalination project recently became
operational.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Dachangshan Island, the seat of
Changhai County in Liaoning, has been in severe shortage of fresh
water resources, and local residents had to rely mainly on
accumulating rainwater.
</P>
<P>
 The sea water desalination project, which began last October,
was completed at a cost of 14 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
With imported technology from the United States, the new
facility is capable of producing 1,000 tons of fresh water daily.
</P>
<P>
Now, a full day's fresh-water supply is guaranteed for the
county seat of Changhai, thanks to this project, coupled with
Dachangshan Island's previous fresh-water supplying capacity,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Many cities in north China suffer from severe water shortages,
and some have made huge investments to build project for diverting
water from faraway inland rivers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Committed to Domestic Bond Market Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Bank Negara (State
Bank) Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said Tuesday Bank Negara
is committed to the development of the ringgit (local currency)
bond market this year.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be focused on introducing a shelf registration
scheme for private debt securities, on deepening the repo market
and broadening the investor base, he said at a National Credit
Management Conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said "It is hoped the further development of the domestic
bond market will increase the menu of debt instruments available
for companies to enhance the management of their liabilities."
</P>
<P>
In managing their debt policies, companies should strive to
avoid the maturity mismatch problem by financing long-term
projects with long-term borrowings, he said, adding corporations
might also wish to consider funding projects on a fixed-rate basis
to enable them to have more certainty in their planning as well as
to avoid being caught with debt-servicing problems should interest
rates rise sharply as a result of external shocks.
</P>
<P>
He said companies intending to undertake long-term capital
investment should diversify their funding sources by tapping into
their ringgit bond market.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the latest indications are that the economic
recovery process has picked up momentum as the trade account
remained in a surplus, amounting to 15.7 billion ringgit (about
4.131 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of 1999 and
contributing to the build-up in international reserves which
totaled 108.7 billion ringgit (about 28.605 billion U.S. dollars)
at the end of April 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the volume of manufacturing production
continued to increase on an annual basis in March 1999 while the
inflation rate continued its moderating trend to 2.9 percent in
April 1999, he said.

<P>
XI'AN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
at the middle reaches of the Yellow River, is speeding up
construction of water-control projects along the river.
</P>
<P>
A 716-km-long section of the Yellow River runs through Shaanxi,
with the valley covering 67 percent of the province's total area.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of floods 20-40 percent heavier than normal
years, the provincial government earmarked a record 3.2 billion
yuan for water conservancy projects since last winter, 1.2 billion
yuan more than the figure for the winter-spring period last year.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have been organized to reinforce river
embankments and repair dangerous reservoirs, with the daily labor
force topping 600,000 people, 120,000 more than last year. They
have completed 10,000 projects, dredged up 527 km of the river,
heightened embankments stretching 1,330 km, and repaired 175
reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The province has also stored 900,000 straw and gunny bags and
200,000 cubic meters of materials for emergency use, and has
created 3,000 emergency-repair teams.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Steps up Efforts to Exterminate Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is calling for redoubled
efforts to prepare computer systems for any possible strike by the
so-called "millennium bug" that threatens information technology
at the turn of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Some progress has been made in this regard, and more than 95
percent of the departments and units have set up special offices
to deal with the Y2K problem, but the overall picture is still not
so optimistic, and more effort need to be made," according to the
municipal official in charge of fighting the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
So far, 18 such units have come up with solutions to the Y2K
problem, while 78 percent have entered the final stage toward
solving it.
</P>
<P>
But various problems still remain, such as delayed placement of
funds, incomplete examinations of computer systems, and general
lack of expediency for solutions to the bug problem, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
The office recently checked the computer systems of 27 key
units including public utilities, medicine, transportation, and
fire control, and found that 63 percent of the units are having
problems dealing with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
that use two digits to indicate the date, and it is feared that
many of these computers will fail on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Effects of the millennium bug may include erroneous
cancellations of customer orders or shipments of goods and
supplies, premature expirations of licenses and credit cards, and
miscalculations or non-payments of salaries.

<HEADLINE> Growing Retail Sales in New Zealand Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in New Zealand rose
1.9
percent in March, one of the largest monthly rises in the past
year,
according to Statistics New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The rise was much higher than the market expectation of 0.4
percent
and took the annual increase to its highest level for the fiscal
year
ending March 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, which was made public here Tuesday, the New

Zealand official statistical organ said that excluding the
volatile car
sector, core retail sales were up 6.9 percent for the fiscal year,
the
highest level for almost four years, with food sales being the
biggest
contributor to the monthly rise.
</P>
<P>
Actual retail sales in March were worth 3.5 billion NZ dollars
(about
two billion U.S. dollars), up 4.8 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade in New Zealand makes up about 40 percent of
consumption
spending, so the latest sales figures reinforced a 0.8 percent
rise in
its gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Powerful retail sales in March gave further weight to a strong

domestic-led economic recovery driven by household spending.

<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to secure the safe return of
the remaining 16 Zimbabwean soldiers captured at an air field in
Kabalo in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) last year are
still on, a defence spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said despite the failure last year to undertake
an exchange of prisoners of war, with Zimbabwe surrendering 43
Rwandan captives in its custody for the return of its 16 soldiers,
alternative solutions to the crisis are being explored, The Herald
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing all we can to ensure the return of our captured
men. The initial process was aborted on the last minute when
Rwanda reneged on arrangements it had agreed to," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Rwanda and Zimbabwe had initially worked out a plan to
swap captives, during which Rwanda would have received 43 of its
troops in return for the 16 Zimbabwean troops.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that an international humanitarian
organization was to act as an intermediary in the process, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 43 Rwandan soldiers were flown from Kinshasa to Zimbabwe to
enable the exchange. The Rwandan soldiers are still being held at
a Zimbabwean military base, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Metro Manila of Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists at a recent
regional water meeting raised an alarm over Metro Manila's over
dependence on deep wells, Philippines' News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the recently concluded Regional Meeting on Water Sector
Mapping and Vision, Hasik Earth Advocates, an environmental group,
presented a paper claiming that the city may be endangering its
own future taking too much water from the ground and compromising
the stability of the soil.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the water sector and representatives from
international organizations, bilateral development agencies and
the private sector attended the meeting hosted by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the current volume of water extraction --
about 250 liters per second in the Metro Manila's Makati Business
District alone -- is comparable to digging a 6,000-wide-by-one
meter-hole every day, adding that "every month the hole grows
deeper by 30 meters."
</P>
<P>
Data from the National Water Resources Board (NWRB), the
Philippines' government agency tasked with regulating the use of
local water resources, show that ground water depletion has been
directly linked to subsidence or the lowering of ground levels.
</P>
<P>
"This has happened in many cities in Latin America -- the
ground has sunk by more than six feet over the last 50 years in
some places there, " NWRB said, adding that there were some
reported sinking in some parts of Metro Manila that are being
blamed on unregulated water extraction.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Meeting on Water Sector Mapping and Vision was
part of the regional technical assistance project for water
resources management in Southeast Asia, administered by the ADB
for Global Water Partnership.
</P>
<P>
The meeting identified priority assistance needs in the water
sector in each member and assessed the availability of expertise
in the region to provide such assistance.
</P>
<P>
It also formulated a regional vision of water, life and
environment in 2025 and developed a regional framework for action
to attain it. This will be presented to the Second World Water
Forum in March 2000 in the Hague, the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The heaviest rainfall of the spring
since Monday night has been damping east China's Shandong Province,
greatly relieving the serious draught throughout the province, the
provincial flood-control and draught-relief headquarters said
today.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall is a result of the conjunction of a cyclone from
the Huaihe-Yangtze river valley with cold air from northern China.
The rainfall has been moving eastward, covering nearly the entire
province.
</P>
<P>
The favorable rainfall averages over 15 millimeters, with the
maximum reaching 55 millimeters, the headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Before the rain, there were some 992,000 hectares of crops in
the province suffering from the draught which began several months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall is expected to help increase grain output in the
province, a leading grain producer of the country.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of
Sierra Leone said that his government and the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) rebels had made progress in their peace talks
currently taking place in Lome, Togo.
</P>
<P>
He said Monday that the RUF's decision to transform itself into
a political party is welcomed since his country's constitution
allows for freedom of association, according to a report by Ghana
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Sierra Leone are tired of war and conflicts
which have had a devastating effect on them," he said, adding
that ''for the past eight years all governments have been
fighting the rebels''
</P>
<P>
Kabbah was speaking to reporters on arrival at the Kotoka
International airport, Ghana, for the fifth African-African
American Summit which got underway Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said he will fly to Lome Tuesday to hold direct talks with
Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF.
</P>
<P>
A further meeting by foreign ministers of the committee of six
on Sierra Leone would be held on May 24 this year to deliberate
on the peace proposals of both parties.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said while in Ghana he would hold discussions with his
Ghanaian counterpart, Jerry Rawlings, on the situation in his
country which, he hopes, would bring a lasting solution to the
war.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings on his part said the presence of President
Kabbah will offer the opportunity for both leaders to discuss
issues relating to peace and tranquillity which he described as
a foundation to the way forward.

<HEADLINE> Results of Israeli Premier Election Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, May 18 (Xinhua) -- One Israel leader Ehud Barak has
beaten sitting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by 56 percent to
44 percent, unofficial final results of Israeli elections showed
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Television Channel One reported that all 4.29 million
eligible votes have been tallied across the country till 10
a.m. (0700 GMT), which gave Barak, the most decorated solider, a
landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
It added that official results are expected in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Barak won with campaign messages stressing his illustrious
military career, a search for national reconciliation and
Netanyahu's failure to make peace with Israel's neighbors or
bring prosperity to the country.
</P>
<P>
Many saw that Barak's victory is a triumph for national unity
in a country that is seeing bitter divisions, such as growing
animosity between the secular and religious, Jews and Arabs,
immigrants and veterans, and Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malam Systems, a company authorized to provide
election figures to the media, said that Barak's Labor Party,
part of One Israel, maintains as the largest party in the next
Knesset (parliament) with 27 seats, but suffers a 7-seats erosion
compared with the current seats it is holding in the outgoing
14th Knesset.
</P>
<P>
According to the results, Netanyahu's Likud dropped from 32 to
19 seats while Shas, which represents ultra-Orthodox Jews with
roots in the Middle East and North Africa, jumped to 17 seats from
the current 10, becoming the third-largest party in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Parties aligned with Barak will have 51 seats and Netanyhu's
allies will seize 53, with the remaining seats belonging to the
centrist parties that could go either way.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Convention-Exhibition Business Remains Robust (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Hosting the International General
Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) for a second
time, Hong Kong again proves that its convention and exhibition
business continues to be robust despite the economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Entering May, the 15th International Computer Expo and a number
of industrial fairs were staged right before the PBEC conference
and a parallel investment forum was held.
</P>
<P>
Since April, Hong Kong has played host to a series of events
and they include the Asia-Pacific Regional Conference for the
International Year of Older Persons, the Asian Industrial
Technology Congress and the Asia Pacific Leather Fair.
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention
Organizers' and Suppliers' Association concludes that major
exhibitions in Hong Kong attracted more than expected overseas
buyers, demonstrating the popularity of Hong Kong and Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, large-scale expositions of toys, fashion,
gifts, leather and jewelry staged in Hong Kong recorded respective
increases of between 20 percent to 70 percent in the number of
buyers.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong boasts special attraction to international trade
fairs, says Michael Duck, director of Miller Freeman Asia, which
acquired last week the Computer Expo from Business &AMP; Industrial
Trade Fairs Ltd.
</P>
<P>
A noticeable character of the exhibition industry is that
exhibitors from outside Hong Kong - overseas and China's mainland -
accounted for roughly half of the total.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging that Hong Kong's fair business maintains an
enjoyable, all-round growth in last year's unfavorable economic
environment, an official of the Exhibition and Convention
Organizers' and Suppliers' Association says.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Convention-Exhibition Business Remains Robust (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robust exhibition and convention business has helped
stimulate Hong Kong's and even Asia's economy, as well as promote
Hong Kong's international status, says the official.
</P>
<P>
An earlier analysis of the association shows that the
exhibition and convention business in 1997 produced directly or
indirectly a total revenue of 6.3 billion HK dollars (808 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The analysis was based on the assumption that one HK dollar in
revenue from the exhibition business would create 5 HK dollars in
revenue for other sectors combined, including retail sales, hotels,
catering and communication.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exhibitions and conventions, which usually come
along with each other, have created some 9,000 jobs for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Administrators and dealers say the exhibition and convention
business has benefited to a large extent from the use of the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC), where the ceremony
of Hong Kong's return to China was held on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Michael Coad, who produced and brought to Hong Kong a "
gymnasium version" or in-the-round set of the classical ballet "
Swan Lake," praises the grand building for its "magnificence" and
beauty that would become part of his show.
</P>
<P>
Before the construction of the HKCEC, which has 25,500 square
meters of exhibition and convention space, the exhibition industry
of Hong Kong had long been constrained by the lack of dedicated
venues.
</P>
<P>
Last year's results have shown that Hong Kong's exhibition and
convention business will maintain its growing momentum and
potentials although such growth can not be expected to be as
strong as it was right after the opening of the HKCEC, according
to the administrators.

<HEADLINE> Textile Industry Shows Signs of Turn-Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The textile industry, the flagship
of China's restructuring of state-owned enterprises, has begun to
show signs of turning around, as production, sales and profits are
growing.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the State Administration of
Textile Industry (SATI), the production of cotton yarn, synthetic
fiber, cloth and silk products increased in the first three months
of this year compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
State-owned textile enterprises saw a total output of 38.6
billion yuan (4.65 billion US dollars), an increase of 5.25
percent over the same period last year. Added value of these
enterprises reached 8.59 billion yuan, an increase of 14.8 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Economic efficiency has also improved, and sales for the first
three months of the year increased 1.79 percent to 35.36 billion
yuan over the same period of last year. Sales for March soared to
14.1 billion yuan, increasing 32 percent over the average level of
the previous two months.
</P>
<P>
Though product prices fell 10.7 percent on a year-on-year basis,
profits of these state-owned enterprises increased due to
increasing sales and decreasing costs. The ratio of sales to
production improved by 6.36 percentage points for the period,
while profits increased by 100 million yuan to 3.48 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Mergers and down-sizing of the state-owned enterprises, debt
write-offs, and lower interest rates for bank loans all combined
to help reduce their debt. For the period, their asset-debt ratio
decreased by 2.86 percentage points to 75.1 percent on a year-one-
year basis.
</P>
<P>
Lower financial and managerial costs helped state textile
enterprises reduce losses by 650 million yuan from the same period
last year, posing a net loss of 1.42 billion yuan for the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
A SATI official said, however, that pressures of a lackluster
market began to cool down the surging trend of expanding
production in the textile industry for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
For the first three months of the year, textile exports fell
near one-fourth over the same period of last year, as prices in
the domestic market dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
The official predicts that in the second quarter of the year
exports will further slump, though the Republic of Korea and
Japanese markets may improve.
</P>
<P>
The SATI forecasts that in the next three months production and
sales of textile will fall back slightly as stockpiles grow.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have cracked a major
value-added invoice forgery case, arresting five people suspected
of forging 11 million yuan worth of invoices, the Ministry of
Public Security said today.
</P>
<P>
Police learned April 8 that Lin Mengxi, a machine and
electrical dealer in Harbin, capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, was illegally selling value-added invoices.
</P>
<P>
Police began an investigation immediately, and carried out a
surprise search of Lin's residence in the small hours of April 23,
seizing 11 books of value-added invoices and a number of blank
valued-added invoices illegally purchased from outside the
province, along with 16 official seals of various types.
</P>
<P>
Initial interrogations have revealed that since last year Lin
and his partners have been engaged in illicitly trading and
forging value-added invoices.
</P>
<P>
The case involves more than 130 enterprises in a number of
provinces, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up Courts to Deal With Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will set up separate
courts in all its six divisions to expedite settlement of cases
relating to environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
The new courts will be set up in accordance with a new law,
which has been drafted by the government.
</P>
<P>
The courts will be treated as criminal courts and will enjoy
all the powers and authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1998, the Financial Express daily newspaper Tuesday quoted
official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government will appoint judges for these courts from among
the additional district judges through consultation with the
Supreme Court, they said.
</P>
<P>
The environmental pollution cases will be disposed of within
six months of their filing after these courts are set up.
</P>
<P>
Nobody can raise questions about the verdict to be given by the
new courts under the planned law called Environmental Court Act,
1999.
</P>
<P>
But, if one feels aggrieved, he can appeal to the High Court
Division of the Supreme Court within 30 days of giving the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
All the under-trial cases at other courts will be transferred
to the environmental courts as soon as they are established.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese young people were
killed overnight in Israeli shelling on a village in south
Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two cousins, aging 19 and 24, were killed when Israeli
forces' shelled the village of Zawtar in the western sector of
the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the incident, guerrillas of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, unleashed a barrage of Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel as a retaliation for the killing
of two civilians, the group's statement said.
</P>
<P>
But, the rocketing did not inflict any human casualties except
some material damages.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's Katyusha attack also prompted Israeli retaliatory
air raid on villages and hills in south Lebanon. There has been no
report of the casualties from the raid.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, a total of six Lebanese civilians have been
killed in conflicts between Israeli forces and lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
South Lebanon Army out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest violence came the same day when Israeli Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak swept to a landslide victory in the
country's election for prime minister, defeating the hardline
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In the run up to the election, Barak promised that if he won he
would withdraw Israeli troops out of Lebanon within one year.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa said Monday it
would do everything possible to help tighten United Nations
sanctions on the Angolan rebel movement, National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Marco Boni, spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Department said
his country was one of the firm backers of the embargo against the
Angolan insurgents, and his department was looking for ways to
tighten the boycott.
</P>
<P>
Boni said the governments of Angola and South Africa would seek
a common strategy to isolate UNITA because of its consistent break
of the accords meant to bring peace to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The South African government had also offered to assist Robert
Fowler, chairman of the United Nations Sanctions Committee, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, Canada's ambassador to the world body, is touring a
number of African nations for talks aimed to tighten the sanctions
against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Boni made the announcement as Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda arrived in South Africa to discuss the sanctions issue.

continued abuses of international accords.

<HEADLINE> European Countries Urge NATO to Halt Bombing in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 researchers from the European
University based in Florence on Monday criticized NATO for bombing
Yugoslavia and urged the alliance to halt the military action to
restore peace to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
They made the call in a letter to NATO Deputy Secretary General
Sergio Balanzino who is coming here to attend a seminar on NATO
expansion.
</P>
<P>
They said that NATO's military action against Yugoslavia
without the authorization of the United Nations was unlawful and
set a very dangerous precedence.
</P>
<P>
They noted that NATO's bombing could not bring peace to
Yugoslavia, and that it only made the situation and the refugee
crisis in the country worse.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Italy's Peace Forum and Anti-War Committee
published open letters, urging the Italian government to call for
an immediate end to the bombing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Warsaw said that more than a dozen
parliamentarians wrote an appeal letter on Monday, urging the
Polish government and parliament to take immediate action to stop
NATO's bombing in Yugoslavia and restore peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
The letter asked Polish soldiers not to take part in this "
dirty war" launched illegally by NATO.
</P>
<P>
In the Portuguese city of Porto, a left-wing youth organization
leader condemned NATO's military action under the excuse of
protecting ethnic Albanians' human rights.
</P>
<P>
The bombing has caused humanitarian and ecological disaster in
the Balkans, she said in a published statement.
</P>
<P>
She called on Portuguese young people to unite and to fight for
peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Congratulates Barak's Victory in Israeli Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Monday congratulated Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak for his
victory in the Israeli election.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the American people, I want to extend my warmest
congratulations to Ehud Barak upon his election as Israel's new
prime minister," Clinton said in a statement. "The people of
Israel have given the new prime minister a strong mandate."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had spoken by telephone to Barak as well as to
outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and had pledged to work
"energetically for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that
strengthens Israel's security."
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to working closely with Ehud Barak and his new
government as they strive to reach that goal with their
Palestinian and Arab partners," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Barak's victory would restore U.S.
trust in the Israeli government and pave the way for a revival of
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. diplomatic source said the Clinton administration
would waste little time in trying to revive Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks by sending its special envoy Dennis Ross to the Middle
East following Barak's ouster of Netanyahu on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We can expect Dennis to come within the next couple of weeks
or as soon as Barak forms his coalition," said the diplomatic
source.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has already laid out U.S. strategy for the post-
election period, including implementation of the Wye agreement,
signed last October by the Israeli and Palestinian leaders under
the brokerage of Clinton, and a one-year target period for
completing Israeli-Palestinian talks on a final settlement.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Leading Paper Backs China in Urging Halt of NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- It is entirely justified for
China to require the halt of NATO's air strikes on Yugoslavia as
the precondition for discussing the Kosovo issue on the U.N.
Security Council, the leading newspaper of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) said in a commentary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, carried on Rodong Sinmun, said that only after
NATO stops its bombardment of Yugoslavia, can the Kosovo issue be
properly solved in the request and interest of the Yugoslav people
and the fundamental condition for ensuring a prolonged peace in
Europe be established.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo issue is an internal affair of Yugoslavia, which the
United States and the U.S.-led NATO should not interfere in under
any pretext, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
To attack a sovereign nation by force cannot be justified
anyway, it said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the May 7 attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, the commentary said the arrogance of the U.S.-led NATO
has gone so far that it does not even discriminate the targets of
its attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack is a blatant trampling on international laws and
justice as well as a war crime, it said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat Urges Comprehensive, Thorough Probe Into Embassy Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Li Zhaoxing, Chinese ambassador
to the United States, on Monday urged the U.S. government to carry
out a "comprehensive, thorough and just" probe into the bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and make public the result at an
earliest date.
</P>
<P>
Li, in an interview with Washington-based Chinese
correspondents, said China has always attached great importance to
the improvement and development of Sino-U.S. relations. It is the
United States that has profoundly hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people and the relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Justice is on the side of the Chinese people, and the United
States must conduct a comprehensive, thorough and just
investigation into the violent event that took place on the Black
Friday of May 7," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that after an across-the-board and thorough probe,
the culprits for the atrocious crime should be brought to justice
and punished in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador refuted American media allegations that
the massive wave of protests in China was "orchestrated" by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO committed a serious crime by bombing the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and it is only natural and reasonable
that the Chinese people show their strong indignation. How could
there have been any need to 'fan up' this sort of sentiment?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that up to now more than 100 countries have
denounced and protested in various forms against the attack on the
Chinese embassy, and people in Washington, New York, London,
Vancouver, Berlin and many other big cities, too, have staged
demonstrations against NATO's savage act.
</P>
<P>
Then, who could have "instigated" all these protests? Li said.
</P>
<P>
Those who disseminated the "fanned-up" stories have
underestimated and insulted the Chinese people's sense of justice
and their patriotic enthusiasm, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These call-white-black assertions are aimed at sowing discord
and shirking responsibility, which can arouse even greater
indignation. They serve to lay bare a serious lack of good
conscience on the part of those who made the allegations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that a majority of the countries in the world have
condemned NATO's raid of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, and
expressed their sympathy and support for the Chinese people, but
all these have been blocked by the major media in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"Why those media, which always claim to brace for 'freedom of
speech' and 'objective and balanced reporting,' dare not present a
true picture of the event?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Li lashed out at some columnists here who went even so far as
to say that "apology (to China) is a big error."
</P>
<P>
"This single line," he said, "bluntly points to the arrogance
and prejudice of some media organizations in the United States,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the past week, I've received thousands of letters and E-
mails, in which many American citizens voiced their detestation at
the American media. Some of them said that if the same thing had
happened to the United States, you could not imagine how American
media would have played it up," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Li said U.S. Congress seems to hanker after all kinds of
investigations, for which it usually spares no efforts nor green
backs. But when it comes to such a serious incident in which
innocent people got killed, sovereignty encroached upon and the U.
N. Charter trampled, Capitol Hill has shown a surprising coldness
and lack of human sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
To be worse, some politicians here even tried to shift the
responsibility to others, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Their attitude has clearly shown to the world the hypocrisy and
double standards they have assumed on such major issues as human
rights, rule of law and morality.

<P>
Li also retorted the so-called China's attempts to make use of
the missile attack to press the United States into concessions in
talks on China's accession into the World Trade Organization and
some other issues.
</P>
<P>
"Such an allegation has an ulterior motive and presents a
typical case in which the defendant preempts a lawsuit against the
plaintiff. It is the U.S.-led NATO that has committed so atrocious
a crime rarely seen in the history of international relations, and
poisoned the atmosphere of Sino-U.S. relations. The U.S.-led NATO
should be held responsible for all the consequences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese ambassador reassured the safety of all
foreigners in China, noting that this has also been confirmed by
foreigners now doing business or traveling in China.

BELGRADE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Sergio Viera de Mello, U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The central China province of Henan,
and eastern Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces along the Huaihe
River have stepped up their efforts to prepare for possible severe
flooding this summer.
</P>
<P>
Flood-control experts warn that there will possibly be heavy
rainfall in northern China this year which may cause flooding on
the Yellow and Huaihe rivers.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, the four provincial governments have
placed flood prevention at the top of their agendas, and local
governments at different levels have all establish up a flood-
prevention responsibility system.
</P>
<P>
Overall inspections were conducted on major dikes, reservoirs
and sluice gates along the Huaihe river over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Anhui, which in the past frequently suffered floods on the
river, has repaired over 100 kilometers of embankments and 240
culverts and sluice gates, and flood-control materials such as
sand and sandbags are being stored near key sections along the
river.
</P>
<P>
A drive was begun recently to increase public awareness of the
importance of flood control in these provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, last year's floods killed 3,
656 people and affected the lives of 230 million, causing 264.2
billion yuan worth of loss nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Ruling Party Changes Rules for Picking Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's ruling party, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), laid out new rules Monday
for choosing its presidential candidate for the year 2000 election,
replacing the 70-year tradition of presidents hand-picking their
successors.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the party's National Political Council (CPN),
307 of the 355 participating members voted in favor of electing
the next PRI presidential candidate through a primary vote that
would allow all registered voters to participate regardless of
party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
The council was due to vote late Monday on a proposal to hold
the primary on November 7.
</P>
<P>
PRI President Jose Antonio Gonzalez said, "Our PRI members will
have in the year 2000 a candidate of booths and democracy."
</P>
<P>
The newly approved election formula for picking the PRI
candidate to the country's presidency was regarded as a milestone
compared with the previous practice of the party, which has
governed Mexico for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
Based upon the non-written rules of Mexico's political system,
Mexican presidents, always members of the PRI, have selected the
next PRI presidential candidate through "dedazo" - Spanish for "
big finger." The party's unstoppable political machine assured
the candidate would win the general election.
</P>
<P>
Mexican presidents are constitutionally limited to one six-year
term.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the PRI's practice has become a target of
criticism within the party as well as from the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Young Spanish People Increasingly Unwilling to Join Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 17 (Xinhua) -- More young Spanish people have
written "No" on forms used to determine their willingness to
participate in military service since NATO started bombing
Yugoslavia on April 24, according to defense ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The number of such "No" forms increased by 40 percent over the
same period last year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They warned that by the end of this year, about 1.5 million
young people could fill out these forms in this way and refuse to
join the army.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry had to extend the deadline for enlistment
registration after it found young people were not willing to join
the army.
</P>
<P>
It had previously planned to draft 6,000 professional soldiers,
but so far less than 10,000 youths registered "Yes" to the
enlistment form, which is reportedly far lower than the required
ratio of 4:1 for drafting.
</P>
<P>
Local media attributed the results to resentment among Spanish
youth to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the casualties it has
caused.

<HEADLINE> China's Nature Reserve Areas Exceed World Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The area of China's nature reserves
has surpassed world average level of 7 percent of the total land,
according to an official of the State Development and Planing
Commission.
</P>
<P>
China now has 926 nature reserves, accounting for 7.64 percent
of its total area, said Hao Jianxiu, vice-minister in charge of
the commission, at a seminar recently held in Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up more than 200 bases for endangered and
rare species, and its 15 nature reserves including Changbai
Mountain have joined the "World Biosphere Network."
</P>
<P>
Hao said that China has achieved remarkable progress in
implementing a sustained development strategy, and that in some
areas of the country formerly deteriorating ecological
environments are now recovering.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development in Rio De Janeiro adopted Agenda 21. Two years later,
the Chinese government published "China's 21st Century Agenda,"
the first governmental program for sustained development in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The '99 Kunming World Horticulture Exposition with the theme "
Man and Nature -- Marching into the 21st Century" represents
China's efforts to promote ecological protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
China began planning nature reserves in the 1950s, and in the
past two decades these plans have entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the State Council published "Regulations on the
Management of Forests and Wild Life Nature Reserves," the first of
its kind for nature reserves in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the following years, China signed a series of international
conventions including the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and the convention on
the protection of biodiversities.
</P>
<P>
China's success in its effort to protect the Jiuzaigou Nature
Reserve has caught the attention of environmentalists around the
world.
</P>
<P>
With aid from the Global Environment Fund, China further
promoted cooperation programs with international communities for
protecting and developing nature reserves. The area of tropical
rain forests in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province has been expanded
from 198,000 hectares in 1988 to 243,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
However, Hao noted, China still faces pressure from a shortage
of natural resources and pollution, the major problems being the
deterioration of water resources, polluted air, the decline of the
functions of ecological forests, damage to biodiversity, and
threats to endangered species.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 17 (Xinhua)-- Brazil registered a surplus
of 10.5 billion U.S. dollars in April in its balance of payments,
said the Central Bank (BC) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Revenues totaled 12.9 billion dollars and expenses amounted to
2.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The surplus followed an unexpectedly large budget surplus of 5.
6 billion dollars registered in the first quarter, more than 50
percent higher than the 3.6 billion dollars pledged to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised to provide Brazil with 41.5 billion dollars to
help it deal with the financial crisis if Brazil could fulfill its
pledge to the IMF. Brazil has received about 19 billion dollars so
far.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is quickly recovering from the economic recession that
was triggered by the drastic devaluation of the 'real,' Brazil's
currency, at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts say Brazil will fight an uphill battle
against unemployment and sluggish exports.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, joblessness in Brazil rose to
8.15 percent in March from 7.51 percent in February.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Safe From Y2K in September 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- While many feel that Indonesia was
rather late in anticipating the "millennium bug" (Y2K), the
government believes that in September 1999 Indonesia will be safe
from this global nuisance.
</P>
<P>
The government along with the relevant institutions will
maintain Indonesia's readiness in facing year 2000, said Jonathan
L. Parapak, vice chairman of the Y2K Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that at the meeting for the Y2K evaluation in August,
they (institutions) would achieve success, so that in September
Indonesia could be declared safe in facing year 2000," he said
after the launching of the Australian Y2K Web Site here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Parapak, the World Bank reported that Indonesia's
readiness to face Y2K has increased from the lowest level to a
secure and safe country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Parapak admitted that it was not until December
1998 that Indonesia set up the Y2K Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The committee faces several obstacles like time, area,
inventory and funding. But we are trying hard to complete the
projects for overcoming the problems which may be caused by the
Y2K," he was quoted by Antara News Agency Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also praised several countries like Australia, the
Netherlands and the United States for their help in handling this
problem through exchange of technology.
</P>
<P>
Y2K will become a problem on January 1, 2000, during which a
lot of software in the world will be confusing and malfunctioning
because it had not been set for programs after December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Many computer application programs have set two-digit dates
such as "00" to "99" for 1900 to 1999, so that in 2000 the
computers will read "00" as the year 1900, thus causing global
confusion.

<HEADLINE> Tunisian Soccer Officials Arrested in Zambia for Match-fixing Attempts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Two Tunisian soccer club officials
were arrested on allegations they tried to bribe match officials
to fix an Africa Cup game, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of African Football cup match was won 1-0 by
Zambia's Nkana team against Tunisia's Club Sportif Sfaxien.
Despite the win, Nkana was ousted from the competition on goal
aggregate after losing to the Tunisian squad 4-0 two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Richard Kantongo said the two Tunisians --
identified as Yaiche Ammed Fakary, the vice-president of Sfaxien,
and Bouset Fadhi, a club committee member, could be charged under
Zambian corruption laws.
</P>
<P>
Match referee Kabelo Molepo of Botswana alleged the two came to
his hotel room with a wad of 500 U.S. dollars as the "first
installment" of a bribe to fix the match.
</P>
<P>
Molepo reported the incident to the police and match
commissioner Leo Mugabe, head of the neighboring Zimbabwe Football
Association.
</P>
<P>
A further 500 U.S. dollars was allegedly promised, along with
other gifts that included T-shirts, according to Molepo's report
to the police.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian club representatives claimed they were seeking
advice how to change U.S. bank notes into the Zambian kwacha
currency, police said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Meteorological
Observatory will lead China in forecasting anion concentration
indexes in the air.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the observatory said anions, negatively charged
ions, most of which are composed of oxygen, have been called the
vitamins of the air, and their concentration determines the
freshness of the air.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the standard
concentration of anions in the air should be no lower than 1,000
to 1,500 units per cubic centimeter.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has a continental climate and anion concentration is
lower than on the coast and in forest areas.
</P>
<P>
These forecasts will guide people to visit spots and exercise
in places with higher anion concentrations, which will be a boon
to their health, said the expert.
</P>
<P>
These forecasts will soon be broadcast on a daily basis via a
special meteorological phone service line by dialing 221 in
Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's per capita vegetable
consumption has reached 253 kilograms a year, well above the world
average of 102 kilograms, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Fang Zhiyuan with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
said that vegetable growing has enjoyed rapid growth since the
initiation of reform and opening up policies in the late 1970s,
contributing to a higher living standard for urbanites and fueling
rural economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At present, China cultivates 11 million hectares of vegetables
with an output of 313 million tons, according to Fang, and growing
vegetables has become one major source of income for Chinese
farmers. The total output value of vegetables grown in China
amounted to 250 billion yuan (30.1 billion US dollars) a year,
second only to that of grains.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural sciences have played a major role in the rapid
growth of vegetable production, and new varieties of vegetables
and methods for fighting against diseases and pests have
contributed about 60 percent to the total vegetable output, Fang
said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Okays Philippine Airlines' Rehab Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Monday in principle an amended
rehabilitation plan for the financially ailing flag carrier,
Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL), Business World reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay as saying the
decision was made following a meeting with members of the Interim
Rehabilitation Receiver set up earlier for PAL.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said creditors, accounting for 55 percent of PAL's 2.2
billion U.S. dollars in debts, backed the PAL rehabilitation
program. These creditors include European credit agencies and
local creditor banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though now ready for implementation, the rehab plan is still
subject to the infusion of new equity of 200 million U.S. dollars
by June 4, Yasay said.
</P>
<P>
"If PAL Chairman Lucio Tan is not able to raise 200 million
U.S. dollars and no other investors come in by the set deadline,
we will have to order PAL's liquidation," Yasay said.
</P>
<P>
Tan has been busy negotiating with prospective investors who
could help him raise the 200--million dollar new equity prescribed
in the rehab program. He has been reported capable of putting up
only half of the needed amount.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation plan calls for a reduction of the airline's
fleet from 54 to 22 planes and sharp cuts in its workforce, which
currently numbers about 8,000.

Earlier on Monday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
suggested ground troops might be sent to Kosovo once the Serb
forces are sufficiently weakened but in the absence of a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Washington and London differ on the ground
troops deployment. President Bill Clinton is reluctant to commit
ground troops but British Prime Minister Tony Blair is eager to
send them in.
</P>
<P>
Cook reiterated NATO was not contemplating a full-scale
invasion of Yugoslavia, but said it was ready to send in ground
forces once the "organized resistance" of the Yugoslav army had
been broken by NATO aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Bacon stressed that NATO was reviewing options for a troop
presence in Kosovo, but also reiterated that the ground troops
should be sent in when there is safe environment.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we don't have the appropriate time right now because
we don't have peace. And we don't have any acceptance by (Yugoslav
President Slobodan) Milosevic of NATO's five conditions," Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman announced that 18 more Air Force A-10
attack planes were headed for Europe to bolster NATO's air
campaign, and that 24 Marine Corps F/A-18s attack jets will go
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen denied a
report that he had received a letter from Pentagon chiefs calling
for ground troops to be sent to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a letter as such, but I have talked to the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. (Henry) Shelton, and he
believes (the air war) is the correct way to go," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. magazine of Newsweek reported Sunday that the U.S.
Joint Chief of Staff had sent Cohen a letter a few weeks ago
suggesting that only ground troops would guarantee fulfillment of
the U.S. political objectives.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Urged to Act on Soeharto's Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian political parties have
urged Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to immediately take
follow-up action on the wealth of former President Soeharto and
his children abroad, according to national newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest weekly issue, U.S. news magazine Time reported
that the Soeharto family amassed a 15 billion U.S. dollar fortune
during his 32 years of rule.
</P>
<P>
It said the Soehartos' fortune includes 9 billion dollars in
cash that was transferred from a bank in Switzerland to another
bank in Austria shortly after the former ruler was forced from
office in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The magazine reported the Soeharto family's 15 billion dollar
wealth comprised cash, shares, corporate assets, real estate,
jewelry and fine arts.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Golkar Party's General Chairman Akbar Tanjung Monday
said in Bali that the Attorney General's Office should respond to
the story seriously.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party Chairman Marzuki Darusman, who is also a leading
human rights campaigner, said inaction would make it very
difficult for the government "to convince the public that this is
a government that should be continuing the job in the future."
</P>
<P>
"The disclosure is quite a bombshell and what the government
should do is invite the magazine to enlighten the government on
its findings. This requires the government to take action as soon
as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to Time's findings, the United Development Party
said it would invite the editor-in-chief of the weekly magazine to
the House of Representatives to give inputs on Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
National Mandate Party leader Amien Rais expressed belief that
Time would provide data "and then it would be even easier later to
secure the return of most of the money for the people of
Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
Faisal Tadjuddin, secretary-general of an anti-corruption
campaign called the Movement of Concerned Citizens Over State
Assets, said the magazine's findings were akin to "a slap on
Ghalib's face," given that he had said Soeharto did not have any
foreign assets.
</P>
<P>
Teten Masduki of the Indonesian Corruption Watch said the
latest revelation had strengthened public perception that the
Attorney General's Office had not been serious and was incapable
of doing its job.
</P>
<P>
The government should start thinking of soliciting foreign
assistance in the matter, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Juan Felix Tampubolon, one of Soeharto's lawyers,
maintained that Soeharto had no assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The report is baseless, and if it is not proven we might file
a lawsuit against Time," Juan was quoted by The Jakarta Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto asserted in a private television interview last year
that he did not have a single cent in foreign banks and he
challenged the government and the general public to trace whatever
wealth he possessed overseas.
</P>
<P>
In February, Ghalib said the initial findings of an
investigation by the Attorney General's Office and the Foreign
Ministry had failed to find any wealth or assets belonging to
Soeharto abroad.

</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 middle school students could eat carefully-
prepared diets at noon every day. And the coming years will see
another 200,000 students who could also benefit, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Ruomu, a well-known nutritionist, said that families
normally would not want to spend too much money in adding
nutritious elements to the diets of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
He suggested students should eat more kelp, which is rich in
iodine, and soybean powder.
</P>
<P>
Besides lunch, the nutritionists have urged young Chinese to
pay great attention to regular meals, especially breakfast.
</P>
<P>
They now believe that eggs and milk are a better and more
suitable food for everyday breakfast.
</P>
<P>
A nutritious breakfast provides sufficient energy and fulfills
parts of people's basic daily calorific needs, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the experts also urged the promotion of milk and
soybean processing industries.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's annual milk production increased from 2,000 tons in
1949 to 226,800 tons in 1997, which led most of the Chinese cities
but greatly lagged behind the international level, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Major Political Parties in Indonesia Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Indonesia's three
leading political parties here early Tuesday signed a joint
communique for cooperation in the general election scheduled for
next month.
</P>
<P>
The communique was signed by the reformist parties --
Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI Perjuangan), the Nation
Awakening Party (PKB) and the National Mandate Party (PAN) -- in
order to form a stronger front by gathering all strength to face
the pro-status-quo front in the general election, said a source
from one of the three parties.
</P>
<P>
"We all can see that ruling Golkar Party's commitment toward
reformation was a fake one. (President) Habibie is part of the old
regime, choosing him would be a pro-old-status decision, so we
must strengthen our front to face them. Through this you can bet
on what PKB, PDI Perjuangan and PAN will do." said Matori Abdul
Djalil, general chairman of the PKB, last Saturday, giving a clear
sign of the three parties' coalition plan.
</P>
<P>
The Paso communique, as it is called, consists of five points
which clearly stated that the coalition is ready to make sure that
the election will be held in a democratic, safe, secure, just, and
non-violent way.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are considered front-runners in the upcoming
elections among 48 political parties contesting the country's
first multi-party election.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said the ruling Golkar Party, which has
ruled the country for about three decades and nominated President
B.J. Habibie as its presidential candidate for the election, will
face fierce challenge from the newly-formed coalition front.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Says Stopping Bombing Prerequisite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here on Monday that prerequisite for Kosovo peace
settlement is stopping the bombing of Yugoslavia by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
After talking with 15 European Union (EU) foreign ministers at
the second meeting of the Russia-EU Cooperation Council, Ivanov
told reporters that the relations between Russia and NATO are
frozen, which is very difficult at the moment "because we have not
talked with NATO to discuss the situation related to Balkan
crisis".
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we have many general positions which we hold in
common with some groupings of internationaL societies, normally
the positions reached in the G-8, where we laid down the create
principles to solve the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would insist on stopping use of force in all this region.
We want to deal with a way of solving the refugee problem. We will
do all we can to create peace in Kosovo and across the Balkan in
general," the Russia's acting foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov did not brief reporters but answered six questions. He
said that he had some disagreement with EU foreign ministers
mainly on the conditions that under which the bombing in
Yugoslavia should stop.

NEW YORK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Monday with blue chips falling while tech-stocks rising in
advance of the Federal Reserve meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 59.85 at

worried that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates
after a report on steep rise in consumer prices in April.
</P>
<P>
Investors were still cautious about the interest rates
although market analysts did not expect the Federal Reserve to
tighten the rates at the forthcoming meeting in Washington.
The worries expanded losses for the index.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq index rose 33.98 at 2,561.84
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 1.69 at 1,339.49.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank: Bankers Trust Takeover to Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The merger of Germany's Deutsche Bank
with U.S. Bankers Trust will be finally completed before the end
of second quarter after it is approved by U.S. authorities, said
Rolf-E. Breuer, Deutsche Bank's chairman.
</P>
<P>
At the annual shareholders' session Monday in Frankfurt, Breuer
said,"We are on schedule with the acquisition of Bankers Trust."
</P>
<P>
The merger, which was reported at the end of last year, has
been approved by the European Commission in Brussels, Bankers
Trust shareholders and the New York State Banking Department, but
it still needs the green light from U.S. Federal Reserve Board,
said Breuer.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank, already Germany's largest commercial bank, will
be among the few leading banking giants in the world after it
acquires Bankers Trust, which is the eighth largest bank in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank has set up an "Integration Steering Committee" to
design its structure after the merger and to fill important
management positions related, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German side hopes to enter the U.S. and the North American
market directly after the takeover. "The long-term strengthening
of our income was, and is, the main motive behind this
acquisition," Breuer said.
</P>
<P>
After the merger, new business goal has been set by Deutsche
Bank, which expects an operating profit of 12 billion marks and a
before-tax equity return of 25 percent, Breuer said at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Barak's Supporters Outpour Joyfulness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Jubilant supporters of Ehud Barak
on Monday night gathered on Tel Aviv's Rabin Sqaure to celebrate
the apparant victory by the One Israel party leader in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
After Prime Minister and Likud Leader Benjamin Netanyahu
conceded defeat in the polls, Barak's supporters waved Israeli
flags, shouted, danced and sang in an sea of joyfulness.
</P>
<P>
Some of the supporters were carrying the portraits of the late
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, the mentor of the man who are poised
to be the next Israeli prime minister, Barak.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, several journalists in the government press
office shouted with joy at the news that Barak beat Netanyahu
by more than 10 percent in exit polls.
</P>
<P>
"I am excited, but I'm also afraid. I'm afraid that's not
true, " said a journalist working for the New York Times
who voted for Barak earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Although the results of the exit polls are unofficial, most
journalists and experts in the press office work-shops believe
Barak has won in the elections due to the huge gap between 58.5
amd 41.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
About half an hour after the results of the exit polls,
Netanyahu admitted his defeat and announced his intention to
quit the leadership of Likud.
</P>
<P>
With his face red and tears in his eyes, Netanyahu tried hard
to keep a calm voice, but two of his supporters hugged each
other and sobbed at the news.
</P>
<P>
In the downtown of Jerusalem, a stronghold for Netanyahu where
a majority of residents are religious and tend to support
right-wing governments, celebrations were hardly seen except
dozens of teenager supporters for the left-wing Meretz.
</P>
<P>
The teenagers chanted slogans and opened champagne on the Ben
Yehuda street, but two ultra-orthodox Jews in black coats and hats
watched them indifferently.
</P>
<P>
When asked about their feelings over Barak's victory, one of
the two Jews answered in fluent English, "I don't understand
English."

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionists Insist on IRA Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant Party, the Ulster Unionist Party, demanded on Monday a
"credible and verifiable start" to IRA decommissioning before Sinn
Fein takes its seats in the executive.
</P>
<P>
The UUP said in a statement that it would not soften a
long-standing demand for Irish Republican Army (IRA) disarmament
before allowing the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein into a
provincial executive.
</P>
<P>
The UUP said last year's landmark "Good Friday" peace agreement
for the province specified that all parties must demonstrate a
commitment to peaceful and democratic methods.
</P>
<P>
"This means that there must be a credible and verifiable start
to a process of decommissioning (disarmament), before Sinn Fein
can participate in government," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This issue goes right to the heart of the agreement and to the
commitments to peace and democracy that government ministers must
abide by," the UUP added.
</P>
<P>
The rigid demand of the UUP seemed dimming hopes in London of
breaking a deadlock in the province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair tried to rejuvenate the peace
process on Saturday by setting June 30 as a deadline for parties
to settle a dispute about IRA guerrilla weaponry and agree to the
formation of a provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Proposals to end the dispute have been accepted by two Roman
Catholic parties, according to political sources in the Northern
Ireland capital Belfast, but the powerful Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP) is wary of them and is seeking clarification.
</P>
<P>
The main Catholic parties, Sinn Fein and the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party, are believed to have broadly backed
the proposals.

<HEADLINE> Uk Committee Condemns NATO Massacre in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17(Xinhua) -- A British Committee on Monday
condemned NATO's decision to intensify its bombing against
Yugoslavia after its massacre of 87 civilians at Korisa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, chaired by Alice Mahon,
a Member of Parliament(MP) from the Labor Party in the House of
Commons, said in a statement that NATO's strategy of intensifying
the bombing on Yugoslavia meant that "further atrocities like
Korisa are inevitable."
</P>
<P>
"One would have hoped that, following the massacre of refugees
by NATO at Korisa, NATO would have reconsidered its strategy. We
were told that bombing was needed to 'protect' refugees," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, NATO's military commanders have announced that the
bombing will be intensified and that further atrocities like
Korisa are inevitable," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The MP said the only way out of the dead end in Kosovo for NATO
was "to accept the proposals of the Chinese and Russian
governments that it stops bombing in order to allow the negotiated
settlement under the auspices of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"(That)has always been the only humanitarian way to solve the
crisis in Kosovo," she said.
</P>
<P>
Another senior MP in the committee, Tony Benn, also pointed out
that public feeling against the bombing is growing very rapidly in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
"NATO aggression cannot be completed without a ground invasion.
But there is no sign that the United States is going to agree to
sending in ground troops. Therefore there is increasingly no
alternative to negotiation to find a political solution," Benn
said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, NATO bombed an alledged "legitimate military
target" in Korisa, a village in Kosovo. In that most deadly attack
on innocent civilians done by NATO, Belgrade officials said at
least 87 ethnic Albanian civilians were killed and 78 wounded.
